Modulation of chemokines, such as RANTES may be part of the virus induced pathogenicity. We examined the effect of core and structural proteins of HCV on RANTES expression in two liver derived cell lines, HepG2 and Chang Liver (CHL).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>HepG2 and Chang Liver (CHL) cell lines were established and selected for constitutive expression of HCV core and structural genes. Flow cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR analysis were performed to examine the effect of HCV core protein on RANTES expression. Luciferase analysis after RANTES-Luc-promoter transfection of established cell lines was assayed by luminometer measurements (RLU) of RANTES promoter activity. IRF-1 and IRF-7 expression was then examined by immunoblotting analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Results of flow cytometry and RT-PCR analysis indicated that RANTES is differentially regulated by HCV core protein in the two cell lines examined as its expression was inhibited in HepG2 cells, by a reduction of RANTES promoter activity.

This suggested that IRF-1 level may mediate the expression of RANTES in cell lines of liver origin. The effect of the core protein on RANTES promoter was countered by co-transfection with NF90, a double-stranded-RNA binding protein that activates some interferon response genes and acts as a component of cell defense against viral infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>HCV core protein have opposite effects on the expression of RANTES in different cell types <italic>in vitro</italic>, possibly reflecting a similar scenario in different microenvironments <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), that is the fifth most common cancer worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], with increasing incidence in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and the leading cause of death amongst cirrhotic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>One of the main features of HCV infection is the high percentage of chronicity which implies the ability of the virus to evade or modulate host cell immune system. Initial inflammatory response to early viral infection is associated to secretion of RANTES, a CC chemokine with chemotactic function which recruits circulating T cells to the inflammation sites. RANTES has been shown to be induced by several viral infections in a number of cell types, including the endothelial cell infection by HCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; in liver cells infected by dengue-2 virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and in influenza A virus infection in monocyte/macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In tumors, a dual role of RANTES has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] since it may promote tumor progression, as in melanomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], or the spreading of tumor cells throughout the body, as in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; but RANTES may also enhance immune response against tumors and associate to improved prognosis as in the case of lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>A possible role for RANTES/CCR5 pathways in the pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection has been suggested from studies on HCV patients. Polymorphism of RANTES promoter was reported to correlate with outcome of HCV associated disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and individuals homozygous for deletion mutation of RANTES receptor (CCR5) showed increased susceptibility to chronic HCV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Lichterfeld and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] reported that T cells from HCV patients had reduced responsiveness to RANTES. In addition, intra-hepatic expression of RANTES and Mig is positively related to the severity of hepatic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and intra-hepatic levels of RANTES mRNA have been reported to increase in chronic HCV patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Modulation of RANTES expression in response to HCV has been somewhat controversial. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies have shown that full length HCV construct induces RANTES and MCP-1 expression in Huh7 and HeLa cells. On the other hand, inhibition of RANTES promoter in Huh7 and HepG2 cell lines has also been reported to be mediated by HCV core protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. More recently interaction of HCV E2 protein and CD81 has been suggested to lead to increased RANTES secretion by CD8 + lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>HCV core protein has been described as a multifunctional protein that in addition to function in viral nucleocapsid formation, influences several cellular function, such as cell growth and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], immune cells functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and its expression in transgenic mice has been associated to development of steatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Induction of chemokines by viral infection determines the local inflammation response and may be part of the virus induced pathogenicity. Modulation of chemokines expression by viruses or viral proteins may contribute to evasion of the innate immune response in early viral infection, affecting the outcome of infection and viral persistence.</p><p>RANTES activation by viral infection has been reported to be regulated by synergistic activity between interferon response factors, IRF-3, IRF-7 and NF-kB in various cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and by IRF-1, which can bind to RANTES promoter in mouse macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Moreover, HCV genome has been reported to modulate IRF-1 and IRF-7 in replicon system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>NF90 belongs to a family of double-stranded-RNA binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], which has been reported to regulate replication of the Pestivirus BVDV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] (phylogenetically related to the Flavivirus family to which HCV belongs) and when introduced into osteosarcoma cell line it induces resistance to HIV replication in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] acting as a component of cell defense against viral infection by activation of some IFN-response genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>We examined the effect of HCV core and structural proteins on the expression of RANTES in human hepatoma and in a liver derived cell lines (HepG2 and Chang Liver) expressing different constructs of HCV genome. The expression of IRF-1 and IRF-7 has been examined to reveal their possible role in RANTES modulation by the core protein. In addition, we investigated the role of NF90 transfection on the expression of RANTES in order to reveal its possible immunomodulatory function and its potential to counteract HCV core protein effect on RANTES.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Stable transfectants and expression constructs</title><p>Stable transfectants in HepG2 cell lines expressing core and HCV structural proteins have been described by Harada et al., 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Stable transfectants of Chang Liver (CHL) cell lines expressing HCV core (CH39) or core-E1-E2-NS2-NS3 (CH352) were established by stable transfection of Chang Liver cells with pCAG39neo, pCAG352neo expression vectors respectively, that expressed HCV structural and non-structural proteins under the control of mammalian CAG promoter. Clonal selection of liver cell transfectants was performed in the presence of 1 mg/ml of G418 antibiotic. Expression levels of HCV proteins were monitored by Western blotting. Positive clones were cultured and maintained under G418 selection; however experiments were performed in G418-free medium to avoid the possible influence of the antibiotic on functions under study as well as to maintain homologous conditions with the parental and control cell lines. Experimental control cell lines, Hepswx and CHwt were transfected with the empty vectors, pcEF321swxneo, described elsewhere by Harada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and pcCAGswxneo. This latter plasmid obtained by inserting the CAG promoter cassette in pEF321neo vector linearized by Asp718 digestion; is a derivative of pCAGGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], containing the unique Swa I cloning site.</p><p>The pCI-NF90 construct (courtesy of Prof. Kumar A, George Washington University) containing the NF90 sequence under the control of CMV promoter has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

Briefly, sub-confluent cultures were detached with trypsin-EDTA solution and washed in PBS. After fixation for 20 minutes at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde and washing with permeabilization solution (Perm/Wash Buffer, Becton Dickinson), 10<sup>6 </sup>cells were suspended in 0.5 &#x003bc;g of mouse anti-human RANTES phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibody in Perm/Wash Buffer and were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. After washing in Perm/Wash Buffer cells were analysed by FACScalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software. A minimum of 10,000 events were analysed for each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis</title><p>To detect RANTES mRNA, total RNA was extracted from cultured cell lines by RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. 500 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexanucleotides and 10 U of transcriptor&#x02122; reverse transcriptase (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications and with the addition of recombinant RNAsin ribonuclease inhibitor. The PCR amplification of the reverse transcribed RNA was carried out with 1.5 unit of Taq DNA polimerase (ABI Prism) in 50 &#x003bc;l reaction mixture containing 200 &#x003bc;M of each dNTPs, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 &#x003bc;M of specific primers and 1&#x000d7; reaction buffer. Primers used for RANTES mRNA amplification in HepG2 cell lines were 5'-GCTGTCATCCTCATTGCTAC-3' (sense) and 5'-TCCATCCTAGCTCATCTCCA-3' (antisense), which yield a specific 260 (237) bp product; cycling conditions for HepG2 transfected cell lines were 94&#x000b0;C, 5 minutes, 56&#x000b0;C, 90 seconds and 72&#x000b0;C, 120 seconds, followed by 28 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C, 30 seconds, 56&#x000b0;C for 90 seconds and at 72&#x000b0;C for 120 seconds. Primers used to amplify RANTES from Chang Liver cell lines were: 5'-ACGCCTCGTGTCATCCTCATT-3' (sense) and 5'-ACTCTCCATCCTAGCTCATCTC-3' (antisense), which amplify a (226) bp product. PCR conditions were same as those described for HepG2 except MgCl<sub>2 </sub>concentration reduced to 1.5 mM and primers concentration to 0.1 &#x003bc;M. Cycling conditions were modified as follows: 94&#x000b0;C 4 minutes, 94&#x000b0;C 1 minute, 55&#x000b0;C 1 minute, 72&#x000b0;C 1 minute, for 40 cycles followed by 72&#x000b0;C 8 minutes. &#x003b2;-actin amplification in parallel samples was performed as controls by using following primers: 5'-ATCTGGCACCACACTTCTACA-3' (sense) and 5'-GTTTCGTGGATGCCAACAGGACT-3' (antisense) (550 bp product). Cycling conditions for &#x003b2;-actin were 94&#x000b0;C 4 minutes, 94&#x000b0;C 1 minute, 50&#x000b0;C 1 minute, 72&#x000b0;C 1 minute, followed by elongation at 72&#x000b0;C 8 minutes. In each experiment, possible DNA contamination was determined by a control reaction in which reverse transcriptase was omitted from the reaction mixture. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of RANTES, serial dilution of the cDNA samples was used. Amplified PCR fragments were analysed by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-Time quantitative PCR analysis</title><p>Real-Time quantitative PCR assessment of RANTES gene expression in Hep39 cell lines was performed using the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detector system (Applied Biosystem). 800 nanograms (ng) of total RNA were <italic>in vitro </italic>reverse transcribed as described above for RT-PCR analysis.

To examine the effect of NF90 on RANTES activity 2.5 &#x003bc;g of the pCI-NF90 plasmid DNA was co-transfected with pRANTES-Luc into the liver cell lines. As transfection control, pSV &#x003b2;-galactosidase vector (1.0 &#x003bc;g) was co-transfected into the cells to monitor transfection efficiency. 48 h post-transfection, cell lysate was prepared and luciferase quantifications were performed using commercial reagents (Promega) and measuring in a Lumat LB 9501 Berthold Luminometer. Results are expressed as relative light units (RLU), calculated as the ratio of luciferase to &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities within each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis of IRF-1 and IRF-7</title><p>Total proteins (50 &#x003bc;g) were diluted in 2&#x000d7; sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes.

Results shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> indicated a twofold decrease in fractions of cells expressing RANTES protein for cells transfected with HCV core protein, as indicated by comparing percentage of positive HepG2 cell line controls (93.77% &#x000b1; 0.8%) or the cells transfected with the empty vector (65.63% &#x000b1; 1.1% in Hepswx) with the HCV core protein expressing cells (45% &#x000b1; 2.6% in Hep39). Reduction in RANTES expression was detected also in Hepswx cells as compared to the parental cell line, suggesting a possible contribution of constitutive transfection on RANTES level. However the differences in percentage of cells positive for RANTES expression in Hep39 as compared to Hepswx cell lines was statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 005). However in Hep352 cell line (expressing core-E1-E2-NS3 proteins) percentage of RANTES positive cells (78,5 &#x000b1; 1.5%) was close to that in control cell lines. In contrast, flow cytometry quantitation of RANTES protein in CH39 cell lines showed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) a statistically significant 2.5 fold increase in percentage of cells positive for RANTES expression, as compared with the CHWT control cells (16.6% &#x000b1; 2.9% <italic>vs</italic>. 6.7% &#x000b1; 1.2%, p &#x0003c; 0.05). In CH352 cell lines the fraction of RANTES positive cells (7.5% &#x000b1; 0.7%) was similar to the controls. This latter result and that from Hep352 cells suggest a possible role of HCV structural E1 and E2 proteins or non-structural proteins NS2-NS3 in counteracting the effect of the core protein in RANTES induction. The results described above suggest that the effect of HCV core protein on the expression of RANTES may be regulated differently in liver cells derived from transformed hepatocytes and the non-transformed fibroblast cell lines.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Immunofluorescence and FACS analysis of RANTES expression</bold>.

Using similar quantity of cDNA (500 ng) for each sample from PCR amplification we made serial dilutions of RANTES cDNA to demonstrate that RANTES transcripts levels were decreased in Hep39 cell lines compared to the controls (Hepswx and HepG2) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3(A)</xref> upper panel).

We carried out transient co-transfections with RANTES promoter-luciferase plasmid DNA in HepG2 and Chang Liver cell lines constitutively expressing core and core-E1-E2-NS2-NS3 proteins of HCV. Inhibition of RANTES promoter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) was observed in two different clones of Hep39 cells, with fourfold reduction (in RLU values) detected in Hep39 cells as compared to Hepswx cell lines. Interestingly, in Hep352 cell line a 3,5 fold induction of RANTES promoter was detected in comparison to Hep39 cell line that suggested a counteracting effect of the structural E1-E2 proteins or non-structural proteins NS2-NS3 toward the core protein inhibition on RANTES promoter also in HepG2.

The results in Chang Liver cells showed that NF90 countered the RANTES promoter activation mediated by the core protein, either in CH39 (1.5 times reduction as compared to NF90 controls, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), or in CH352 cells (the NF90-mediated inhibition was about 7 folds, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, right panel).

Recruitment of virus-specific T cells to the liver is a critical step for HCV clearance. Chemokines such as RANTES, play a pivotal role in this process since they mediate lymphocytes migration. In addition, it has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], that RANTES/CCR5 expression is important in regulating relevant pathological events in the course of chronic hepatitis C infection; as well, intrahepatic expression of RANTES is positively related to the severity of hepatic inflammation in chronic hepatitis C. These results highlighted the significant role of this chemokine in HCV-induced liver disease. Consistent with recently reported observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], we found that HCV core protein variously modulated RANTES expression, by inducing its promoter. As discussed in the present study, opposite effects of HCV core protein on RANTES expression correlates with the different origin of the cell lines. HepG2 which is a human hepatoblastoma cell line with biochemical properties similar to hepatocytes, and Chang Liver cells are non-transformed human fibroblasts of liver origin. Immunohistochemical studies <italic>in vivo </italic>have indicated that RANTES and IP-10 chemokines are expressed in hepatocytes and that RANTES secretion increased in chronic hepatitis with a positive correlation to histological index of HCV related liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Similar to other cancers (ovary and colorectal tumors) chemokines, which contribute to lymphocyte recruitment at tumor sites and to immune-mediated attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] have been reported to be secreted by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well. Interestingly, it has been reported that a mammary murine carcinoma cell line expressing low levels of RANTES showed a decreased growth rate <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The reported evidences so far have pointed to a possible dual role of tumor-derived RANTES in tumor growth suggesting that inhibition of chemokine secretion by tumors could be a mechanism to evade immune attack. HepG2 cell line, a human hepatoblastoma cell line with hepatocytes characteristics, has been extensively investigated for the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis; with regard to RANTES secretion HepG2 cell line behaves as tumor cells, whereas Chang Liver cells, a fibroblast-like cell line that is immortalized but without tumor phenotype, behave as non tumor cells with regard to the RANTES expression. The regulation of RANTES promoter by HCV proteins in these two liver cell types most likely reflects the available levels of the required transcription factors in these cell lines. The difference in the effects of HCV proteins on RANTES promoter is not due to their cellular localization, since the core protein is expressed in the cytoplasm of both HepG2 and the Chang Liver cells (data not shown). Since both the Hep39 and CH39 cell lines we utilized in the present study express full length (p21) HCV core protein, our data exclude the possibility that a truncated form of HCV core protein, which could migrate to the nucleus and affect NFk-B pathway (known to regulate expression of RANTES), could have influenced the results.</p><p>The effects of HCV envelope proteins on RANTES secretion are multifaceted. Recently, Soo et al. demonstrated that the intracellular co-expression of structural proteins E1-E2 suppress the HCV core-mediated activation of RANTES promoter reporter constructs in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast, extracellular binding of HCV E2 to CD81 has been shown to increase RANTES secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We found, that co-expression of the core protein with E1-E2 and non-structural NS2-NS3 proteins of HCV counteracts the effect of HCV core expressed alone with respect to RANTES expression in both cellular systems. Thus, in line with Soo and colleagues, our results suggest that E1-E2 proteins counteract the effect of HCV core protein on RANTES expression, possibly by direct interaction of E1-E2 with the core protein in the cytoplasm. However, the role of the non-strucutral proteins NS2 and NS3 remains to be clarified in this context.</p><p>Expression of RANTES promoter has been reported to be regulated by IRF-3 and -7 cooperatively with NF-kB in U937 and in human kidney 293 cell lines as well as, in mouse macrophages, by IRF-1 which can bind to RANTES promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The HCV core protein expression in Huh7 and HeLa cell lines is able to induce IRF-1 mRNA but it does not influence IRF-3 expression and phosphorylation [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], personal unpublished observations]. Consistent with the data from Miller and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] we found that HCV core protein induces expression of IRF-1 in human hepatoblastoma cell lines (HepG2), but not in human fibroblast of liver origin (CHL, where IRF-1 is slightly expressed in parental cells). We suggest that the available level and different basal expression of IRF-1 between HepG2 and CHL cell lines could explain, at least in part, the opposite effect of HCV core protein on RANTES induction in the two cell lines examined.</p><p>NF90ctv is a nuclear transcription factor belonging to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], which is involved in the life cycle of bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and can activate interferon response genes and inhibit HIV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, results obtained from present study indicated that NF90 protein has the ability to counter the effect of HCV core protein mediated RANTES expression in both cell types examined, suggesting its ability to counter virus mediated effect on host cell antiviral response. The mechanisms underlying its role are under investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>HCV core protein have opposite effects on the expression of RANTES in different cell types <italic>in vitro</italic>, possibly reflecting a similar scenario in different microenvironments <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Based on the data presented here we speculate that cell type specific factors play a fundamental role in RANTES expression.
