However, the underlying molecular/neuronal mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we reported that the expression of NR2B, a subunit of NMDA receptors, in cerebellar granule cells specifically enhanced the effect of voluntary motor training on motor learning in the mouse. Moreover, this effect was characterized as motor learning-specific and developmental stage-dependent, because neither emotional/spatial memory was affected nor was the enhanced motor learning observed when the motor training was conducted starting at the age of 3 months old in these transgenic mice. These results indicate that changes in the expression of gene(s) that are involved in regulating synaptic plasticity in cerebellar granule cells may constitute a molecular basis for the cerebellum to be involved in the GEI by facilitating motor skill learning.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motor learning, a process by which an animal learns to perform a motor skill more accurately and efficiently through practice, plays an essential role in human life.

Indeed, the effects of environmental intervention on motor learning are readily measurable under certain circumstances. For example, restriction of early-life environments such as in intrauterine or at early postnatal stages may result in overall brain function decline including motor learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Barnes1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, while access to a particular motor training paradigm leads to selectively better performance in the task that used in this program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Kleim1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Rogers1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Which factor, genetic or environmental, is relatively more important for motor learning is a longstanding debate regarding the influence of nature vs. nurture in human behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Wallen1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Evidence from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies suggests that in most cases gene/environment interaction (GEI) plays an essential role in constraining various human behaviors including cognition, personality, social activity, and personal interests such as sport participation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Bouchard1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Perusse1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Most interestingly, several lines of evidence clearly show the role of GEI in the development of motor learning. For example, in a human rotary pursuit task, a task that is relatively unaffected by cognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Fleishman1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, the performance is driven by an integrative influence from both heritability and practice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Fox1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken together, these studies suggest that GEI represents an integrative driving-force to constrain the development of motor skills.</p><p>However, the molecular basis that underlies the effect of GEI on motor learning is still far from clear.

Therefore, it is of significant interest to determine whether recombinant NMDAR changes cerebellar-learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of inducible cerebellar granule cell-specific NR2B transgenic mice</title><p>The most unique feature for NMDAR in the cerebellum is that the expression of NR2 subunits is fundamentally different in different cell types across different developmental stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

This development-dependent switching provides an ideal model to study how gene expression affects cerebellar function. Accordingly, we generated inducible cerebellar granule cell-specific NR2B transgenic mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, two single transgenic mouse strains were generated. A granule cell-specific promoter, GABA-&#x003b1;6 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Bahn1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, was used to drive tTA . In order to confirm the specificity and efficacy of this promoter, we first generated <italic>GABA-&#x003b1;6-</italic>tau-LacZ reporter mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1B and C</xref>, Lac-Z staining revealed that blue stain was only observed in the cerebellar cortex and was restricted to granule cells including soma (granular layer), dendrites, and parallel fibers throughout the molecular layer in transgenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1B and C</xref>), but not wild-type mice (data not shown). Then <italic>GABA-&#x003b1;6-tTA/tetO-NR2B double transgenic</italic> (simply tg hereafter) mice were produced and these mice showed normal growth, eating behavior, body weight, and breeding behaviors (data not shown). <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization revealed that the expression of NR2B transgene was exclusively observed in the cerebellar cortex of tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), but not of their littermate control (thereafter control) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Western blot confirmed the expression of NR2B protein in the cerebella of tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Unlike AMPA receptor, trafficking of NMDAR, especially for NR2B subunits, does not essentially or necessarily require other partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-PerezOtano1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it was expected that the expression of tg NR2B protein was able to move to the synapses. However, it was recently reported that in the cultured hippocampal neurons, the increased NR2B expression did not increase the synaptic NR2B-containing NMDAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Thomas1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. To address whether there is a difference between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> systems, we used electron microscopy (EM) immunocytochemistry to confirm NR2B synaptic expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1G&#x02013;I</xref>, axo-spinous and axo-dendritic synapses throughout all groups were morphologically intact. Immuno-gold particles, which represent NR2B immunoreactivity, were found in mossy fiber/granule cell synapses of tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1H and I</xref>), but not control cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). In these labelled synapses, gold particles were closely associated with the &#x0201c;active zone&#x0201d; (PSD and synaptic cleft) of synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1 H</xref>). In addition, some immunogold-labelled synapses expressed NR2B throughout the active zone and neuropil of the spine head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1I</xref>).

At the gross level, we examined cerebellum size, weight, and structural organization and there was no observable difference between control and tg mice (data not shown). At the microscopic level, we examined whether there was any obviously morphological changes in tg mice with Nissl straining (cresyl violet). The results showed no observable difference, either in general morphology or granule cell number in granule cell layer between control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) mice.

It might be possible that the enhanced NMDAR function in granule cells may affect survival or morphology of Purkinje cells. Accordingly, at the immunohistological level, we performed Purkinje cell-specific immunostaining with DK-28 (Sigma).

We then examined whether a specific motor training would specifically enhance motor learning. As both task-specificity and slow-development are most essential features for the development of motor learning, an ideal motor training paradigm should be long-term and voluntary, and display measurable effect with a task. Mice voluntarily run in a wheel (wheeling) and the motor mechanism for wheeling is similar to the rotorod task. Accordingly, we designed a specific VMT paradigm. Both control and tg mice were subjected to VMT for 60 days from weaning (P20) up to P80. In order to avoid mouse plug during VMT, only male mice were used. We first examined the effect of the transgene and VMT on wheeling behaviors by using a homecage activity-scanning system for one week. This system offers an automatically digitized-24-hr real-time analysis of wheeling behaviors including running times or bouts (times a mouse gets up to the wheel to run at least for 2.5 cycles), running time (duration) in each bout, total running distance (in cycles), and average/maximal running speed (in cycles per minute) on a single mouse/single cage basis.

Based on the Marr-Albus motor learning model, input from mossy fibers encodes learning information in terms of contexts and stimulation while input from climbing fibers provides either positively or negatively instructive signals to modify the efficacy of the input from parallel fibers to Purkinje cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Mauk1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Ekerot1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, a functional change in granule cells may directly affect the information integration within the cerebellar computational network and subsequently affect motor learning. Although robust evidence is available from various lesion studies showing that lesion to granule cells impaired motor learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Llinas1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Ekerot1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Baizer1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, our study has for the first time demonstrated that change in NMDAR function in granule cells constitutes a molecular basis for the involvement of the cerebellum in GEI in facilitating the development of better motor skill learning.</p><p>Secondly, at the system level, we found that the environmental factors may play a dominant role in the development of motor skills. Based on the different channel properties such as NR1/NR2B receptors having a longer decay time in comparison to NR1/NR2C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-CullCandy1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Tang1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> together with many others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Barria1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-BenMamou1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> have established that overexpression or up-regulation of NR2B in the forebrain of animals specifically facilitates synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory. However, in the present study, the expression of NR2B transgene only did not produce any observable changes in motor learning, indicating a fundamental difference in the process to encode cerebellar memory vs. to encode hippocampal memory in the brain. For hippocampal memory, an existing mechanism that is favourable for memory formation such as an enhanced NMDAR function is critical and once the memory trace is consolidated, this mechanism is no longer required for the retrieval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the acquisition and consolidation processes are distinctive. The consolidating process may be not necessarily nor essentially dependent on times or duration of a memorable episode presented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Nader1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. For motor learning, however, a long-duration of neuronal activity-triggered by motor activity or motor training is required <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Llinas1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The acquisition and consolidation processes essentially overlap and the memory trace is established based on a use-dependent manner that is correlatively related to the duration or times of motor training <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Krakauer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, motor activities/training, or environmental factors, have a higher impact in the development of motor skill learning.</p><p>Thirdly, from the synaptic plasticity angel, we demonstrated that the recombinant NMDAR in cerebellar granule cells facilitates the development of this use-dependent plasticity in our transgenic mice. We first established that the expression of NR2B has an effect on long-term VMT, which was evidenced by increased running duration/distance without change in running bouts in wheeling after VMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The increases in running duration/distance indicate that wheeling skill may be enhanced, as running duration/distance gradually increases following wheeling (data not shown). If this enhanced &#x0201c;wheeling skill&#x0201d; is associated with some kind of use-dependent plasticity, the expression of NR2B facilitates the development of this kind of plasticity. Indeed, we demonstrated that the long-term VMT could enhance motor skill learning in a similar motor learning paradigm, rotorod. This task provides a quantitative analysis of motor learning, in contrast to wheeling. The enhanced motor learning in B6/CBA F1 mice after long-term VMT presents direct evidence showing that long-term VMT is able to trigger the &#x0201c;use-dependent plasticity&#x0201d;. Most importantly, we have demonstrated that during the development of this use-dependent plasticity, the expression of the NR2B transgene significantly facilitates the effect of motor training, which established the first GEI model in motor learning.</p><p>How the recombinant NMDAR facilitates this use-dependent plasticity in the cerebellum is not clear from the current study. Since the long-term modification of neurotransmission efficacy at synapses either potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD) is considered as a cellular basis for learning behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Massey1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, it might be possible that the expression of the NR2B transgene or/and motor training together change these &#x0201c;synaptic behaviors&#x0201d;. Especially, parallel fiber LTD in the cerebellum may be particularly important <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Ito1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, because this type of synaptic plasticity is typically associative, since neither stimulating parallel fiber alone nor climbing fiber alone can produce the depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Hansel1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, and activity-dependent, as it is induced by repetitive conjunctive stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Ito2">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, there is robust evidence showing that parallel fiber LTD is associated with motor learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Boyden1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Aiba1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Hansel2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. However, at the same time, controversial findings were also reported. For example, it has been found that mice with diminished parallel fiber LTD, either by genetic deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Boyden1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> or pharmacological blockage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Welsh1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref> have normal motor learning, suggesting that a particular plasticity mechanism may not support all cerebellar learning or/and that motor learning is controlled by multiple plasticity mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Boyden2">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Jorntell1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, there are at least four forms of LTD and three forms of LTP in the cerebellum. The significance and interaction among them are complicated. Therefore, this study did not ambitiously explore the potential implication of these synaptic mechanisms in this specific GEI, as weak-point in this study.</p><p>Finally, at the system level again, we demonstrated that this GEI is both developmental stage-dependent and task-specific. The effect was observed only when the motor training was conducted at the stage that is critical for some specific motor skill development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Brutsaert1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Since from that time on, the transgene has already been fully expressed, this developmental stage-dependent feature highlights a development-related role of the recombinant NMDAR with NR2B in replace of NR2C in the development of motor skill learning. Very interestingly, a recent study in adult neurogenesis revealed a critical developmental stage existence, during which synaptic plasticity is enhanced because of the higher NR2B expression level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Ge1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the recombinant NMDAR with NR2B may underlie this developmental stage-dependent effect. This developmental stage-dependent effect is also well observed in human studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Perusse1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Butefisch1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. At the same time, it has been well-established that the development of motor skills is task-dependent, that is a specific training in a task is required for the development of a specific motor skill <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Kleim1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Rogers1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Bloedel1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. It is daily experience that training in a water pool, for example, improves one's swimming skill but not essentially change one's skill in bicycling. Our studies also reproduced this specificity in the animals. However, it should be noted that evidence is available that the cerebellum is also involved in spatial navigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-RondiReig1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, however, we found that neither NR2B expression in the cerebellum nor GEI with wheeling changed the navigation behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This discrepancy suggests that as a motor-controlling organ, the cerebellum is required for normal navigation so that the lesion to the cerebellum may lead to deficits in spatial learning. However, the changes in the cerebellum that are able to enhance, but not impair, motor learning may not sufficient enough to enhance navigation strategy, which is essentially controlled by the medial temporal lobe including the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Eichenbaum1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, and therefore, spatial learning and memory is unaffected in our transgenic mice.</p><p>In conclusion, our results for the first time validated a GEI model in motor learning and further indicated that the expression of gene(s) that are involved in regulating synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar granule cells may constitute a molecular basis for GEI in motor skill learning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of cerebellar granule cell-specific NR2B transgenic mice</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001684-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, the tTA/tetO inducible gene manipulation system was used to produce these mice. Two constructs were made. GABA-&#x003b1;6-tTA construct consisted of a 12 kb of GABA-&#x003b1;6 promoter, an IRES element (615 bp, pIRES, Clontech), tTA (1 kb, pTte-Off, Clontech), and SV-40 poly-A signal (0.8 kb, p265). The transgenic cassette was released by Mlu I and Xho I from the backbone. The tetO-tau-Lac-Z construct consisted of tetO mini promoter (0.4 kb, pTRE2, Clontech), an artificial intron (0.3 kb, p265), tau-Lac-Z (5.5 kb, in pSK (&#x0002b;), (which was kindly provided by Dr. John Thomas at the Salk Institute, San Diego), and the SV-40 poly-A. The transgenic cassette was released by Sal I. The tetO-NR2B construct consisted of the tetO mini promoter, the artificial intron, mouse NR2B cDNA, and the SV-40 poly-A. The transgenic cassette was released by Sal I. After being linearized with the enzymes as indicated, the transgene cassettes were respectively injected into pro-nuclei of B6/CBA F1 zygotes as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001684-Hogan1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. The gene copy number in founder mice was determined by Southern blot. In order to have a medium expression level of the transgene, founders with transgene copy number at about 3&#x02013;5 were used to breed double transgenic mice. As both zygote donors and mice used for founder segregation (or single transgenic mouse production) were all B6/CBA F1 mice, the overall genetic background for all the littermates were the same. The genotypes after the F1 generation were determined by PCR analysis of tail DNA with primers respectively for tTA transgene and NR2B (SV-40) transgene.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Molecular characterization of tg mice</title><p>We used <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with a <sup>35</sup>S-labeled oligo probe that could recognize the NR2B transgene only to detect the expression pattern.

Ultra-thin sections were cut and mounted on nickel grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences).

Mice were given three trials every day and each trial was ended by either falling down from the rod or staying on it over 100 seconds. Any mice that were able to stay on the running rod for 100 seconds in three consecutive trials were considered that these mice had learned the task (learned criterion).

An interval of 2 hours was set between each two trials in each animal. For each training session, the starting quadrant and sequence of the four quadrants from where mouse was released into the water tank was randomly chosen so that it was different among different sessions in each animal and was different between different animals. The navigation of mice was recoded by a video-camera and the task performances including swimming paths, speed, and time spent in each quadrant were recorded by using an EthoVision video tracking system (Noldus).
