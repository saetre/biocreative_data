The study of how sleep regulatory networks are conserved is needed to better understand sleep across evolution. We present a detailed description of a sleep state in adult zebrafish characterized by reversible periods of immobility, increased arousal threshold, and place preference. Rest deprivation using gentle electrical stimulation is followed by a sleep rebound, indicating homeostatic regulation. In contrast to mammals and similarly to birds, light suppresses sleep in zebrafish, with no evidence for a sleep rebound. We also identify a null mutation in the sole receptor for the wake-promoting neuropeptide hypocretin (orexin) in zebrafish. Fish lacking this receptor demonstrate short and fragmented sleep in the dark, in striking contrast to the excessive sleepiness and cataplexy of narcolepsy in mammals. Consistent with this observation, we find that the hypocretin receptor does not colocalize with known major wake-promoting monoaminergic and cholinergic cell groups in the zebrafish. Instead, it colocalizes with large populations of GABAergic neurons, including a subpopulation of Adra2a-positive GABAergic cells in the anterior hypothalamic area, neurons that could assume a sleep modulatory role. Our study validates the use of zebrafish for the study of sleep and indicates molecular diversity in sleep regulatory networks across vertebrates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Sleep disorders are common and poorly understood. Further, how and why the brain generates sleep is the object of intense speculations. In this study, we demonstrate that a bony fish used for genetic studies sleeps and that a molecule, hypocretin, involved in causing narcolepsy, is conserved. In humans, narcolepsy is a sleep disorder associated with sleepiness, abnormal dreaming, and paralysis and insomnia. We generated a mutant fish in which the hypocretin system was disrupted. Intriguingly, this fish sleep mutant does not display sleepiness or paralysis but has a 30&#x00025; reduction of its sleep time at night and a 60&#x00025; decrease in sleep bout length compared with non-mutant fish. We also studied the relationships between the hypocretin system and other sleep regulatory brain systems in zebrafish and found differences in expression patterns in the brain that may explain the differences in behavior. Our study illustrates how a sleep regulatory system may have evolved across vertebrate phylogeny. Zebrafish, a powerful genetic model that has the advantage of transparency to study neuronal networks in vivo, can be used to study sleep.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Zebrafish sleep, and have the receptor for the wake-inducing molecule hypocretin.

SE is defined as the percent of non-response to stimulation when inactive/total number of trials when inactive. SP is defined as the percent of response when active/total number of trials when active. These analyses considered the percentage of responses to differing voltages (0.13, 0.38, 0.5, 1 and 2 V) as well as the consecutive number of seconds (0&#x02013;30 s) of inactivity (&#x0003c;6 pixels/s) preceding the stimulus. These SE/SP pairs are plotted on ROC and qualitative ROC planes. Diagnostic lines are drawn on the qualitative ROC plane, and the ideal test point is plotted. This analysis indicated that the best SE/SP ratio (point closest to ideal test point and closest to the diagnostic line) was obtained when using 0.38 V and 6 s of prior inactivity. As expected, SE increased with increasingly longer periods of inactivity, as the longer the prior period of inactivity was, the likelier true sleep (without reactivity to electrical stimulation) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050277-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). In contrast, SP decreased with increasingly longer periods of inactivity, as more and more short periods of true sleep were missed and considered &#x0201c;active.&#x0201d; This analysis provided a working definition of zebrafish sleep: an interval of inactivity (&#x0003c;6 pixels/s) lasting at least 6 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050277-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050277-g001">1</xref>F). All other periods were defined as active (awake).

Further, the lack of rebound after sleep deprivation by light in our experiment contrasts with the observation of homeostatic regulation after a much lower level of sleep deprivation using electrical stimulation. Overall, whereas it is likely that homeostatic regulation of rest can be demonstrated in some circumstances (in our case, electrical stimulation when sleeping in the dark), we found that wake induced by light in zebrafish was not, on a short-term basis, associated with a mounting sleep debt.</p><p>How could this unusual effect of light be explained? Unlike in mammals, but as reported in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> most zebrafish cells are directly photoreceptive &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;.

The combined effect of light on various cell populations, together with its suppressive effects on melatonin production, may result in multiple redundant wake-promoting inputs into the brain. In favor of this hypothesis, variable effects of light have been observed in other teleosts, where it acts to suppress rest and induce rest rebound in the perch and goldfish &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, both diurnal fish, whereas it has calming effects in nocturnal fish such as the tench &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. In this context, the strong effects of light or melatonin may be able to overcome the more minor regulatory effects of other neural networks regulating sleep homeostasis in zebrafish.</p><p>Recent results in other species, most notably in diurnal birds, indicate that some vertebrates have sleep regulatory characteristics similar to those of zebrafish. Birds are especially interesting as, unlike fish, it is possible to document all the electroencephalographic characteristics of mammalian sleep &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

It may thus be that the need for homeostatic regulation of sleep has not strongly evolved in zebrafish, and that it is not as universal in vertebrates as previously believed. Rather, in both diurnal birds and fish, the direct effect of light or melatonin may be able to bypass homeostatic regulation of sleep. Further studies of sleep deprivation by light versus other methods in these species may reveal molecular mechanisms regulating sleep homeostasis.</p><p>Our studies have also shown significant and informative divergence in the organization of the hypocretin system in zebrafish. We have described a small group of approximately 20 hypocretin cells in the preoptic hypothalamus of embryonic zebrafish and characterized a compact promoter driving expression in these cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;.

This result, surprising when considering the frequency of gene duplications in this species, was confirmed through <italic>in silico</italic> searches, BAC library screening, genomic Southern blot analysis, and comparisons of syntenies around HCRTR1 and HCRTR2 in mice, humans, and zebrafish.

Indeed, the high density of hypocretin receptor mRNA in the telencephalon, hypothalamus, posterior tuberculum, and hindbrain, but not lateral thalamic and pallidal areas, is reminiscent of overall mammalian HCRTR1 and HCRTR2 distribution and density (in cortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain, central midline thalamic areas, and hypothalamus) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, although neuroanatomical correspondence of overall structure across these species is only partially established &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.

One explanation for this discrepancy is likely to be the strong and direct effect of light in inhibiting sleep in zebrafish during the day, as described above. Indeed, the phenotype of <italic>hcrtr<sup>168</sup></italic> is not apparent under constant light (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050277-t001">Table 1</xref>). The direct effect of light in this species may thus have made it unnecessary to evolve a method to consolidate wake, and indeed there was great variability in daytime wake bout length among fish of all genotypes in the absence of light (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050277-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The lack of wake abnormality in <italic>hcrtr<sup>168</sup></italic> mutants during the day or the night is also surprising considering recent results indicating increased activity and decreased sleep in zebrafish larvae after heat shock stimulation of hypocretin expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. To address this issue and to test for the specificity of the effects of high doses of hypocretin (as generated in heat shock overexpressing models), we studied the effects of icv injections of mammalian and zebrafish hypocretin-1 at various doses on sleep and locomotion in wild-type zebrafish adults. Mammalian hypocretin-1 is conserved in the functionally important final six C-terminal amino acids of hypocretin-1 and &#x02212;2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d; needed for binding activity, and thus must be active, as reported for <italic>Xenopus</italic> hypocretin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d; and in goldfish experiments. Prober et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d; found that heat shock activation of hypocretin expression increased locomotion and wake for several days in larvae, although without altering diurnal fluctuations in activity. In our icv injection experiments, we found that zebrafish or mammalian hypocretin-1, but not zebrafish hypocretin-2, reduces activity and promotes sleep in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050277-g010">Figure 10</xref>A). These effects were abolished in the null <italic>hcrtr<sup>168</sup></italic> mutant, indicating mediation by Hcrtr. The relatively mild reducing effect on locomotion contrasts with the strong locomotor activation and wake-promoting effects of hypocretin-1 reported in mammals. In rats, for example, 8,000 pmol dramatically increases activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; and sustains wake for 5 h, an effect followed by a proportional sleep rebound lasting 10 h &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Overall, although it is difficult to reject the possibility that the increased sleep seen in our experiments after icv hypocretin-1 injection is merely a rebound after a primary wake-promoting effect (an effect that could have been masked by the 10 min of anesthesia and subsequent activation in a novel environment), we believe this hypothesis to be unlikely. Indeed, a very minor increase in locomotion has been reported in goldfish after icv injection of mammalian hypocretin-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b074">74</xref>&#x0005d;, without further follow-up of activity monitoring longer than 1 h after administration. In our experiments, it is difficult to conceive that our injected zebrafish would be activated while in or recovering from anesthesia. Further, even in awake rodents placed in a novel environment, icv hypocretin-1 injection increases locomotion. We thus believe that in zebrafish, unlike in mammals, hypocretin is mildly sedative and certainly not strongly stimulant. Other differences from mammalian physiology include the postulated role of hypocretin in integrating metabolic input in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;, as we did not find differences in locomotor activation after fasting. Environmental modulators of hypocretin release (e.g., stress, locomotion, feeding, and fasting), as measured using cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1, have also been shown to have differential effects between mammals, possibly reflecting ecological differences in the need for hypocretin to regulate sleep or wake under specific conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Together with the mutant data, we therefore favor the hypothesis that hypocretin is a more minor sleep regulatory molecule in zebrafish than in mammals, with mostly sleep-promoting effects in the dark. It is also possible that in mammals, hypocretin has a dual effect on promoting sleep at night and wake during the day, thus explaining insomnia and daytime sleepiness in its pathology. In this case, only sleep-promoting projections of hypocretin would be common to zebrafish and mammals.</p><p>The differential expression pattern of the sole hypocretin receptor in zebrafish versus those in mammals may explain the mild <italic>hcrtr<sup>168</sup></italic> insomnia phenotype and the lack of stimulatory effect of hypocretin. We have shown absence of Hcrtr on serotoninergic cells of the raphe nuclei and histaminergic cells. Moreover, unlike in a previous study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, we were unable to find <italic>hcrtr</italic> expression in all diencephalic dopaminergic cells or in the locus coeruleus of 2-dpf embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050277-g003">Figure 3</xref>), a result we extended to adult brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050277-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In mammals, the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, the serotoninergic raphe nuclei, and the adrenergic locus coeruleus are among the densest regions containing hypocretin receptor mRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our data offer intriguing parallels with and surprising divergences from mammalian sleep physiology. Not only did we find that light has a profound effect on sleep, but it abolished the need for short-term homeostatic rebound. Further, in this species, hypocretin is a milder sleep modulator, possibly primarily consolidating sleep rather than wake. This is likely explained by the lack of hypocretin stimulation of monoaminergic and cholinergic systems and a proportionally stronger input on sleep-promoting systems of the hypothalamus and basal forebrain. The need for hypocretin innervation of wake-promoting structures may have evolved later, as the importance of the direct effects of light and melatonin on brain activity decreased, and the need to consolidate wake independently of light effects evolved. It is possible that, as for circadian biology, neural networks regulating behaviors (e.g., clock output networks that must vary between nocturnal and diurnal animals) are less well conserved than core genetic actors to be discovered for the regulation of sleep. Further studies in zebrafish, a poikilotherm vertebrate, together with parallel work in birds and monotremes, may help decipher how sleep regulatory network organization evolved prior to the emergence of homeothermy and the REM/non-REM dichotomy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b084">84</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050277-b086">86</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals.</title><p>Young adult (6 mo) wild-type zebrafish (Scientific Hatcheries, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scientifichatcheries.com/">http://www.scientifichatcheries.com/</ext-link>) were used for the sleep characterization.
