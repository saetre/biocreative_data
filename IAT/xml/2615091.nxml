The major components of the lamina are nuclear lamins, intermediate filament proteins encoded by three genes in humans, <italic>LMNA</italic>, <italic>LMNB1</italic>, and <italic>LMNB2</italic>. The <italic>LMNA</italic> gene encodes A-type lamins, whereas the B-type lamins, lamin B1 and lamins B2 and B3, are encoded by the <italic>LMNB1</italic> and <italic>LMNB2</italic> genes, respectively. A-type lamins are developmentally regulated and are expressed in differentiated cells, whereas at least one B-type lamin is expressed in all vertebrate cells (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldman et al., 2002</xref>). The nuclear lamina provides structural support and is involved in anchoring chromatin to the nuclear envelope in DNA replication and repair and in the control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Worman and Courvalin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tang et al., 2008</xref>). It is through these mechanisms that nuclear shape, and thus the nuclear lamina, is associated with the normal aging process as well as with premature aging disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haithcock et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lans and Hoeijmakers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We and others have previously reported that chromatin interactions with the nuclear envelope play important roles in the control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hewitt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zink et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malhas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guelen et al., 2008</xref>). An alternative mechanism by which the nuclear envelope can regulate gene expression is by associating with specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heessen and Fornerod, 2007</xref>), such as AP-1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein, MOK2, and the octamer transcription factor 1 (Oct-1), and modulating their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dreuillet et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lloyd et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Capanni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ivorra et al., 2006</xref>). Oct-1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor known to have both activating and silencing activities. Two lines of evidence suggest a role for the nuclear lamina in associating with and regulating the activity of Oct-1. First, Oct-1 has been shown to be present in an insoluble nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that it may be associated with the nuclear lamina. Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imai et al. (1997)</xref> have shown that the dissociation of Oct-1 from the nuclear periphery is accompanied by the up-regulation of the interstitial collagenase gene and is associated with cellular aging.</p><p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tantin et al. (2005)</xref> have shown that Oct-1 regulates genes that are essential for the cellular response to stress and that Oct-1&#x02013;deficient mouse fibroblasts harbored elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and were more susceptible to oxidative stress. Given the link between aging and ROS (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finkel and Holbrook, 2000</xref>) and that alterations to the nuclear envelope occur during aging, we hypothesized that the nuclear lamina and Oct-1 might have a cooperative role in controlling the expression of genes that are associated with aging and response to oxidative stress. To examine this hypothesis, we first confirmed that lamin B1 is associated with Oct-1 in normal mouse fibroblasts but not in cells lacking normal, full-length lamin B1 (<italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells). We also found that, like Oct-1&#x02013;deficient fibroblasts, <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells have elevated ROS levels and that they are more susceptible to oxidative stress than normal mouse fibroblasts as a result of the same gene expression abnormalities. We demonstrate that the release of Oct-1 in the <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells results in increased occupancy of its binding sites in target genes that are dysregulated in Oct-1&#x02013; and lamin B1&#x02013;deficient cells. Collectively, our results provide evidence that lamin B1 at the nuclear lamina directly sequesters Oct-1 and as a result can regulate the expression of genes involved in various processes, including aging and response to oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Oct-1&#x02013;lamin B1 interactions</title><p>Western blotting detection of Oct-1 confirmed the presence of two isoforms of the protein at comparable levels in wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts and <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells that lack the C-terminal 273 amino acids of lamin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vergnes et al., 2004</xref>). Using a previously described nuclear envelope subfractionation protocol involving differential extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maske et al., 2003</xref>), we found that in WT cells, Oct-1 is detected in all fractions of increasing extraction stringency, including the 4-M urea fraction. However, in <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells, more Oct-1 is released in the earlier fractions, and no Oct-1 is detected in the 4 M urea fraction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This profile of extraction is consistent with tight association with the nuclear lamina because in WT cells, this pool contains &#x0003e;40% of the full-length lamin B1 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maske et al., 2003</xref>). Immunoprecipitating lysates from WT cells with an anti&#x02013;lamin B1 antibody resulted in coimmunoprecipitating Oct-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Oct-1 was not coimmunoprecipitated with lamin B1 in lysates of <italic>Oct1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells despite the successful precipitation of lamin B1. The anti&#x02013;lamin B1 antibody used in immunoprecipitation (IP) was directed toward the C terminus, which is lacking in the <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells, and therefore, the IP samples of these cell lysates contained neither lamin B1 nor Oct-1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This provides evidence of a direct interaction between lamin B1 and Oct-1. This was also confirmed by expressing fluorescently tagged Oct-1 in WT and <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells. Oct-1 is observed at the nuclear periphery in WT cells but not in the <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804155/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804155/DC1</ext-link>). Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) reveals that Oct-1&#x02013;EGFP shows very slow turnover when expressed in WT cells, with only 8% being exchanged within 100 s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The turnover is faster in <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells, in which 43% of Oct-1&#x02013;EGFP is being exchanged within the same time frame. This experiment shows that the stability of Oct-1 association is tighter in the presence of full-length lamin B1 than in the absence of the latter's C terminus.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Oct-1 is tightly associated with lamin B1.</bold> (A) Nuclei from WT and <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells were subjected to sequential extraction and analyzed by Western blotting. Numbers represent percentages of Oct-1 signal in each fraction from one representative experiment.

The left panels show immunoblots of the input sample, and the right panels show immunoblots of the immunoprecipitates. A control staining of the immunoprecipitates with anti&#x02013;goat heavy chain confirms equivalent precipitation efficiency in each sample.

(D) FLIP in WT and <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells expressing Oct-1&#x02013;EGFP. (left) A nuclear peripheral ROI outside the photobleached area was used to measure fluorescence loss after photobleaching (mean values &#x000b1; SD shown; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10). These results indicate that Oct-1&#x02013;EGFP is more tightly associated with the peripheral nuclear lamina containing full-length lamin B1. (right) Quantitative FLIP of a nucleoplasmic ROI shows that there is no significant difference in stability of nucleoplasmic Oct-1&#x02013;EGFP expressed in WT or <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells. (E) Oct-1 is in tight association with lamin B1 but not lamin A/C. FRET was performed as described in Materials and methods. The red boxes (images) and lines (plots) represent the ROI that was selected for acceptor photobleaching using the 543-nm laser, whereas the green boxes and lines represent an ROI selected within the photobleached regions for analysis of FRET. The shaded areas in the plots show the time of bleaching. Note the increase in donor (green) fluorescence after bleaching lamin B1 (top) but not lamin A/C (bottom), indicating that the nuclear lamina component in association with Oct-1 is indeed lamin B1 and not lamin A/C. A representative image is shown (5% FRET efficiency for lamin B1), but mean FRET efficiency values (4.63 &#x000b1; 1.4% SD and 0 &#x000b1; 0.75% SD for lamin B1 and lamin A/C, respectively) from 20 nuclei in three independent experiments show a significant difference using a Student's <italic>t</italic> test (P &#x0003c; 0.01).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1840045f01"></graphic></fig><p>To test whether the FLIP results are caused by a tight association between Oct-1 and lamin B1, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) confocal microscopy using the acceptor photobleach method. In brief, the method involves photobleaching an acceptor fluorophore (e.g., Cy3) and looking for an increase in the fluorescence signal detected for the donor (e.g., EGFP). An increase in the donor fluorescence expressed as the FRET efficiency (see Materials and methods) indicates that the two proteins are indeed within 1&#x02013;10 nm of each other and thus likely interact directly. In this case, the donor was Oct-1&#x02013;EGFP, and the acceptor was lamin B1 or lamin A/C detected with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. The F&#x000f6;rster radius (at which FRET efficiency is half-maximal) is 6.0 nm for the GFP-Cy3 FRET pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wouters and Bastiaens, 1999</xref>). Using this approach, we found that the fluorescence of Oct-1&#x02013;EGFP increases after the bleaching of Cy3 used for lamin B1 detection (FRET efficiency of 4.6%; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 20; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). However, in the negative control, photobleaching of Cy3 used for lamin A/C detection does not result in an increase in Oct-1&#x02013;EGFP fluorescence (P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), confirming the absence of an Oct-1&#x02013;lamin A FRET signal.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased available nucleoplasmic Oct-1 in <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells</title><p>Next, we wanted to investigate whether the Oct-1&#x02013;lamin B1 association and its loss in <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells has any functional consequences. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with a fluorescently labeled Oct-1 consensus oligonucleotide (FAM&#x02013;Oct-1) was performed using equal amounts of nuclear extracts from WT, <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic>, and <italic>Oct1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

Furthermore, the intensity of the band obtained with <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> extracts is more than that with the WT extracts, suggesting that Oct-1, which has lost its association with the nuclear lamina in <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells, is now available for binding to its DNA target sequences.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Oct-1 that is released from the nuclear lamina in <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells is more readily available to bind to its target DNA sequences.</bold> EMSA was performed using a FAM-labeled Oct-1 consensus-binding oligonucleotide.

To establish this, we first wanted to identify Oct-1 targets that are dysregulated in the <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells (i.e., genes that are dependent on both lamin B1 and Oct-1 for their normal expression). We compared the gene expression patterns of <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> with WT cells using six biological replicates of each and six hybridizations performed with dye swaps. We had previously identified 790 dysregulated genes (P &#x0003c; 0.05 using CyberT) in the absence of normal full-length lamin B1 (ArrayExpress accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="E-MEXP-538">E-MEXP-538</ext-link>). CyberT is a web-based implementation of a Bayesian probabilistic framework for the analysis of microarray data designed for the analysis of data with high measurement noise and variability and typically low replicate numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldi and Long, 2001</xref>).

Final confirmation that this is a direct effect of Oct-1 comes from the converse experiment in which Oct-1 is independently overexpressed in WT cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>, gray bars). In this case, the genes normally repressed by Oct-1 (<italic>Gpx3</italic> and <italic>Rdm1</italic>) are down-regulated by Oct-1 overexpression, whereas the gene normally activated by Oct-1 shows increased expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Given that not all of the gene expression changes observed in the absence of full-length lamin B1 could be explained by altered chromatin&#x02013;lamina interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malhas et al., 2007</xref>), we sought additional mechanisms. In particular, it has previously been reported that Oct-1 colocalizes with lamin B and that the dissociation of Oct-1 from the nuclear periphery results in the up-regulation of the collagenase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imai et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, we considered the possibility that some of the gene expression changes observed in the <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells might be a result of the dissociation of Oct-1 from the nuclear lamina in the absence of full-length lamin B1.</p><p>We first showed that Oct-1 associates with lamin B1, that the loss of this interaction leads to elevated Oct-1 levels in the nucleoplasm, and that the released Oct-1 can bind to its consensus target sequences. We then wanted to investigate whether this increased binding can have a functional effect and therefore sought to identify the genes that are dysregulated in the <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells as a result of the altered Oct-1 distribution. To test this, we made use of existing data on gene expression in murine Oct-1 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tantin et al., 2005</xref>). We found that 1,030 genes are either unchanged or moderately dysregulated in the absence of Oct-1 but are significantly dysregulated in the absence of full-length lamin B1, indicating a dependence on lamin B1 but not Oct-1. This group includes most of the small number of genes we identified as dependent on processed lamin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malhas et al., 2007</xref>) but must also include many genes whose lamin B1 dependence cannot be accounted for by either lamin B1&#x02013;chromatin interactions or lamin B1&#x02013;Oct-1 interactions. Efforts are continuing to identify the mechanism by which lack of a stable B-type lamina affects expression of these genes. Only 54 genes are dependent on Oct-1 and not lamin B1 for their normal expression. We surmise that these represent genes with a stringent requirement for low levels of Oct-1 and that in both WT and <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells, the Oct-1 level exceeds this permissive requirement. We identified 57 genes that are dependent on both lamin B1 and Oct-1 for their normal expression. Several of these genes have been found to be involved in the response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tantin et al., 2005</xref>). 15 of these genes are also dysregulated in the <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). If the hypothesis that Oct-1 is released from sequestration in <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells is correct, we would expect Oct-1&#x02013;dependent genes to show expression changes in opposite directions in <italic>Oct1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells. This is true for 13 of the 15 genes involved in oxidative stress responses. At first glance, one might expect the resulting phenotypes to be opposite (i.e., if there is increased vulnerability to oxidative stress in <italic>Oct1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, there would be reduced vulnerability in <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells). However, it is important to note that for six of these genes there is already published evidence that either increased or decreased expression increases vulnerability to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). It is worth noting that the increased Oct-1 occupancy, target gene dysregulation, and the resulting phenotype are caused by Oct-1 release and not its overexpression because the expression of the <italic>Oct1</italic> gene itself is unchanged in the <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells compared with the WTs (both at transcript level and protein level; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><p>Oct-1 is known to have repressive as well as activating effects on gene expression. Oxidative stress response genes that are dysregulated in the <italic>Oct1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells are mostly down-regulated in the <italic>Lmnb1 <sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), suggesting that in the WT cells, Oct-1 is sequestered by lamin B1, and thus the oxidative stress response genes that have octamer sequences are expressed at normal levels. In the <italic>Lmnb1 <sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells, where there are higher levels of nucleoplasmic Oct-1 as a result of the loss of the sequestration by lamin B1, Oct-1 moves away from the periphery, binds to the octamer sequences, and down-regulates the target genes involved in response to oxidative stress, which we detect using EMSA, ChIP, and microarray, respectively. As a result, the <italic>Lmnb1 <sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells harbor high levels of ROS and are more susceptible to oxidative stress. Other examples of genes that are repressed by Oct-1 are the <italic>Gnrhr</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2002</xref>) and the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (Vcam1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">dela Paz et al., 2007</xref>), which are also down-regulated in the <italic>Lmnb1 <sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells (fold ratios of 0.3 and 0.7, respectively).</p><p>The <italic>Gnrhr</italic> gene offers a further interesting insight. An Oct-1&#x02013;binding site has previously been identified and confirmed using an in vitro mobility shift assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2002</xref>), but our ChIP/qRT-PCR analysis failed to detect a change in occupancy at this site in <italic>Lmnb1 <sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells, whereas all other sites tested showed an increase in Oct-1 occupancy. However, this site is very weakly predicted as an Oct-1&#x02013;binding site by the MAPPER algorithm, and much stronger Oct-1 sites are predicted elsewhere in the promoter region of <italic>Gnrhr</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). When we repeated ChIP and qRT-PCR using primers designed to detect these additional predicted Oct-1 sites, we found a significant increase in Oct-1 occupancy in <italic>Lmnb1 <sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells. We conclude that the relatively modest increase in nucleoplasmic Oct-1 protein levels between WT and <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells has enabled us to detect subtle differences in the behavior of different Oct-1&#x02013;binding sites in the same promoter. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> shows site occupancy changes ranging from 1.22 in <italic>Csnb</italic> to 2.85 in <italic>Gpx3</italic>, indicating that different Oct-1 sites respond differently to the same increase in Oct-1 level. Because the elevated binding is observed in the EMSA on short duplexes, they cannot depend on the sequence context and steric effects of transcription factor binding to adjacent sites. Moreover, because these differences are still detected by ChIP, they are not abrogated by transcription factor binding in a wider sequence context in intact nuclei.</p><p>Oct-1 is also known to function as an activator of expression of some targets, such as the U6 small nuclear RNA and osteopontin (<italic>Opn</italic> or <italic>Spp1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Botquin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Remenyi et al., 2002</xref>), which are both up-regulated in the <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells (fold ratios of 1.7 and 10, respectively). Again, this can be explained by the loss of Oct-1 sequestration and an increase in nucleoplasmic Oct-1, which is now available to promote the transcription of such genes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imai et al. (1997)</xref> observed that an up-regulation of the human interstitial collagenase gene accompanied the loss of Oct-1 from the nuclear periphery during cellular aging. We also observe an up-regulation in the mouse interstitial collagenase gene <italic>Mmp13</italic> and an elevated level of Oct-1 occupancy of the Oct-1&#x02013;binding sequence in its promoter region.</p><p>Elevated levels of ROS result in modifications to proteins, lipids, and DNA that are associated with aging (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finkel and Holbrook, 2000</xref>), a process that is also linked to defects in nuclear envelope components. Alterations to the nuclear architecture are observed during the normal aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006</xref>), and an extended lifespan in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has been associated with increased nuclear envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haithcock et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, mutations in genes coding for nuclear structural components such as lamin A are associated with several diseases, including the premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eriksson et al., 2003</xref>). Several of the abnormalities resulting from nuclear structure defects in both an animal model and cells in culture can be reversed by treatment with farnesyltransferase inhibitors that act by normalizing the nuclear architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glynn and Glover, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, there is mounting evidence that nuclear architecture and aging are interrelated and that compromised nuclear architecture might play a central role in the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haithcock et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson, 2005</xref>), although the exact mechanisms have yet to be unraveled. The findings we present in this study advance our understanding of this mechanism by demonstrating that disrupting the interactions between lamin B1 and Oct-1 result in the overall down-regulation of oxidative stress response genes and elevated ROS levels, both of which are hallmarks of the normal aging process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, constructs, and sequential nuclear extraction</title><p>Lamin B1 WT and <italic>Lmnb1<sup>&#x00394;/&#x00394;</sup></italic> cells were obtained from S.
