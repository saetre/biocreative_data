A typical vertebrate immune response depends upon the highly orchestrated migration and motility of various hematopoietic compartments and their subsequent interactions that ultimately control the magnitude of the response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Current techniques used to study the cellular dynamics of such processes include intravital microscopy and tissue explant assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although extremely informative, both methods rely upon invasive surgical procedures and do not represent a true whole animal setting. The zebrafish is emerging as an extremely promising model system to study specific aspects of disease mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Not only is the early zebrafish embryo optically clear, it is also highly amenable to genetic manipulation and small chemical screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These attributes have been exploited to study aspects of immune system development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Zebrafish, like mammals experience two separate waves of hematopoiesis. The first 'primitive wave' generates embryonic erythrocytes as well as early myeloid-derived macrophages and neutrophils from two distinct intraembryonic compartments, the caudally-located intermediate cell mass (ICM) and a rostral blood-forming region derived from cephalic mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Whether these early myeloid cell populations are specifically embryonic or persist to contribute to more adult immune cell populations is unclear. The second, 'definitive' wave, believed to initiate within the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta eventually gives rise to all adult blood lineages, including erythrocytes, macrophages, several types of granulocytes, lymphocytes and thrombocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Zebrafish also possess a B and T cell repertoire as part of a functional adaptive immune system; a <italic>rag</italic>-dependent system that emerged with the evolution of the jawed vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Macrophages represent the main differentiated cell of the monocyte phagocyte system and an essential primary innate barrier to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Their primary function is phagocytosis and they are widely distributed throughout the organism, displaying variations in behavior and morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Despite these variations, most macrophages can be defined by the expression of certain enzymes, such as lysozyme and peroxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition to phagocytosis of infectious materials, macrophages also function during host tissue repair, regulation of inflammatory events (through secretion of cytokines), regulation of immune responses (through antigen presentation to lymphocytes) and are believed to influence certain aspects of neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In zebrafish, embryonic macrophage precursors originate from the rostral blood compartment and derive from lateral plate mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. During early somitogenesis, anterior lateral plate mesoderm converges to the midline and eventually lies just beneath the paraxial mesoderm. From this region, macrophage precursors expressing the early myeloid marker <italic>pu.1 </italic>migrate to initially populate the anterior yolk surface and then more posterior yolk regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The transcription factor <italic>pu.1 </italic>has been demonstrated, by whole mount in situ hybridization, to mark the myeloid lineage up to 30 hours post fertilization (hpf) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Once on the yolk, these primitive macrophages begin to express genes encoding the actin-binding protein L-plastin and lysozyme C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Upon initiation of embryonic circulation, a subset of macrophages enter the circulation and are distributed throughout the embryonic tissues. This is in contrast to neutrophils, where appearance on the yolk is preceded by that within the posterior ICM, as revealed by expression of the <italic>myeloperoxidase </italic>(<italic>mpo</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], suggesting a degree of anatomical separation during embryonic monocytopoiesis and granulopoiesis.</p><p>To generate a macrophage reporter line, and facilitate direct observation of macrophage events in situ in real-time, we have generated novel transgenic lines in which the zebrafish <italic>lysC </italic>promoter was used to drive macrophage expression of EGFP and DsRED2. Lysozyme is a cationic antibacterial enzyme capable of hydrolyzing specific linkages within the bacterial cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In humans, lysozyme is synthesized within both granulocytic and monocytic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Regulatory regions of the mouse <italic>lysozyme M </italic>gene, one of two <italic>lysozyme </italic>genes found in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], have been demonstrated to be sufficient to drive myelomonocytic-specific expression of the EGFP fluorescent reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In zebrafish, <italic>lysC </italic>expression has been reported to specifically mark the macrophage compartment, based upon initial expression within cells on the yolk and co-localised expression with <italic>L-plastin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We used the highly efficient <italic>Tol2 </italic>transposon system to generate germline <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>and <italic>lysC::DsRED2 </italic>transgenic founders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Approximately 6.35 kb of promoter sequence was sufficient to drive reporter expression in a manner that recapitulated the endogenous expression profile of <italic>lysC </italic>and was consistent with the known ontogeny of the macrophage lineage. Inflammation, bacterial infection and phagocytic assays demonstrated that these labeled cells possessed hallmark traits of the macrophage lineage while time-lapse confocal microscopy revealed their highly dynamic morphology, proliferative potential and ability to roll along vascular endothelia. Within transgenic embryos, labeled cells expressed markers of the macrophage lineage, including <italic>L-plastin</italic>. Some fluorescent cells also contained transcripts for myeloperoxidase (<italic>mpo</italic>), raising questions regarding the macrophage-specificity of <italic>lysC </italic>previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], but consistent with the presence of lysozyme within both macrophages and granulocytes of mammals. In summary, we present the <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>and <italic>lysC::DsRED2 </italic>reporter lines as having marked myelomonocytic compartments that will prove useful in defining the determinants of lineage commitment during myelopoiesis and in examining the contribution of innate immune cells during inflammatory events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Strategy to generate a zebrafish <italic>lysozyme C </italic>reporter line</title><p>The <italic>lysC </italic>promoter region was selected for generation of a reporter line, as expression of the <italic>lysC </italic>gene had been described as being specific to the zebrafish macrophage lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. To facilitate comparison with the <italic>lysC </italic>transgenic reporter lines generated in this work, we have included a detailed expression analysis of <italic>lysC </italic>during embryonic/larval development that extends previous studies (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: <italic>lysC </italic>expression during early embryonic/larval development). A zebrafish genomic BAC clone was initially identified in silico as containing sequence of the Ensembl-predicted <italic>lysC </italic>gene. This BAC clone (I.D. zC250A24) was confirmed via amplification and sequence verification as containing the first coding exon of <italic>lysC</italic>. Fragments corresponding to sequence upstream of the initiation codon were cloned from this BAC (for details see Methods section) into EGFP- and DsRED2-encoding pT2KXIG&#x00394;in <italic>Tol2</italic>-containing vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This generated the pT2K/lysC::EGFP and pT2K/lysC::DsRED2 expression vectors. To verify that these constructs could drive expression of the fluorescent reporters to simulate endogenous <italic>lysC</italic>, we injected 1-cell stage zebrafish embryos with 30 pg of either construct (injection of higher doses resulted in toxicity). EGFP and DsRED2 expression was first observed exclusively on the yolk surface with EGFP first detectable around 24 hpf and DsRED2 approximately 4 hours later. This is most likely due to the longer time required for proper folding of the DsRED2 tetrameric protein (data not shown). A subset of these cells entered the circulation and could be seen moving over the yolk ventrally towards the embryonic heart. This expression pattern is consistent with the endogenous expression pattern of <italic>lysC</italic>, as detected by whole mount in situ hybridization as shown here and by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and the ontogeny of early macrophage development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>These constructs were then injected into 1-cell stage embryos along with capped <italic>transposase </italic>transcript to induce transposition and generate germline transgenic founders. Six germline transgenic founders were identified for both the <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>and <italic>lysC::DsRED2 </italic>lines. Both lines displayed correct Mendelian inheritance ratios in subsequent generations and identical reporter expression profiles of comparable intensities (data not shown).</p><p>Next we describe, in detail, reporter expression within stable <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>transgenic animals. It is of note that the <italic>lysC::DsRED2 </italic>line possessed an identical expression profile throughout development (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Co-localized expression of EGFP and DsRED2 within <italic>lysC::EGFP</italic>/<italic>lysC::DsRED2 </italic>compound transgenic larvae), albeit commencing slightly later.</p></sec><sec><title>EGFP expression within <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>transgenic embryos recapitulates the endogenous expression profile of <italic>lysC </italic>that traces the early development of the macrophage lineage</title><p>EGFP expression within the <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>line was first detectable by fluorescence microscopy at 22 hpf. This expression was restricted to a small collection of weakly expressing cells located over the anterior yolk (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This location is consistent with the onset of <italic>lysC </italic>expression described here (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: <italic>lysC </italic>expression during early embryonic/larval development) and by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This location also corresponds with lineage tracing of primitive macrophages using DIC optics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Summed Z stacks using confocal microscopy through individual EGFP-positive cells within 22 hpf transgenic embryos revealed that these early putative macrophages could be divided into three main classes. One comprised cells possessing a rounded morphology with very few, if any, filopodia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A'</xref>; upper inset). The second class possessed a more compacted morphology with ruffled borders (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A'</xref>; middle inset). Cells in the third class were more elongated and possessed long filopodia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A'</xref>; lower inset). These morphologically distinct classes are consistent with previous observations made through DIC imaging of similarly staged live zebrafish embryos and likely represent stages of macrophage differentiation and/or activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This initial domain of putative macrophage development preceded the onset of embryonic circulation. Upon initiation of circulation at approximately 25 hpf, a subset of EGFP-positive cells together with primitive erythrocytes was noted to migrate ventrally through the duct of Cuvier to the embryonic heart. In comparison to erythrocytes, these labeled cells demonstrated an ability to resist blood flow, often pausing for a certain period before resuming movement. This suggests that these cells interact with the overlying epidermis and/or the underling yolk syncytial layer. This ability to interact with these surfaces and undertake environmental sensing has been observed using Nomarski microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The primitive circulatory network then transported these labeled cells to the posterior of the embryo where they began to populate the posterior ICM compartment. By 36 hpf, larger numbers of EGFP-expressing cells were seen over the yolk (with this domain expanded to also include more posterior yolk regions), a subset of which migrated with erythrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Also at 36 hpf, EGFP-positive cells were seen accumulating within the caudal vasculature and surrounding mesenchyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). EGFP expression progressively intensified and by 48 hpf large numbers of strongly expressing cells were observed within the head mesenchyme and over the yolk (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). This developmental stage also marked a massive expansion of the posterior expression domain with large numbers of EGFP-expressing cells clustered together in close vicinity to the caudal vascular plexus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Summed Z stacks through EGFP-labeled cells within this domain demonstrated that they clustered in tight aggregates and in general did not display features of activated macrophages such as dynamic cell morphology and extended filopodia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). Time-lapse confocal microscopy confirmed this region to be an active proliferative domain for this marked cell population (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Movie of dividing EGFP-labeled cell within ICM compartment of 52 hpf <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>larva). Microangiography using red fluorescent microspheres revealed that EGFP-positive cells within the ventral tail region were largely excluded from the caudal vascular plexus and occupied mesenchymal tissue between the vascular endothelia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>). This observation supports a recent study in which this mesenchymal ventral tail domain has been termed the caudal hematopoietic tissue and represents a newly defined region of hematopoietic proliferative activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, a small subset of cells were located within the tail blood vessels, and these cells were observed to navigate the caudal vascular plexus, seemingly to crawl along the endothelial walls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I'</xref>; inset). To image this rolling in greater detail we performed time-lapse confocal microscopy within <italic>lysC::DsRED2</italic>/<italic>fli1::EGFP </italic>double transgenic larvae. DsRED2-expressing cells were clearly seen rolling along the interior endothelial surface of the vasculature (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Movie of labeled cell rolling along vasculature endothelia). From 5 dpf, a new domain of EGFP-expression commenced in the pronephric glomerulus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>), consistent with <italic>lysC </italic>expression (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: <italic>lysC </italic>expression during early embryonic/larval development). The first evidence of hematopoietic activity in the zebrafish kidney, the equivalent of mammalian bone marrow, occurs around 4 dpf where hematopoietic progenitors are closely associated with renal vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Within 6 dpf transgenic larvae, EGFP-positive cells were observed in close association with the pharyngeal skeleton (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>) and clusters of EGFP-expressing cells remained in the ventral trunk/tail region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L</xref>). Microangiography revealed that these cells were still largely excluded from the trunk vasculature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M</xref>). By 7 dpf, EGFP expression within cells marking the glomerulus had significantly expanded (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1N</xref>). When visualized within 7 dpf <italic>I-FABP::RFP </italic>larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], a line where the red fluorescent protein (RFP) is targeted to intestinal epithelia that express intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), EGFP-expressing cells were detected migrating between RFP-labeled gut epithelia within the developing intestinal wall (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1O</xref>). This evidence of early mucosal innate immune surveillance is of particular interest given that the gut exists as an externally accessible tube and is subject to microbial influence from as early as 4 dpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Of note, no ectopic EGFP expression was observed outside of the endogenous expression profile for <italic>lysC</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>EGFP expression within <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>transgenic embryos and larvae</bold>.

Transgenic adults also displayed intense EGFP expression just posterior to the gills, which appeared to be continuous with expression running in a posterior direction just above the intestine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Dissection to expose the kidney revealed this intense fluorescence was emitted by cells located within the head kidney and adjoining posterior kidney (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). To define the cell compartment expressing EGFP within the kidney we performed FACS analysis and sorting of dissected adult <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>kidneys. EGFP-labeled cells were found almost exclusively within the myelomonocytic fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), as defined by forward and side scatter characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Approximately 57.4 &#x000b1; 3.5% (mean &#x000b1; standard error; <italic>n </italic>= 4) of cells within the myelomonocytic (FSC<sup>hi</sup>SSC<sup>hi</sup>) fraction were marked with EGFP and displayed typical myelomonocytic morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Previous FACS and morphological analyses have shown monocyte/macrophage cells to constitute approximately 24% of the myelomonocytic fraction of adult zebrafish kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].

Examination of transverse sections from adult <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>animals following immunohistochemical detection of EGFP revealed that these labeled cells occupied space between the renal tubules of the kidney (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), a well characterized definitive hematopoietic site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

This was in contrast to Gata1-depleted embryos which demonstrated marked expansion of the EGFP-marked compartment (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Labeled cells are restricted to the myeloid lineage) consistent with previous studies in which Gata1-deficient embryos possess an expanded myeloid and diminished erythroid compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>Unlike erythropoiesis, which generates a single mature cell type, myelopoiesis gives rise to monocyte/macrophage cells and several different types of granulocytes.

To confirm that EGFP expression was restricted to cells expressing <italic>lysC</italic>, and indirectly that the lysozyme C promoter fragments used to generate the <italic>lysC </italic>reporter lines contained the necessary enhancer elements to faithfully reproduce endogenous <italic>lysC </italic>expression, we performed immunohistological detection of EGFP and whole mount in situ hybridization detection of <italic>lysC</italic>. These experiments confirmed that throughout the entire embryo, all EGFP-expressing cells analyzed possessed <italic>lysC </italic>transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). A similar result was observed when detecting EGFP and the macrophage marker <italic>L-plastin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], in that all EGFP-labeled cells analyzed also expressed <italic>L-plastin </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). However, some <italic>L-plastin</italic>-expressing cells were observed that were EGFP negative within the tail (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) as well as the trunk and head regions (data not shown) suggesting that not all macrophages express <italic>lysC</italic>. A subset of EGFP-marked cells were also detected containing <italic>fms </italic>transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). In zebrafish, in addition to marking neural crest precursors of xanthophores, expression of <italic>fms </italic>(which encodes the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor) has been demonstrated to co-localize with that of the pan-myeloid marker <italic>pu.1 </italic>within cells considered to be macrophage progenitors on the yolk sac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Expression of <italic>fms </italic>is also observed in more mature macrophage populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Some labeled cells that expressed <italic>mpo </italic>were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>), raising the possibility of neutrophilic identity. Although this is embryonic expression, it is consistent with the FACS analysis previously described where the relative contribution of EGFP-labeled cells within the adult kidney myelomonocytic compartment (57.4 &#x000b1; 3.5%, <italic>n </italic>= 4) exceeded that previously reported for monocytes/macrophages (24%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In mammals the expression patterns of lysozyme and myeloperoxidase are dynamic within the hematopoietic compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In general, the monocyte/macrophage lineage appears to first synthesize lysozyme followed by myeloperoxidase while the reverse is observed in differentiating neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In zebrafish, studies have shown specific expression of <italic>mpo </italic>only within morphologically identified granulocytic neutrophils and not within the macrophage lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] leading to the notion that, in zebrafish, <italic>mpo </italic>may represent a specific marker of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, the initial site of <italic>mpo </italic>expression, in the posterior ICM compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], is distinct from that of the macrophage markers <italic>lysC </italic>and <italic>L-plastin </italic>that first appear over the yolk surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

It seems that within the embryonic myeloid compartment of zebrafish, myeloid-restricted genes are subject to dynamic temporal regulation. The expression profile of the labeled cells within <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>animals described here, in concert with their initial appearance on the yolk surface suggests that populations of macrophages and also some neutrophils are fluorescently marked.</p></sec><sec><title>Labeled cells within transgenic larvae demonstrate a robust response to inflammation and bacterial infection</title><p>Embryonic macrophages fulfill a number of roles including phagocytosing cell corpses and protecting the early embryo from bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Macrophages are also highly mobile, possessing an ability to migrate through tissues to an inflammatory source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. A recent study in zebrafish has shown that an intact microtubule network is a prerequisite for normal macrophage chemotaxis towards a laser-induced injury on the yolk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. To address the ability of the labeled cells to migrate in response to acute inflammation, the tails of 7 dpf <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>larvae were transected and the response of EGFP-expressing cells monitored. As early as 2 hpi (hours post insult), EGFP-labeled cells had accumulated at the injury site and by 6 hpi a significant number of cells had assembled at the trauma region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These migratory kinetics are similar to those demonstrated previously for zebrafish leukocyte populations in response to inflammatory insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Labeled cells within transgenic larvae exhibit robust responses to acute inflammation</bold>.

A small incision within the ventral fin was sufficient to generate a strong infiltration of DsRED2-expressing cells to the wound (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). In general, migrating cells displayed rapid chemotaxis towards the injury after they had exited the caudal vein. Once at the wound, labeled cells continued migrating both around and within the injured tissue. This analysis revealed three predominant migratory phenotypes. Some cells rapidly migrated to the wound, then after navigating within and around the injury migrated back into the vasculature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, also see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Movie of tracked cell demonstrating retrograde chemotaxis). Other labeled cells, following their return to the caudal vein were observed exiting once again to revisit to the wound for a second time and subsequently return to the circulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, also see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Movie of tracked cell that infiltrates the injury site and returns to the vasculature twice). The third phenotype comprised cells that initially migrated towards the wound only to cease movement for a period of time before returning to the vasculature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, also see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>: Movie of tracked cell that fails to infiltrate the wound).

This retrograde chemotaxis to the vasculature has been described as a potential mechanism that contributes to the resolution phase of inflammation. Interestingly, neutrophils were observed to migrate almost immediately towards the wound followed by another cell type described morphologically as macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. This result supports a macrophage identity for the inflammation-responsive cells in our assay where labeled cells were not observed at the wound until at least 30 minutes following wounding.

To demonstrate that these EGFP/DsRED2-expressing cells were capable of phagocytosis we injected red fluorescent microspheres into 4 dpf <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>larvae and monitored the uptake of particles by confocal microscopy. Phagocytosis has been defined as the uptake of particles greater than 0.5 &#x003bc;m in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. To ensure that phagocytosis was the mechanism of uptake, we selected 2 &#x003bc;m-sized microspheres. Injection of these fluorescent particles, typically just posterior to the swim bladder, resulted in rapid mobilization of EGFP-labeled cells to the site of injection. As early as 6 hours post injection, EGFP-labeled cells were observed in close association with individual microspheres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).

MOs were injected essentially as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Effective doses for each morpholino were as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Inflammation assay</title><p>The inflammation assay was conducted essentially as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In brief, 7 dpf <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>larvae were anaesthetized in E3 medium supplemented with tricaine before the posterior portion of the developing caudal fin was transected with a sterile scalpel. Larvae were then left to recover in E3 medium before analysis under fluorescence microscopy using an MZFLIII stereo microscope equipped with a GFP filter set (Leica) during the progression of inflammation. The high resolution inflammation assay was performed by making a small incision in the ventral fin of anaesthetized 6 dpf <italic>lysC::DsRED2</italic>/<italic>fli1::EGFP </italic>compound transgenic larvae using a sterile scalpel followed by mounting in 1% low melting point agarose (Sigma) in E3 medium and time-lapse confocal microscopy using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope equipped with a heated chamber which was kept at 29&#x000b0;C and water-immersion lenses. Z-series were collected at 1 minute intervals and were no greater than 4 &#x003bc;m between each section as to ensure detection of all DsRED2-labeled cells. Projections of summed Z stacks, time-lapse animations and cell tracking were generated using ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Phagocytosis assay</title><p>Red fluorescent microspheres of 2 &#x003bc;m diameter (Molecular Probes) were selected to monitor the phagocytic ability of EGFP-expressing cells within 4 dpf <italic>lysC::EGFP </italic>larvae. Larvae to be injected were anaesthetized in tricaine then mounted in 1% (w/v) low melting point agarose (Sigma) in E3 medium. The microspheres were diluted 3:1 in sterile distilled water then microinjected into the embryonic tissue of 4 dpf transgenic larvae using a FemtoJet pressure injection system (Eppendorf). Injections were typically 0.5 &#x003bc;l in volume and targeted just posterior to the swim bladder within the somitic tissues. The success of injections was confirmed through fluorescence microscopy using an MZFLIII stereo fluorescence microscope equipped with a DsRED filter set (Leica). Phagocytosis of the individual microspheres was detected using a TCS SP2 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica) using GFP and TRITC channels. Projections of summed Z stacks and time-lapse animations were generated using ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial infection assay</title><p>GFP-labeled <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serovar Typhimurium were used to infect zebrafish. To label <italic>Salmonella</italic>, the strain SM022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] was recreated by P22 transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>] of the <italic>rpsM</italic>::<italic>gfp </italic>fusion and linked kanamycin resistance genes from SM022 into the original parental <italic>Salmonella </italic>strain SL1344 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Five dpf <italic>lysC::DsRED2 </italic>larvae (raised in E3 medium supplemented with PTU to inhibit pigmentation, as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]) were immersed in 2.93 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/ml CFU GFP-labeled <italic>Salmonella </italic>strain SL1344. Following a 24 hour infection period surviving larvae were washed several times in PTU-supplemented E3. Uptake of GFP-expressing <italic>Salmonella </italic>was monitored through fluorescence microscopy. Successfully infected transgenic larvae were then anaesthetized, mounted in 1% (w/v) low melting point agarose (Sigma) and imaged using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope equipped with a heated chamber which was kept at 29&#x000b0;C.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CH carried out experimental work and drafted the manuscript.
