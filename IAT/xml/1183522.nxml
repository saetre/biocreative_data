One possible explanation for this behavior is that cats lack the sensory system to taste sugars and therefore are indifferent to them. Drawing on work in mice, demonstrating that alleles of sweet-receptor genes predict low sugar intake, we examined the possibility that genes involved in the initial transduction of sweet perception might account for the indifference to sweet-tasting foods by cats. We characterized the sweet-receptor genes of domestic cats as well as those of other members of the Felidae family of obligate carnivores, tiger and cheetah. Because the mammalian sweet-taste receptor is formed by the dimerization of two proteins (T1R2 and T1R3; gene symbols <italic>Tas1r2</italic> and <italic>Tas1r3</italic>), we identified and sequenced both genes in the cat by screening a feline genomic BAC library and by performing PCR with degenerate primers on cat genomic DNA. Gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR of taste tissue, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. The cat <italic>Tas1r3</italic> gene shows high sequence similarity with functional <italic>Tas1r3</italic> genes of other species. Message from <italic>Tas1r3</italic> was detected by RT-PCR of taste tissue. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that <italic>Tas1r3</italic> is expressed, as expected, in taste buds. However, the cat <italic>Tas1r2</italic> gene shows a 247-base pair microdeletion in exon 3 and stop codons in exons 4 and 6. There was no evidence of detectable mRNA from cat <italic>Tas1r2</italic> by RT-PCR or in situ hybridization, and no evidence of protein expression by immunohistochemistry. <italic>Tas1r2</italic> in tiger and cheetah and in six healthy adult domestic cats all show the similar deletion and stop codons. We conclude that cat <italic>Tas1r3</italic> is an apparently functional and expressed receptor but that cat <italic>Tas1r2</italic> is an unexpressed pseudogene. A functional sweet-taste receptor heteromer cannot form, and thus the cat lacks the receptor likely necessary for detection of sweet stimuli. This molecular change was very likely an important event in the evolution of the cat's carnivorous behavior.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Although sweet sugars are ubiquitous in human foods, they are seldom added to cat food, and owners usually do not feed sweets to their cats. This is because, in contrast to most other mammals, both domestic cats and their wild cousins, the big cats, do not show a preference for and, most likely, cannot detect sweet-tasting compounds. Other than this sweet blindness, the cat's sense of taste is normal. The molecular mechanism for this unique behavior towards sweets was not known, until now. Sweet compounds, including sugars and artificial sweeteners, are recognized by a special taste bud receptor composed of the products of two genes. The authors found that in cats, one of these genes is not functional and is not expressed. (It is called a pseudogene.) Because the sweet receptor cannot be formed, the cat cannot taste sweet stimuli. During the evolution of the cats' strictly carnivorous behavior, selection to maintain a functional receptor was apparently relaxed. This research provides a molecular explanation for the common observation that the cat lives in a different sensory world than the cat owner.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Li X, Li W, Wang H, Cao J, Maehashi K, et al.

Its sense of taste is distinguished by a lack of attraction to, or indifference toward, compounds that taste sweet to humans, such as sweet carbohydrates (sugars) and high-intensity sweeteners &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b01">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. This behavior toward sweet stimuli is in marked contrast to the avidity for sweets shown by most omnivores and herbivores and even some other carnivores such as the dog &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The indifference that cats display toward sweet-tasting compounds contrasts with their otherwise normal taste behavior toward stimuli of other taste modalities. For example, they show preference for selected amino acids &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d; and generally avoid stimuli that to humans taste either bitter or very sour &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Congruent with these behavioral responses to taste stimuli, recordings from cat taste nerve fibers, and from units of the geniculate ganglion innervating taste cells, demonstrate responses to salty, sour, and bitter stimuli as well as to amino acids and nucleotides, but do not show neural responses to sucrose and several other sugars &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b05">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The sense of taste in the cat, in general, is therefore similar to that of other mammals, with the exception of an inability to taste sweet stimuli.</p><p>The molecular basis for this sweet blindness in cats is not known. Because the taste blindness appears specific to this single modality, we postulated that the defect in the cat (and likely in other obligate carnivores of Felidae) lies at the receptor step subtending the sweet-taste modality. The possible defects at the molecular level that might cause this sweet blindness could range from a single to a few amino acid substitutions, such as is found between sweet &#x0201c;taster&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;nontaster&#x0201d; strains of mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;, to more radical mechanisms, such as an unexpressed pseudogene.</p><p>To distinguish among these possibilities, we identified the DNA sequence and examined the structures of the two known genes, <italic>Tas1r2</italic> and <italic>Tas1r3,</italic> that in other mammals encode the sweet-taste receptor heteromer, T1R2/T1R3. We compared these with the sequence and structure of the same genes in dog, human, mouse, and rat&#x02014;all species that display a functional sweet-taste modality. We also sought to detect the expression of the two cat genes at both the RNA and protein levels. Our results lead us to conclude that <italic>Tas1r3</italic> is expressed in cat taste buds and very likely is functional, whereas cat <italic>Tas1r2</italic> is an unexpressed pseudogene. The immediate repercussion of this unexpressed gene is that the heteromer normally acting as a sweet-taste receptor in most other mammals likely does not form in the cat.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We identified DNA sequences of <italic>Tas1r3</italic> and <italic>Tas1r2</italic> from the domestic cat by screening a feline BAC library and using a PCR strategy on cat genomic DNA with degenerate primers.

The genes encoding taste receptors often show a good deal of variation both among species and among individuals. These variations, both subtle and obvious, can have a variety of effects on taste sensitivity and preference behavior. A textbook example of this effect is the individual variation seen in sensitivity to the bitter compound, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). A gene of the human <italic>TAS2R</italic> family of bitter taste receptors, <italic>TAS2R38,</italic> associated with this individual variation, shows three coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms giving rise to five haplotypes worldwide, accounting for the 55&#x00025; to 85&#x00025; of the variance in PTC sensitivity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

An example of this effect in mammalian chemoreception lies within the large repertoire of olfactory receptor genes. More than 60&#x00025; of the human olfactory receptor genes are pseudogenes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b35">35</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas, only 20&#x00025; are classified as such in mouse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010003-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

Similar generation of bitter-taste receptor pseudogenes, accompanied by a large number of coding region single-nucleotide polymorphism, can account for the broad diversity displayed by the bitter-taste receptor family.

Because, with the exception of the sweetness modality, the taste system of the cat is organized much like that of most other mammals, discovering the molecular basis for the cats' lack of response to sweet-tasting compounds gives us a window on the development of strict carnivorous behavior in Felidae.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is known that Felidae do not detect sweetness of carbohydrates yet can taste amino acids.
