JNCL presents between the ages of 6&#x02013;10 years with visual failure, followed by epilepsy and progressive cognitive and motor deterioration, leading to premature death. The conservation of <italic>CLN3</italic> suggests that it has a basic cellular role, although its exact function is still unknown. CLN3 is a transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) and is located in the endosome&#x02013;lysosome membrane and possibly in lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Its function has been linked to many cellular processes, including trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), cytoskeletal organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), lysosomal homoeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and lipid modification or changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>To help understand the apparently complex role of CLN3, we have been using a simple model system, the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. We have previously shown that deletion of <italic>btn1</italic>, the <italic>CLN3</italic> orthologue, causes dysregulation of vacuole homoeostasis, with <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells displaying larger and less acidic vacuoles (equivalent to mammalian lysosomes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), as in patient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). In addition, we demonstrated that in <italic>Sz. pombe</italic>, Btn1p traffics slowly to the vacuole membrane through the endosomal system and Btn1p has a role prior to reaching the vacuole that impacts on vacuole function. Ectopic expression of N-terminally fused green fluorescent protein (GFP)&#x02013;Btn1p or GFP&#x02013;CLN3 constructs in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells complements the vacuole size and pH defects, confirming that Btn1p and CLN3 are functional homologues.</p><p>We also found that in the absence of a functional V-type H<sup>+</sup> adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase), <italic>btn1</italic> is required for completion of cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), suggesting an additional role for <italic>btn1</italic> that is not linked to vacuole pH regulation. Consistently, we noted that at 25&#x000b0;C, under normal growth conditions, cells deleted for <italic>btn1</italic> have an increased septation index, are longer and grow somewhat slower than wild-type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Given the tight control of progression through the cell cycle in fission yeast, we reasoned that the mild growth defects of <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells could be significant and so examined the phenotype of these cells under different growth conditions. We discovered that <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells are sensitive to growth at high temperature and lyse at 37&#x000b0;C following progressive depolarization of growth. Subsequent analysis revealed that at 37&#x000b0;C, Btn1p is involved in an F-actin-dependent process that links endocytosis and the polarized localization of sterol-rich membrane domains with polarized growth.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Btn1p is essential for growth at 37&#x000b0;C</title><p>We explored the effect of increased temperature on the growth of <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells. The presence of <italic>btn1</italic> is not essential for growth of fission yeast cells under normal growth conditions. However, at 37&#x000b0;C in YES media, <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells were found to be temperature sensitive for growth. After overnight growth (18 h) at 37&#x000b0;C, <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells underwent striking changes in cell morphology, with the appearance of swollen cells that were pear shaped, elliptical or branched, and this was accompanied by some cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>btn1</italic> &#x00394; cells progressed through no more than two to three cell cycles within this time compared with at least six cell cycles for wild-type cells as measured by cell count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>) and time lapse microscopy (data not shown). By 24&#x02013;48 h at 37&#x000b0;C, all <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells had undergone lysis. Growth curve analysis of early events at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C</xref>) revealed that after transfer to 37&#x000b0;C, both wild-type and <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells underwent a delay in growth, presumably because of activation of the heat-stress response pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), but by 3 h growth had resumed in both strains. However, unlike wild-type cells, which appeared to have completed the first cell cycle by 5 h, <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells were slightly delayed and took 6&#x02013;7 h to reach this stage. After this point, growth was significantly delayed for <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells compared with wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C</xref>).

In fission yeast, sites of polarized growth and cell wall deposition are restricted to the cell poles in interphase cells and to the mid-zone, the site of cell division, in dividing cells. These sites form at and are maintained by the presence of sterol-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) that can be visualized by staining with filipin, a fluorescent sterol-binding dye. We examined the distribution of filipin-stained sterol domains in cells grown at 25&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C. These domains were correctly polarized at sites of growth in wild-type cells and in cells lacking <italic>btn1</italic> grown at 25&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2A</xref>). However, in contrast to wild-type cells that retained polarized filipin up to and after 18 h growth at 37&#x000b0;C, in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells, the polarization of filipin-stained sterol domains was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>) and instead, these domains were depolarized and distributed over the plasma membrane surface. Spatial distribution graphs of filipin staining confirmed that in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells, there was increased filipin staining along the sides of interphase cells and at all locations in septated cells, particularly at the septa and cell sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells, after 18 h at 37&#x000b0;C, sterols are often concentrated at swollen regions of the cell including the division septum, suggesting that these cells are unable to correctly delimit sterols to cell poles during interphase or during the final stages of cell division after prolonged growth at 37&#x000b0;C. This broadening of filipin staining is consistent with the depolarized growth of <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells. In order to establish whether sterol spreading was merely a secondary consequence of depolarized growth, we examined the location of these sterol-rich domains in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells at earlier time-points after the temperature shift to 37&#x000b0;C. Up to and including 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C, their location was correctly polarized in both wild-type cells and <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells (data not shown and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2C</xref>), but by 7 h at 37&#x000b0;C, in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells, sterol spreading began to occur. Interphase cells displayed broad regions of filipin staining either on the cell sides or spreading from the cell tips, and dividing cells showed sterol spreading from septum regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2D</xref>). Spatial distribution graphs confirmed these findings. Additionally, in septated cells, filipin staining was observed mainly spreading outwards from the septum regions on to the cell sides but was rarely at the cell tips. At this time-point, <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells are still largely rod shaped and not yet completely depolarized for growth. Thus, progressive spreading of sterols in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells at 37&#x000b0;C appears to precede total depolarized growth.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2:</label><caption><p><bold><italic>btn1</italic></bold><bold>&#x00394; cells have altered sterol-rich membrane domains.</bold>Loss of polarization of sterol domains in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells at 37&#x000b0;C: filipin staining of wild-type 972 and <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells grown at A) 25&#x000b0;C and Bi) 37&#x000b0;C for 18 h (left panel, phase contrast; inset, wild-type 972).

We therefore explored whether localization of Myo1p was affected in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells. We crossed <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; with a strain carrying endogenous Myo1p fused with GFP and found that although at 25&#x000b0;C Myo1p localized to cell tips and septum regions in both wild-type and <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A</xref>), after 18 h at 37&#x000b0;C, the location of Myo1p was completely depolarized in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells, showing mainly a diffuse or occasionally a depolarized punctate pattern of staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B</xref>). This depolarization concurred with the previously observed spreading of filipin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>). We also observed Myo1p and filipin location at earlier time-points during growth at 37&#x000b0;C, prior to the cell swelling phenotype. Myo1p and sterol-rich domains were correctly polarized and found at the cell tips of interphase cells and at septa of dividing cells up to and including 4 h of growth at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3C</xref>). However, by 7 h at 37&#x000b0;C, GFP&#x02013;Myo1p was fully depolarized in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3C</xref>). This coincided with the onset of filipin spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, polarized location of Myo1p and sterols was observed in wild-type cells expressing GFP&#x02013;Myo1p and grown under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Thus, mislocalization of Myo1p occurs with onset of sterol spreading and precedes total depolarized growth in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells, which occurs at 7 h at 37&#x000b0;C. These events are concurrent with completion of the first cell cycle for the total cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C</xref>). Together, these data suggest that polarization of growth zones is defective post-cytokinesis in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells at high temperature.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3:</label><caption><p><bold><italic>btn1</italic></bold><bold>&#x00394; cells have altered Myo1p location.</bold>Loss of polarization of sterol domains is linked to altered localization of GFP&#x02013;Myo1p in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells at 37&#x000b0;C: localization of GFP&#x02013;Myo1p in wild-type and <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells at A) 25&#x000b0;C and B) 37&#x000b0;C for 18 h (inset, wild type).

Myo1p, the only type 1 myosin in fission yeast and its <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> orthologues, Myo3p and Myo5p, have independently been shown to be directly involved in the activation of the Arp2/3 complex at the plasma membrane. Arp2/3 activation promotes actin polymerization and drives F-actin patch formation at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).

First, we examined the location and spreading of sterol-rich domains in cells totally defective in F-actin polymerization by the use of Latrunculin A, which disrupts the F-actin cytoskeleton by sequestering monomeric actin. At the concentration used, all F-actin cables and patches depolymerize by 10 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). We found that polarized sterol domains are not maintained after prolonged Latrunculin A treatment and filipin is instead spread over most of the cell surface in all cells after 2&#x02013;4 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4A</xref>), with the exception of small regions adjacent to the nuclei that remain free from sterol spreading. We measured filipin density in interphase cells (i.e. cells with one nucleus), which confirmed sterol spreading along the sides of the cells. Latrunculin A treatment prevents cell cycle progression to cytokinesis because the acto&#x02013;myosin ring is not formed and the division plane is not assembled; so, we were unable to measure filipin density in septated cells. A previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) describes broad bands of sterols on cell sides in <italic>cdc25-22</italic>&#x02018;block and release&#x02019; cells that had been treated with Latrunculin A.

These cells exhibit a block at septation and depolarized growth consistent with a severe defect in actin after 2&#x02013;4 h growth at 37&#x000b0;C. Again, severe sterol spreading was observed after 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C that worsened by 4-h growth, by which time the depolarized phenotype was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4B</xref>). Spatial distribution graphs of filipin spreading confirmed this finding with sterol spreading to cell sides apparent in both interphase and septated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4B</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that polarization of F-actin and localization of sterol domains are linked.</p><p>We then explored the link between sterols and F-actin patches. Investigations in both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Sz. pombe</italic> yeasts have recently provided a link between F-actin patch formation and polarization and endocytosis. Indeed, &#x02018;slow-moving&#x02019; F-actin patches at the plasma membrane have been identified as sites of endocytic membrane invagination (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), and the active process of actin polymerization at these sites forms part of the Sla1p and Sla2p/End4p-dependent endocytic machinery that causes the membrane to invaginate, ultimately giving rise to an early endocytic vesicle. F-actin patch formation at the plasma membrane is therefore not only coupled to endocytosis but also part of the endocytic process. Consistently, type 1 myosin has also been linked to endocytosis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), although not apparently in <italic>Sz. pombe</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>We tested cells that were compromised in early stages of endocytosis and/or F-actin patch polarization for sterol spreading.

The <italic>myo1</italic>&#x00394; strain is also defective for F-actin patch formation/polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).

Endocytic defects are typically visualized by monitoring the uptake and trafficking of the lipophilic dye FM4-64, which is taken up at the cell tips in interphase cells and septum region in dividing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) and transported to the vacuole within minutes. We found that at 25&#x000b0;C, cells deleted for <italic>end4</italic>, already known to have a severe endocytic defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), show very limited uptake of FM4-64 over time compared with wild-type and <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>)]. We also found that <italic>myo1</italic>&#x00394; cells are severely compromised for endocytosis, with minimal uptake of FM4-64 over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Even after 60-min incubation, only very low amounts of FM4-64 had entered <italic>myo1</italic>&#x00394; cells. FM4-64 has been observed to eventually traffic to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), albeit at very reduced amounts, in these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5B</xref>). Although it has been reported that the <italic>myo1</italic>&#x00394; strain does not have a defect in endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), we show, using a more sensitive method of FM4-64 uptake, that this same strain is in fact severely delayed in endocytosis. When we used the previously reported method where excess FM4-64 is preloaded onto cells on ice prior to uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), we found that although FM4-64 is ultimately taken up (between 10 and 20 min), at earlier time-points (1&#x02013;10 min), a delay was clearly evident (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). The method used in the previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) is more suited to detection of a total block in endocytosis rather than a delay unless earlier time-points are examined. We concluded that there is a link between defective F-actin patch polarization, defective endocytosis and sterol domain spreading.</p></sec><sec><title>btn1&#x00394; cells are defective in F-actin patch formation and polarization</title><p>Because <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells are defective in sterol localization at 37&#x000b0;C and we have now demonstrated a link between sterol spreading, depolarization of F-actin and reduced endocytosis, we examined <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells for such defects. First, we stained for F-actin in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells grown at 25&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C. At 25&#x000b0;C, the distribution of F-actin in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells appeared relatively normal with polarized F-actin patches at the poles in interphase cells and at the septum in dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6A</xref>). We did however note that there was more diffuse F-actin in these cells compared with wild-type cells. At 37&#x000b0;C, after 18 h, by which time <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells were already depolarized for growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>), severe F-actin defects were apparent. F-actin patches were mostly depolarized or completely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B</xref>), with only a few cells displaying some polarized F-actin patches that were found at the polarized (non-swollen) end of pear-shaped cells. We explored earlier time-points at 37&#x000b0;C to follow the course of F-actin depolarization and its link to sterol spreading. At 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C, F-actin patches were mainly polarized in both wild-type and <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6C</xref>), although again we noted more diffuse F-actin in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells. However, at 7 h at 37&#x000b0;C, <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells exhibited a very diffuse F-actin staining together with defective localization of F-actin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6D</xref>). The majority of <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells (71%, compared with 26% of wild-type cells) displayed a monopolar, rather than bipolar, distribution. For those patches localized at, or near, the one growing tip, as evidenced by calcofluor staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6D</xref>), the distribution was not centred at the tip as in wild-type cells. Rather, patches were more dispersed around the tip. The predominance of monopolar over bipolar F-actin patches at 7 h suggested a defect in maintaining bipolar growth. This is likely to be a prerequisite for the more severe polarity defects at later time-points.</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Figure 6:</label><caption><p><bold><italic>btn1</italic></bold><bold>&#x00394; cells are defective in F-actin patch formation/polarisation and endocytosis.</bold><italic>btn1</italic> &#x00394; cells have slight defects in the F-actin cytoskeleton at 25&#x000b0;C.

Briefly, following cell division, each daughter cell first resumes polarized growth at the &#x02018;old&#x02019; end, marked by the polarized presence of F-actin patches, and thus grows in a monopolar manner for a set time. At a later point in G2, a &#x02018;new end take-off&#x02019; (NETO) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) is established that additionally localizes F-actin at the new cell end, enabling polarized growth at this end as well as the old end (bipolar growth) until cell division. Cells that are blocked in NETO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) continue to grow but remain monopolar in their growth up to septation. We therefore determined the percentage of septated cells that had only one growth cap, as visualized by calcofluor staining after 7 h growth at 37&#x000b0;C. Ninety-four per cent of septated <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells were monopolar for growth at this time compared with 30% of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, by 7 h, after completion of the first cell division at 37&#x000b0;C and preceding the swollen growth phenotype, <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells have a defect in polarizing F-actin, particularly at a new growth zone, that prevents the initiation of polarized growth at a new cell end. Further analysis revealed that after 7 h, the F-actin cytoskeleton became progressively depolarized with patches spread around the cell cortex, which was concurrent with loss of cylindrical morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6B</xref> and data not shown) and further sterol spreading. Thus, total depolarized growth is preceded by a defect in NETO arising from defective localization of F-actin at the new cell end.</p></sec><sec><title>btn1&#x00394; cells are defective in endocytosis</title><p>We then examined <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells grown at 37&#x000b0;C for defects in endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Severely reduced uptake of FM4-64 was observed in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells at 18 h at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6E</xref>). This was consistent with total depolarization of F-actin and sterol domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6E</xref>). FM4-64 uptake was also severely reduced at 7 h when F-actin defects are apparent and sterol spreading is first observed. Upon examination of the localization of FM4-64 that had been taken up, we saw that in contrast to wild-type cells, which showed typical staining of cytoplasmic structures, FM4-64 was retained at one cell pole in interphase cells and no obvious vacuole staining was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting a defect both in uptake and in trafficking to the vacuole. Interestingly, uptake of FM4-64 was also reduced in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells that have been grown for 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6E</xref>). This is consistent with a mild defect in F-actin, visualized by slightly diffused actin staining, at this time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6C</xref>) but prior to sterol spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests that in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells, sterol spreading may be a downstream consequence of defects in F-actin patch formation/polarization and endocytosis. This is consistent with our observations that Latrunculin A treatment, which causes a total block in endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), is followed by sterol spreading even in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), uptake and trafficking of FM4-64 were relatively normal in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells at the permissive temperature of 25&#x000b0;C when F-actin patches and sterol domains were largely polarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6A</xref>), although some diffuse actin was evident and uptake of FM4-64 is slightly reduced over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A,B</xref>). This implies that at 25&#x000b0;C and under normal laboratory growth conditions, Btn1p plays a minor role in F-actin patch remodelling and endocytosis (as monitored by FM4-64 uptake) but has little effect on sterol domains, but at 37&#x000b0;C, this role is crucial.</p></sec><sec><title>Btn1p has a polarized location at 37&#x000b0;C</title><p>For Btn1p to affect events that normally occur at the cell poles or septum, that is, the formation and polarization of F-actin patches, endocytosis, polarization of sterol-rich domains and cell wall deposition, it might be expected that its location be spatially regulated, perhaps at these sites. We have previously shown that trafficking of Btn1p to the vacuole was through the endocytic pathway and was slower than for other vacuole membrane proteins and that it exerts an effect prior to reaching the vacuole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), consistent with a prevacuolar location of Btn1p being functionally important. Because cells lacking <italic>btn1</italic> have additional and severe defects when grown at 37&#x000b0;C, we examined the intracellular location of Btn1p at this temperature and found that it was altered. GFP&#x02013;Btn1p was enriched at the cell poles and at the septa in wild-type cells grown at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7A</xref>) compared with cells grown at 25&#x000b0;C where it was located in structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The polar location of GFP&#x02013;Btn1p was shown to be actin dependent as treatment with Latrunculin A, which prevents polymerization of actin, but not with methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamate (MBC), which depolymerizes microtubules, caused Btn1p to disperse throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7B</xref> and data not shown). Importantly, the location of GFP&#x02013;Btn1p in cells grown at 37&#x000b0;C overlapped that of early FM4-64-staining vesicles at the cell poles, but not late FM4-64-staining vacuoles, indicating that these Btn1p-containing compartments are prevacuolar and within the endomembrane system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7C</xref>). Intriguingly, the GFP&#x02013;Btn1p-containing structures were found to localize adjacent to F-actin patches near the cell pole regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, the location and trafficking of Btn1p appear to be differentially regulated at high temperature, with Btn1p being retained in compartments that locate at the cell poles at 37&#x000b0;C. Because Btn1p does not completely colocalize with F-actin patches at the plasma membrane, this suggests that Btn1p may be acting from a separate compartment that impacts on the early endocytic/F-actin patch machinery.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Figure 7:</label><caption><p><bold>Btn1p has an altered intracellular distribution at 37&#x000b0;C.</bold>A) Polarized location of GFP&#x02013;Btn1p at 37&#x000b0;C: location of GFP&#x02013;Btn1p in wild-type ED665 cells after overnight induction at 25&#x000b0;C followed by growth for 4 h at i) 37&#x000b0;C or ii) 25&#x000b0;C.

Progressive depolarization and spreading of sterol-rich domains commenced after the first cell cycle (7 h) at 37&#x000b0;C, and this was preceded by a progressive failure in the formation and polarization of F-actin patches and by endocytic defects that we now show are linked. Previously, sterol domains and F-actin patch polarization have separately been linked to Myo1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), and consistent with this, we found a loss of polarized location of Myo1p in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells after 7 h at the restrictive temperature. We additionally show that Myo1p is required for efficient endocytosis, and we directly link endocytosis with polarization of sterol-rich domains because <italic>end4</italic>&#x00394; cells, which are severely compromised in endocytosis, exhibit total sterol spreading. <italic>end4</italic> &#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), like <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells, have a block in NETO prior to total depolarization of growth. Thus, in <italic>Sz. pombe</italic>, the formation and polarization of F-actin patches and the early stages of endocytosis are intimately linked with the polarization of sterol-rich domains, and co-ordination of these aspects is required both for establishing new sites for growth (NETO) and for maintaining polarized and rod-shaped growth. We speculate that under certain conditions, defects in the positioning of the early endocytic vesicle/F-actin patch formation machinery during NETO give rise to sterol spreading and a feedback system of further depolarized growth, resulting from a loss of co-ordination of the endocytic and secretory pathways that specify sites for delivery of membrane and new cell wall components. We further speculate that the process of endocytosis regulates and delimits these sites to the cell tips/septum and that a major purpose of endocytosis in <italic>Sz. pombe</italic> is to co-ordinate membrane retrieval from the surface during ongoing polarized secretion.</p><p>We had previously observed an underlying cell cycle delay at 25&#x000b0;C in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells in addition to the cytokinesis defect with longer and more binucleate cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). These cell cycle delays could be because of a delay in remodelling of the polarization and actin-dependent machinery at each major transition throughout the cell cycle, in particular during NETO. Exploration of the phenotypes of <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells under normal growth conditions (25&#x000b0;C) revealed that the uptake and trafficking of FM4-64 are slightly reduced in these cells at the permissive temperature of 25&#x000b0;C when Myo1p and sterol domains appear to be polarized, although F-actin patches are slightly abnormal, consistent with Btn1p playing a minor role in endocytosis (as monitored by FM4-64 uptake) at 25&#x000b0;C and under normal growth conditions. Further investigation is required to fully elucidate the role that <italic>btn1</italic> plays in these processes under non-stress conditions.</p><p>While the link between F-actin patches, the early steps of endocytic membrane invagination and establishment of polarity is well understood in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) and to a lesser extent in <italic>Sz. pombe</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), this is only just being explored in mammalian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that an intimate link exists between F-actin, endocytosis, the type 1 myosins and sterol polarization across all eukaryotes. Furthermore, from our data in the <italic>Sz. pombe</italic> system, we propose that F-actin-dependent early endocytic events are upstream of sterol and Myo1p-related polarity events.</p><p>Mammalian cells have eight type 1 myosins, two of which (MYO1E and MYO1F) are long-tailed like <italic>Sz. pombe</italic> Myo1p. MYO1E plays a role in endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), like Myo1p, and MYO1F is important for cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). It will be interesting to investigate whether the function of Btn1p in relation to polarity, cytoskeletal regulation, endocytosis, Myo1p, and sterols, is conserved through CLN3 in higher eukaryotes. Certainly, endocytic defects have been reported in mammalian systems with <italic>CLN3</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). A similar depolarization phenotype has not been reported for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lacking the orthologue <italic>BTN1</italic> despite varying growth, temperature and hyperosmotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). This may be a reflection of some important difference in their biology or the presence in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> of two long-tailed type 1 myosins that functionally compensate for each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells also differ from <italic>Sz. pombe</italic> in their requirement for a programme of polarization only during budding of a new daughter cell. <italic>Sz. pombe</italic>, in contrast, relies on a continuous programme of polarized cell growth to maintain and restrict growth to the cell tips. It will be interesting to check for polarization of bud formation in the mother cell and its daughters in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> deleted for <italic>btn1</italic>, particularly following heat or other stress.</p><p>An important question raised by this data is how a protein that is considered to be a vacuole/lysosome membrane protein impacts on early endocytosis, cytoskeletal dynamics and the polarity machinery (including sterol-rich domains). We have previously provided evidence that Btn1p traffics slowly to the vacuole through the endocytic system and that Btn1p has a function prior to reaching the vacuole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). We now show that the location of Btn1p within endomembrane compartments is controlled, particularly in response to heat stress, when the location of Btn1p becomes polarized in an actin-dependent manner at sites of active growth. We propose that it is from these endomembrane compartments that Btn1p is affecting the F-actin machinery and sterol domains. Interestingly, CLN3 has been found to have additional polarized location in neurons where it localizes at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Thus, the evidence suggests that Btn1p and also CLN3 are spatially controlled and that their main function is outside the vacuole/lysosome.</p><p>In addition to the novel phenotypes reported in this paper, Btn1p and CLN3 play a role in vacuole/lysosome acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) under normal conditions. Vacuole/lysosome acidification by v-ATPase is modulated by many factors, including the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>); so, Btn1p may be affecting vacuole pH by indirectly modulating v-ATPase activity by an effect on the cytoskeleton. Alternatively, or in addition, Btn1p may be affecting the trafficking of v-ATPase and perhaps other transporters to the vacuole, again through its effect on actin.</p><p>In conclusion, we have further characterized the phenotype of cells deleted for the <italic>Sz. pombe</italic> orthologue of the human Batten disease gene <italic>CLN3</italic>, <italic>btn1</italic>. We identified a failure to correctly polarize F-actin patches and the endocytic machinery, leading to the loss of polarity of Myo1p and sterol-rich membrane domains. Our work suggests that CLN3 may act in a similar manner and affect the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking, perhaps resulting in changes in lipid domains. This could have far-reaching consequences on the trafficking and activity of other proteins including CLN3 itself as well as type 1 myosins. Failure to correctly regulate the endocytic pathway could give rise to many of the features of JNCL, for example, defective antigen processing, leading to the production of autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>) or aberrant modulation of receptor signalling in neurons leading to seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). The precise events that contribute to neuronal cell death in JNCL remain to be delineated. We are continuing to use the <italic>Sz. pombe</italic> system to investigate the basic function of Btn1p, and by extrapolation CLN3, and expect this to provide new avenues for the development of therapies for patients with JNCL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and general techniques</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.

Calcofluor (50 &#x003bc;g/mL; Polysciences Inc.) was used to visualize septa and cell wall deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). Cells were stained with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for DNA. For endocytosis assays, FM4-64 dye (Molecular Probes) was dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide at a concentration of 0.82 m<sc>m</sc>. Typically, 2 &#x003bc;L FM4-64 stock was added to 1 mL cells at equal cell density, typically 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cell/mL (1.64 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> final concentration), and cells incubated at 25&#x000b0;C for 20 min and where indicated chased for 40 min in fresh media to allow all FM4-64 to reach the vacuole. Samples were viewed immediately. In one experiment, excess FM4-64 was preloaded onto cells on ice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) prior to uptake. For FM4-64 densitometry measurements, 20 &#x003bc;L FM4-64 was added to 10 mL cells, and cells were grown at 25&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000b0;C with shaking. At indicated times (typically 5, 10, 15, 20 and 60 min), 1 mL of cells were removed, washed in fresh, cold media to remove FM4-64 that had not been taken up and stored on ice until image capture. For densitometry measurements, <italic>n</italic> = 30 individual cell measurements were obtained using <sc>openlab</sc> software. For visualization of sterol-rich domains, filipin staining was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and at a final concentration of 5 &#x003bc;g/mL. Briefly, 1 &#x003bc;L of filipin was added to 1 mL log-phase cells (at equal cell density, typically 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cell/mL), and cells were rapidly washed in media and visualized immediately. All cells (wild type or mutant) were kept at the stated temperature until just prior to image capture and were treated identically. Microscopy (at room temperature) was rapidly performed to minimize any changes in temperature. Measurements were obtained using <sc>openlab</sc> software from <italic>n</italic> = 25 cells for interphase measurements and <italic>n</italic> = 25 for septated cell measurements and transferred to Excel for analysis. The mean fluorescence intensity of a set tool area was obtained in the same cell for three non-overlapping regions &#x02013; cell tip, cell septum (if present) and cell side (which was equidistant between the mid region and the tip of the cell). For cells at 37&#x000b0;C, the same set area was used. Septation in depolarized cells gave the orientation. Most depolarized interphase cells retained an elliptical or egg shape, allowing orientation for positioning the measuring tool. Cells with septa that had not separated were considered septated cells. For actin staining, cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde (to a final concentration of 3.7%) to the culture for 60 min with shaking, washed twice with PM (35 m<sc>m</sc> K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> MgSO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.9), permeabilized with 1% Triton-X-100, washed twice with PM and stained with rhodamine&#x02013;phalloidin (Molecular Probes). We note that the defects present in <italic>btn1</italic>&#x00394; cells may interfere with visualization of intracellular structures. Images were visualized using a Hamamatsu digital camera C4742-95 fitted to a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with plan-Apochromat &#x000d7;63 1.25 oil objective and were recorded using <sc>openlab</sc> 3.4 software (Improvision Ltd.) and downloaded to either Microsoft Excel for analysis or to <sc>adobe photoshop</sc> 7 for assembly into montages. A DAPI filter was used for DAPI, calcofluor and filipin fluorescence. A fluorescein isothiocyanate filter was used for GFP detection and a rhodamine filter for detection of FM4-64.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank T. D. Pollard, S. Castagnetti and W.

FM4-64 uptake experiments were performed using the protocol described by Takeda and Chang (19). Cells were loaded with 20 &#x003bc;M FM4-64 from 2 mM stock for 15 min on ice, washed once with ice-cold YES, resuspended in fresh YES, incubated at 30&#x000b0;C and FM4-64 imaged at different time-points. The figure shows indicated cells at time 0 (i.e. after15-min incubation on ice and washing) and at 2, 5, 10 and 20 min after release into fresh media at the raised temperature. In wild-type (wt) cells, FM4-64 is internalized rapidly (by 2 min) and has reached the vacuole in some cells by 5 min and in all cells by 20 min. In contrast, in myo1&#x025b5; cells, FM4-64 remains at the cell surface for longer and internalization is much slower. FM4-64 is only evident at the vacuole in some cells at 20 min.
