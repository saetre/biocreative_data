Using mice with an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutation in <italic>Suppressor of Zeste 12</italic> (<italic>Suz12</italic>), a core component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), we show here that loss of Suz12 function enhances hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity.

To investigate the molecular targets of the PRC2 complex in the HSC compartment, we examined changes in global patterns of gene expression in cells deficient in Suz12. We identified a distinct set of genes that are regulated by Suz12 in hematopoietic cells, including eight genes that appear to be highly responsive to PRC2 function within this compartment. These data suggest that PRC2 is required to maintain a specific gene expression pattern in hematopoiesis that is indispensable to normal stem cell function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The chromatin environment that surrounds a gene heavily influences the gene's transcriptional activity. Specific modifications on histone tails serve as signposts for the basal transcriptional machinery, reflecting a cell's developmental history and identifying genes that should be actively transcribed and those that must be repressed. Polycomb group proteins are involved in large, multiprotein complexes that catalyse the post-translational modification of histones. The disruption of these complexes induces wholesale changes in gene expression, a scenario commonly seen in diseases such as cancer. We have investigated the role of Polycomb group proteins during blood cell formation: in stem cells, progenitor cells, and mature blood cells. Using a variety of functional assays, we demonstrate an important role for Polycomb group proteins in restricting the activity of hematopoietic stem cells. To define the molecular targets of the complex, we examined gene expression profiles in cells with impaired expression of Polycomb group proteins. This analysis identified a set of target genes within the hematopoietic compartment that was distinct from those defined in embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. This study provides new insights into the role of these proteins during hematopoiesis, and suggests a novel mechanism by which they might contribute to leukaemia.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Epigenetic modifications are central to the maintenance of cellular identity and are dynamically regulated during differentiation.

Previous studies have demonstrated that Ezh2, Suz12, and Eed are interdependent, such that a reduction in any one of the PRC2 components negatively affects the stability of the others. This is evident in mice harbouring loss-of-function alleles of PRC2 components &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d; and in cell lines in which one of the components has been impaired by RNA-mediated silencing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

The discovery that <italic>Ezh2</italic>, <italic>Eed</italic>, and <italic>Suz12</italic> are all haploinsufficient demonstrates that the activity of the PRC2 complex is exquisitely sensitive to alterations in the expression of its components. This is further supported by the observation that the composition and activity of the complex becomes altered when the components are expressed at inappropriate levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>One of our key findings was that <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice have enhanced HSC activity, which likely accounts for changes that are evident in the peripheral blood. A similar phenotype has been described in mice that carry a hypomorphic allele of <italic>Eed</italic>. <italic>Eed<sup>3354/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice show elevated numbers of multi-potent progenitors in long-term bone marrow cultures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, and this finding was used to suggest an important function for PRC2 in restricting the proliferation of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors. Our study extends this result and has identified a role for PRC2 in regulating the functional activity of HSCs. The proliferative defects evident in Eed<italic><sup>3354/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice worsen with age and ultimately progress to leukaemia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Although HSCs derived from <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice were clearly more competitive than wild-type cells, leukaemia was not observed in <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice or in recipients of <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> bone marrow. It is tempting to speculate that the phenotypic similarities between <italic>Eed<sup>3354/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice result from their common contribution to the PRC2 complex, and that progression to leukaemia in <italic>Eed<sup>3354/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice is a consequence of a greater impairment to PRC2 activity. Elevated platelet counts evident in <italic>Ezh2<sup>&#x0002b;/-</sup> c-Mpl<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> animals strongly suggest that PRC2 is central to the phenotypic changes in <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice; however, it remains possible that Suz12 has a functional role that is independent of the complex.</p><p>A series of elegant studies have demonstrated that PRC2 functions to maintain the undifferentiated state in embryonic stem cells, and it is quite possible that the complex fulfils a similar role in HSCs. An increased rate of differentiation, in the context of PRC2 deficiency, could explain the elevated contribution of <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> HSCs to hematopoiesis and is consistent with the progressive nature of the hematopoietic defects evident in <italic>Eed<sup>3354/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Kamminga and colleagues recently demonstrated that exogenous expression of Ezh2 preserves stem cell function during serial bone marrow transplantation and suggested that PRC2 prevents replicative senescence within the HSC compartment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. With this in mind, we performed experiments to assess the integrity of homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the HSC pool in <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice. Although alterations in the number and function of HSCs were detected, several observations suggest that these cells retain their ability to self-renew and do not become senescent prematurely: first, the hematopoietic system is stable in <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice as they age; second, <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> HSCs continue to contribute effectively to hematopoiesis, even after three rounds of transplantation; and third, mice that carry the <italic>Plt8</italic> mutation respond normally to treatment with the cytotoxic agent 5-fluorouracil, which selectively targets cycling cells (unpublished data). It is likely that additional resources, such as conditional targeted alleles, will be required to determine the precise role of PRC2 within the HSC compartment.</p><p>To better understand the mechanism by which the <italic>Plt8</italic> mutation influences hematopoiesis, we investigated changes in gene expression associated with PRC2 deficiency. Before this study, knowledge of PRC2 target genes within the hematopoietic compartment was limited. We used shRNA-mediated silencing to impair <italic>Suz12</italic> expression in the erythro-megakaryocytic cell line G1ME and in primary hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells. Global analysis of gene expression by microarray identified several hundred transcripts that were differentially expressed in cells that lacked <italic>Suz12</italic>. The vast majority of these genes showed elevated expression, which supports the prevailing view that PRC2 and H3K27-3Me are required for the maintenance of transcriptional repression (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;). Previous studies have identified genes that are regulated by PRC2 in a variety of different cell types, including mouse and human ES cells, fibroblasts, and numerous cell lines derived from tumours. Our results suggest that PRC2 regulates a distinct set of genes in hematopoietic cells, because very few of the genes identified as mis-regulated in <italic>Suz12</italic>-deficient hematopoietic cells have previously been reported as PRC2 targets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We identified eight genes that were similarly altered in <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> LSK cells and <italic>Suz12</italic>-deficient progenitors (LK cells), demonstrating that some target genes are conserved between stem cells and progenitors. This included the uncharacterised transcript <italic>2810025M15Rik</italic>, which was also up-regulated in <italic>Suz12</italic>-deficient G1ME cells (unpublished data).

For example, both <italic>Bex2</italic> and <italic>Bex4</italic> become activated when cancer cells are treated with agents that inhibit DNA methylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results suggest that Polycomb group proteins contribute to silencing these genes. A recent study identified a subset of breast cancers that express high levels of <italic>Bex2</italic>, and it will be important to determine whether these tumours display impaired PRC2 function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. Tumours that express <italic>Bex2</italic> are highly sensitive to treatment with tamoxifen, and the inhibition of PRC2 may represent a mechanism to promote <italic>Bex2</italic> expression. Few studies have addressed the role of these genes in leukaemogenesis, yet it has been shown that <italic>Bex2</italic> is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukaemia samples that carry activating translocations in the trithorax group gene, <italic>Mixed lineage leukaemia</italic> (<italic>Mll</italic>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Bex2</italic> expression appears to be highly responsive to changes that disrupt the balance between Polycomb and trithorax complexes. PRC2 has also been implicated in the development of acute promyelocytic leukaemia via direct interaction with the oncogenic fusion protein PML-RAR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results suggest that PRC2 may contribute to leukaemogenesis by directly silencing tumour suppressor genes.</p><p>Modulation of PRC2 complex, either through inhibition or enhancement of complex activity, has distinct consequences for the behaviour of HSCs. Major impairment of the complex is associated with defective maturation in lymphoid cells and leukaemia, whereas the modest reduction in complex activity in <italic>Suz12<sup>Plt8/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice enhances blood cell production and the performance of HSCs during transplantation. Our data support an important role for PRC2 in regulating gene expression during hematopoiesis. A more detailed knowledge of PRC2 target genes within the HSC compartment, and their response to altered expression of PRC2 components, will enable a better understanding of the role of the complex during development and in disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>ENU mutagenesis screen and genetic mapping.</title><p><italic>c-Mpl<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice used in this study were maintained on an inbred C57BL/6 background &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060093-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.
