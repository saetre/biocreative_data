In the immediate postnatal period, the outermost layer, the external granule layer (EGL), contains dividing granule neuron progenitors (GNP). These granule cells migrate inwards, guided by Bergmann radial glial fibers through the molecular layer (ML), pass through the Purkinje neuron layer (PL) containing the cell bodies of Purkinje neurons and Bergmann glia and finally settle into the internal granular layer (IGL) where they exit the cell cycle and terminally differentiate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005922-Altman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005922-Alder1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

This report also reports another abnormality related to increased proliferation of CGPs in IGL of cerebellum. Our previously published finding that GPR3 was highly expressed in the internal granule layer (IGL) of the rodent postnatal cerebellum led us to hypothesize that GPR3 was one of the factors responsible for inhibition of granule cell precursors' proliferation and induction of their terminal differentiation during development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005922-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. In this report, we show for the first time that <italic>GPR3</italic> expression: <bold>1)</bold> decreases Shh-induced proliferation and increases p27/Kip expression of GPCs when added exogenously, while it promotes the opposite effect when &#x0201c;knocked- down&#x0201d; by siRNA; <bold>2)</bold> gradually increases postnatally in IGL and, when absent, there is increased proliferation of cells in IGL with a visible neuroanatomical abnormality; and <bold>3)</bold> is linked in vivo to induction of p27/Kip, previously linked to CGP cell cycle exit, and to an increase in phosphorylated CREB, suggesting that its action is mediated by cyclic AMP. Therefore, these results indicate that GPR3 represents one of the molecules responsible for the regulation of the antiproliferative and differentiation program in the postnatal cerebellum.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic>, increases of GPR3 gene expression by exogenous means did not affect proliferation of postnatal GPCs suggesting that by itself the antiproliferative action of the gene was already at its peak. However, addition of more GPR3 did significantly inhibit the proliferative action of Shh. Although this inhibition seems to be only partial, electroporation experiments may be under-estimating its true magnitude. First of all, the efficiency of electroporation is at best about 50&#x00025; of cells on the plate, while the effect of Shh, or of the positive control dibutyryl cyclic AMP, is likely to be on all cells on the plate. Second, more detailed dose-response assays could have been performed to determine the stoichiometry of <italic>GPR3</italic> gene expression inhibition of Shh-induced proliferation. In spite of this, the experiment performed still showed significant inhibition of Shh action by GPR3, thus answering the posited question. Third, it is likely that GPR3 is not the only mediator of inhibition of Shh-induced action and that other factors (for instance, other GPRs or PACAP) and signaling pathways are also required to completely abolish GPR3 action. Finally, experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> may not faithfully recapitulate <italic>in vivo</italic> events, due to artifacts of tissue culture. Similar considerations apply to the siRNA experiments. To really determine if GPR3 possesses a significant role in cerebellar development, we did employ studies in wild-type and <italic>GPR3&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice. These studies clearly showed that <italic>GPR3</italic> gene expression expands significantly during the time-course of postnatal development of rats and mice, particularly in the IGL and, when not present, CGPs in IGL are hyper-proliferative. This results in a visible neuro-anatomic difference (enlarged IGL) with decreased expression of p27/kip, as predicted by the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Taken in conjunction, thus, these <italic>in vivo</italic> studies do establish GPR3 as a mediator of anti-proliferative signals in CGPs.</p><p>We indirectly linked <italic>in vivo</italic> the down-stream effects of GPR3 on Shh and p27/Kip by evaluating phosphorylated CREB in IGL as a marker of cyclic AMP activity. The evidence linking GPR3 expression with cAMP activation in CGPs is indirect. However, GPR3 activation of cAMP has been demonstrated in a variety of cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005922-Eggerickx1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005922-Hinckley1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, thus making it likely to also be occurring in CGPs. The findings did show a visually distinct loss of phosphorylated CREB in <italic>GPR3&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mice, in agreement with a model where GPR3 activation stimulates cAMP-mediated mechanisms that antagonize Hedgehog signaling and stimulate p27/Kip expression. The interplay of signaling pathways is a critical component in the development of the central nervous system. Cerebellar development has been extensively studied over the decades and the complex interplay of proliferative signals provided by the Hh pathway have revealed a cascade of events regulating the growth of cerebellar neurons, including granule precursors. Interestingly, regulatory signals related to inhibition of proliferation and stimulation of differentiation have not been elucidated, as fully. Adenylate cyclases, such as PACAP and PKA, have been shown to counteract Shh signaling and elevated cyclic AMP levels signal cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation of CGPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005922-Hammerschmidt1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005922-Nicot1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. P27/Kip activity also provides a signal for inhibition of proliferation, counteracting Hh<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005922-Miyazawa1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. However, no known upstream mediators of PKA and p27/Kip activity have been identified. The findings in this report indicate that GPR3 may represent this upstream mediator. Its genetic absence in mice leads to abnormal proliferation of GPCs postnatally, to an anatomically enlarged IGL, and to a downregulation of p27/Kip levels. When added exogenously GPR3 inhibits Shh-mediated proliferation of these cells and is also associated with p27/Kip upregulation, leading to cell cycle exit. GPR3 belongs to a family of presumably constitutively active G-protein coupled receptors previously linked to oocyte meiotic arrest and to neurite extension in rat neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005922-Mehlmann1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005922-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the implications of our findings provide a much larger role for this receptor in the development of the CNS. Future studies should elucidate the regulation of its expression in CGPs and the significance of its constitutive activity in these cells with its possible linkage to CGP development and differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005922.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Detection of endogenous vs. exogenous GPR3 mRNA from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005922-g001">figure 1</xref>.
