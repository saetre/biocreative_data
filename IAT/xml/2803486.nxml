To clarify the role of p53 gene, the effect of BNCT on oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells showing either wild- (SAS/neo) or mutant-type (SAS/mp53) p53 was examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Cells were exposed to neutron beams in the presence of boronophenylalanine (BPA) at Kyoto University Research Reactor. Treated cells were monitored for modulations in colony formation, proliferation, cell cycle, and expression of cell cycle-associated proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>When SAS/neo and SAS/mp53 cells were subjected to BNCT, more suppressive effects on colony formation and cell viability were observed in SAS/neo compared with SAS/mp53 cells. Cell cycle arrest at the G1 checkpoint was observed in SAS/neo, but not in SAS/mp53. Apoptotic cells increased from 6 h after BNCT in SAS/neo and 48 h in SAS/mp53 cells.

Indeed, Iwadate et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reported that high LET carbon-ion beams were more cytotoxic than low LET X-rays for glioma cells, and the effects of the carbon-ion beams were not dependent on the p53 gene status.

In the present study, we performed colony formation assays, and confirmed that the effect of BNCT was more potent in SAS/neo than SAS/mp53 cells. We also examined the effect of BNCT using the MTT assay, and identified a difference between SAS/neo and SAS/mp53 cells regarding their proliferative potential after BNCT. The expression of functional p53 must be involved in BNCT-induced growth suppression and/or cell death.</p><p>p53 is a key factor that regulates the cell cycle checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In this study, it was suggested that p53 plays an important role in G1 arrest in SAS/neo cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a transient accumulation in the G0/G population at 6 h after BNCT in SAS/neo cells. Thereafter, BNCT induced G2 arrest in both SAS/neo and SAS/mp53 cells. This indicates that BNCT induces cell cycle arrest at the G1 checkpoint only in SAS/neo cells. Tsuboi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] did not identify a marked increase of cells in the G1 phase in glioblastoma U87 MG cells with wild-type p53 as well as TK1 with mutant-type p53 after carbon-ion beam irradiation. BNCT may differ from carbon-ion beams in terms of its ability to induce cell cycle arrest at the G1 checkpoint.</p><p>When DNA damage by IR is irreparable, the activation of p53 leads to apoptosis via both transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Aromando et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] reported that BNCT-induced control of hamster cheek pouch tumors would be an inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis and apoptosis does not have a significant role in tumor control. Masunaga et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] examined the effect of BNCT on SAS xenografts in nude mice. After BNCT, the tumor cells were dissociated and the cell suspension was cultured for colony formation, the detection of apoptotic cells, and a micronucleus assay. The peak of apoptosis was observed at 6 h after BNCT at low levels, irrespective of the p53 status, suggesting that apoptosis occurred early on. We also observed an increase in the sub-G1 population and nuclear fragmentation early after BNCT in SAS/neo cells, and the level was maintained thereafter. In SAS/mp53 cells, however, the increase in apoptosis occurred subsequent to G2 arrest. Thus, p53 seems to be responsible for G1 arrest-associated apoptosis. In the present study, p53 led to a significant but limited increase of apoptosis. Differently, in colony formation and MTT assays, p53 has a much stronger impact on the survival fraction and proliferation of treated cells. This indicates that apoptosis is a form of cell death induced by BNCT. So far, different types of cell death have been documented. They include apoptosis, autophagy, mitotic catastrophe, necrosis and senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Especially, participation of mitotic catastrophe, necrosis and senescence in BNCT-treated cancer cells should be clarified.</p><p>p21 binds to and inhibits the cyclin-dependent protein kinases that drive the cell cycle, and is responsible for G1 arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In SAS/neo cells, we found that the expression and phosphorylation of p53 was markedly enhanced from 6 h after BNCT, and this level was maintained for 48 h. We also detected a transient increase in the expression of p21 which inhibited the transition from the G1 to S phase. In SAS/mp53 cells, however, p21 was not induced, and neither G1 arrest nor the induction of apoptosis was observed. This indicates that p21 is associated with cell cycle arrest at G1 down-stream of the p53 pathway.</p><p>After BNCT, cells that escaped G1 arrest accumulated at G2 to prevent mitotic entry after potentially lethal DNA damage. Cdc2 protein kinase activity is required for the G2-to-mitosis transition in all eukaryotic cells. Cdc25 activates the cdc2/cyclin B1 complex by dephosphorylating inhibitory threonine-14 and thyrosine-15 residues of cdc2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This step is indispensable to mitosis after IR. Wee1 protein kinase allows cdc2 inactivation by phosphorylation of cdc2 on tyrosine -15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Matsumura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] reported that carbon-ion irradiation was associated with the overexpression of Wee1 and phosphorylation of cdc2, followed by the prolongation of G2 arrest and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Consistent with their results, we found that BNCT induced the expression of Wee1 and cyclin B1 and increased the phosphorylation of cdc2 in both SAS/neo and SAS/mp53 cells around 12 h after BNCT. Therefore, it can be stated that Wee1, cdc2, and cyclin B1 are associated with G2 arrest in a p53-independent manner.</p><p>Carbon-ion beams reportedly induce apoptosis in oral SCC and lung cancer cells regardless of the p53 status at a high LET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Why high LET BNCT leads to the p53-dependent suppression of cell survival and induction of cell cycle arrest at the G1 checkpoint is unclear. Probably, each tumor cell would be equally exposed to carbon-ion beams. In the case of BNCT, however, the path lengths of high LET &#x003b1; and Li particles are very short, so that the LET would decrease markedly, even within a cell, being dependent on the distance from the cytoplasmic boron to the nuclear DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This may generate a variety of intracellular LET values, and yield appropriate energy to induce cell cycle arrest at G1, if the cells have functional p53. It may also be ascribed to the characteristics of the cell lines used. Indeed, the survival curve of SAS/mp53 cells is not exponential, but a shoulder curve. The form of the curve suggests that the LET was not very high. If the mutation may influence the intracellular accumulation of BPA, it may heavily influence the LET of the radiation and relative biological effect.</p><p>In conclusion, oral SCC cells with mutant-type p53 were more resistant to the cell-killing effect of BNCT than those with wild-type p53 under the present experimental conditions. A functional p53 is required for the induction of apoptosis related to G1 arrest. BNCT inhibits oral SCC cells via p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Recent clinical studies have shown that the delivery of wild-type p53 to cancer cells with p53 mutations significantly increases their radiation sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Adenoviral-mediated gene therapy is a reliable method to introduce the wild-type p53 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Such an approach may be applicable to oral SCCs with mutated p53 to promote the efficiency of BNCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YF carried out the experiments in the study and drafted the manuscript.
