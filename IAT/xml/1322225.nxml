The responsible mutation was recently revealed to be an eleven base pair deletion, leading to a frame shift, in the gene encoding the potassium channel Kv1.1. The predicted MCEPH protein is truncated at amino acid 230 out of 495. Truncated proteins are usually not expressed since nonsense mRNAs are most often degraded. However, high <italic>Kv1.1 </italic>mRNA levels in <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>brain indicated that it escaped this control mechanism. Therefore, we hypothesized that the truncated Kv1.1 would be expressed and dysregulate other Kv1 subunits in the <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that the MCEPH protein is expressed in the brain of <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice. MCEPH was found to lack mature (Golgi) glycosylation, but to be core glycosylated and trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interactions between MCEPH and other Kv1 subunits were studied in cell culture, <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes and the brain. MCEPH can form tetramers with Kv1.1 in cell culture and has a dominant negative effect on Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 currents in oocytes. However, it does not retain Kv1.2 in the ER of neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>megencephaly </italic>mice express a truncated Kv1.1 in the brain, and constitute a unique tool to study Kv1.1 trafficking relevant for understanding epilepsy, ataxia and pathologic brain overgrowth.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The megencephaly mice (BALB/cByJ-<italic>Kv1.1</italic><sup><italic>mceph</italic>/<italic>mceph</italic></sup>, here denoted <italic>mceph/mceph</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] have an 11 base pair deletion in the <italic>Shaker</italic>-like voltage-gated potassium channel subunit <italic>Kv1.1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This mutation causes progressive postnatal complex partial seizures and a unique pathologic brain overgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The enlargement is not uniform but restricted to the hippocampus and ventral cortex, with 28% and 72% larger area compared to wildtype at 12 weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The enlargement is in part due to that the numbers of both neurons and glia cells are dramatically increased in the hippocampus which is caused by increased proliferation and/or reduced apoptosis (Almgren et al, unpublished).</p><p>The 11 base pair deletion in Kv1.1 leads to a frame shift and a premature stop codon. The predicted truncated Kv1.1 protein (MCEPH) will retain only the N-terminal (T1) domain, the first transmembrane domain (S1) and the first extracellular loop. Voltage gated potassium channels form a diverse group of membrane proteins, regulating membrane potential, neuronal excitability and nerve signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The channels are hetero- or homotetramers, formed by a great variety of subunits, classified in 12 subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Kv1.1 belongs to the Kv1 subfamily, consisting of eight members (Kv1.1 to Kv1.8). Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 are the most abundant Kv1 subunits expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although the heteromeric structure means that a very large number of K channels can be formed in theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the composition of the heteromultimers in the mammalian brain seems to be precisely regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A direct link between potassium channel dysfunction and apoptosis is that reduced intracellular potassium levels appear to promote critical events early in the suicide program. Treatment with potassium channel blockers have been shown to block apoptosis in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, neither <italic>Kv1.1 </italic>mutations, the Kv1.1 null mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] nor other epileptic models have previously been associated with pathologic brain overgrowth. Therefore, we hypothesized that the truncated Kv1.1 would be expressed and dysregulate other Kv1 subunits in the <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice.</p><p>Truncated proteins are usually not expressed. This is because mRNAs with a premature stop codon are degraded through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. One exception to this is genes with no introns such as the <italic>Kv1 </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization have shown that there is no decay but instead an increased expression of <italic>Kv1.1 </italic>mRNA in the hippocampus, cortex and ventral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that MCEPH is expressed.</p><p>In humans <italic>Kv1.1 </italic>point mutations are reported in patients with the autosomal dominant disorder episodic ataxia type1 (EA1), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Most are missense mutations but there is one report of a premature stop codon, resulting in a Kv1.1 protein that is truncated in the C-terminal (Kv1.1&#x00394;C79). The patient carrying this mutation suffers from a drug resistant form of EA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Truncated Kv1.1 channels have previously been studied in cell culture and <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes. When the Kv1.1&#x00394;C79 protein is expressed in cell culture it is trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, full length Kv1.1 in cell culture is also retained in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Another experimental Kv1.1 protein truncated in the extracellular loop between S1 and S2 is able to assemble with full length Kv1.5 subunits in cell culture and the resulting complexes are trapped in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes both the N- and C-terminal truncated Kv1.1 variants have a dominant negative effect on currents when coinjected with full length Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Knowing if the MCEPH protein is expressed and how it interacts with other Kv1 subunits would provide further understanding of Kv1 trafficking and clues to the downstream effects seen in the <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice.</p><p>In this paper we show that a truncated Kv1.1 protein, MCEPH is expressed in the brain of the <italic>megencephaly </italic>mouse. The truncated protein is trapped in the ER and does not reach the plasma membrane of neurons. MCEPH has the ability to form multimers with Kv1.1. It has a dominant negative effect on Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 currents in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes, but in the brain it does not appear to retain Kv1.2 in the ER.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Antibody characterization</title><p>A polyclonal antiserum was produced by immunization of rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 4 to 27 of Kv1.1. The N-terminal epitope was necessary to be able to detect the truncated MCEPH protein. Western blot on brain lysate from wild type mice using the antiserum showed a strong band at 86 kDa but also several weaker bands. The 86 kDa band had the same size as that detected by the previously characterized monoclonal antibody against a C-terminal epitope of Kv1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Preimmune serum did not recognize the 86 kDa band but showed the same weaker bands as the antiserum. The antiserum was affinity purified against the peptide used for immunization which reduced the number of unspecific bands significantly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> panel A). Preincubation of the affinity purified antibody with the peptide used for immunization absorbed the signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> panel B). The purified Kv1.1 N-terminal antibody was used for all further experiments.</p><p>In immunblotting of lysate from Kv1.1 null mice an 86 kDa band was present but at a lower intensity than in wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel A). Since the null mouse does not have any Kv1.1 protein this means that the antibody cross reacts with another protein. Kv1 subunits have a high degree of similarity so it is likely that the antibody recognizes another Kv1 subunit. The peptide used for immunization share a stretch of six amino acids with Kv1.2. Both Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 are expressed in the brain as mature glycoproteins that are reported to be 86 and 88 kDa, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The shared amino acids and the size of the band makes Kv1.2 the likely candidate for the cross reactivity.</p><p>Acetone post fixed wild type and Kv1.1-null brains were used for immunohistochemistry. In wild type the staining resembled Kv1.1 but the background was high. The pattern in Kv1.1 null brain was very similar to wild type, indicating cross reactivity (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed wild type brain sections showed the same staining pattern that previously has been reported for Kv1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the hippocampus the immunoreactivity was mainly localized in the fiber networks in the middle part of the molecular layer, in the hilus and the pyramidal cell layer of CA3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel A). When formalin fixed tissue was used the pattern in Kv1.1 null was changed and clearly distinguishable from wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel B).</p><p>The conclusion is that the antibody recognizes Kv1.1. It is cross reactive when used for immunoblotting but this is greatly reduced when used for immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>MCEPH expression in the brain</title><p>The 11 bp deletion in <italic>Kv1.1 </italic>in <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice leads to a premature stop codon. The predicted truncated protein, MCEPH, has a calculated weight of 27 kDa. To determine if MCEPH is expressed in the brain the polyclonal Kv1.1 N-terminal antibody was used for immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Immunoblotting showed a band at approximately 30 kDa in brain lysate from <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel C). The intensity of the band was much lower than that of the Kv1.1 protein in wild type mice suggesting a low expression of the truncated protein. The <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice do not have any full length Kv1.1 but, like the Kv1.1 null mice, they have the 86 kDa cross reactivity-caused band. However, the 30 kDa band was only present in <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice. No other band specific for <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>was detected.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin fixed <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice brain sections. Interestingly, in <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>there was staining only around the nuclei of cells, and no staining in fibers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel C and D). There was some background staining resembling that of the Kv1.1 null mouse but the overall pattern was significantly different. The main areas with MCEPH immunoreactivity were the hippocampus and ventral cortex. In the other areas examined there were only a few stained cell bodies. In the hippocampus MCEPH was expressed in neurons in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and in CA3. This pattern is in agreement with the previously reported mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Taken together, the immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry results show that MCEPH is expressed in the brain of the <italic>megencephaly </italic>mouse.</p></sec><sec><title>Trafficking of MCEPH</title><p>Kv1.1 has a single N-glycosylation site on the extracellular loop between S1 and S2 and is expressed on the plasma membrane as a mature glycoprotein. This glycosylation site is preserved in MCEPH which makes it possible to study the trafficking of MCEPH by analyzing its glycosylation pattern. Glycosylation starts in the ER where a high mannose carbohydrate is transferred to an asparagine residue. This carbohydrate can be cleaved off by the glycosidases EndoH and PNGaseF. Next, the protein is transported to the Golgi where the carbohydrate is modified and becomes resistant to EndoH but not to PNGaseF. This is used as a marker for ER to Golgi transport.</p><p>To investigate the glycosylation status, brain lysates from wild type and <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice were treated with the enzymes EndoH and PNGaseF and analyzed with immunoblotting. For Kv1.1 in wild type mice EndoH did not affect the size of the 86 kDa band but PNGaseF reduced it with approximately 20 kDa. This is in agreement with other studies that have shown that the 86 kDa band is the mature glycosylated form of Kv1.1 expressed in the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both EndoH and PNGaseF reduced the apparent molecular weight of MCEPH with approximately 3 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This strongly indicates that MCEPH is core glycosylated in the ER but not transported to the Golgi. Neither mature nor unglycosylated MCEPH was detected in the brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions of MCEPH</title><p>Kv1 channels are tetramers and the assembly of the Kv1 subunits takes place in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. MCEPH contains the N-terminal tetramerization domain and might thus bind other Kv1 subunits.</p><sec><title>Interactions with Kv1.2 in the brain</title><p>Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 are often associated in the same channels in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have previously reported a disturbance in the expression of Kv1.2 in the <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To investigate if this disturbance could be caused by an interaction between MCEPH and Kv1.2, immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting was performed on brain lysate from wild type, Kv1.1 null and <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice. The monoclonal Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 antibodies each precipitated both Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 in wild type brain, verifying that correct experimental procedures were used. As a control the same antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation of lysate from Kv1.1 null brain. As expected, in the Kv1.1 null lysate no Kv1.1 coprecipitated with Kv1.2. Also, when the Kv1.1 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation neither Kv1.1 nor Kv1.2 was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> panel A). The Kv1.1-N-terminal antibody precipitated Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 in wild type but also Kv1.2 in Kv1.1 null lysate. This means that it is not specific when used for immunoprecipitation. For <italic>mceph/mceph</italic>, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Kv1.2 whereas the Kv1.1-N-terminal antibody was used for immunoblotting. With this approach it was not possible to detect any MCEPH co-precipitating with Kv1.2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> panel B). This suggests that there is no persistent interaction between Kv1.2 and MCEPH in the brain.</p><p>On Western blots, Kv1.2 in brain appears as two bands at 60 and 88 kDa representing core and mature glycosylated form, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. If MCEPH binds and traps Kv1.2 in the ER, the amount of core glycosylated Kv1.2 would be expected to increase and the mature glycosylated form decrease. Immunoblotting was performed on lysates from both whole brains and isolated hippocampi. The hippocampus was investigated since MCEPH is expressed primarily in this brain region. Most of the Kv1.2 protein in the hippocampus had mature glycosylation and there was only a very small amount of core glycosylated protein. No difference in Kv1.2 core glycosylation was seen between wild type and <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>in neither whole brain nor hippocampus lysate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> panel C). When the immunoprecipitation and glycosylation data is combined it appears that MCEPH does not retain Kv1.2 in the ER in brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions with Kv1.1 in HEK293 cells</title><p>To test if MCEPH can form multimers its ability to interact with wild type Kv1.1 was investigated by overexpression in cell culture. This system was chosen to allow higher expression levels and easier detection. For this experiment Kv1.1 and MCEPH were cloned into the vectors pZsGreen and pDsRed2 to construct fluorescent fusion proteins. HEK293A cells were transfected with the MCEPH-ZsGreen and the Kv1.1-DsRed constructs together or separately and analyzed 48 hours after transfection. The green and the red fluorescent signals were colocalized around the cell nucleus (data not shown). No staining was observed on the plasma membrane. Western blot with the polyclonal Kv1.1 N-terminal antibody on lysate from cotransfected HEK293 cells showed bands at 55 and 85 kDa corresponding to the MCEPH and Kv1.1 fusion proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> panel D). Corresponding bands were found in cells transfected with single constructs which confirmed the identity of the bands. To investigate the interaction between MCEPH and Kv1.1, immunoprecipitation was performed on cell lysate from cotransfected cells using the monoclonal Kv1.1 C-terminal antibody. Immunoblotting with the polyclonal Kv1.1 N-terminal antibody detected the MCEPH-ZsGreen fusion protein as well as the Kv1.1-DsRed fusion protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> panel D). Since the C-terminal Kv1.1 antibody is specific for wild type Kv1.1 the detected MCEPH protein was associated with the Kv1.1 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions with Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 in Xenopus oocytes</title><p>To further investigate the ability of MCEPH to interact with Kv1 subunits we chose to analyze the effects of expressing MCEPH in combination with Kv1.2 or Kv1.3 in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref> shows the Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 currents associated with a series of voltage steps, followed by a step to +30 mV. Both channels show delayed rectifier behaviour and lack fast inactivation. Kv1.3, however, shows a marked slow inactivation.</p><p>MCEPH was found to reduce the expression of both Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 in the plasma membrane. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref> shows the mean results of injecting <italic>mceph </italic>mRNA together with <italic>Kv1.2 </italic>or <italic>Kv1.3 </italic>mRNA (in equal amounts) given as the effect on peak conductance versus voltage curves (i.e activation curves). As seen, the curves for Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 are down-scaled by about 50 and 60%, respectively, without marked changes in slope or midpoint value. The MCEPH shift of the Kv1.3 activation curve was slightly bigger than that of Kv1.2 (-6 mV vs. +2 mV; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The activation time course of the currents associated with voltage steps was negligibly affected by MCEPH, reflected in the unaffected time to peak current at +50 mV for both Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Similar effects were observed for the MCEPH effect on the slow inactivation kinetics. Mean inactivation versus voltage curves, measured from the peak current associated with the second pulse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>) are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>. The MCEPH shift of the Kv1.3 inactivation curve was slightly bigger than that of Kv1.2 (-5 mV vs. -1 mV; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the measurements show that MCEPH has a dominant negative effect on both Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 channel expression in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes. Furthermore, the small effects on activation and inactivation kinetics suggest that MCEPH does not form functional channel complexes with Kv1.2 or Kv1.3 subunits in the plasma membrane. Heteromeric complexes involving MCEPH subunits are expected to drastically affect channel kinetics.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we show that <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice express a truncated Kv1.1, MCEPH. The MCEPH protein is expressed in neurons throughout the brain but is trapped in the ER. MCEPH is able to bind full length Kv1.1 in cell culture and has a dominant negative effect when coexpressed with Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes. In contrast, in the brain MCEPH does not appear to retain Kv1.2 in the ER.</p><p>To be able to detect the truncated MCEPH protein an antibody against the N-terminal part of Kv1.1 was generated. Immunoblotting on brain lysate from <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice showed a band that has the same size as the predicted MCEPH protein, approximately 30 kDa. This band is present in all <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>brains studied but not in any wild type or Kv1.1 null mice. Based on this we conclude that MCEPH is expressed in the brain of the <italic>megencephaly </italic>mouse.</p><p>Kv1.1 in the brain is a mature glycoprotein that is mostly localized to axons and nerve terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Truncated Kv1.1 variants have previously been shown to be retained in the ER in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The draw back of these studies is that full length Kv1.1 homomers in cell culture is also largely retained in the ER since they are undetectable at the cell surface by immunohistochemical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] but detectable at low levels with electrophysiological methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Lack of surface expression was seen by us both in HEK293 cells and in the neuron-like cell line PC12 (data not shown). The reason is a strong ER retention motif in the pore region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mouse provides an opportunity to study the trafficking of a truncated Kv1.1 in neurons. Both EndoH and PNGaseF treatment reduced the molecular weight of MCEPH by approximately 3 kDa, suggesting that the protein is core glycosylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We detected neither maturely glycosylated nor unglycosylated MCEPH. The glycosylation data suggest that MCEPH is trapped in the ER and not further transported. This is supported by immunohistochemistry experiments were MCEPH immunoreactivity surrounds the nuclei in an ER-like pattern. There is no immunoreactivity in fibers consistent with the lack of mature glycosylated MCEPH. The low amount of MCEPH protein detected with immunoblotting compared to the high levels of mRNA suggests that the MCEPH protein is rapidly degraded. This is most likely due to ER-associated degradation (ERAD), a quality control mechanism in the ER that recognizes misfolded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These proteins are retro-translocated to the cytosol and degraded by proteasomes.</p><p>We have previously seen disturbances of staining pattern of Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 in the <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>hippocampus, which was not due to transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Previous studies of other truncated K1.1 variants have shown that they have a dominant negative effect in oocytes and form oligomers with full length Kv1 subunits in cell culture. We hypothesized that MCEPH interacts with Kv1 subunits and causes the expression disturbance possibly by retaining these subunits in the ER. Kv1.1 often forms heterotetramers with Kv1.2 subunits in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, we found no evidence for a persistent interaction between MCEPH and Kv1.2 in the brain, suggesting that there is no retention of Kv1.2 in the ER. However, we found MCEPH to be able to oligomerize when expressed in HEK293 cells. Moreover, electrophysiological measurements on <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes showed that MCEPH reduces both Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 currents, suggesting interaction between MCEPH and Kv1 subunits in this cell type. This indicates that the lack of ER retention seen for Kv1.2 in the brain is not caused by an inability of MCEPH to form multimers</p><p>It can be assumed that lack of Kv1.1 could lead to defect trafficking of Kv1 channels. This is not the case since the Kv1.1 null mouse has normal expression of Kv1.2 in the hippocampus (data not shown) and also the cerebellum and sciatic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. One possibility is that the Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 expression disturbances in <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>hippocampus are related to the growth. The <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>hippocampus is significantly enlarged and has an increased amount of neurons (unpublished data). This could lead to disturbed organization of the dendritic trees and give rise to the abnormal expression patterns. Also, since MCEPH contains the N-terminal T1 domain, which has been shown to mediate beta subunit association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], it is possible that MCEPH sequesters these auxiliary subunits within the ER and prevents them from forming complexes with Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 in <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>mice. Beta subunit association has been shown to promote Kv1 trafficking to the cell surface as well as to cause axonal targeting of Kv1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>megencephaly </italic>mouse is not a model for any known human disease. Still, it provides a unique tool to study Kv1 channels in the brain. The EA1 mutation R417Stop gives rise to a Kv1.1 protein that lacks the final 79 amino acids in the C-terminal domain (Kv1.1&#x00394;C79). The Kv1.1&#x00394;C79 protein and MCEPH have some similarities but there are major differences. Both truncated proteins have a dominant negative effect in oocytes and can assemble with full length subunits in cell culture. For the Kv1.1&#x00394;C79, change in current kinetics when coinjected with Kv1.1 in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes indicates that some channels containing truncated subunits can reach the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This is not seen for MCEPH which is most likely due to the difference in length. Kv1.1&#x00394;C79 might evade the rapid degradation by cellular control mechanisms since most of the protein remains. The truncated protein can then cause more damage by retaining subunits or by forming defect channels. This is supported by the inheritance patterns. The R417Stop mutation is dominant which suggests a new function for the truncated protein, while <italic>mceph </italic>is recessive, which indicates a loss of function.</p><p>The mechanism behind the brain growth in <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>is still unknown. We now know that MCEPH is expressed in the brain, but we do not know if it is MCEPH or lack of functional Kv1.1 that is responsible for the overgrowth. The Kv1.1 null mouse has not been reported to have an enlarged brain which suggests that MCEPH has an effect. However, the low levels of protein and recessive inheritance indicates that the <italic>mceph </italic>mutation causes a loss of function of Kv1.1. In line with both scenarios, it was previously shown that potassium channel dysfunction appears to reduce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which might contribute to the overgrowth of the <italic>mceph/mceph </italic>brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>For the first time we report the expression of a truncated Kv1.1 protein in brain. This protein is trapped within ER and has the ability to interact with Kv1 subunits. The <italic>megencephaly </italic>mice, where the protein is expressed, constitute a tool to study Kv1.1 trafficking relevant for understanding epilepsy, ataxia and pathologic brain overgrowth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><sec><title>Primary antibodies</title><p>A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal of Kv1.1 was generated using a synthetic peptide (CMSGENADEASTAPGHPQDGSYPRQ) corresponding to amino acids 4&#x02013;27.

The relative levels of the two fusion proteins in this overepressing cell system cannot be used to quantitate MCEPH expression or stability in brain since regulation and trafficking is known to be different between these two systems. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with the Kv1.1 C-terminal antibody. In the precipitate, both fusion proteins were detected with the Kv1.1 N-terminal antibody (IP).
