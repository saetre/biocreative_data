However, techniques for mapping suppressor mutations are not available for most bacterial species. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify spontaneously arising suppressor mutations that enabled disruption of <italic>rpoE</italic> (which encodes &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>) in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, the agent of cholera. The alternative sigma factor &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, which is activated by envelope stress, promotes expression of factors that help preserve and/or restore cell envelope integrity. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>rpoE</italic> is an essential gene that can only be disrupted in the presence of additional suppressor mutations. Among a panel of independent <italic>V. cholerae rpoE</italic> mutants, more than 75% contain suppressor mutations that reduce production of OmpU, <italic>V. cholerae&#x02019;s</italic> principal outer membrane porin. OmpU appears to be a key determinant of <italic>V. cholerae&#x02019;s</italic> requirement for and production of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>. Such dependence upon a single factor contrasts markedly with regulation of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic>, in which numerous factors contribute to its activation and none is dominant. We also identified a suppressor mutation that differs from all previously described suppressors in that it elevates, rather than reduces, &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>&#x02019;s activity. Finally, analyses of a panel of <italic>rpoE</italic> mutants shed light on the mechanisms by which suppressor mutations may arise in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The alternative sigma factor &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> (also known as RpoE) is one of several regulators that enable bacteria to respond to perturbation of the cell envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In unstressed growing cells, &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> activity is relatively low, as it is tethered to the bacterial inner membrane by the antisigma factor RseA, and hence cannot interact with RNA polymerase to direct transcription from &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, if misfolded outer membrane proteins (OMPs) accumulate within the periplasm, they trigger the degradation of RseA and release of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, thereby allowing increased expression of the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon, which includes genes encoding periplasmic proteases, foldases and chaperones that aid in periplasmic folding, as well as <italic>rpoE</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). Activation of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> also induces transcription of several small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) that repress production of OMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Heightened expression of these factors is thought to aid in elimination of the inducing stimulus and restoration of envelope homeostasis. &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> activity is also induced as cells enter stationary phase. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, this response has been shown to be dependent upon the alarmone ppGpp, which typically accumulates when nutrients are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>&#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is classically thought of as regulating a stress response; however, it has been found to be essential for viability in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, suggesting that it plays a more fundamental role in bacterial physiology as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> was not initially recognized to be essential in <italic>E. coli</italic>, both because suppressor mutations can mask this phenotype and because the growth (or lack thereof) of <italic>E. coli rpoE</italic> mutants is highly dependent upon the selective criteria employed. However, comparisons of independently derived <italic>E. coli rpoE</italic> mutants suggested that these strains might contain suppressor mutations, and several suppressors have been identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). These include a loss of function mutation in <italic>ydcQ</italic>, which encodes a putative DNA-binding protein, and multicopy plasmids containing <italic>ptsN</italic> or <italic>yhbW</italic>. Little is known about the mechanisms by which these suppressors function; however, it has been observed that all the suppressors reduce basal activity of other envelope stress response pathways as well. Somewhat surprisingly, suppressors that counteract <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02019;s requirement for the proteases RseP and DegS, which are needed for degradation of RseA and thus for activation of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> in response to periplasmic stresses, did not also function as suppressors for <italic>rpoE</italic> mutations. For example, when production of OmpA and OmpC is reduced, either via deletion of both genes or via overexpression of RseX, an sRNA that negatively regulates them, <italic>degS</italic> and <italic>rseP</italic> are no longer essential; however, <italic>rpoE</italic> is still required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This may reflect the fact that several pathways have been shown to activate &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Studies of <italic>rpoE</italic> in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, the etiologic agent of cholera, have not directly addressed whether <italic>rpoE</italic> is essential or whether <italic>rpoE</italic> mutants contain suppressor mutations. As with early studies of <italic>rpoE</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the ability to generate <italic>rpoE</italic> mutants may have led to the assumption that the gene is not required, without consideration of the possibility of suppressors. In <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, <italic>rpoE</italic> has been shown to be required for intestinal colonization in an animal model of disease and for resistance to an antimicrobial peptide, and likely members of the regulon have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). Furthermore, we have found that expression of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is reduced in the absence of OmpU, an abundant outer membrane protein in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> whose expression is controlled by the key virulence regulator ToxR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, many aspects of the biology of <italic>rpoE</italic> mutants remain to be explored, and phenotypic comparisons of independently derived mutants have not been reported.</p><p>Identification of suppressor mutations can be hampered by a lack of scorable/selectable phenotypes and/or of tools for genetic mapping. In <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, there are currently no robust genetic tools for mapping spontaneous suppressor mutations. However, the recent development of massively parallel sequencing technology provides a potential path around these experimental barriers. This technology enables generation of high coverage genomic sequence data at a cost that permits analysis of multiple samples, and hence allows for direct identification of differences between the DNA sequences of related strains. The approach is ideally suited for unbiased identification of genetic changes, particularly if multiple changes with interdependent effects are present within a single strain [e.g. as observed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>)], since such effects might be missed in phenotypic assays of individual changes.</p><p>We generated and characterized a set of <italic>V. cholerae rpoE</italic> mutants and found that they displayed a range of phenotypes, consistent with the possibility that they might contain distinct suppressor mutations. Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified several differences between wt and <italic>rpoE</italic> strains that were subsequently confirmed to be suppressor mutations. Remarkably, the majority of strains that lacked &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> contained additional mutations that reduced expression of <italic>V. cholerae&#x02019;s</italic> major OMP, OmpU. An <italic>ompU</italic>-independent suppression pathway was also identified, which, unlike other <italic>rpoE</italic> suppressors, elevated the basal activity of this envelope stress response pathway. Overall, our data suggest that a key role for &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is to respond to an endogenously generated stimulus transmitted from OmpU. They also shed light on the mechanisms used by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to maintain appropriate OMP expression, and upon the mechanisms by which suppressor mutations may arise in this organism. Finally, our results illustrate the utility of high-throughput sequencing technology in carrying out a genomics-based approach to suppressor genetics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>All <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains generated for this study are derivatives of the sequenced clinical isolate N16961 and are resistant to streptomycin. For analysis of <italic>rpoE</italic> production by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lacking various OMPs, transposon insertion mutants derived from C6706 were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). A related mutant with an insertion in <italic>vca0199</italic> was also used, both with the KnR transposon still present (BD2034) and with the majority of the transposon excised by flippase (BD2041). Transposons were also excised from a subset of the C6706 OMP mutants, namely those in which the transposon &#x02018;scar&#x02019; remaining after excision contained a stop codon to prevent production of the full length gene product. Removal of the transposon, which contains <italic>lacZ</italic>, was necessary prior to monitoring <italic>rpoE::lacZ</italic> activity. C6706 &#x00394;<italic>toxRS</italic> was obtained from JJ Mekalanos. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains DH5&#x003b1;&#x003bb;pir and SM10&#x003bb;pir were used for cloning and conjugation of suicide vectors, respectively.

Negative selection against strains containing <italic>sacB</italic> was performed on plates containing 10% sucrose at 30&#x000b0;C.

Integration of this vector, via a single crossover event within the <italic>rpoE</italic>-derived sequence, results in gene disruption and confers carbenicillin resistance. Exconjugates were selected on plates containing streptomycin and carbenicillin. When primary exconjugates gave rise to colonies of varied sizes upon restreaking, which occurred for at least 90% of exconjugants, large colonies were selected for further analysis, in order to minimize analyses of mixed populations. Strains with insertion mutations in <italic>ompS</italic> and <italic>ompT</italic> were generated using pBD1664 and pBD1665, which contain internal gene fragments of 451 and 382 bp, respectively.</p><p>All allele replacements were generated using vectors derived from the suicide vector pCVD442, using standard allele exchange procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In brief, the targeting vector, which confers carbenicillin resistance, was transferred by conjugation to a <italic>V. cholerae</italic> recipient, where it integrated. Primary exconjugants (selected on plates containing streptomycin and carbenicillin) were then subjected to counterselection on sucrose plates to identify strains that no longer contained the plasmid backbone, and further screened via PCR to identify strains containing the mutation of interest. Strains containing deletions within <italic>rpoE</italic> were generated using pBD1578, which introduces a 342-bp deletion. Strains in which <italic>rpoE</italic> was replaced by an <italic>rpoE::aph</italic> allele were generated using pBD1999, in which <italic>rpoE</italic> is interrupted by insertion of an <italic>aph</italic> gene cassette from pUC71K. Mutants were selected on plates containing kanamycin as well as sucrose. (Primary selection on plates containing sucrose alone, followed by patching to plates containing kanamycin, led to similar conclusions.) Point mutations in <italic>vca0199, vc2413</italic> and the <italic>ompU</italic> (<italic>vc0633</italic>) promoter and 5&#x02032;UTR were introduced using plasmids pBD2038, pBD2036, pBD2049 and pBD2088, respectively.

MAQ was primarily used for identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but also enabled detection of some single-nucleotide insertions and deletions in regions with extended mononucleotide tracts. The consensus sequence obtained for <italic>rpoE</italic> mutants was compared to a control sequence from the wt progenitor and to the published <italic>V. cholerae</italic> N16961 sequence, thereby enabling identification both of mutant-specific SNPs and SNPs distinguishing our isolate from the published genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).

However, some of our strategies for generating <italic>rpoE</italic> mutants had failed, while others seemed to have only a low frequency of success. Furthermore, we noted that the two published mutants did not share all phenotypes (e.g. EtOH sensitivity), suggesting that they might have acquired distinct suppressor mutations. Thus, although <italic>V. cholerae rpoE</italic> had not previously been reported to be essential, we undertook a systematic characterization of <italic>V. cholerae rpoE</italic> mutants and their potential suppressor mutations.</p><p>We first assessed the frequency of obtaining insertion mutants following conjugation of suicide vectors containing either an internal fragment of <italic>rpoE</italic> or a control gene (<italic>ompS</italic> or <italic>ompT</italic>), along with the selectable marker <italic>bla.</italic> Carbenicillin resistant (carbR) mutants of <italic>rpoE</italic>, <italic>ompS</italic> and <italic>ompT</italic> were obtained with approximately equal frequencies, suggesting that these <italic>rpoE</italic> mutants could arise in the absence of any suppressor mutations. However, we noticed that the initial selection for <italic>rpoE</italic> mutants routinely yielded smaller colonies than for the control genes, and that upon restreaking these colonies typically yielded a mixture of large and small colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Further characterization of the mutants revealed that they could be grouped into distinct classes. Mutants could be distinguished by their levels of OMP expression, their colony size and morphology, and their ability to grow on plates containing detergents. Together, these results suggested that our carbR <italic>rpoE</italic> insertion mutants frequently acquired at least one of several additional mutations that suppressed the small colony phenotype of an <italic>rpoE</italic> mutant and enabled more rapid growth. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>An <italic>rpoE</italic> insertion mutant restreaked on plates containing Sm and Carb following the primary selection.

Mutants in which <italic>rpoE</italic> was replaced by <italic>rpoE::aph</italic> could not be obtained. Thus, <italic>rpoE</italic> appeared to be essential for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> growth under the selection conditions for <italic>rpoE::aph</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of candidate suppressor mutations</title><p>To identify the putative suppressor mutations in <italic>V. cholerae rpoE</italic> mutants, we took advantage of newly developed massively parallel sequencing technology. Whole genome sequencing of DNA from a subset of insertion mutants and deletion mutants as well as from wt <italic>V. cholerae</italic> N16961, from which the mutants were derived, was performed on the Solexa Genome Analyzer. This approach yielded an average of 2.8 million 36-nt sequence reads per sample (range of 1.2&#x02013;4.0 million). Sequences were subsequently mapped to the published <italic>V. cholerae</italic> N16961 genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) using the freely available software MAQ [Mapping and Assembly with Qualities; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://maq.sourceforge.net/index.shtml">http://maq.sourceforge.net/index.shtml</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>)]. MAQ uses the Solexa nucleotide sequences and their associated quality scores (which reflect the confidence with which each nucleotide within a 36-mer was called by the Genome Analyzer) to predict SNPs, positions where the sequenced sample differs from the reference genome. MAQ also calculates its own consensus quality score for these potential SNPs. An average of 88% of the Solexa sequences could be mapped to the reference genome. Numerous potential SNPs were identified; however, most were identified as candidate SNPs in wt as well as <italic>rpoE</italic> mutant samples (and thus correspond to differences between our strain and the published sequence) or had relatively low consensus quality scores. Based on visual inspection of sequence alignments (using MAQ&#x02019;s companion program, MAQview) as well as Sanger sequencing of some candidate loci, we determined that candidate SNPs with consensus quality scores of less than 50 were likely to be false. Removing these loci from the list of mutant-specific candidates left a relatively small number of candidates, suitable for confirmation using Sanger sequencing and/or elimination via visual inspection of aligned reads. Through this process we verified the presence of five candidate suppressor mutations, located in the <italic>vca0199</italic> and <italic>vc2413</italic>-coding regions (one each, in strains BD1965 and BD1963 respectively) and in the intergenic region between <italic>vc0633</italic> and <italic>vc0634</italic> (three distinct mutations, in strains BD1962, BD1956 and BD1987). The effects of these mutations are described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of newly sequenced isolates to the published <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome</title><p>Solexa reads were also used as inputs for the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly program Edena [Exact DE Novo Assembler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>)], which generated contigs that could be searched for differences relative to the published <italic>V. cholerae</italic> N16961 sequence using MUMmer. The advantage of this approach is that it performs gapped as well as ungapped alignments, and hence can be used to identify small insertions and deletions, which generally cannot be detected in our data set using MAQ. Disadvantages are that it does not utilize the Solexa quality scores or provide a means to identify high quality versus low quality candidate SNPs, and it requires a greater number of sequences to generate a consensus, often more than we obtained for a single sample. Edena confirmed the presence of most of the candidate suppressors identified using MAQ; however, its principal utility was in identification of differences between our starting strain and the reference strain, for which we pooled all our Solexa sequences to generate the Edena input. With this comprehensive set of sequences, contigs spanning 3.9 million bases, or &#x0003e;88% of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome, could be assembled, and 145 differences between our strains and the reference strain could be identified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp568/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). These included 40 SNPs, most of which had also been predicted by MAQ and 79 small insertions or deletions. A subset of these correspond to loci identified in a recent study as likely errors within the published genomic sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). An approximate position for many of the insertions/deletions could also be obtained by performing BLAST analyses on sequences that could not be mapped by MAQ. This approach can be utilized even if sequence depth does not meet the stringent conditions required by Edena, and hence can be used to search for insertions and deletions in sequence from an individual sample as well as pooled samples.

However, mutations within <italic>vca0199</italic>, which encodes a gene of unknown function, also were found to suppress <italic>V. cholerae&#x02019;s</italic> need for <italic>rpoE.</italic> Unlike the <italic>ompU</italic>-linked suppressors and suppressors of <italic>rpoE</italic> essentiality identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), suppressor mutations within <italic>vca0199</italic> augmented, rather than reduced, &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> activity, suggesting that they diminish the requirement for &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> through a distinct mechanism, perhaps by influencing a process downstream of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> activation. High-throughput genomic sequencing was a crucial tool in the identification of suppressor mutations, particularly the latter class, which could not have been predicted based on previous knowledge of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>&#x02019;s role and regulation in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. The availability of this technology, which continues to improve, should greatly facilitate similar studies in other organisms.</p><p>We previously observed that deletion of <italic>ompU</italic> reduced <italic>V. cholerae&#x02019;s</italic> production of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>; however, the importance of this finding was not recognized at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Our new data highlight the central role played by OmpU as a regulator of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>; indeed, they suggest that one of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>&#x02019;s most critical roles in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> may be to respond to this endogenously generated factor. Even relatively small reductions in OmpU levels have a dramatic effect on the organism's need for, and production of, this sigma factor. It appears a threshold level of OmpU must be present to generate a requirement for &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>; simply reducing <italic>ompU</italic> promoter activity by &#x0223c;60% renders <italic>rpoE</italic> inessential, even though OmpU is still readily detectable. It is also notable that OmpU has a significant influence on activity both during log phase, when much OmpU must be synthesized, and during stationary phase, when OmpU transcript levels are quite low (data not shown). The latter observation raises the possibility that OmpU&#x02019;s activating stimulus is transmitted from previously synthesized, rather than newly generated, protein. Factors may accumulate in the culture medium by late stationary phase that trigger membrane and OMP disruption and thereby reveal the activating motifs that are masked within properly folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Alternatively, exposure of activating domains within OmpU may be coupled to peptidoglycan remodeling during stationary phase, since OmpU has been reported to be associated with this polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). It is also theoretically possible that the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-activating stimulus is not due to OmpU misfolding but instead is a result of OmpU&#x02019;s porin activity, which might enhance transmission of a signal from the culture media into the periplasmic compartment.</p><p>Our study reveals both significant similarities and differences between the role and regulation of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. For both organisms, <italic>rpoE</italic> is absolutely essential under a subset of conditions tested, and no mutants can be derived from wt cells under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Under less stringent selection conditions, mutants can be isolated; however, they have been found to contain additional suppressor mutations. Such suppressor mutations also permit disruption of <italic>rpoE</italic> under the otherwise non-permissive selective conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Deletion of OMP-encoding genes reduces the activity of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> in both <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is also a negative regulator of OMP production in both organisms, although it should be noted that &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> does not appear to influence <italic>V. cholerae&#x02019;s</italic> production of its principal OMP, OmpU, since an <italic>rpoE</italic> mutant that lacks an <italic>ompU</italic>-linked suppressor produces wt amounts of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), and overexpression of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> also did not alter OmpU production (data not shown). A key difference between the species is that no single deletion or combination of deletions of OMP-encoding genes has yet rendered <italic>rpoE</italic> non-essential in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), whereas the absence of a single <italic>V. cholerae</italic> OMP is sufficient to do so. Thus, it appears that the pathways for activation of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> are more limited, and that monitoring and responding to OmpU (mis)folding is of paramount importance. Given that significant activation of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is still detectable in stationary phase cultures of a strain with diminished OmpU, it is quite striking that <italic>rpoE</italic> is no longer essential in these cells.</p><p>Our work provides new evidence that bacteria have developed numerous safeguards to coordinate and balance expression of their OMPs. Excessive OMP accumulation was already known to trigger &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> activity and the resulting transcription of sRNAs that downregulate OMP translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In addition, it has been noted that OMP-encoding sequences are often adjacent to genes encoding negative regulators of other OMPs, suggesting that new OMP-encoding genes can more readily be acquired in conjunction with means for downregulating those that are already present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In this study, we observed that expression of OmpU has a significant negative effect on production of OmpT. It has long been recognized that the genes encoding these proteins respond in opposite fashions to the transcriptional regulator ToxR, and thus that their expression is coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>); however, disruption of <italic>ompU</italic> has not previously been reported to augment OmpT production. It remains to be seen whether this interdependence of OmpU and OmpT production is mediated by OmpU&#x02019;s porin function, by an sRNA that overlaps with or is coordinated with the <italic>ompU</italic> transcript, or by some alternate mechanism.</p><p>Finally, our identification of a panel of suppressor mutations provides clues about the mechanisms by which such suppressors may arise. Two aspects of these suppressor mutations are particularly striking. First, the same suppressor mutations were generated from distinct selection protocols (i.e. growth in the presence of antibiotics versus sucrose), suggesting that the process for suppressor formation is not determined solely by the selection used. Second, most suppressor mutations (11 of 21) were single nucleotide contractions of mononucleotide (A/T) repeats. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, such mutations are characteristic of the error-prone polymerase DinB, which is induced by specific stresses and is associated with temporary formation of a hypermutable state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Although mutation as a stress response has yet to be investigated in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, our data are consistent with the possibility that formation of <italic>rpoE</italic> suppressor mutations may be facilitated by such a response. Transient emergence of a mutator phenotype may thus underlie the high frequency with which suppressors arise (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Such a possibility could be explored by assessing whether factors often needed for formation of stress-linked mutations (e.g. DinB, RpoS and the SOS response) are also required for development of <italic>rpoE</italic> suppressor mutations. Additionally, blocking these processes might permit characterization of the true consequences of <italic>rpoE</italic> disruption, unmodulated by additional genomic changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp568/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp568_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="gkp568_nar-00822-h-2009-File003.xls"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="gkp568_nar-00822-h-2009-File004.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Howard Hughes Medical Institute; <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> [<award-id>AI-42347</award-id> to M.K.W.].
