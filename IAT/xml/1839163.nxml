The tumor-associated virus, Kaposi sarcoma&#x02013;associated herpesvirus, has two distinct phases in its life cycle: inactive latency and active lytic replication. The balance between these two phases is critical for viral pathogenesis. Cellular signals play a role in the switch from latency to lytic replication, termed reactivation. To systematically evaluate the cellular signals regulating this reactivation process in Kaposi sarcoma&#x02013;associated herpesvirus, a genome-wide cDNA library screen was conducted. Twenty-six thousand mammalian genes were individually expressed in cells that harbor the latent virus, and their effect on reactivation was assessed through a sensitive reporter system. A group of diverse cellular signaling proteins were identified and validated. Further analysis revealed that the activation of the cellular Raf/MEK/ERK/Ets-1 pathway is shared by multiple upstream inducers to trigger reactivation. This work provides a functional genomic approach to systematically identify the cellular signals regulating the herpesvirus life cycle, thus facilitating better understanding of a fundamental issue in virology and identifying novel therapeutic targets.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Yu F, Harada JN, Brown HJ, Deng H, Song MJ, et al.

This virus family also includes the Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus (EBV) and murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Herpesviruses have two distinct phases in their life cycle: latency and lytic replication. During latency, the viral genome is replicated by cellular DNA polymerase, and only a few gene products are expressed. One of the advantages of latency is the ability of the virus to evade the host immune responses. After stimulation, the virus can enter the lytic cycle by a reactivation process. Genes that are induced in the lytic phase can be classified as immediate-early genes, early genes, and late genes according to their temporal expression pattern and sensitivity to viral protein synthesis and DNA replication inhibitors. Upon replication of the viral genome by a viral DNA polymerase, viral progeny are produced, frequently resulting in cell death.</p><p>The distinctive features of gamma-herpesviruses include their ability to establish long-term infections in lymphocytes, and their oncogenic potential. EBV is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, and other types of malignancies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. KSHV is associated with Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and some forms of multicentric Castleman disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Viral infection persists predominantly in a latent form in tumor cells. However, lytic replication is believed to play a critical role in tumorigenesis. It is likely that continuous low-level reactivation leads to efficient viral transmission and spread, and subsequently disease development in a subset of the infected cells. Cytokines of both viral and cellular origin produced during lytic replication may provide a favorable environment for the proliferation of infected cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The switch between latency and lytic replication has been actively investigated. KSHV replication and transcription activator (RTA), a protein product encoded mainly by open reading frame (ORF) 50, plays a central role in regulating this switch in KSHV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. In latently infected cells, the expression of RTA is necessary and sufficient to disrupt KSHV latency and trigger the complete lytic replication process. RTA functions as a transcription factor, activating expression of multiple downstream target genes as well as its own gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Among these downstream effector genes is the early viral transcript polyadenylated nuclear RNA (PAN, also called nut-1). PAN is the most abundant transcript made during the lytic cycle, and is directly induced by RTA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b025">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>RTA contains an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal activation domain. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain mediates sequence-specific DNA binding. RTA response elements (RREs) have been identified within several lytic gene promoters, including the PAN, v-IL-6, ORF57, and Kpsn promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b029">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. The RRE within the PAN promoter was incorporated into a highly sensitive luciferase reporter construct named pPAN-69Luc. RTA has also been shown to interact with several transcription modulatory proteins to maximally facilitate lytic gene expression, including CREB-binding protein (CBP), the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and the TRAP/Mediator coactivator, and CSL, a target of the Notch signaling pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.

In an attempt to systematically identify these signals, we carried out a genome-wide cell-based screen utilizing an arrayed cDNA expression library. The screen was conducted in KS-1 cells (a PEL cell line latently infected with KSHV, a twin cell line of BC-3 cell line) in a 384-well format. The pPAN-69Luc reporter construct is highly responsive to RTA and was therefore used as an indicator of KSHV reactivation. The screen assessed the effect of ectopic expression of 26,000 individual cDNA clones on RTA-dependent reporter activity and identified a list of positive cellular genes. We then conducted more extensive analyses on one of the most potent reactivators, Ras, and investigated the signaling components downstream of Ras to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms for reactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Large-Scale Screen with a Reporter System</title><p>To systematically identify the cellular signals that induce RTA activity (and therefore reactivate KSHV), a reporter system was established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030044-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). pPAN-69Luc has low basal activity in the absence of RTA and is highly sensitive to RTA in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030044-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

A very large amount of cDNA was used in the high-throughput screen to increase the sensitivity. Activation of the endogenous RTA promoter on the viral genome by exogenous cDNA gene products would cause a chain of events culminating in luciferase expression from the RTA-dependent pPAN-69Luc reporter.</p><fig id="ppat-0030044-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic Representation and Results of the Primary Screen System</title><p>(A) Overview of the screen approach.

There were only a very limited number of signals detected between these two groups, indicating the significance of the outliers. The signals in the outlier group were considered as positive signals.</p><p>To validate the ability of these cDNA gene products to induce reactivation, we transfected each cDNA individually into KS-1 cells and assessed KSHV lytic gene expression levels by Western blot and reverse transcription&#x02013;quantitative PCR (RT-Q-PCR) analysis.

The verified list contains a number of signaling molecules, either kinases or transcription factors. Among them was a previously identified molecule that reactivates KSHV, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA, &#x0201c;A9&#x0201d;), which was one of the molecules that gave the strongest signal in the screen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

In contrast, when an increasing amount of the inhibitors specific to the Raf/mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK (Raf/MEK/ERK) pathway (PD98059 and U0126) was applied, the induction of K8 expression by Ras was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030044-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

Though it is difficult to compare the robustness of induction by Ras and Raf expression due to different expression levels and induction kinetics of different cDNA constructs, our results clearly showed that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is the main pathway through which Ras exerts its effect on KSHV reactivation.</p><p>To explore the mechanism by which the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway reactivates KSHV, reporter assays were conducted on the RTA promoter in 293T cells.

In 293T cells where there is no endogenous RTA protein, the cotransfection of v-Ki-ras2 with RTA resulted in an enhanced activation of the RTA promoter. This effect was inhibited by U0126 to a level similar to that induced by the RTA protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030044-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), suggesting that RTA and v-Ki-Ras2 activate expression from the RTA promoter by two distinct mechanisms.

Collectively, our reporter assays suggested that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can activate the RTA promoter, which further leads to the activation of downstream lytic genes.

The cause of spontaneous reactivation is not yet clear for any herpesvirus, but it is believed to be important for virus-associated disease pathology and transmission. To more sensitively measure spontaneous reactivation rate, we established a BC-3-based reporter cell line, BC-3-G, with GFP expression driven by the PAN promoter. The PAN promoter is very sensitive and specific to the presence of viral RTA protein, but is not activated at all by other cellular factors, as indicated by a lack of regulation by any of the 26,000 cDNA clones in the genome-wide cDNA screen in the absence of viral RTA activation. Thus, the activation of the PAN promoter in BC-3-G cells serves as a specific indicator of KSHV spontaneous reactivation. KSHV spontaneous reactivation in these cells was assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030044-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We found that upon U0126 treatment, the percentage of GFP-positive cells (gated in the R2 region) was significantly reduced.

In this study, we address this issue directly, utilizing a genome-scale analysis to identify cellular factors that can reactivate endogenous herpesvirus in latently infected B cells. By using this approach, we were able to identify diverse signaling molecules as activators of KSHV reactivation. The effectiveness of this genome-wide analysis was validated by revealing the critical role of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/Ets-1 pathway in mediating signals from the cell surface to the viral genome in the nucleus to reactivate KSHV. This pathway is also crucial for TPA-induced reactivation and spontaneous reactivation.</p><p>Our primary screen was designed to measure the activation of the endogenous RTA promoter, using a reporter generated from a downstream transcriptional target of RTA, PAN. The PAN promoter provides a robust measure for RTA function, and further enabled us to capitalize on three rounds of signal amplification in our screen output: the direct activation of the RTA promoter by the transfected gene product, autoactivation of the RTA promoter by RTA itself, and subsequent transactivation of the PAN promoter by RTA. This substantially increased the sensitivity of our approach, and enabled us to overcome typically low transfection efficiencies observed in the lipid-mediated transfection of lymphoid cells. At the same time, the PAN reporter construct pPAN-69Luc contains only a minimum promoter region (69 base pair) that is very sensitive to RTA expression. This short sequence makes it less likely for other transcription factors to bind to and activate the PAN promoter. Indeed, the cDNA clones identified in our screen did not activate PAN promoter in 293T cells in the absence of the viral genome, as shown for v-Ki-Ras2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030044-g004">Figure 4</xref>C. Our screen identified a wide range of cellular gene products that were able to increase RTA expression and thereby initiate viral reactivation. Defining the consequences of multiple inputs is often too difficult to address using traditional methodologies, but has become a new exciting topic in systems biology. The multiple signals that have been identified in the high-throughput screen, in combination with our sensitive fluorescent/luminescent reporter cell systems, can be utilized to further characterize their combinatory effect. This also forms a unique platform, to which other highly efficient interdisciplinary approaches, such as microfluidic optical and algorithm-based control systems, can be applied to explore viral processes at single cell and population levels.</p><p>In latently infected cells, virus reactivation is thought to be the consequence of a disruption of the &#x0201c;balance&#x0201d; between signaling pathways that induce or suppress virus lytic replication. Our screen system utilizes an ectopic expression strategy to achieve the disruption of the balance of the signaling network, thus exposing the virus to certain pathways that are involved in virus reactivation. One potential limitation of this strategy is that the activation of certain cellular signaling pathways might require post-translational modification of their component molecules, such as phosphorylation or methylation, rather than mere overexpression. Thus, our screen system may not have revealed some of these genes and pathways, or those involved in repressing reactivation. The latter might be discovered by assays such as an siRNA library screen that specifically aims to inhibit endogenous gene expression.</p><p>To validate the biological relevance of our genome-wide screen, we performed detailed analysis of the signaling pathway from Ras to Ets-1. It is known that Ras-related pathways can be activated by a number of extracellular stimuli including growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), as well as immunological cytokines and chemokines. Studies on KSHV have associated some of these stimuli with KSHV infection and Kaposi sarcoma pathogenesis. For example, it has been reported that VEGF-induced Raf activation promotes KSHV entry into cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d; and that inflammatory cytokines can directly modulate KSHV replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, it was shown that ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 induced by KSHV early during de novo infection of target cells are essential for expression of viral genes and for establishment of infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;. Our study directly revealed how Ras-related pathways play a role in herpesvirus reactivation. In both cases, the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway enhances the transcription of the RTA gene. It is biologically rational that the same cellular signaling pathways can induce viral reactivation as well as facilitate herpesvirus de novo infection.</p><p>In the in vitro culturing system, the cells are usually maintained in 10&#x00025;&#x02013;15&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS), where various growth factors and cytokines are present. Some of them are natural activators of certain cellular signaling pathways. Our study reveals an interesting phenomenon in that the intracellular processes can be triggered by further activation of these signaling pathways, and the induction level does not necessarily correlate with the different preexisting activation level of the related signaling components. KSHV-infected cell lines were shown to express a higher level of VEGF-A and B-Raf compared to uninfected cells, but the rate of spontaneous reactivation of latently infected cells is low, with variable levels of B-Raf in different cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. This suggests that KSHV reactivation does not necessarily correlate with the endogenous Ras/Raf activation level, but is most likely balanced by other signaling pathways. We showed that additional activation of Ras could overcome a threshold to induce virus reactivation. Meanwhile, the preexisting Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK activity in the regular culturing condition could be an important factor that contributes to virus spontaneous reactivation, as indicated by a reduced spontaneous reactivation rate when this endogenous activity was inhibited by U0126. The spontaneous reactivation in a small percentage of cells represents cellular variation among &#x0201c;genetically identical cells.&#x0201d; There is no easy way to identify and isolate the cells that will permit virus reactivation before the reactivation actually takes place; thus, it is difficult to define the cellular variation that leads to spontaneous reactivation. It is intriguing that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/Ets-1 signaling pathway identified via the genome-wide screen is critical for spontaneous reactivation as well. The role of this pathway in de novo infection, induced reactivation, and spontaneous reactivation implies that this pathway is an essential pathway selected by the virus to sense environmental cues at different stages of its life cycle.</p><p>The genome-wide screen approach utilized in this study provides an avenue by which the molecular signals regulating herpesvirus reactivation may be systematically identified and studied. The information revealed by the in vitro screen systems could greatly help identify potential physiological stimuli that can be further tested in in vivo studies. For example, the discovery of the role of PKA on KSHV reactivation led to the finding that physiological concentrations of epinephrine/norepinephrine effectively reactivate KSHV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. We also revealed that dopamine and dopamine derivatives can reactivate KSHV through dopamine receptors, which may function upstream of PKA and Ras (unpublished data). Thus, identification of the potential physiological stimuli, facilitated by the large scale screenings, provides a foundation for further verifications in in vivo systems.</p><p>The balance between latency and lytic replication is a fundamental virology question, particularly in the herpesvirus field. A better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the balance between latency and lytic replication may in turn enable the development of a more effective therapeutic strategy to treat KSHV and EBV-associated malignancies. For example, one potential approach to treat KSHV and EBV infection is to reactivate latent virus, followed by gancyclovir or acyclovir treatment to kill cells expressing lytic genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b069">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030044-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d;.
