In support of its role in base excision repair, it was found that XRCC1 forms a tight complex with DNA ligase III&#x003b1; and also interacts with DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol &#x003b2;) and other base excision repair (BER) proteins. We have isolated wild-type XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer and mutated XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; complex that does not interact with Pol &#x003b2; and tested their activities in BER reconstituted with human purified proteins. We find that a point mutation in the XRCC1 protein which disrupts functional interaction with Pol &#x003b2;, affected the ligation efficiency of the mutant XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer in reconstituted BER reactions. We also compared sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide between wild-type CHO-9 cells, XRCC1-deficient EM-C11 cells and EM-C11 cells transfected with empty plasmid vector or with plasmid vector carrying wild-type or mutant XRCC1 gene and find that the plasmid encoding XRCC1 protein, that does not interact with Pol &#x003b2; has reduced ability to rescue the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of XRCC1- deficient cells. These data suggest an important role for the XRCC1&#x02013;Pol &#x003b2; interaction for coordinating the efficiency of the BER process.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Base excision repair (BER) is the major pathway involved in removal of endogenous and mutagen induced DNA damage. This repair process involves a number of sequential reactions initiated by a damage-specific DNA glycosylase that recognizes and removes the damaged base by cleavage of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylic bond connecting the base to the sugar phosphate backbone. The arising apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP site) is recognized by an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) that incises the phosphodiester bond 5&#x02032; next to the AP site, followed by addition of one nucleotide to the 3&#x02032;-OH end of the incised AP site and excision of the base-free sugar phosphate residue by DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol &#x003b2;). Finally, DNA ligase completes repair by sealing the DNA ends (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c1">1</xref>).</p><p>Three major human DNA ligases (DNA ligase I, III&#x003b1; and IV) employ the same basic mechanism for DNA ligation, but participate in distinct biological processes namely DNA replication, BER and nonhomologous end joining, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c2">2</xref>). The mechanism linking DNA ligases to a particular biological process is unclear. It was proposed that other proteins might support functional diversity of the DNA ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c3">3</xref>). Indeed, all of the DNA ligases mentioned above were found in tight complexes with other proteins. DNA ligase I forms a complex with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c4">4</xref>), and DNA ligases III&#x003b1; and IV with X-ray cross complementing protein 1 (XRCC1) and XRCC4, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c7">7</xref>). Mutations in a DNA ligase partner protein frequently leads to genetic instability and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c10">10</xref>) and all attempted knockouts of these genes were embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c11">11</xref>).</p><p>Changes in the XRCC1 gene in characterized mutant cell lines (EM7, EM9, EM-C11 and EM-C12) resulted in undetectable levels of the XRCC1 protein and reduced (3&#x02013;5 fold) levels of its counterpart protein, DNA ligase III&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c13">13</xref>). These changes affect the mutant cells&#x02019; sensitivity to a number of DNA damaging agents including alkylating agents and X-rays, pointing to a deficiency in the BER pathway. Indeed, delayed ligation during BER was demonstrated for XRCC1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c14">14</xref>). Since XRCC1 has no established biological activity, it was suggested that it might serve as a scaffold protein recruiting and positioning other components during BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c16">16</xref>). This idea was further supported by the multiple interactions of human XRCC1 with other BER proteins including Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c17">17</xref>), polynucleotide kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c18">18</xref>), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c19">19</xref>), and APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c20">20</xref>). Although the physiological role of XRCC1&#x02013;PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c22">22</xref>) and XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c23">23</xref>) interactions have been recently demonstrated, there are no such data for other XRCC1 interactions.

To purify XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer, we used EM-C11 cells that contain a G &#x02192; A substitution at nucleotide 1169 in the XRCC1 gene which leads to a C390 &#x02192; Y amino acid change in the protein and is located in the putative functional BRCT1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c13">13</xref>). This mutation results in an undetectable level of XRCC1 protein in these cells (probably due to instability of the mutated protein) and reduced amounts of DNA ligase III&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c13">13</xref>). We stably transfected these cells with wild-type His-tagged XRCC1 and pulled down the XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer using Ni-NTA agarose. Western blot analysis revealed that the pulled down fraction contained both XRCC1 and DNA ligase III&#x003b1; components (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f1">1</xref>A). The complex was also tested and shown to be active in a DNA ligase activity assay with a nicked oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f1">1</xref>C and D). However, since a Coomassie-stained gel of the heterodimer in addition to XRCC1 and DNA ligase III&#x003b1; also contained several background protein bands characteristic for non-specific binding to Ni-NTA agarose, the complex was tested for enzymatic activities that may interfere with BER. We did not find any substantial activity of DNA polymerase, UDG, AP endonuclease or any other nucleases in a reconstituted repair assay (data not shown). In control experiments, no ligase activity could be pulled-down from XRCC1-deficient cells (EM-C11) or HeLa cells containing untagged XRCC1 (data not shown). Marintchev <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c27">27</xref>) have recently characterized a number of XRCC1 point mutations specifically disrupting the interaction of Pol &#x003b2; with the N-terminal domain of XRCC1. To test whether this interaction is important for the activity of the XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer in the BER reaction, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a V86R mutation in a cloned human XRCC1 cDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f2">2</xref>A). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis confirmed that the V86R mutation greatly reduced or ablated the interaction with Pol &#x003b2; <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f2">2</xref>B). This was indicated by the ability of the wild-type protein, but not mutated protein, to activate the histidine and &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter genes in yeast expressing Pol &#x003b2;. The mutation in XRCC1 did not affect the interaction of XRCC1 with DNA ligase III&#x003b1;, however (data not shown).</p><p>Then we stably transfected EM-C11 cells with mutated His-tagged XRCC1 (XRCC1m) pulled down the XRCC1m&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer using Ni-NTA agarose and tested its DNA ligase activity. The V86R mutation did not affect DNA ligase activity and the complex proved to be highly active (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f1">1</xref>D).</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; with Pol &#x003b2; is required for efficient ligation in reconstituted BER</title><p>The potential function of XRCC1 as a scaffold protein has been discussed in a number of papers and the interaction of XRCC1 with Pol &#x003b2; was suggested as a possible molecular basis for such a role (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c28">28</xref>), however this model has not been verified experimentally. To demonstrate that the V86R mutation in XRCC1 protein affects the ability of the mutated XRCC1m&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer to function in BER, we tested its DNA ligase activity and its ability to support BER in a reconstituted repair assay. We reconstituted short-patch repair of uracil in DNA with purified human recombinant proteins including UDG, APE1, Pol &#x003b2; and XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; or mutated XRCC1m&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer. The DNA end-joining activity of the XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer and XRCC1m&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; was initially measured using a single nick-containing oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f1">1</xref>C and D, correspondingly) and an equal amount of activity units was subsequently used in the reconstituted reaction (one unit of DNA ligase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme converting 0.1 pmol of the nicked substrate to full-length product at 37&#x000b0;C within 20 min).</p><p>For repair reactions, a 30mer oligonucleotide duplex containing a single uracil at position 19 was used as a substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f3">3</xref>A). Incubation of the 30mer substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f3">3</xref>B, lane 1) with UDG and APE1 leads to generation of the 18mer labelled product resulting from removal of uracil and incision of the AP site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f3">3</xref>B, lane 2). Pol &#x003b2;, when added to the reaction mixture, continues repair by adding one nucleotide to the 3&#x02032;-end of the incised AP site and simultaneously removing the 5&#x02032;-sugar phosphate, thus generating a substrate for DNA ligase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f3">3</xref>B, lane 3). The XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer stimulated ligation (observed as the 30mer full-length product) and stimulation depended on the amount of the heterodimer added (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f3">3</xref>B and D). In contrast, the equivalent amount (in units of DNA ligase activity) of XRCC1m&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; was about 2&#x02013;3 fold less efficient in reconstituted BER (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f3">3</xref>C and D). We thus concluded that interaction of the XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; complex with Pol &#x003b2; is required for efficient DNA ligation.</p></sec><sec><title>Disruption of XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1;&#x02013;Pol &#x003b2; interaction increases cell sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide</title><p>Finally, to address the biological role of this mutation, we compared sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide between wild-type CHO-9 cells, EM-C11 cells and EM-C11 cells transfected with empty plasmid vector and with plasmid vector carrying wild-type or mutant XRCC1 gene. Western blot analysis revealed that both clones transfected with the plasmid vector containing wild-type or mutated XRCC1 express similar levels of XRCC1, and no XRCC1 was detected in the EM-C11 cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f4">4</xref>B). In a clonogenic survival assay, we found that EM-C11 cells were approximately 2-fold more sensitive to killing by hydrogen peroxide than CHO-9 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f4">4</xref>A) and transfection of the EM-C11 cells with the vector carrying wild-type XRCC1, but not empty vector, completely rescued the EM-C11 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f4">4</xref>B). However, cells carrying mutated XRCC1 remained sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, although not as much as the EM-C11 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f4">4</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Unless BER enzymes are organized in a preassembled DNA repair complex, BER should be a highly coordinated process to avoid accumulation of repair intermediates, since some of them, such as single strand breaks introduced by APE1 during the course of repair, are a major threat to genome integrity and should be repaired promptly. Recently, several groups proposed the so-called &#x02018;passing the baton&#x02019; model for BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c30">30</xref>). According to this model, the complex of a repair protein with damaged DNA formed at one step of the repair is recognized by the enzyme involved in the next step. Thus, a DNA repair intermediate is &#x02018;handed&#x02019; from one repair protein to another without exposure to a cellular milieu. In this model, interactions of XRCC1 protein with other BER proteins were suggested to play an important role. XRCC1 interacts with several enzymes implicated in BER including Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c17">17</xref>), PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c19">19</xref>) and DNA ligase III&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c7">7</xref>). While the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of disrupting the interactions with PARP-1 and DNA ligase III&#x003b1; have been characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c23">23</xref>), the biological importance of the Pol &#x003b2; interaction had not been assessed until now. XRCC1 interacts with the palm-thumb domain of Pol &#x003b2; via its N-terminal domain (NTD) and this interaction is therefore distinct from the sites of interaction with either PARP-1 or DNA ligase III&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c31">31</xref>). Recently, NMR chemical shift mapping of the XRCC1 NTD&#x02013;Pol &#x003b2; interaction interface has identified several key residues involved in this protein&#x02013;protein interaction and their importance has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c32">32</xref>). We selected one of the XRCC1 mutants (V86R) for further study since it has been shown to completely abolish binding of the XRCC1 NTD to Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c27">27</xref>). The mutation is located in the five-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet of the core &#x003b2;-sandwich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c33">33</xref>) and disrupts a key hydrophobic interaction with the Pol &#x003b2; thumb loop without, crucially, affecting the folding of the NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh567c27">27</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we provide direct evidence of a biological role for the interaction of XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; with Pol &#x003b2; by analysing the relative efficiency of wild-type and non-interacting mutant XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer in BER reactions reconstituted with purified human proteins. We first demonstrated that the V86R mutation does not affect the DNA ligase activity of the mutated XRCC1m&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer as measured with a nicked oligonucleotide duplex substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f1">1</xref>). We then used similar amounts of DNA ligase activity in reconstituted BER reactions and found that the XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer, which does not interact with Pol &#x003b2;&#x0002c; has reduced ability to support BER (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f3">3</xref>). We further demonstrated that this reduced ability of mutated heterodimer to function as a DNA ligase in BER is correlated with a reduced ability of the mutated XRCC1 gene to rescue the DNA damage-sensitive phenotype of XRCC1-deficient cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh567f4">4</xref>). Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that interaction of Pol &#x003b2; with XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer plays an important role in cellular defence against DNA damage by supporting efficient BER.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh567f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Isolation and characterization of XRCC1&#x02013;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; heterodimer.
