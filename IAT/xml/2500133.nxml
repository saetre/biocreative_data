We demonstrate that Ku80 is degraded in response to DSBs in a ubiquitin-mediated manner. Strikingly, K48-linked polyubiquitylation, but not proteasomal degradation, is required for the efficient removal of Ku80 from DNA. This removal is DNA length dependent, as Ku80 is retained on duplex oligonucleotides. Finally, NHEJ completion and removal of Ku80 from DNA are independent from one another. We propose that DSB-induced ubiquitylation of Ku80 provides a mechanism to efficiently eliminate Ku from DNA for pre- and postrepair processes.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>A.N.

The cell has two major pathways to repair DSBs: homologous recombination, which requires a homologous copy of the DNA for repair, and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyman and Kanaar, 2006</xref>). The first component of the NHEJ pathway to bind to a DSB is the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, also known as Ku (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Downs and Jackson, 2004</xref>). Upon binding to DNA, Ku recruits the other factors required for NHEJ, including the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), XRCC4, ligase IV, Cernunnos (also known as XLF), and Artemis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wyman and Kanaar, 2006</xref>). These proteins then process the broken DNA and seal the two ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lieber et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to repair of nonprogrammed DSBs, Ku is critical for the VDJ recombination pathway of lymphocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rooney et al., 2004</xref>). Ku80 is essential in human somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2002</xref>), but Ku-deficient mice are viable, though small, and display a severe compromised immunodeficiency phenotype resulting from an inability to process VDJ breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nussenzweig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gu et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Although Ku80 requires Ku70 for binding to DNA, Ku70 may display some weak DNA-binding activity on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chou et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffith et al., 1992</xref>). Consistent with its role as a detector of DSBs, Ku binds linear DNA significantly better than closed supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blier et al., 1993</xref>). Similar to many other proteins involved in DNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hingorani and O'Donnell, 2000</xref>), Ku forms a toroid with a central channel that binds DNA (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spagnolo et al., 2006</xref>). This channel, which makes contacts with B-form DNA, is composed of residues from both subunits of Ku. The channel is thought to be responsible for the heterodimer's recognition of DSBs, as no major structural changes to the ring itself are needed to thread a DNA end through the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walker et al., 2001</xref>). A consequence of this mode of end recognition is that Ku and the DNA will become topologically linked on completion of repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paillard and Strauss, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walker et al., 2001</xref>). Unlike the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen and many other ring-shaped DNA-binding complexes, which can be released from linkage to DNA through conformational changes separating two subunits with adjacent domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hingorani and O'Donnell, 2000</xref>), both subunits of Ku encircle the DNA and form an extended protein&#x02013;protein interdigitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walker et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, the two subunits cannot be separated with a simple conformational change, and a removal mechanism analogous to that of proliferating cell nuclear antigen is unlikely. Instead, if the DNA is to remain unbroken, removal of Ku will require the cleavage or large-scale conformational changes of one or both subunits. Because the channel is completely filled by a single duplex of DNA, removal would be necessary for replication to be completed on the repaired DNA.</p><p>Using <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts, we find that ubiquitylated proteins are specifically enriched on DNA containing a DSB. In addition, Ku80 bound to DSBs is heavily modified by posttranslational modifications that include polyubiquitin. K48-linked polyubiquitylation is required for the damage-dependent proteasomal degradation of Ku80 and its efficient removal from DNA. However, proteasomal degradation is not necessary for Ku80 removal from DNA. The regulation of Ku80 removal from DNA is DNA length dependent, as Ku80 is not efficiently removed from short double-stranded oligos. Through the use of Ku80 truncation and point mutants, we show that although DSB binding is required for Ku80 ubiquitylation and degradation, the ubiquitin-dependent removal and degradation of Ku80 from DNA is independent of the completion of NHEJ. We propose that DNA binding initiates the polyubiquitylation of Ku80, which is required for its removal. We suggest that ubiquitin-dependent dissociation may be a more general mechanism for the removal of DNA-bound proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Polyubiquitylated proteins accumulate at DSBs</title><p>To study processes induced by DSBs, we devised a method to identify proteins accumulated on DNA containing DSBs in <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts. Unless specified, we used extracts arrested at meiotic metaphase II (CSF extracts), which are fully functional for ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation in response to DSBs and for Ku-dependent NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Labhart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo and Dunphy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Virgilio and Gautier, 2005</xref>; unpublished data). Either one end or both ends of a linear 3-kb plasmid were biotinylated and bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Although the former beads leave one DNA end free (single biotin DNA [SB-DNA] beads), both DNA ends of the latter beads (double biotin DNA [DB-DNA] beads) are concealed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left). The DNA of SB-DNA beads resembles a DSB and is rapidly repaired in the CSF extract (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) as judged by the doubling in DNA length. Several proteins preferentially copurified with SB-DNA beads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) revealed that these include previously known DSB-interacting proteins, such as DNA-PKcs, RPA1, Mre11, Ku70, and Ku80 (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802146/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802146/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, histone H3 copurifies with both SB- and DB-DNA beads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Polyubiquitylation and Ku80 modification at DSBs.</bold> (A) Streptavidin-coated, SB-DNA, and DB-DNA beads were incubated in egg extract for 30 min, and bound proteins were visualized with colloidal coomassie stain.

The presence of ubiquitylated proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with an antibody against ubiquitin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Whereas both SB- and DB-DNA beads copurified histone H3, SB-DNA beads specifically copurified ubiquitylated proteins. The staining mostly occurred in the high molecular mass region of the gel, with a particularly strong band migrating at &#x0223c;100 kD.</p><p>It has been thought that much of the polyubiquitin at DSBs is linked through lysine (K) 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morris and Solomon, 2004</xref>) and K63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang and Zou, 2007</xref>), which are not canonical signals for protein degradation. To identify the specific form or forms of polyubiquitylation attached to SB-DNA beads, we took a directed approach using mass spectrometry. We searched the detected peptide masses for those that corresponded to the masses of each of the possible branched ubiquitin peptides, and then confirmed the identities of these peptides using ms/ms. We were able to identify some peptides corresponding to the K63-linked ubiquitin-branched peptide. In addition, nearly the entire gel lane contained K48-branched peptides, which is the proteasomal degradation signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pickart and Fushman, 2004</xref>). We did not detect any peptides of the other branched isoforms of ubiquitin, including the K6 branch. Additionally, although the previously observed polyubiquitylations were induced on ATM/ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) checkpoint activation, our polyubiquitin signal as detected by immunoblotting was insensitive to caffeine, which can inhibit ATM/ATR activity in egg extracts (unpublished data). We therefore speculated that the K48-linked polyubiquitylation was of a different origin than the previously observed modifications at DSBs, which are thought to be dependent on the BRCA1 and RNF8 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morris and Solomon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Polanowska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ku80 is ubiquitylated at DSBs</title><p>To investigate which proteins bound to a DSB are ubiquitylated, we looked at several candidate proteins that we had identified in the SB-DNA bead purification by ms/ms analysis. Ku80, Ku70, WRN, and Mre11 were labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine in reticulocyte lysates, mixed with the egg extract, and incubated with SB-DNA beads. All four proteins were modified to varying degrees when bound to DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Ku70 was modified in a very faint ladder, and this was confirmed by immunoblot (unpublished data). Most strikingly, however, DNA-bound Ku80 was heavily modified in a ladder of bands reminiscent of polyubiquitylation. Immunoblotting confirmed that these modifications were present on endogenous Ku80 copurified with SB-DNA beads but not with DB-DNA beads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The majority of the ubiquitylation on SB-DNA beads was Ku dependent (unpublished data). Also, isolation of proteins conjugated with 6-His&#x02013;tagged ubiquitin from extracts containing linear DNA selectively copurified the modified form of Ku80 (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802146/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802146/DC1</ext-link>). Therefore, we concluded that Ku80 itself was ubiquitylated upon binding to the DSB-containing DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Components of the Skp1&#x02013;Cul1&#x02013;F-box (SCF) complex bind to DSBs in a Ku-dependent manner</title><p>We noticed a strong 100-kD band reacting to the antiubiquitin antibody. ms/ms analysis identified the presence of Cul1, a component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Willems et al., 2004</xref>) in this band. By immunoblotting, we confirmed that Cul1 and Skp1 were present in the SB-DNA bead purification, but largely absent from the DB-DNA beads and that the majority of this binding was Ku dependent (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802146/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802146/DC1</ext-link>). In addition, although Ku80 interacted with Ku70 either in the absence or presence of linearized DNA, its interaction with Cul1 was linear DNA dependent (Fig. S2 B). In contrast, other cullin family members (Cul2, Cul3, and Cul4) failed to bind strongly to the SB-DNA beads, although Cul3 did show a slight preference for SB- over DB-DNA beads (Fig. S2 C).</p><p>Activated cullin proteins are modified with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pan et al., 2004</xref>), which can cross react with antiubiquitin antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lammer et al., 1998</xref>). In fact, antiubiquitin, anti-Nedd8, and anti-Cul1 antibodies recognize the exact same band from the SB-DNA sample after a close examination by two-color Western blots (unpublished data). Therefore, the majority of Cul1 bound to DSBs appears to be neddylated. These results suggest that the SCF is an excellent candidate E3 for the DSB-induced Ku80 ubiquitylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ku80 is degraded by the proteasome in response to DSBs</title><p>Because K48-linked ubiquitin was associated with SB-DNA beads, we asked whether exposure to DSBs induced the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Ku80. To monitor DNA-induced degradation, we added linear DNA to extract containing <sup>35</sup>S-labeled Ku80 at a concentration of 10<sup>12</sup> ends per microliter, or 0.6 mg/ml, in excess of the estimated concentration of Ku80 in the extract (0.7&#x02013;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>11</sup> molecules per microliter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Labhart, 1999</xref>). Within half an hour of the addition of linear DNA, a fraction of Ku80 migrated as a high molecular mass smear (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7 E</xref> and S4 [available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802146/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802146/DC1</ext-link>]), whereas Ku80 incubated with supercoiled DNA or buffer did not. We quantified the amount of radioactive signal in the entire lane using a phosphorimager, and found that its intensity decreased over time only when the extract contained linear DNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In contrast, the abundance of both Ku70 and Mre11 was unchanged when exposed to linear DNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Immunoblots using an anti-Ku80 antibody revealed that endogenous Ku80 was also modified and lost over time in the presence of DSBs (Fig. S3, A and B). Degradation of Ku80 was observed in response to DSBs in interphase extract as well as CSF-arrested extract (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DSBs lead to the proteasomal degradation of Ku80.</bold> (A) Cut linear DNA, supercoiled circular DNA, or buffer was added to extract containing <sup>35</sup>S-labeled Ku80.

These results were nearly identical to those obtained using the phosphorimager.</p><p>To confirm that the observed degradation of Ku80 depends on K48-linked polyubiquitin, mutant ubiquitin in which K48 was replaced with arginine (K48R), which can no longer branch at K48, was added to the extract. The mutated ubiquitin acted as a dominant-negative protein and prevented the loss of Ku80 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2 D</xref> and S4, A and B). Although Ku80 does become modified in the presence of ubiquitin-K48R, these modifications are shifted in favor of lower molecular mass proteins (Fig. S4 A), as would be expected if the mutant was inhibiting ubiquitin branching. In contrast, in the presence of ubiquitin-K6R or -K63R, the ubiquitylation and degradation of Ku80 was unchanged (Fig. S4, A and B; and not depicted), suggesting strongly that only K48-branched ubiquitin was required for Ku80 degradation. Consistently, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 slowed Ku80 degradation, as compared with addition of the solvent DMSO (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). The decrease in Ku80 in response to DSBs therefore appeared to be caused by its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.</p></sec><sec><title>Polyubiquitylation, but not proteasomal degradation, leads to the removal of Ku80 from DNA</title><p>We next asked whether the ubiquitylation of Ku80 was responsible for its removal from DNA.

In the presence of buffer or wild-type ubiquitin, the labeled Ku80 initially bound to DNA was heavily modified in a high molecular mass ladder (30 min), and then was rapidly lost after transfer to unlabeled extract (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). When ubiquitin-K48R was added, however, Ku80 modification was shifted in favor of lower molecular mass species and Ku80 was retained on the DNA even after the transfer. Therefore, K48-linked polyubiquitylation is important for Ku80 release from DNA.</p><p>This result suggested that proteasomal degradation might be involved in removal of Ku80. To address this question, we tested the effect of MG132 in the release assay. Using a liquid scintillation counter, we measured the levels of radioactive Ku80 that remained on beads and that were released into the supernatant after 30 min in the nonradioactive extract chase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>, <italic>t</italic> &#x0003d; 60 min). As expected, Ku80 was rapidly lost from the SB-DNA beads in the presence of wild-type ubiquitin. Very little of the dissociated Ku80 was found in the supernatant, indicating that it had been degraded. Consistent with the autoradiography, ubiquitin-K48R largely prevented the removal of Ku80. However, MG132 had no effect on bead retention, although the presence of a large fraction of Ku80 in the supernatant suggests that the drug did effectively inhibit degradation of Ku80 released from DNA. These results demonstrate that K48-linked polyubiquitylation, but not proteasomal degradation, is required for the release of Ku80 from DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Ku80 is inefficiently ubiquitylated and removed from DNA when bound to short oligonucleotide duplexes</title><p>As the DNA-binding site of Ku binds B-form DNA, it is capable of binding naked DNA efficiently in contrast to many damage-associated proteins that require chromatin for their activities. To address whether chromatin was required for the DSB-dependent ubiquitylation and degradation of Ku80, we used two short oligonucleotides: one that when annealed formed a 4-nt biotinylated hairpin with a 20-bp base and a 49-bp duplex containing a 3&#x02032;-biotin on one strand. These were bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and incubated in the extract as previously described.

We hypothesized that the binding of the responsible E3 ubiquitin ligase may be inhibited on the shorter DNAs. Supporting the possibility that the SCF complex is the E3 of Ku80, immunoblotting indicated that components of the SCF complex interacted with oligo DNA beads less efficiently than with SB-DNA beads (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Cul1 and Skp1 binding to the oligo DNA beads, normalized to Ku80 binding, was at &#x0223c;25&#x02013;40% of the level of that bound to SB-DNA beads.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Ku80 bound to short oligonucleotide duplexes has less polyubiquitylation and is stable on DNA beads.</bold> (A) Steptavidin-coated beads bound to a biotinylated hairpin-containing 20-bp duplex DNA, a 49-bp double-stranded oligo containing a biotinylated 3&#x02032; end on one strand, or a 3,000-bp SB-DNA were incubated in extract for 30 min.

We found that each Ku80 truncation incapable of efficiently binding DNA was stable in the presence of DSBs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Alternatively, truncations that bound DNA were degraded in the presence of DSBs. Some truncations tested, namely amino acids 1&#x02013;713 and the minimal 244&#x02013;540, appeared to have significantly longer half-lives than the full-length protein. This slow degradation seemed to correlate with a low translation efficiency of these proteins in the reticulocyte lysate, and we therefore cannot conclude that these truncations are missing regions of the protein required for ubiquitylation and degradation.

Because the point mutant, at least in this simplified assay, appeared to be functional for NHEJ, we conclude that polyubiquitin-mediated removal of Ku80 from DNA is not required for the ligation of DNA ends.

We have shown that Ku80 becomes polyubiquitylated when bound to a DSB in <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extract, and that this leads to its removal from DNA. Although Ku80 is degraded by the proteasome in response to DSBs, its dissociation from DNA does not require proteasomal degradation. Our results are in contrast to a previous observation that both Ku70 and Ku80 are ubiquitylated and degraded in response to apoptosis, which showed no specific requirement for DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gama et al., 2006</xref>). The evidence obtained in this study leads us to a model for Ku removal from DNA (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In this model, binding of Ku to DNA induces a signal recognized by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which then polyubiquitylates Ku80. Polyubiquitylation leads to either a conformational change in Ku, which releases it from DNA, or, more likely, to the recruitment of an additional factor that actively dissociates Ku80 from the DNA. After dissociation, Ku80 is recognized and degraded by the proteasome.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>A model for Ku removal from DNA.</bold> Ku70 (red) and Ku80 (yellow) form a ring that encircles a DSB. The heterodimer either recruits other NHEJ proteins, repairing the break (left), or fails to do so (right). Binding to DNA causes Ku to become posttranslationally modified, possibly through phosphorylation (pink boxes). An E3 ubiquitin ligase such as the SCF complex recognizes this modification and polyubiquitylates Ku80. This leads to dissociation from DNA, which is inhibited by the W275R mutation. Dissociation is followed by proteasomal degradation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820467f08"></graphic></fig><p>Our proposition that Ku80 ubiquitylation is responsible for its removal from DNA is the simplest model and is consistent with all of our observations: that Ku80 becomes polyubiquitylated when bound to DNA; that the global inhibition of K48-linked polyubiquitylation inhibits the removal of Ku80 from DNA; that global inhibition of proteasomal degradation does not inhibit the removal of Ku80 from DNA; that removal is required for the proteasomal degradation of Ku80; and that under conditions in which specifically Ku80 ubiquitylation is inefficient, such as on oligo DNA beads, its removal and degradation are inhibited as well. However, it remains possible that the K48-linked polyubiquitylation of an additional protein contributes to the release of Ku80 from DNA.</p><p>The altered modification ladder of Ku80 in the presence of ubiquitin-K48R or short oligonucleotides is probably caused by the mono- or diubiquitylation of multiple lysines on the protein. This will result in a ladder that is shifted toward lower molecular mass forms. The striking DNA release and degradation phenotypes in the presence of this modestly shifted ladder are not surprising. The proteasome requires chains of at least four K48-linked ubiquitin subunits to recognize its substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pickart and Fushman, 2004</xref>). The factor or factors required to remove Ku80 from DNA likely have similar ubiquitin chain length requirements.</p><p>Although the E3 ubiquitin ligase for this process remains unknown, a tantalizing possibility is that it is the SCF complex, which we found binds specifically to DSBs in a Ku-dependent manner. Interestingly, a role for the SCF complex in postrepair processes has been observed. Cell cycle recovery from the DNA replication checkpoint response depends on the SCF-mediated degradation of claspin, whose phosphorylation by Plk1 is recognized by the F-box protein &#x003b2;TrCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mailand et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peschiaroli et al., 2006</xref>). However, unlike the majority of Cul1 and Skp1, &#x003b2;TrCP does not bind to DSBs in a Ku-dependent manner (unpublished data), suggesting that &#x003b2;TrCP is not the F-box protein responsible for Ku-dependent DSB binding of the SCF complex.</p><p>The signal for Ku80 polyubiquitylation remains unknown. As we have shown that only the DNA- and Ku70-binding region of Ku80 is required for ubiquitylation and degradation, the E3 ligase&#x02013;binding site is predicted to reside there. Alternatively, it is possible that Ku70 recruits the ligase. Many ubiquitin ligases, such as the SCF complex, recognize their substrates through posttranslational modifications, often phosphorylations. Ku80 is phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs, and three phosphorylation sites on human Ku80 have been identified by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 1999</xref>). None of these sites are in the DNA-binding region we have identified, although it is possible that additional sites exist.</p><p>We have shown, through point and truncation mutants, that completion of NHEJ is uncoupled from ubiquitin-dependent removal and degradation. First, Ku80-W275R is functional for NHEJ coordination, seemingly becomes ubiquitylated, yet is not removed from DNA or degraded. This result implies that removal from DNA, although not required for NHEJ, is a prerequisite for proteasomal degradation. W275 is a residue in the DNA-binding domain of Ku80, making contacts with Ku70 and with DNA. A tryptophan to arginine mutation at this site is likely to result in a significant change in local structure. It is possible that this structural modification prevents the large-scale conformational change required for Ku80 removal or that it inhibits the recognition of a factor that actively removes Ku80 from DNA.</p><p>Complimentarily, experiments using truncation mutants have demonstrated that the DNA-binding region alone, which is insufficient for NHEJ, is enough for the ubiquitylation and degradation of Ku80. Therefore, Ku80 may be removed from DNA before the completion of repair, a fact seemingly in contradiction with its function. One possible explanation is that the ubiquitylation of Ku80 induces the removal only of inactively bound protein. However, the rate of degradation of the nonfunctional N- and C-terminally truncated protein was identical to that of wild-type protein, suggesting that inactively bound protein is removed and degraded no more quickly than actively bound protein. Another possibility is that this mechanism is in competition with the completion of NHEJ. If the two break sites can be synapsed and ligated before the removal of Ku80, repair will be completed through the NHEJ pathway. If not, this process will perhaps make way for repair proteins involved in different pathways. Indeed, Ku is inhibitory to repair through the homologous recombination pathway at unique I-SceI&#x02013;generated DSBs in chicken and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fukushima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>) and at RAG1/2-generated DSBs in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weinstock and Jasin, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, FRAP studies indicate that Ku is very dynamic on DSBs in mammalian cells, with a half-life on the order of a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mari et al., 2006</xref>), which is similar to what we see in our release assays.</p><p>Recently, an increasing appreciation for the role of polyubiquitylation at DSBs has emerged. A critical DSB-binding protein, BRCA1, is itself an E3 ubiquitin ligase that adds K6-linked polyubiquitin onto substrate proteins. One such substrate, CtIP, which is thought to promote end resection at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sartori et al., 2007</xref>), binds chromatin while ubiquitylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, recent data have shown that the DSB-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8, along with the E2 Ubc13, polyubiquitylates histones H2A and H2AX, and that this leads to the recruitment of BRCA1 and other damage response proteins to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the recruitment of BRCA1 and RNF8 to DSBs, and thus their DSB-localized ubiquitylations, both require the ATM/ATR checkpoint pathways, whereas the ubiquitylation of Ku80 that we observe does not. In addition, neither of these pathways is known to result in the degradation of a target protein, whereas Ku80 is degraded.</p><p>Whereas investigations of repair protein localization have thus far focused on recruiting proteins to DSBs, the problem of protein removal from DNA is equally important. DNA must be cleared either to allow other repair proteins access to the DNA or to allow postrepair processes. Although Ku is particularly interesting in this context because of its likely topological attachment to DNA after repair, the regulated removal of proteins from DNA is a broad problem that currently is not well understood. Ubiquitin-mediated removal may be a general mechanism for protein dissociation from DNA. A similar case is the Aurora B protein, part of the mitotic chromosomal passenger complex, that must be removed from chromatin after anaphase and before nuclear envelope reformation. The ubiquitin-dependent chaperone protein p97/VCP was recently shown to be required for the removal of K48-polyubiquitylated Aurora B from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramadan et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that ubiquitylated Ku80 is removed via a similar process and that this is a general mechanism for the controlled removal of proteins from DNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Frog egg extract</title><p>Meiotic metaphase II&#x02013;arrested (CSF) <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extract was prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murray, 1991</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies, proteins, and Western blots</title><p>Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were generated against the C termini of <italic>X. laevis</italic> Ku80, Ku70, Skp1, and Cul1 using the following peptides: Ku70, CKKQELVDALVEYFKKN; Ku80, CMEDEGDVDDLLDMM; Cul1, CDILIEKEYLERVDGEKDTYSYLA; Skp1, EEEEAQVRKENQWCEEK.
