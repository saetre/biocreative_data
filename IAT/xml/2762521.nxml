Here, we report that RBP-J, the critical transcription factor mediating Notch signaling, modulates EPC through CXCR4. In a mouse partial hepatectomy (PHx) model, RBP-J deficient EPC showed attenuated capacities of homing and facilitating liver regeneration. In resting mice, the conditional deletion of RBP-J led to a decrease of BM EPC, with a concomitant increase of EPC in the peripheral blood. This was accompanied by a down-regulation of CXCR4 on EPC in BM, although CXCR4 expression on EPC in the circulation was up-regulated in the absence of RBP-J. PHx in RBP-J deficient mice induced stronger EPC mobilization. In vitro, RBP-J deficient EPC showed lowered capacities of adhering, migrating, and forming vessel-like structures in three-dimensional cultures. Over-expression of CXCR4 could at least rescue the defects in vessel formation by the RBP-J deficient EPC. These data suggested that the RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling regulated EPC mobilization and function, at least partially through dynamic modulation of CXCR4 expression. Our findings not only provide new insights into the regulation of EPC, but also have implications for clinical therapies using EPC in diseases.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recently, bone marrow (BM)-derived cells, such as the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and the endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), have shown promising potential in the treatment of various human disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-Houlihan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-Ueno1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Transfused EPC can home to injured livers, and directly differentiate into SEC and integrated into liver sinusoids. They can also indirectly facilitate SEC and hepatocyte regeneration by paracrine mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-Fausto1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-LeCouter1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results suggested that the Notch signaling might play a role for the transfused BM-derived EPC to facilitate liver regeneration. When Notch signaling was interrupted, the BM-derived EPC appeared to have lower CXCR4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007572-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Notch signaling is essential for these BM-derived EPC to incorporate into liver tissues and/or to participate in liver regeneration. Our results showed that the Notch signaling-mediated CXCR4 expression is necessary for EPC to participate in vessel formation. Furthermore, we have previously shown that RBP-J deficient SEC have attenuated capacity in supporting hepatocyte regeneration due to the lowered level of VEGFR1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-Wang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. These results suggested that the modification of EPC by the activation of their Notch signaling might be helpful to enhance the function of EPC in the therapy of liver diseases.</p><p>Although EPC have been shown to participate in liver regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-Fujii1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and might have therapeutic potentials in the treatment of end-stage liver diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-Beaudry1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, how these cells are regulated in vivo has been poorly understood. The Notch-RBP-J signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of multiple lineages of stem/progenitor cells. In this study, using an inducible RBP-J knockout mouse model, we showed that Notch signaling might influence EPC at different levels or stages. In BM, the deficiency of the canonical Notch signaling led to the reduction of EPC, but a substantial fraction of EPC exists, suggesting that the Notch-RBP-J pathway is not essential for EPC commitment. Kwon et al reported a similar phenotype in the Notch ligand Jagged-1 knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-Kwon1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In the RBP-J deficient mice, however, we observed a concomitant increase of EPC in the peripheral blood. Because the RBP-J deficient EPC in BM showed lowered CXCR4 expression, we propose that the canonical Notch signaling represses EPC mobilization in BM by the maintenance of CXCR4 expression. In PB, RBP-J deficient EPC have up-regulated CXCR4, implying that Notch signaling might repress CXCR4 expression and EPC recruitment to injured tissues, since literature has indicated that the CXCR4 expression is closely related to the EPC recruitment into injured tissues, which produce SDF-1&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007572-Ceradini1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in the RBP-J knock-out model, although EPC in PB showed higher CXCR4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007572-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007572-g004">4</xref>), they were recruited into the regenerating liver (which produces SDF-1&#x003b1;) at a lower efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007572-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This suggests that additional Notch-regulated signals are also necessary for the homing of EPC from PB into the injured tissues, and further molecular studies are needed to identify these signals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethnics Statements</title><p>The animal husbandry, experiments and welfare were conducted in accordance with the Detailed Rules for the Administration of Animal Experiments for Medical Research Purposes issued by the Ministry of Health of China, and were approved by the Animal Experiment Administration Committee of Fourth Military Medical University.
