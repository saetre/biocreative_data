Accumulated data in the literature reveal that laminar shear stress is beneficial for the endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Numerous studies and accumulating microarray data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] indicate that physiological shear stresses produce antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], antiapoptotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and antiproliferative effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Investigations from our laboratories and others have shown that shear stress inhibits serum-, cytokine-, and hydrogen peroxide-induced responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Shear stresses also initiate cascades of events that are essential for endothelial function. For example, shear stress can stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] which is required for Akt phosphorylation; this helps prevent endothelial apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and contributes to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and subsequent nitric oxide (NO) production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. NO acts as a vasodilator and exerts atheroprotective effects on the endothelium by inhibiting many atherosclerosis-prone events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Moreover, a number of antioxidant genes, such as heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase-1, and glutathione S-transferase, are upregulated in ECs under laminar shear stress, and the antioxidant response element (ARE) which resides in the promoter regions of these antioxidant genes plays a vital role in their induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Upregulation of the antioxidant, superoxide dismutase (SOD), by shear stresses can suppress the apoptotic effects induced by other agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the detailed mechanisms of how the antioxidant ability of shear stresses is regulated remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a cap'n'collar (CNC) basic leucine zipper transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Evidence compiled from in vitro and in vivo studies has shown that Nrf2 is essential for ARE-mediated induction of genes including phase II detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Results obtained from experiments exploiting Nrf2-null mice suggest that Nrf2 plays a protective role against xenobiotics, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A recent study revealed that Nrf2 activation inhibits inflammatory gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The N-terminal domain of Nrf2 is bound to the cytoskeletal-associated protein, Keap1, that negatively regulates Nrf2 by both repressing Nrf2 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and enhancing its rate of proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1 and is translocated into the nucleus to initiate the following transcriptional events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Oxidants and electrophiles are known to stimulate Nrf2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and herein we show that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), a major reactive oxygen species (ROS), is another Nrf2 stimulator. A recent study demonstrated that NO also induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. So far, knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of Nrf2 activation is very limited. Several studies implied that PI3K is a key regulator of Nrf2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It was also found that protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates Nrf2 and regulates concomitant ARE-mediated transcription in response to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as ERK1/2 and p38, are also reported to modulate Nrf2 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Although the signaling pathways of the translocation of Nrf2 were reported in several previous papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], studies on the signaling pathway of Nrf2 translocation under shear stress stimulation are very limited. Hosoya et al. reported that both laminar and oscillatory shear stresses can trigger the translocation of Nrf2, but only laminar shear stresses can induce Nrf2 binding to the ARE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In this study, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in shear stress-induced Nrf2 translocation.</p><p>In a previous study, we showed that shear stress increases intracellular ROS and antioxidant activity in ECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Generation of ROS may participate in cellular responses and signal transduction. Shear-induced ROS are responsible for inducing HO-1, that has remarkable antioxidant abilities and carries out diverse protective functions in diseases such as atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In the present study, we examined the regulatory mechanisms of shear stress on the Nrf2 transcription factor and its downstream target, HO-1, in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We demonstrated that shear stress induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and this process involved PI3K, ROS, and PKC. We also showed that shear stress increased the ARE-binding activity of Nrf2. Parallel experiments using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>to stimulate ECs were carried out, and similar results were obtained. Our data suggest that in some way, the atheroprotective role of laminar shear stress may be attributed to Nrf2 activation which results in initiation of ARE-mediated gene transcription, including HO-1 expression, that is beneficial to the cardiovascular system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary cultures of HUVECs were harvested from umbilical cord veins by collagenase isolation.

The following day, HUVECs were rinsed with buffer and grown to confluence within 2 to 3 days. The cells were subcultured on fibronectin-coated glass slides. One day prior to the shear stress experiments, the concentration of FBS in the culture medium was reduced to 2%, and this was used throughout the shear stress experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Shear stress experiments</title><p>Exposure of HUVECs to shear stress was conducted in a parallel-plate flow chamber as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].

The cells were lysed by adding 10% Nonidet P-40 and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm to obtain a pellet of nuclei. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in cold buffer B containing HEPES (20 mM), EDTA (1 mM), dithiothreitol (1 mM), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), as well as NaCl (0.4 mM), and then vigorously agitated from time to time, followed by centrifugation.

Nrf2 primers were synthesized by MB Mission Biotech (Taipei, Taiwan) and consisted of 5'-ACA CGG TCC ACA GCT CAT CAT-3' (forward) and 5'-TTG GCT TCT GGA CTT GGA AC-3' (reverse); GAPDH primers were synthesized by the same company and consisted of 5'-TGG TAT CGT GGA AGG ACT CAT GAC-3' (forward) and 5'-ATG CCA GTG AGC TTC CCG TTC AGC-3' (reverse). When total RNA was isolated from HUVECs, a Superscript III one-step RT-PCR kit was used for the reverse transcription. After 25 cycles, the end products were subjected to 1% agarose electrophoresis to analyze the target RT-PCR products.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)</title><p>The supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was used for the EMSA. The probe for EMSA was a synthetic 24-mer oligonucleotide (5'-GGG ACT GGT GAC TCA GCA AAA TCT-3') containing the ARE binding site within the promoter region and about 4 kb upstream of the human HO-1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The probe was end-labeled with biotin using the Biotin 3'-end DNA labeling kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Both the sense and antisense oligonucleotides were separately labeled and then annealed to form the double-stranded probe. 10 &#x003bc;g of the nuclear protein from either untreated or the different stress-exposed cells was incubated at room temperature for 20 min in binding reaction buffer containing the biotin-labeled 24-mer probe with, or without, an unlabeled competitor. The competitor used was the unlabeled 24-mer just described or the biotin control probe (Pierce). In the antibody supershift assay, the anti-Nrf2 antibody (1 &#x003bc;g, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with the mixture for 20 min at room temperature followed by the addition of the biotin-labeled DNA probe. Proteins in the reaction mixture were then separated by electrophoresis in a 5% TBE polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), run at 100 V for 45 min. Protein-DNA complexes were transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 60 min with 0.5% TBE buffer at 4&#x000b0;C. The transferred DNA was cross-linked to the membrane by 60-s exposure to ultraviolet light. Biotin-labeled DNA was detected by using the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Shear stress increases Nrf2 expression and nuclear translocation</title><p>To examine the effect of shear stress on Nrf2 expression and activation, HUVECs were exposed to a laminar shear stress of 12 dyne/cm<sup>2 </sup>which resembles physiological blood flow conditions in atherosclerotic plaque-free regions. Shear stress substantially increased the total cellular levels of Nrf2 protein over time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

The expression of Nrf2 mRNA was reduced after 120 min of shear stress, but it was still higher than the basal static condition. The results show that shear stress not only induces Nrf2 translocation but also increases the expression of Nrf2 at the mRNA and protein levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Shear stress induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation through a PI3K-dependent pathway</title><p>Many previous studies implied that Nrf2 activation is mediated through the PI3K pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].

These findings suggest that PKC may play a role in shear-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation. To test this hypothesis, calphostin C (a PKC inhibitor) was used to pretreat HUVECs prior to the shear stress experiment. Pre-exposure to calphostin C did not affect the basal level of nuclear Nrf2 protein but significantly attenuated shear-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), indicating that PKC is involved in the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in response to shear stress.</p><p>Chen et al. determined that dietary chemopreventive compounds induce Nrf2 translocation through MAPK pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].

Many MAPK family proteins, including p38 and JNK, are activated by shear stress stimulation. It is likely that the translocation of Nrf2 under shear stress conditions is regulated by the MAPK pathway. However, the use of SB203580 (a p38-specific inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) did not attenuate the translocation of Nrf2 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

To investigate the effect of shear stress on the ARE-binding activity of Nrf2, nuclear proteins were isolated from endothelial cells and used for an EMSA. An oligonucleotide (5'-GGG ACT GGT GAC TCA GCA AAA TCT-3') containing the ARE-binding site within the promoter region lying about 4 kb upstream of human HO-1 gene was used as a probe in the EMSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In the antibody supershift assay, the anti-Nrf2 antibody was incubated with nuclear proteins prior to the addition of the oligonucleotide. The results indicated that shear stress enhanced Nrf2 binding activity to ARE, and this effect was significantly repressed by the ROS scavenger, NAC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Similarly, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>also increased the ARE-binding activity of Nrf2, and this event was significantly suppressed by NAC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Based on these findings, it is suggested that shear stress promotes the binding activity of Nrf2 to ARE through ROS.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Shear stress increases the antioxidant response element (ARE)-binding activity of Nrf2 through reactive oxygen species (ROS)</bold>.

It was found that shear stress activated Nrf2 nuclear translocation and increased the amount of Nrf2 protein and the level of mRNA transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The translocation of Nrf2 occurred after 10 min of shear stress, suggesting that Nrf2 translocation which induces downstream gene regulation is a rapid response. However, the mRNA level of Nrf2 increased obviously after 30 min of shear stress and reached a maximum at around 60 min. Hong et al. and Eggler et al. reported that under a basal condition, Nrf2 undergoes Cul3-dependent ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation, but under various stimuli, Keap1 is ubiquitinated to release Nrf2 into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. It is likely that when HUVECs are exposed to shear stress, the early response is ubiquitination of Keap1 which induces Nrf2 translocation. Nuclear translocation may decrease the concentration of Nrf2 in the cytosol thus triggering the expression of Nrf2 at both the mRNA and protein levels. But by 2 h later, the cells may have adapted to the shear stress stimulation, and thus the transcription level of Nrf2 began to decline. However, the amount of Nrf2 protein was still higher than the basal condition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><p>We also found that PI3K played a crucial role in shear-induced Nrf2 translocation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Kang et al. revealed that before entering nuclei, it is necessary for Nrf2 to be translocated to plasma membranes where it is phosphorylated by PI3K or PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Based on our results, we found that Nrf2 translocation and activation were PI3K-dependent. But PI3K is a lipid kinase, and the substrate of PI3K should be a lipid like PIP2, not Nrf2. This implies that the mechanism of Nrf2 translocation is indirectly mediated by PI3K. There are likely more protein kinase(s) involved in Nrf2 activation, and PKC may be one candidate. When shear stresses activate PI3K, it phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3, and at this time, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) may bind to PIP3 through its PH domain. PKC, one of the downstream substrates of PDK1, can be phosphorylated and activated. Activation of Nrf2 by PKC possibly occurs through the phosphorylation of S40 at the Neh2 domain of Nrf2, which interacts with Keap1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The phosphorylation of S40 triggers a conformational change in Nrf2, and thus Nrf2 is released from Keap1. Free Nrf2 in the cytosol is translocated into nuclei or interacts with other protein kinase(s). We speculate that nuclear translocation of Nrf2 requires either phosphorylation by PKC or another serine or threonine kinase at S40 of the Neh2 domain, which disrupts the interactions of Nrf2 and Keap1, leading to Nrf2 separating from Keap1. With the exception of PI3K, ROS also participate in the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, the detailed mechanism is not clear at the present time. ROS may change the intracellular redox state of HUVECs, triggering the formation of disulfide bonds between the SH groups of cysteine residues within protein molecules, thus altering the activities of those proteins (see discussion below).</p><p>In a previous study, we showed that shear stresses increase the amount of ROS in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The generation of ROS may participate in many cellular responses and signal transduction. This study verified that ROS are important regulators of the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. The intracellular redox state of HUVECs can be altered by ROS. On the other hand, many previous studies reported that shear stresses activate eNOS and increases the amount of endogenous NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], which also affects the intracellular redox state of HUVECs. However, we found that shear-increased NO had no influence on Nrf2 translocation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>The detailed mechanism of the regulation of Nrf2 translocation by the intracellular redox state remains to be elucidated. Wakabayashi et al. showed that both C273 and C288 residues are necessary for Keap1 to repress Nrf2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Based on our data in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, we speculated that the redox state of HUVECs may influence Nrf2 translocation by changing the redox state of the C273 and C288 residues of Keap1. There might be several possible mechanisms that alter the C273 and C288 residues of Keap1 and thus release Nrf2. For example, it is possible that when the amount of ROS is increased, the SH groups on C273 and C288 may be oxidized to form disulfide bonds, thus triggering Keap1 to release Nrf2 and initiating Nrf2 nuclear translocation. It was reported that an elevated concentration of xenobiotics in the cytosol causes oxidative stress and induces the dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 through the above-mentioned ROS-mediated mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Another possibility is the nitrosylation of C273 and C288 residues of Keap1 which causes the release of Nrf2, and this mechanism is carried out only when the concentration of NO in the cytosol is much higher than the basal condition. We speculated that the concentration of shear-induced NO was not high enough to trigger Nrf2 translocation. Thus, it is likely that the ROS-mediated mechanism plays a relatively more important role than the NO-mediated mechanism in regulating Nrf2 translocation.</p><p>As for the intracellular sources of ROS, Li et al. and Hancock et al. showed that NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are a major source of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], and in our preliminary study, we found that the use of small interfering (si)RNA against NOX2 repressed Nrf2 translocation (data not shown). This result also supports our deduction that a change in the redox state of HUVECs triggers Nrf2 translocation.</p><p>Results obtained from the gel shift assay further revealed that shear stress enhanced the ARE-binding activity of Nrf2 through the involvement of ROS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Shear-induced HO-1 protein expression was also suppressed by a PI3K inhibitor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Parallel experiments were conducted using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a major ROS, as the stimulus, and similar results were obtained. These results provide evidence that shear-induced Nrf2 regulates HO-1 expression via binding to the ARE in the promoter region, and this regulation involves PI3K and ROS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we examined the regulation of shear stress on Nrf2 in HUVECs. We demonstrated that a laminar shear stress of 12 dyne/cm<sup>2 </sup>induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and we found that PI3K, PKC, and ROS, but not MAPKs (p38 and JNK), were involved in the signaling pathway. We also found that shear stress increased the ARE-binding activity of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. HO-1 has been shown to have remarkable antioxidant abilities and is responsible for diverse protective functions against diseases such as atherosclerosis. Our data suggest that the atheroprotective role of laminar shear stress is partly attributed to Nrf2 activation which results in ARE-mediated gene transcription, including HO-1 gene expression, which is beneficial to the cardiovascular system.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p><bold>ARE</bold>: antioxidant response element; <bold>ECs</bold>: endothelial cells; <bold>eNOS</bold>: endothelial nitric oxide synthase; <bold>HO-1</bold>: heme-oxygenase 1; <bold>HUVECs</bold>: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; <bold>MAPKs</bold>: mitogen-activated protein kinases; <bold>NAC</bold>: N-acetyl cysteine; <bold>NO</bold>: nitric oxide; <bold>Nrf2</bold>: nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; <bold>PI3K</bold>: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; <bold>PKC</bold>: protein kinase C; <bold>ROS</bold>: reactive oxygen species.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CYH and HYH contributed equally to this study.
