However, circulating adiponectin is elevated in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients, who have also a higher incidence to develop CVD. Because monocytes play an important role in atherosclerosis, we analysed the influence of adiponectin on cytokine and chemokine release in monocytes from T1D patients and controls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Systemic adiponectin was determined in the plasma and the high-molecular weight (HMW) form of adiponectin was analysed by immunoblot. Monocytes were isolated from T1D patients and controls and the adiponectin-stimulated release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) and interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) was analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Systemic adiponectin was higher in T1D patients. Immunoblot analysis of the plasma indicate abundance of HMW adiponectin in T1D patients and controls. IL-6, CCL2 and CXCL8 secretion in response to adiponectin were found induced in monocytes from controls whereas only IL-6 was upregulated in T1D cells. The induction of IL-6 by adiponectin was abrogated by an inhibitor of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data indicate that adiponectin-mediated induction of IL-6, CCL2 and CXCL8 is disturbed in monocytes from T1D patients and therefore elevated systemic adiponectin in T1D patients may be less protective when compared to controls.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The adipokine adiponectin (APM) is known to exert anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] but recent studies also describe proinflammatory activities of APM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. APM is highly abundant in human plasma and is secreted by adipose tissue in inverse relation to the body mass index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. APM circulates in blood as trimers, hexamers, and higher molecular weight (HMW) complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A proteolytic cleavage product of adiponectin that includes its globular head group has also been detected in human plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The biological activity of APM depends on its high order structure with different oligomeric complexes activating different signaling pathways. HMW-APM activates the NF&#x003ba;B pathway and consequently induces the secretion of IL-6 in differentiated THP-1 cells and primary monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Besides NF&#x003ba;B, HMW-APM also activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and stimulation of AMPK by metformin, a drug used in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, also induces IL-6 in cardiac fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Release of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL8 is also stimulated by HMW-APM in human monocytes and may depend on NF&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Chemokines are molecules that attract cells of the immune system to the site of inflammation and also mediate the migration of monocytes to the subendothelium, an early event in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Like CCL2, CXCL8 is produced by a variety of cell types and is induced by proinflammatory mediators like endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Both chemokines attract cells of the immune system to sites of inflammation and CXCL8 is unique among these proteins because of its high stability in-vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The best characterized CC chemokine is CCL2 (MCP-1) and several studies suggest that CCL2 is the main chemokine involved in the recruitment of monocytes from blood into early atherosclerotic lesions. CXCL8 stimulates the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells and has also been linked to the development of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Whereas circulating adiponectin is reduced in the sera of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], systemic adiponectin is elevated in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), that is also associated with macro- and microvasculature complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Several studies demonstrate a disturbed response of T1D monocytes to endotoxin shown by an altered cytokine and chemokine secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Because HMW-APM and endotoxin activate NF&#x003ba;B it might be suggested that T1D monocytes show an altered response to HMW-APM.</p><p>Monocytes are involved in the innate immune response and the formation of early atherosclerotic lesions. An altered cytokine and chemokine release from these cells may contribute to premature atherosclerosis and reduced immune function in T1D patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore the influence of HMW-APM on the secretion of the multifunctional cytokine IL-6 and the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL8 was determined in monocytes of T1D patients and controls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and controls</title><p>Monocytes were purified from the blood of 10 female controls and 10 female T1D patients.

In contrast, CXCL8 is similarily induced in T1D monocytes and control cells by endotoxin but not stimulated by HMW-APM in the patients' cells although upregulation of this chemokine, at least by endotoxin, also depends on NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Apo E is reduced by endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] whereas HMW-APM did not alter Apo E in human monocytes. Therefore not all proteins are similarily regulated by endotoxin and HMW-APM.</p><p>IL-6 is higher in the sera of patients with T1D, T2D and in patients with coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore reduced IL-6 release of T1D monocytes upon stimulation with HMW-APM may be beneficial in the development of atherosclerosis. However, impaired IL-6 secretion may contribute to an ineffective innate immune response and higher incidence and duration of infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and this may secondary promote atherogenesis.</p><p>In contrast to control monocytes, secretion of CCL2 is not altered by HMW-APM stimulation of T1D cells. Levels of CCL2 are increased early in the course of plaque formation and lead to increased monocyte migration into the atherosclerotic lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Monocytes migrate into the intima due to a CCL2 concentration gradient that is formed by endothelial cells and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Lower expression of CCL2 by T1D cells may increase this gradient and enhance migration of monocytes to the endothelium similar to a recent publication where an increase in CCL2 expression in adipose tissue enhances macrophage infiltration to this site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore CCL2 is decreased in the plasma of T1D patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and diminished secretion of CCL2 by monocytes may contribute to reduced plasma levels. The chemokine CXCL8 also activates monocytes and may recruit these cells to the endothelium. CXCL8 was found to be reduced by adiponectin purified from human plasma in macrophages when the cells were cultivated in the presence of apoptotic cells and was induced in the absence of apoptotic cells or when endotoxin was added to the macrophages. These authors suggest that adiponectin is a dual modulator of innate responses and not an antiinflammatory adipokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The current data indicate that HMW-APM signal transduction pathways are impaired in T1D monocytes. Therefore elevated circulating adiponectin may be less protective in T1D patients when compared to healthy individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, the present study demonstrates that T1D monocytes have a lower secretion of IL-6 and fail to induce CCL2 and CXCL8 when treated with HMW-APM. Therefore elevated systemic adiponectin in T1D patients may not reduce the risk to develop cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Apolipoprotein E (Apo E), high-molecular weight adiponectin (HMW-APM), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2, MCP-1), type 1 diabetes (T1D).</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SA and MN collected monocytes from controls and carried out immunoassays and immunoblots, JW carried out immunoassays, GW collected the patients and control samples and carried out immunoassays, EE carried out immunoassays, AS participated in the design of the study; KM carried out immunoassays, CA was involved in discussions and preparation of the manuscript and, JS is the head of the department and provided the required resources for research and was involved in fruitful discussions and preparation of the manuscript, CB conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination and prepared the manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The technical assistance of Kerstin Winkler and Natalie Smolnikow is greatly appreciated.
