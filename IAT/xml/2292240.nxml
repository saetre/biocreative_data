In this study, we used selective TLR7 and 8 agonists to dissect their contribution to the anti-HIV effects. While triggering TLR7 inhibited efficiently HIV replication in lymphoid suspension cells from tonsillar origin, its effect was inconsistent in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In contrast, triggering TLR8 showed a very prominent and overall very consistent effect in PBMC and tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells. Depletion of dendritic cells (DC), Natural killer cells (NK) and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells from PBMC resulted in the reversal of TLR8 induced anti-HIV effects. Especially noteworthy, depletion of either NK or CD8&#x0002b; T-cells alone was only partially effective. We interpret these findings that DC are the initiator of complex changes in the microenvironment that culminates in the anti-HIV active NK and CD8&#x0002b; effector cells. The near lack of NK and the low number of CD8&#x0002b; T-cells in tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells may explain the lower TLR8 agonist's anti-HIV effects in that tissue. However, additional cell-type specific differences must exist since the TLR7 agonists had a very strong inhibitory effect in tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells. Separation of effector from the CD4&#x0002b; target cells did not abolish the anti-HIV effects pointing to the critical role of soluble factors. Triggering TLR7 or 8 were accompanied by major changes in the cytokine milieu; however, it appeared that not a single soluble factor could be assigned for the potent effects.</p><p>These results delineate the complex effects of triggering TLR7/8 for an efficient antiviral defense. While the ultimate mechanism(s) remains unknown, the potent effects described may have therapeutic value for treating chronic viral diseases. Notably, HIV replication is blocked by TLR triggering before HIV integrates into the host chromosome which would prevent the establishment or maintenance of the latent reservoir.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pattern recognition receptors act as sentinels against microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Akira1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

While the transduction pathways of individual TLRs are well described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Kawai1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, the overall effects of TLR triggering on the lympho-reticular system and on viral diseases remain largely unknown.</p><p>Compounds triggering distinct TLR may be of great value for targeted immunomodulation of viral diseases, including HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Kanzler1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The complex changes from triggering TLR may be more beneficial than administration of single cytokines. In fact, human studies examining treatments with distinct cytokines have rather been discouraging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Hengel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. A detailed mechanistic examination is certainly required for the targeted use of compounds triggering TLR.</p><p>We previously reported that the TLR7/8 agonist R-848 or HIV ssRNA has immediate anti-HIV activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Schlaepfer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, TLR7/8 agonists which were given as vaccine adjuvants in concert with HIV proteins were able to impact on the magnitude and quality of anti-HIV CD8&#x0002b; T-cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-WilleReece1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-WilleReece2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, triggering TLR7/8 stimulates the innate as well as the adaptive immune response; this unique property makes them, at least theoretically, superior to cytokines, which are conventionally given as single agent and either act on the innate or the adaptive arm of the immune system. Thus, triggering TLR7/8 may represent an ideal therapeutic strategy for immunomodulation stimulating multiple arms of the immune response.</p><p>In the previous work, we examined the synthetic compound R-848, which triggers TLR7 and 8. Since TLR7 is preferentially expressed on PDC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Kadowaki1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, the major producer of IFN-<bold><italic>&#x003b1;</italic></bold>, TLR7 triggering is believed to be a key factor in the overall anti-viral response. However, IFN-<bold><italic>&#x003b1;</italic></bold> did not have a major role in the anti-HIV activity that we observed since its neutralization did not reverse R-848's anti-HIV effect. To differentiate the individual contributions of triggering TLR7 and 8 to the anti-HIV activity requires agonists that specifically and efficiently trigger the corresponding TLR. Because TLR8 does not function in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Jurk1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, this pathway has been less well studied, and its biologic significance is largely unknown.</p><p>In the present study, we used agonists that specifically trigger each pathway to characterize the individual contributions of TLR7 and 8 signaling to the overall anti-HIV effect.

TLR agonists were added to the culture medium as indicated in the figure. Infected PBMC where the TLR agonists were added to the insert served as positive control for the TLRs' efficient antiviral activity. Notably, CD4&#x0002b; T-cells do not express TLR7 and 8 and thus do not react to the TLR agonists added. In this setup any inhibitory HIV activity observed when HIV infected CD4&#x0002b; T-cells were separated by a semi-permeable membrane from the PBMC (devoid of CD4&#x0002b; T-cells) must be due to factors secreted by the PBMC into the medium, which then diffuse through the semi-permeable membrane (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3).

in any case we used always concentrations at the upper limit feasible (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">material and method</xref> section). We have formal proof that the neutralization of IFN-&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b1; was effective: the efficacy of the IFN-R&#x003b1; antibody is shown by the fact that adding this antibody resulted in higher HIV replication in control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001999-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). The TNF-&#x003b1; blocking antibody showed complete suppression of recombinant TNF-&#x003b1; in a transient-transfection assay using a NF&#x003ba;B reporter assay (data not shown). Furthermore, there was a tendency that blocking IL-12, -15 and -18 was also effective in the reversal of TLR7-mediated anti-HIV effects. In any case, neutralization of individual cytokines or of combinations of diverse cytokines was not sufficient to reverse the anti-HIV effects after triggering TLR8 or 7/8 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001999-t005">Table 5</xref>). In contrast, the inhibitory activity in cultures treated with the TLR7 agonist was partially reversed when adding nAb against the IFN-R&#x003b1;, pointing to the known anti-viral role IFN-&#x003b1; has in many settings. To conclude, the enigma concerning the soluble factor responsible for the potent TLR7/8 agonists' anti-HIV effect remains.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0001999-t005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001999.t005</object-id><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Neutralization of cytokines had no impact on anti-HIV activity subsequent to triggering TLR8 and/or 7/8;

(D) Replication incompetent lentiviral viruses pseudotyped with VSV envelope which encodes a luciferase reporter gene were used to assess whether TLR7 and/or 8 triggering affects the early step in the replication cycle of HIV. Notably VSV uses a totally different entry mechanism than HIV which is highly unlikely to be affected by the TLR7 and/or 8 agonists. (E) Assessment whether TLR agonists have any effects on HIV replication at the transcriptional level or later in the HIV replication cycle. For this purpose, CD4&#x0002b; T-cells were infected with HIV and spreading infection was blocked by adding the fusion inhibitor enfurvitide. These CD4&#x0002b; T-cells with integrated HIV were co-cultured with either autologous PBMC devoid of CD4&#x0002b; T-cells previously stimulated by TLR7 and/or 8 agonists vs unstimulated autologous PBMC devoid of CD4&#x0002b; T-cells. Thus, any change in HIV output would be due to the effects on either transcription or later events in the HIV replication cycle due to TLR7 and/or 8 triggering (analysis of variance: n.s.; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001999.g006"/></fig><p>Expression level of the HIV receptor complex is required for HIV to enter a cell. Indeed, we found that triggering TLR8 and/or 7/8 resulted in a decrease in the percentage of CD4&#x0002b; cells expressing CCR5 while the percentage of CD4&#x0002b; cells expressing CXCR4 was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001999-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). The median intensity of CCR5 and CXCR4 was not affected by triggering TLR7 and/or 8 (data not shown). The decrease of CCR5 may be explained by the increased release of &#x003b2;-chemokines. However, X4-tropic HIV strains were inhibited to the same extent as R5-tropic strains. Thus, other anti-HIV active mechanisms must be blocking HIV replication. Additionally, we used a lentiviral based reporter virus pseudotyped with the envelope from vesicular stomatitis virus. This virus uses an entirely different entry mechanism than HIV and was inhibited to the same extent as HIV when the tissue was treated with compounds triggering either TLR7 and/or TLR7/8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001999-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p><p>We further wanted to substantiate the above-mentioned findings using an experimental set-up that examines whether the TLR7/8 agonists induced effects inhibits HIV replication at the level of transcription or later in the HIV replication cycle. For this purpose, we infected isolated CD4&#x0002b; T-cells with HIV using spinoculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-ODoherty1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and added 12 h later the fusion inhibitor enfurvitide which prevents spreading infection. Spinoculation was used to increase the number of HIV infected CD4&#x0002b; T-cells which will increase the sensitivity of the read out. Thereafter, we co-cultured these infected CD4&#x0002b; T-cells with autologous PBMC devoid of CD4&#x0002b; T-cells which had been previously exposed to the TLR7/8 agonists. In this setup, the resulting HIV production was solely due to the ongoing HIV transcription of the CD4&#x0002b; T-cells being already infected. If the changes in the microenvironment induced had any effect on HIV replication after integration, we would see a clear decrease of resulting HIV replication in samples treated with the TLR agonists. However, this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001999-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>), indicating that they display their inhibitory activity prior to integration of HIV into the host chromosome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We previously showed that triggering TLR7/8 causes changes to the lymphoid microenvironment that are unfavorable for HIV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Schlaepfer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we sought to identify the individual contributions of TLR7 and 8 to the overall anti-HIV activity and to gain insights into the mechanisms of how TLR trigger anti-viral defenses. We found that (i) the TLR7- or 8-mediated anti-HIV activity depended on the origin of the lymphoid tissue, (ii) dendritic cells are indispensable for the anti-HIV effect, (iii) the main effector cells for the anti-HIV activity were NK-cells and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells, and iv) soluble factors mediated the anti-HIV effects and were not reversed when the antiviral active cytokines IFN-&#x003b1;, -&#x003b3;, or TNF-&#x003b1; were neutralized.</p><p>The TLR7/8 agonist R-848 shows strong anti-HIV activity in PBMC and lymphoid suspension cells from tonsils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Schlaepfer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we used two agonists which selectively trigger either TLR7 or 8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Gorden1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Their potency depended strongly on the origin of lymphoid tissue. Triggering TLR7 was primarily responsible for the anti-HIV activity in tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells, but it had only limited and inconsistent effects in PBMC. In contrast, triggering TLR8 had strong anti-HIV activity in PBMC; it had also consistent but somewhat less anti-HIV activity in tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells. Because of limited availability of tonsillar tissue, we focused in most experiments on PBMC for elucidating the anti-HIV mechanism(s) of TLR7 and/or 8 triggering.</p><p>Based on the sentinel function and the expression of TLR8, we speculated that MDC initiate the complex changes in PBMC that are eventually unfavorable for HIV replication. Indeed, when we depleted DC and DC precursors from PBMC, the anti-HIV effect from TLR7/8 triggering was mostly lost. Not surprisingly, depletion of these cell subsets from untreated cultures resulted in modest increases of HIV replication, pointing to HIV's ability to trigger TLR directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Heil1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Meier1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Beignon1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and thus to initiate an anti-viral defense program, although less potently than the TLR agonists examined. The potent antiviral defense program initiated by TLR8 or 7/8 was also reflected when exposing MoMDC to the TLR agonists: they showed cell clumping, up-regulation of the cell surface marker CD80, CD83 and CD86 as well as pronounced secretion of a number of cytokines. Triggering solely TLR7 had no visible effect on MoMDC.</p><p>Previously, we reported that depletion of B cells partially reversed the anti-HIV activity of R-848 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Schlaepfer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Strikingly, when we depleted NK and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells prior to adding the TLR8 or 7/8 agonists to PBMC, we observed a rather complete reversal of the anti-HIV effects; depleting either NK or CD8&#x0002b; T-cells showed only partial inhibition, suggesting that there is an additive effect when stimulating NK and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells or there is an eminent cross-talk between these cell-populations necessary for this striking anti-HIV effect. Triggering TLR7 in PBMC depleted from NK and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells showed inconsistent effects which reflect its overall inconsistent anti-HIV effects. Since NK and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells are the key effector cells for the TLR8-mediated HIV inhibitory activity, their low or even absent numbers in tonsillar lymphoid suspension cultures may explain the lower TLR8 agonist's anti-HIV effects in that tissue as compared to PBMC. The robust HIV inhibitory activity in tonsillar lymphoid tissue and the rather poor one in PBMC in response to TLR7 triggering speak in favor of additional tissue type specific mechanism(s) beyond NK and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells which may explain the differences between TLR7 and TLR8 agonists. Notably, while we have not assessed functional differences, the percentages of DC are similar in the lymphoid tissue studied.</p><p>The potent cell activation subsequent to triggering TLR8 or TLR7/8 is reflected by an up-regulation of intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; and increased cytolytic activity of NK and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells. Surprisingly, levels of expression of inhibitory (CD94, KIR2DL2, KIR3DL1, ILT2) and activating receptors (NKp30, NKp46, NKp44, DNAM-1) on NK cells were similar between the controls and PBMC treated with TLR agonists (data not shown).</p><p>Since NK and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells do not respond directly to TLR7/8 agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Gorski1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, their activation has to occur either by cell-cell contact with a TLR7/8-responsive cell or by soluble factors. The most likely candidates are IL-12, -15, and -18, which are released from DC upon their activation. However, blocking the individual cytokines or all of them with neutralizing antibodies did not reverse the anti-HIV activity and neither prevented the cellular activation of NK and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells that is consistent with a recently published study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Alter1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we assume that cell-cell contact and/or a variety of soluble redundant factors will ultimately result in the activation of these effector cells. Indeed, the significance of bi-directional interactions between DC and NK cells has been convincingly demonstrated for an efficient immune defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Walzer1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>So how do NK and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells block HIV infection? To answer this question, we used trans-well experiments, in which HIV-infected CD4&#x0002b; T-cells were separated from PBMC devoid of CD4&#x0002b; T-cells. We found that separating the effector from the target cells did not abrogate the anti-HIV effects, thus implicating soluble factors in the process. Indeed, triggering TLR7 and/or 8 resulted in prominent changes in the cytokine profile. However, we were not able to assign the anti-HIV effect to one distinct cytokine even though we neutralized a large number of soluble factors either alone or in combination. The lack of any reversal of the antiviral activity subsequent to triggering TLR8 or TLR7/8 when IFN-&#x003b1; was neutralized is most puzzling and speaks in favor of very potent unknown factor(s) inhibiting HIV. In contrast, the inhibitory activity in response to TLR7 triggering was partially reversed when IFN-&#x003b1; was neutralized: this indicates that these above postulated factor(s) are not secreted or not to the same amount when exposing lymphoid tissue to TLR7 agonists. While not statistically significant, it appeared that blocking IL-12, -15 and -18 resulted also in some reversal of the anti-HIV effects in the case of triggering TLR7. We assume that TLR7 triggering activates DC which in turn releases IL-12, -15 and -18 critical for activating downstream effector cells such as NK or CD8&#x0002b; T-cells.</p><p>While the data with the trans-wells were unambiguous, cell-cell contact may substantiate the anti-HIV effects. However, NK cells showed only minor changes of activating and/or inhibiting receptors (see above) and thus, we do not assume that they play a major role. In contrast, TRAIL showed a prominent up-regulation on NK cells. This increased TRAIL expression is reminiscent of a recent report describing the TLR7 triggering dependent generation of killer PDC expressing TRAIL able to induce apoptosis of HIV-infected SupT1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Hardy1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The potential effects of TRAIL may be masked by the potent inhibitory anti-HIV effects of soluble factors in our experimental set-up that may explain the lack of any reversal of anti-HIV activity when neutralizing TRAIL (data not shown). The potent HIV-inhibition by soluble factors is reminiscent of the long-searched CD8&#x0002b; T-cell antiviral factor, CAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001999-Levy1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Triggering TLR7/8 appears to inhibit HIV before its integration into the host-genome. Downregulation of CCR5 after release of &#x003b2;-chemokines may contribute to the anti-HIV activity when challenging the lymphoid tissue with CCR5-tropic strains. However, other anti-HIV mechanism(s) must be involved. Down-regulation of CCR5 was not complete, and more importantly, X4-tropic strains were also inhibited. We excluded an unspecific effect on the fusion process of the TLR agonists as examined by a cell-cell based fusion assay. Furthermore, we used replication-incompetent viruses pseudotyped with VSV envelope, which enter cells by an entirely different mechanism(s) than HIV. We observed a similar inhibition of the reporter gene in tissue exposed to TLR agonists, also suggesting that these agonists act after entry but before integration/transcription. To substantiate this finding, we investigated whether the TLR agonists induced changes influence HIV replication at the level of transcription: for that purpose CD4&#x0002b; T-cells were infected overnight and spreading infection was inhibited by adding the fusion inhibitor enfurvitide. The infected CD4&#x0002b; T-cells were subsequently co-cultured with previously TLR7/8 agonist stimulated autologous PBMC devoid of CD4&#x0002b; T-cells. Thus, resulting HIV output from this co-culture reflects exclusively HIV transcription from HIV-infected CD4&#x0002b; T-cells. In this setup, the TLR agonists had no inhibitory activity as compared to the control excluding any inhibitory action at the transcriptional level.</p><p>In summary, we propose a new model, in which triggering TLR7 and/or 8 of DC activates NK cells and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells. These cells, in turn, induce the release of soluble factors that result in a microenvironment unfavorable to HIV infection. Since B cells express TLR7, they may be activated directly or indirectly by the corresponding trigger, but in any case, they have less anti-HIV activity than NK and CD8&#x0002b; T-cells. The inability to identify a specific soluble factor is characteristic of the vast array of changes induced by triggering pattern recognition receptors and points to the poorly understood redundancy of the innate immune responses. As outlined in the introduction, we would like to reiterate the fact that compounds triggering TLR7 and/or 8 also strengthen the adaptive immune responses. Thus, these compounds may combine by acting on diverse arms of the immune response optimal properties as immunomodulatory drugs in HIV infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Primary lymphoid tissue, cell lines, separation of cells, and generation of monocyte-derived myeloid dendritic cells</title><p>PBMC obtained from the blood bank (Stiftung Z&#x000fc;rcher Blutspendedienst SRK, Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland) were prepared by Ficoll Hypaque and cultured in RPMI (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, Vienna, Austria), 10 U/ml IL-2 (National Institutes of Health, AIDS Repository), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland), and 1&#x00025; penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies).

NK cytotoxic activity was calculated by expressing the residual EGFP-K562 cells as a percentage of the initial number of target cells added to the co-culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the following markers were used: IFN-&#x003b3; (554552), TNF-&#x003b1; (559321), CD107a (555801), CD4 (555346), CD8 (555634), CD69 (555533), CD56 (555518 and 345811), CD80 (557227), CD83 (556855), CD86 (555658), CD226 (559789), CD336 (558563), CXCR4 (555974), CCR5 (556903), CD3 (555339), CD19 (555412), CD14 (555397), HLA-DR (340549), CD20 (559776), CD11c (333144) and CD123 (340545) (all from BD Pharmingen), CD16 (130-091-246; Miltenyi), NKp30 and NKp46 (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany), NKG2D (R&#x00026;D Systems, Abingdon, UK), and CD94 (provided by L. Lanier, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Quantification of DC was done by staining PBMC with the lineage kit (Lin1 FITC 340546) and mAB against CD11c, CD123 and HLA-DR. To stain for intracellular cytokines, we used the Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (BD, #554714), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Staining for CD107a was done by incubating TLR7- and/or 8-treated PBMC with a mAb to CD107a and Brefeldin A (BD Pharmingen, Allschwil, Switzerland) for 5 h. Data were acquired on a FACS Calibur and analyzed by FlowJo software (TreeStar)).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Transwell experiments</title><p>To determine if cell-cell contact or soluble factors are involved in the anti-HIV effects after TLR triggering, HIV-infected CD4&#x0002b; T-cells were cultured at the bottom of a well of a six-well plate, and the PBMC devoid of CD4&#x0002b; T-cells in the insert. As controls served untreated PBMC infected with HIV as well as PBMC infected similarly as the CD4&#x0002b; T-cells which were placed at the bottom of wells and the TLR agonists added to the inserts. Inserts with a pore size of 4 &#x003bc; were purchased from Millipore. The compounds triggering TLR were added to the medium. CD4&#x0002b; T-cells do not respond to TLR7/8 since they have no TLR7/8. Thus, any observed effects must be due to soluble factors released from the treated PBMC devoid of CD4&#x0002b; T-cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Cytokine measurement</title><p>In the initial experiments, IL-6 (D6050), -8 (D8050), -12 (D1200), TNF-&#x003b1; (HSTA50), RANTES (DRN00B), MIP-1&#x003b1; (DMA00), and -&#x003b2; (DMB00) were quantified by enzyme immunoassays (Quantikine ELISA, R&#x00026;D Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions, IFN-&#x003b1; (Bender Med Systems BMS216) and -&#x003b3; (Hycult Biotechnology, Hbt human Interferon gamma, HK030S) were quantified by enzyme immunoassays from Bender MedSystems Diagnostics and HyCult Biotechnology, respectively.
