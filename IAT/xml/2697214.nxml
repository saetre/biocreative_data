In this study, the <italic>R200Q </italic>substitution was investigated in a sample of 62 individuals from Hampshire, Chinese Min and Erhualian pigs, and the genetic variations of <italic>T30N</italic>, <italic>G52S </italic>and <italic>V199I </italic>substitutions were detected in 1505 individuals from 21 Chinese indigenous breeds, 5 Western commercial pig breeds, and the wild pig. Allele <italic>200R </italic>was fixed in Chinese Min and Erhualian pigs. Haplotypes <italic>II-QQ </italic>and <italic>IV-QQ </italic>were not observed in the Hampshire population, supporting the hypothesis that allele <italic>200Q </italic>is tightly linked with allele <italic>199V</italic>. Significant differences in allele frequencies of the three substitutions (<italic>T30N</italic>, <italic>G52S </italic>and <italic>V199I</italic>) between Chinese indigenous pigs and Western commercial pigs were observed. Obvious high frequencies of the "favorable" alleles <italic>30T </italic>and <italic>52G </italic>in terms of meat quality were detected in Chinese indigenous pigs, which are well known for high meat quality. However, the frequency of the "favorable" allele <italic>199I</italic>, which was reported to have a greater effect on meat quality in comparison with <italic>30T </italic>and <italic>52G</italic>, was very low in all of the Chinese indigenous pigs except for the Min pig. The reasons accounting for this discrepancy remain to be addressed. The presence of the three substitutions in purebred Chinese Tibetan pigs indicates that the three substitutions were ancestral mutations. A novel A/G substitution at position 51 in exon 1 was identified. The results suggest that further studies are required to investigate the associations of these substitutions in the <italic>PRKAG3 </italic>gene with meat quality of Chinese indigenous pigs, and to uncover other polymorphisms in the <italic>PRKAG3 </italic>gene with potential effects on meat quality in Chinese indigenous pigs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pig</kwd><kwd><italic>PRKAG3 </italic>gene</kwd><kwd>meat quality</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>(To access the full article, please see PDF)</p></body></article>
