Elements within the basal promoter of the gene do not fully explain <italic>CFTR</italic> expression patterns, suggesting that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements are located elsewhere, either within the locus or in adjacent chromatin. We previously mapped DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) in 400 kb spanning the <italic>CFTR</italic> locus including a cluster of sites close to the 3&#x02032;-end of the gene. Here we focus on a DHS at +6.8 kb from the <italic>CFTR</italic> translation end-point to evaluate its potential role in regulating expression of the gene. This DHS, which encompasses a consensus CTCF-binding site, was evident in primary human epididymis cells that express abundant <italic>CFTR</italic> mRNA. We show by DNase I footprinting and electophoretic mobility shift assays that the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element within this DHS binds CTCF <italic>in vitro</italic>. We further demonstrate that the element functions as an enhancer blocker in a well-established <italic>in vivo</italic> assay, and by using chromatin immunoprecipitation that it recruits CTCF <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, we reveal that in primary epididymis cells, the +6.8 kb DHS interacts closely with the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter, suggesting that the <italic>CFTR</italic> locus exists in a looped conformation, characteristic of an active chromatin hub.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<italic>CFTR</italic>) gene is located at chromosome 7q31.2, where it is flanked upstream by <italic>ASZ1</italic> (ankyrin repeat, SAM and basic leucine zipper) and downstream by <italic>CTTNBP2</italic> (cortactin binding protein 2). These neighbouring genes have very different expression profiles: <italic>CFTR</italic> is expressed primarily in specialized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>), while <italic>ASZ1</italic> is transcribed exclusively in the testis and ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and <italic>CTTNBP2</italic> is highly expressed in the brain, kidney and pancreas, with lower levels of expression in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). We previously identified two enhancer-blocking insulators 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; to the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene that had distinct properties. First, a DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) located at &#x02212;20.9 kb with respect to the translation start site was associated with a classical CTCF-dependent insulator element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). CTCF, a ubiquitously expressed, zinc finger DNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) often establishes independently regulated domains of gene activity. A second element, located 3&#x02032; to <italic>CFTR</italic>, within a DHS at +15.6 kb also demonstrated enhancer-blocking activity but this was independent of CTCF-binding. The +15.6 kb DHS was marked by a peak of euchromatin-specific histone modifications, unlike the &#x02212;20.9 kb DHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that these elements function by different mechanisms.</p><p><italic>CFTR</italic> exhibits tightly regulated expression, both temporally during development, and spatially in different tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, somewhat paradoxically, the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter resembles that of a house-keeping gene, in that it is CpG rich, contains no TATA box, has multiple transcription start sites and has several putative binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Consistent with promoters of this type, the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter demonstrates no apparent tissue-specificity, suggesting the involvement of distal regulatory elements in control of <italic>CFTR</italic> expression. It is probable that these elements are associated with DHS across 400 kb encompassing the <italic>CFTR</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15">12&#x02013;15</xref>). In addition to the prominent site at +15.6 kb other DHS were evident 3&#x02032; to the coding region of the gene, in particular, a complex cluster of sites at +5.4 kb, +6.8 kb, +7.0 kb and +7.4 kb from the <italic>CFTR</italic> translation end-point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The DHS at +5.4 kb and +7.0 kb were observed in a variety of cell types, irrespective of <italic>CFTR</italic> expression; however, the DHS at +6.8 kb and +7.4 kb were only found in a restricted number of <italic>CFTR</italic>-expressing cell-types, including primary epididymis cells, suggesting that they may contain tissue-specific regulatory elements that participate in controlling <italic>CFTR</italic>-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Here we demonstrate that the +6.8 kb DHS is associated with a tissue-specific CTCF-binding site that displays enhancer-blocking activity comparable to that of other known insulator elements, including the one at the <italic>CFTR</italic> &#x02212;20.9 kb DHS. CTCF is thought to be involved in regulating nuclear organisation and CTCF-dependent chromatin loops exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>), which may depend on tethering to the nuclear matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and/or association with cohesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>). Hence, we next evaluated the three-dimensional structure of the <italic>CFTR</italic> locus in primary cells that exhibit the +6.8 kb DHS and express <italic>CFTR</italic>. Using chromosome conformation capture (3C), we demonstrate that a region encompassing the +6.8 kb DHS shows strong interaction with the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter in these cells. We predict that looping of <italic>CFTR</italic>, possibly induced by CTCF, enables key regulatory elements at the 3&#x02032;-end of the gene to move into close proximity with the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter, so activating cell-type-specific expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The K562 erythroleukemia cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).

Sequences to be assayed for insulator activity are cloned into a unique AscI site located between the enhancer and promoter. Transfection of these constructs into K562 human erythroleukemia cells yields G418-resistant colonies, with a frequency dependent on the level of enhancer-promoter communication (and hence enhancer-blocking activity of the intervening fragment).</p><p>The DHS6.8<sup>oligo</sup> and DHS6.8mut<sup>oligo</sup> oligonucleotides were designed with BssHII sticky ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), facilitating their direct cloning into the AscI site of pNI. An enhancer-blocking activity assay was performed, with the number of neomycin-resistant colonies obtained for each construct normalized to the empty pNI plasmid.

The pNI-DHS6.8<sup>oligo</sup> construct also gave a significantly lower number of colonies compared to pNI (2- to 3-fold, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). In contrast, although the pNI-DHS6.8mut<sup>oligo</sup> construct gave a slightly lower number of colonies than pNI, this was not significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

However, the underlying genetic mechanisms responsible for conferring these complex <italic>CFTR</italic> expression patterns are poorly understood. The <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter is weak and demonstrates little tissue specificity, suggesting that key regulatory elements must be located elsewhere within the gene or in adjacent genomic regions. To identify potential regulatory elements, we previously performed DHS mapping in a variety of cell types, across 400 kb spanning the <italic>CFTR</italic> locus. Of the DHS that were found, a subset showed some correlation with <italic>CFTR</italic> expression. These included two DHS at the 3&#x02032;-end of the gene, at +6.8 kb and +7.4 kb from the <italic>CFTR</italic> translation end-point.</p><p>The +6.8 kb DHS was only observed in fetal epididymis cells and adult lung tissue, both <italic>CFTR</italic>-expressing primary cell types. Here we demonstrate that the +6.8 kb DHS contains a predicted CTCF-binding site with a close match to the consensus. Moreover, this region shows a strong <italic>in vivo</italic> association with CTCF in chromatin extracted from primary epididymis cells, correlating with the presence of the DHS in these cells. Although we did not previously observe the +6.8 kb DHS in Caco2 colon carcinoma cells experiments with Caco2 chromatin showed slight CTCF-specific enrichment at this site. It is thus possible that within a large population of Caco2 cells, a small number of cells exhibit the +6.8 kb DHS.</p><p>While most CTCF-binding sites throughout the human genome appear to be cell-type invariant, a fraction are cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). This cell-type specificity may be conferred by DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides, an epigenetic mark that is known to affect CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, within the <italic>CFTR</italic> +6.8 kb DHS, there is an absence of CpG dinucleotides, with the nearest CpG located about 200 bp 5&#x02032; to the CTCF-binding site core. It therefore seems unlikely that tissue-specific control of CTCF binding at the +6.8 kb DHS is controlled by DNA methylation, suggesting the use of a different regulatory mechanism. For example, it is possible that events leading to the formation of the +6.8 kb DHS, such as nucleosome remodelling, may regulate CTCF binding.</p><p>Genome-wide analysis of CTCF binding in primary human fibroblast IMR90 cells revealed &#x0223c;14 000 genomic regions flanked by CTCF-binding sites, so-called CTCF-pair-defined domains (CPDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Within these CPDs, the average distance between CTCF-binding sites was found to be 212 090 bp. It is therefore of interest that the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene is contained within an apparent CPD of 214 000 bp, considering the distance between the +6.8 kb DHS and the previously described &#x02212;20.9 kb DHS CTCF-dependent insulator element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>At the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> locus, CTCF sites that flank the locus associate with actively transcribed globin promoters within the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> active chromatin hub (ACH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that there is no association between the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter and the &#x02212;20.9 kb DHS CTCF-binding element in the upstream flanking region, irrespective of <italic>CFTR</italic> expression. In contrast, in <italic>CFTR</italic>-expressing primary epididymis cells, we observed a strong interaction between the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter and a region at the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene encompassing the +6.8 kb DHS CTCF-binding site. This interaction was not seen in skin fibroblast cells, which do not express <italic>CFTR</italic>, suggesting that &#x02018;looping&#x02019; of the <italic>CFTR</italic> locus correlates with active expression of the gene.</p><p>In addition to the +6.8 kb DHS, the 3&#x02032; HindIII fragment demonstrated here to interact with the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter encompasses a number of other DHS. These include the cluster of adjacent DHS (+5.4 kb, +7.0 kb and +7.4 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and the previously characterized +15.6 kb DHS enhancer-blocking element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Within primary epididymis cells, the +6.8 kb, +7.0 kb and +15.6 kb DHS were all evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that looping of the <italic>CFTR</italic> locus in primary epididymis cells is induced by interaction of either the +7.0 kb or the +15.6 kb DHS with the <italic>CFTR</italic> promoter. However, given that in other cell types the presence of these DHS shows poor correlation with <italic>CFTR</italic> expression, it seems highly likely that an important role is performed by the +6.8 kb DHS, which was only observed in a subset of <italic>CFTR</italic>-expressing primary cell types.</p><p>It seems probable that the induction and maintenance of looping of the <italic>CFTR</italic> locus is dependent on the interaction of multiple regulatory elements located in different DHS regions, both intronic and flanking the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Indeed we now have evidence that several intronic DHS also contribute to the loops (Ott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008. Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, in Press). Hence, though a single element, such as that within the DHS at the 3&#x02032;-end of the gene is unlikely to be solely responsible for the looping phenomenon, it may play a pivotal role in primary epididymis. We predict a co-ordinated interplay of the regulatory elements located within DHS at the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene and note similarities between this cluster of DHS and the human <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<italic>globin</italic> locus control region (LCR) (41): (i) Both comprise five DHS (+5.4 kb, +6.8 kb, +7.0 kb, +7.4 kb and +15.6 kb in the case of <italic>CFTR</italic>; 5&#x02032;HS1-5 in the case of <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic>). In the case of the <italic>CFTR</italic> 3&#x02032; region, these DHS are spread over 11 kb, while the <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> LCR is about 16 kb in size; (ii) both contain CTCF-binding elements (+6.8 kb DHS in the case of <italic>CFTR</italic>; 5&#x02032;HS5 in the case of <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic>); (iii) when their corresponding genes are actively transcribed, both regions contain peaks of euchromatin-specific histone modifications (at the +15.6 kb DHS in the case of <italic>CFTR</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>); and (iv) both interact with the promoters of their corresponding genes, inducing genomic loops and the formation of an ACH. Future experiments will determine whether the DHS cluster 3&#x02032; to <italic>CFTR</italic> does indeed represent an LCR. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which <italic>CFTR</italic> expression is regulated is likely to be of direct practical relevance in the design of effective gene therapy vectors for cystic fibrosis. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Looping model for <italic>CFTR</italic> gene.
