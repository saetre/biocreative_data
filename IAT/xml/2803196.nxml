However, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is a general event or not. Although crosstalk between Aurora-A and Ras signaling pathways has been reported, the role of these two genes acting together in tumorigenesis remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Real-time PCR and sequence analysis were utilized to identify Ha- and Ki-<italic>ras </italic>mutation (Gly -&#x0003e; Val). Immunohistochemistry staining was used to measure the level of Aurora-A expression in bladder and colon cancer specimens. To reveal the effect of overexpression of the above two genes on cellular responses, mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast derived cell lines over-expressing either Ras<sup>V12</sup>and wild-type Aurora-A (designated WT) or Ras<sup>V12 </sup>and kinase-inactivated Aurora-A (KD) were established. MTT and focus formation assays were conducted to measure proliferation rate and focus formation capability of the cells. Small interfering RNA, pharmacological inhibitors and dominant negative genes were used to dissect the signaling pathways involved.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overexpression of wild-type Aurora-A and mutation of Ras<sup>V12 </sup>were detected in human bladder and colon cancer tissues. Wild-type Aurora-A induces focus formation and aggregation of the Ras<sup>V12 </sup>transformants. Aurora-A activates Ral A and the phosphorylation of AKT as well as enhances the phosphorylation of MEK, ERK of WT cells. Finally, the Ras/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is responsible for Aurora-A induced aggregation of the Ras<sup>V12 </sup>transformants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Wild-type-Aurora-A enhances focus formation and aggregation of the Ras<sup>V12 </sup>transformants and the latter occurs through modulating the Ras/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The role of Aurora-A, a serine/threonine kinase, in tumorigenesis has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In proliferative cells, the expression levels of Aurora-A mRNA and protein are low during G1 and S phases. The levels peak at G2 phase and fall during mitotic exit and G1 phase of the next cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Aurora-A protein consists of 403 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 46 kilo Daltons (kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Overexpression of Aurora-A has been detected in several human cancer cell lines and cancers of the following tissues: bladder, breast, colon, liver, gingival, gliomas, medulloblastoma, ovarian, pancreas, prostate and tongue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Ectopic expression of Aurora-A in mouse NIH3T3 cells and Rat1 fibroblasts causes centrosome amplification and cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This suggests that Aurora-A gene amplification and overexpression play a role in human carcinogenesis, largely due to the effect of Aurora-A on oncogenic cell growth, rather than a loss of maintenance of centrosomal or chromosomal integrity.</p><p>Ras proteins are important for controlling the activities of several crucial signaling pathways. The <italic>ras-</italic>gene encoded proteins become constitutively active due to point mutations in their coding sequences, especially at amino acid 12, 13, and 61 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These activated Ras proteins contribute significantly to several aspects of the malignant phenotype, including deregulation of tumor-cell growth, programmed cell death, invasiveness, and induction of new blood-vessel formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Various Ras-regulated signaling pathways are responsible for cell survival, transformation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Multiple effectors have been found downstream of Ras, including Raf, PI3K, RalGDS, RIN1, MEKK, GAP, NF1, and AF6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Overexpression of Ha-<italic>ras</italic><sup>val12 </sup>oncogene not only transforms NIH3T3 cells but also sensitizes them to various stresses, such as serum depletion, Lovastatin, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and 5-FU treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Through the Ras/Raf interaction, Raf activates MEK1/2, which subsequently phosphorylates ERK1/2 and activates the transcription factor, Elk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. After activation, Elk complexes with the serum responsive factor (SRF) and binds to the serum responsive element (SRE) which is an important element in the <italic>c-fos </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. RalGDS, another Ras effector, associates with Ras and activates Ral (a small GTPase), including RalA and RalB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Studies on progesterone-induced maturation of <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes indicate that overexpression of kinase Eg2, a <italic>Xenopus </italic>member of the Aurora/Ipl1 family, activates the MAP kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This study raises the possibility that Aurora protein may also transduce cell transformation signals through the MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, Aurora-A could associate with NM23-H1, which may phosphorylates the scaffold kinase repressor of Ras (KSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Gigoux et al., (2002) reported that the interaction between Aurora-A and RasGAP, a negative Ras regulator, decreased the kinase activity of Aurora-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Wu et al., (2005) found that RalGDS and RalA are downstream substrates of Aurora-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Tatsuka et al., (2005) showed that overexpression of Aurora-A potentiated Ha-<italic>ras</italic>-mediated oncogenic transformation by increasing focus formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Furukawa et al., (2006) showed that Aurora-A is one of the downstream targets of MAPK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

Co-expression of Ras<sup>V12 </sup>and wild-type Aurora-A in WT cells increases the level of p-AKT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 5, 3.5 fold) as compared to Ras<sup>V12</sup>overexpression alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 4, 1.8 fold).</p><p>The RalGDS/RalA signaling pathway was determined by detecting the activity of RalA using GST-RalBD pull-down assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, Aurora-A overexpression alone activated RalA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 2, 2.0 fold) as compared to the parental Vector cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 1, 1.0 fold). After IPTG induction, The RalA activity was increased by Ras<sup>V12 </sup>overexpression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 4, 2.5 fold). Co-expression of Ras<sup>V12 </sup>and wild-type Aurora-A in WT cells increase the activity of RalA of Ras<sup>V12 </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 5, 3.7 fold). Taken together, both Aurora-A and Ras<sup>V12 </sup>increased the levels of p-MEK, pERK1/2, and p-AKT and the activation of RalA. This induction was further enhanced when Aurora-A and Ras<sup>V12 </sup>were overexpressed simultaneously.</p><p>To further confirm our results, Aurora-A specific small interference RNA (siRNA) was used. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, Aurora-A specific siRNA decreased the expression level of Aurora-A in WT cells. Accordingly, levels of p-MEK/p-ERK, p-AKT and activation of RalA were also decreased when Aurora-A siRNA was introduced into WT cells upon IPTG induction. Our results confirmed that wild-type-Aurora-A enhance Ras downstream signaling pathways including MEK/ERK, AKT and RalA.</p></sec><sec><title>The MEK/ERK pathway is involved in WT cell aggregation</title><p>The involvement of MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and RalGDS/RalA signaling pathways in Aurora-A-related cell aggregation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, WT + IPTG) was clarified by treatment of the cells with the following inhibitors: FTI-277, a farnesylation inhibitor of Ras; PD-98059, the inhibitor of MEK kinase and LY-294002, the inhibitor of PI3K kinase and RalASa94A, a mutant of Ral. FTI-277 restrains Ras protein as a non-farnesylated form and inhibits p-ERK1/2 expression dose-dependently but had no effect on p-AKT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). PD-98059 decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) but had no effect on other signaling pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). LY-294002 reduced the phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) but had no effect on another signaling pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 6 and 7). In summary, in WT cells Aurora-A increases the expression of p-ERK1/2 in a Ras dependent manner. However, FTI-277 does not reduce the p-AKT in WT cells co-expressing Ras<sup>V12 </sup>and wild-type Aurora-A. Wild-type Aurora-A activates RalA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and phosphorylates RalA at serine194 to promote cellular transformation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To reveal the role of RalA phosphorylation at ser194 in Aurora-A induced RalA activation in WT cells, the mutants RalAS183A or RalAS194A were transiently transfected into WT cells and the RalA activity was evaluated. Consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], only RalAS194A could reduce the Ral A activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lane 3).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The MEK/ERK pathway is involved in the aggregation of WT cells</bold>.

The WT cells were treated with FTI-277, PD-98059 or LY-294002 for 24 h and cell aggregation was observed.

Because mutant RalAS194A was unable to block cell aggregation, its role in Aurora-A induced cell aggregation was excluded (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

Aurora-A can promote the cell transformation of Ha-<italic>ras </italic>transformed BALB/c 3T3 A31-1-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The nuclear EGFR induced by EGF associates with Stat5 to bind and increase Aurora-A gene expression, which ultimately leads to chromosome instability and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. We previously reported that oncogenic Ras-induced morphological changes (from spindle-shaped to round) occur through the MEK/ERK signaling pathway to down-regulate Stat3 at a posttranslational level in NIH3T3 cells. Microtubule disruption is involved in the morphologic changes, which can be reversed by overexpression of Stat3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In this study, we determine that overexpression of wild-type-Aurora-A can enhance Ha-<italic>ras</italic><sup>V12 </sup>transformant aggregation through the MEK/ERK signaling pathway.</p><p>The effector domain mutant of oncogenic Ras, Ras<sup>V12S35</sup>, which specifically activates the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in transformed NIH3T3 cells, can induce subcutaneous tumor formation and lung metastases. In these Ras<sup>V12S35</sup>-transformed NIH 3T3 cells, high levels of activated ERK1/2 were detected. By contrast, the cells derived from the other effector domain mutants, Ras<sup>V12G37 </sup>(PI3K) or Ras<sup>V12C40 </sup>(RalGDS), did not show changes at the level of ERK1/2 activation and tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The increase of ERK1/2 activation could lead to enhanced expression of many proteolysis enzymes such as the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family genes which can degrade extracellular matrix, leading to increased cell invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Furthermore, Aurora-A-regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion are mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Our current and previous studies reveal that Ras<sup>V12 </sup>mutation and Aurora-A overexpression can be detected simultaneously in human bladder and colon cancers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Co-expression of wild-type Aurora-A and mutant Ras enhances the signaling of the MEK/ERK, AKT and RalA activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). I</p><p>The activation of ERK1/2 requires phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine and threonine residues by dual specific MAPK kinases (MEK), which are activated by the serine/threonine kinase Raf through phosphorylation. Scaffolding proteins such as MEK partner (MPI) or kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) enhance the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in response to different stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. The KSR/MEK complex is recruited to the membrane following dephosphorylation by phosphatase 2A (PP2A) at the Ser392 residue leading to release 14-3-3 from KSR and then exposes the C1 domain, which is required for the membrane localization of KSR, as well as the FxFP MAPK binding site. At the membrane, Raf-1 is activated and KSR provides a platform for the phosphorylation/activation of associated MEK and ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Other proteins might help recruit activated Raf, triggering MEK phosphorylation. PP2A also interacts with Aurora-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Whether the PP2A may regulate Aurora-A and KSR complex to affect the MEK/ERK signaling pathway is valuable to explore. In addition, Aurora-A interacts with the other tumor suppressor RASSF1A. Aurora-A phosphorylates RASSF1A at Threonine202 and/or Serine203. Knockdown of RASSF1A reduces Aurora-A activation; however, the recombinant RASSF1A can not activate recombinant Aurora-A <italic>in vitro </italic>suggesting that RASSF1A may function as a scaffold for Aurora-A activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The possibility of the interaction between Aurora-A and KSR or RASSF1A requires more investigation and the involvement of other unidentified factor(s) in ERK1/2 activation induced by Aurora-A in R<italic>as</italic><sup>V12 </sup>transformants can not be excluded.</p><p>PI3K/AKT is a down stream signaling pathway of Ras. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, Ras<sup>V12 </sup>or Wild-type Aurora-A alone increases the p-AKT level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 2 and 4) and further increase p-AKT while both of the genes were overexpressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 5). However, upon FTI-277 treatment, the p-AKT level was not reduced in WT cell when RasV12 was overexpressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 2 and 3). Above results suggest that Ras<sup>V12 </sup>and wild-type Aurora-A may share a redundant pathway to increase p-AKT expression level. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism is unclear.</p><p>Overexpression of Aurora-A induces cell motility of MDCK cells, mediated by RalA activation through phosphorylation of the serine 194 residue of RalA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrated that overexpression of either Aurora-A or mutant Ras stimulates RalA activation and maximal RalA activation is observed when both of the oncogenes are overexpressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 5). However, we found that the RalAS194A mutant could not block cell aggregation induced by Aurora-A in the Ha-<italic>ras</italic><sup>V12 </sup>transformants indicating that different signaling pathways may be transduced to control motility and aggregation of the different cells.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate that aberrant Aurora-A expression plus <italic>ras </italic>mutation may occur simultaneously in various cancers, and the increase of MEK/ERK activation triggered by over-expression of the two oncogenes induces cell aggregation. We speculate that this event may play a pivotal role in Ras or Aurora-A related tumor progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, both Aurora-A and Ras<sup>V12 </sup>mutant can activate the MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Our study reveals that additional activation of ERK1/2 may induce cell aggregation and increase cell focus formation when both oncogenes are overexpressed together. The results suggest that increased risk of tumor progression is possible through increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by diverse oncogenes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YST participated in conceptualization, carried out this study, and drafted the manuscript; JCL participated in the collection of cancer tissues; CYFH provided the Aurora-A wild and kinase dead plasmids as well as RalAS194A and RalAS183A plasmids.
