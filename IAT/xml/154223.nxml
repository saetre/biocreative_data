Recently, a candidate prostate cancer susceptibility gene, <italic>ELAC2</italic>, has been identified at chromosome 17p by positional cloning and mutation screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>). An insertion&#x0002f;frameshift mutation and a non-conservative missense mutation in <italic>ELAC2</italic> segregate with prostate cancer in two kindreds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>). Several studies report that two common missense variants in the gene are also significantly associated with the occurrence of prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c3">3</xref>), although several groups argue against this association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c6">6</xref>). Sequence analysis suggested that <italic>ELAC2</italic> encodes an evolutionally conserved, metal-dependent hydrolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c7">7</xref>), which could partly explain environmental effects on human prostate cells by imagining differential interaction of the enzyme variants with some environmental exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>). In addition, the gene product showed similarity to a family of DNA interstrand crosslink repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c8">8</xref>), which seemed consistent with a potential role in cancer susceptibility. Despite the fundamental biological interest, however, the genuine function of the <italic>ELAC2</italic> product was totally unknown. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the prostate cancer susceptibility gene encodes an unfamiliar but important enzyme which is essential for tRNA biosynthesis, that is, tRNA 3&#x02032; processing endoribonuclease (3&#x02032; tRNase).</p><p>3&#x02032; tRNase is an enzyme responsible for the removal of a 3&#x02032; trailer from precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) which is transcribed as a larger form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c9">9</xref>). The enzyme cleaves pre-tRNA immediately downstream of a discriminator nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c11">11</xref>), onto which the CCA residues are added to produce mature tRNA. We have shown that mammalian 3&#x02032; tRNase can remove 3&#x02032; trailers from various pre-tRNAs with various efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c14">14</xref>). Pre-tRNA 5&#x02032; leaders affect the efficiency of tRNA 3&#x02032; processing reaction <italic>in vitro</italic>; leaders of 9 nt or longer severely inhibit the tRNA 3&#x02032; processing reaction, and even small 5&#x02032; leaders, when stably base-paired with 3&#x02032; trailers, hinder removal of the 3&#x02032; trailers by 3&#x02032; tRNase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c14">14</xref>). Besides the 5&#x02032; leaders, the 3&#x02032; trailers also affect the cleavage efficiency of pre-tRNAs, which varies depending on both the length and the 5&#x02032; end nucleotide of the 3&#x02032; trailer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c11">11</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian 3&#x02032; tRNase is unique in that a relatively stable complex between the enzyme and a 3&#x02032;-truncated tRNA can function as a four-base-recognizing RNA cutter (RNase 65) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c17">17</xref>). Although little is known about the physiological role and substrate of RNase 65, it has been demonstrated that the 3&#x02032;-truncated tRNA directs substrate specificity via four base-pairings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c10">10</xref>). Another unique point is that mammalian 3&#x02032; tRNase possesses a property of being able to cleave any RNA at any site under the direction of small guide RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c20">20</xref>) like an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) underlying RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c21">21</xref>).</p><p>In addition to these studies focusing on 3&#x02032;-tRNase interactions with various pre-tRNAs and pre-tRNA-like complexes, we had also been making efforts towards cloning a 3&#x02032;-tRNase cDNA, and finally came across the prostate cancer susceptibility gene.</p></sec><sec><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Enzyme purification and microsequencing</title><p>Pig 3&#x02032; tRNase was intensively fractionated from liver basically as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c10">10</xref>), and further purified by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation.

At this point, the fusion protein was induced by adding IPTG (500 &#x000b5;M). After further incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 23 mM AEBSF, 100 mM EDTA, 2 mM Bestatin, 0.3 mM E-64, 0.3 mM pepstatin A).

Although we were not able to identify the &#x0223c;45 kDa protein, it could have been a proteolytic cleavage product of the &#x0223c;85 kDa protein. To determine an amino acid sequence of this further purified protein, we subjected the protein in an excised gel strip to trypsin digestion and analyzed resulting peptides with a mass spectrometer. Four internal peptide sequences, AEFLLLNHFSQR, LPLFSPDFNEK, VGLAFDHMK and ALFAGDLEEMEER, were derived and searched using BLAST against GenBank. The search suggested that the protein is the <italic>ELAC2</italic> gene product based on the fact that the human ELAC2 amino acid sequence includes all these peptide sequences with a few amino acid mismatches probably due to species difference (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f1">1</xref>B). The calculated molecular mass of human ELAC2 is 92 kDa, which is comparable to that of the pig enzyme estimated by the SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f1">1</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title>Human ELAC2 has the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity</title><p>To confirm that the <italic>ELAC2</italic> product really has the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity, the complete protein coding region of an <italic>ELAC2</italic> cDNA was PCR-amplified from a human testis cDNA library, and cloned into the <italic>E.coli</italic> expression vector pTYB11. The <italic>ELAC2</italic> product was over-expressed as an intein-containing precursor in <italic>E.coli</italic>, and purified with chitin beads by removing its intein portion. The protein sample was checked for purity by SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein profile showed two protein bands, one of &#x0223c;60 kDa and the other of &#x0223c;100 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f2">2</xref>). We analyzed both proteins with a mass spectrometer, and elucidated that the large and small proteins correspond to human ELAC2 and <italic>E.coli</italic> GroEL, respectively.

As shown for human ELAC2, the two species of cleavage products were generated by the fusion protein, while the cleavage was not observed in the presence of the &#x0223c;27 kDa GST protein alone (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f3">3</xref>B). This result shows that the cleavage of pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> is mediated directly by YKR079C and not by GST or by contaminating <italic>E.coli</italic> proteins. The 3&#x02032;-terminal sequence of the long cleavage product was determined as above, and the obtained sequence indicated that the cleavage occurs after the discriminator as in the case of human ELAC2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f4">4</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the <italic>YKR079C</italic> product is yeast 3&#x02032; tRNase. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that <italic>ELAC2</italic> indeed encodes tRNA 3&#x02032; processing endoribonuclease.</p></sec><sec><title>The C-terminal half of ELAC2 is essential for the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity</title><p>The multiple protein alignment of ELAC2 orthologs revealed that the C-terminal half regions have much higher similarity than the N&#x02010;terminal half regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>). Thus, we assumed that the essential domains including the catalytic domain should exist in the C-terminal half of 3&#x02032; tRNase. To test this possibility, we constructed two pTYB11 expression plasmids lacking either N&#x02010;terminal (residues 1&#x02013;481) or C-terminal (residues 481&#x02013;826) half-coding region, expressed and purified half proteins as described for the full-length ELAC2. The LC&#x0002f;MS&#x0002f;MS analysis showed that the recombinant C-terminal half (ELAC2-&#x00394;N) and N&#x02010;terminal half (ELAC2-&#x00394;C) 3&#x02032; tRNases had apparent molecular weights of &#x0223c;53 and &#x0223c;38 kDa, respectively, on an SDS&#x02013;10&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f2">2</xref>). Consistently, the calculated masses were 54 and 38 kDa, respectively. Both protein samples were contaminated with <italic>E.coli</italic> GroEL, and another unrelated <italic>E.coli</italic> protein of &#x0223c;50 kDa, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, was detected in the ELAC2-&#x00394;N sample. In the tRNA 3&#x02032; processing assay, ELAC2-&#x00394;N was able to cleave the pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>, while ELAC2-&#x00394;C was not at all (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f3">3</xref>B). These results suggest that the C-terminal half of 3&#x02032; tRNase is essential for its activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Human ELAC1 has also the tRNA 3&#x02032; processing activity</title><p>Interestingly, in the human genome exists a gene, <italic>ELAC1</italic>, which is very similar to, but about half the size of <italic>ELAC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>), and seems to correspond to the C-terminal half of 3&#x02032; tRNase from <italic>ELAC2</italic>. To examine whether ELAC1 has also the tRNA 3&#x02032; processing activity as ELAC2-&#x00394;N, we cloned a human cDNA encoding ELAC1 into the plasmid pGEX-4T-3, and expressed and purified the GST&#x02013;ELAC1 fusion protein as described for GST&#x02013;YKR079C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f2">2</xref>). On an SDS&#x02013;10&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel, GST&#x02013;ELAC1 appeared as a protein of &#x0223c;70 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f2">2</xref>), which is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of 66 kDa composed of 26 kDa from GST and 40 kDa from ELAC1. The protein identity was confirmed by LC&#x0002f;MS&#x0002f;MS analysis. From the 3&#x02032;-tRNase assay for GST&#x02013; ELAC1 and the RNA sequencing of the cleavage product, we demonstrated that the ELAC1 enzyme can also cleave pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> at the expected site (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f3">3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f4">4</xref>). This result emphasizes the importance of the C-terminal half domain of 3&#x02032; tRNase from <italic>ELAC2</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> containing a 5&#x02032; leader is also a good substrate for ELAC2 and ELAC1</title><p>Because pig liver 3&#x02032; tRNase can remove 3&#x02032; trailers efficiently even from pre-tRNAs containing 5&#x02032; leaders if the length of leaders is smaller than 9 nt, we examined whether the human pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> containing a 5&#x02032; leader R-6L6TUUU is also a substrate for human ELAC2. R-6L6TUUU was synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> with T7 RNA polymerase, and subsequently 5&#x02032;-end-labeled with fluorescein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f5">5</xref>A). In the 3&#x02032;-tRNase assay under the standard conditions, human recombinant ELAC2 cleaved R-6L6TUUU as efficiently as the pig liver enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f5">5</xref>B). We also examined the ELAC2-&#x00394;C, ELAC2-&#x00394;N, YKR079C and ELAC1 enzymes, and showed that these enzymes can cleave R-6L6TUUU with the exception of ELAC2-&#x00394;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f5">5</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>tRNA 3&#x02032; processing activities of enzyme variants associated with the occurrence of prostate cancer</title><p>It has been reported that two mutations in <italic>ELAC2</italic>, an insertion&#x0002f;frameshift (1641 ins G) and a missense change (Arg781His), segregate with prostate cancer in two pedigrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>). The frameshift mutation results in premature termination after the miscoding of 67 residues. In addition, two common missense changes, Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr, seem to be associated with the occurrence of prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c3">3</xref>). In order to investigate the effects of these mutations on the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity, we constructed eight expression plasmids which can produce one frameshift (ELAC2<sup>1641insG</sup>), three single missense (ELAC2<sup>Ser217Leu</sup>, ELAC2<sup>Ala541Thr</sup> and ELAC2<sup>Arg781His</sup>), three double missense (ELAC2<sup>Ser217Leu&#x0002f;Ala541Thr</sup>, ELAC2<sup>Ala541Thr&#x0002f;Arg781His</sup> and ELAC2<sup>Arg781His&#x0002f; Ser217Leu</sup>) or one triple missense (ELAC2<sup>Ser217Leu&#x0002f;Ala541Thr&#x0002f;Arg781His</sup>) variant enzyme, based upon pTYB11&#x0002f;ELAC2. These variants were expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, purified and assayed for 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity. Seven ELAC2 variants which contain one to three amino acid substitutions showed efficient 3&#x02032;-tRNase activities, while one truncated variant, which lacked a C-terminal half region, had no activity, emphasizing again the importance of the C-terminal domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg337f6">6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We purified 3&#x02032; tRNase from pig liver and determined its partial sequences by mass spectrometry. The BLAST search of them against GenBank suggested that the human <italic>ELAC2</italic> gene is the gene that encodes 3&#x02032; tRNase. To demonstrate this directly, we cloned the cDNA from human testis into the expression plasmid pTYB11, expressed it in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified the <italic>ELAC2</italic> product. The obtained ELAC2 sample clearly showed the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity, although it was contaminated with the bacterial GroEL. The possibility that GroEL has the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity was excluded by the experiment using the purchased pure GroEL. Another possibility that the observed activity is due to a trace amount of other contaminated bacterial proteins was also ruled out by the assay using the sample from mock transformed bacteria. Furthermore, we confirmed that a single yeast ortholog, YKR079C, has the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity by testing the recombinant yeast enzyme obtained through a different expression system with the vector pGEX-4T-3. We also showed that both recombinant enzymes, ELAC2 and YKR079C, can cleave pre-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> precisely after the discriminator nucleotide and that they can process not only pre-tRNA without a 5&#x02032; leader but also pre-tRNA with the leader like the pig liver 3&#x02032; tRNase. Therefore, we conclude that the gene <italic>ELAC2</italic> indeed encodes 3&#x02032; tRNase. In addition, our data suggest that no other protein factors and no eukaryote-specific modifications are essential for the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity of ELAC2.</p><p>The <italic>YKR079C</italic> gene has been shown to be indispensable for yeast viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>), suggesting that the yeast genome may have only one gene that encodes an enzyme responsible for correctly removing 3&#x02032; trailers from pre-tRNAs. Although a yeast 3&#x02032; tRNase with a molecular weight of 45&#x0002f;60 kDa has been identified, which can catalyze precise cleavage of a pre-tRNA at the discriminator site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c25">25</xref>), the gene of this enzyme was unidentified. It is possible that the 45&#x0002f;60 kDa proteins detected on the polyacrylamide gel are degradation products of the 97 kDa intact YKR079C protein. Even these about half-size degradation products, if they contain the majority of the C-terminal domain, should show the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity like ELAC2-&#x00394;N. Although several studies suggested the existence in yeast of another pathway to remove 3&#x02032; trailers by utilizing only exoribonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c26">26</xref>), the necessity of the <italic>YKR079C</italic> gene may argue against such pathways. Even in the situations where exoribonucleases can be involved in the pre-tRNA 3&#x02032; processing, the final cut to generate the discriminator termini for the CCA-adding enzyme may be carried out by 3&#x02032; tRNase. An alternative interpretation is also possible. The reason that the <italic>YKR079C</italic> gene is indispensable may be because the gene has another unknown essential function. Several unidentified yeast genes that are not related to <italic>YKR079C</italic> might also encode 3&#x02032; processing endoribonucleases.</p><p>We showed that human ELAC1, which is very similar to the C-terminal half domain of human ELAC2, has the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity. An ELAC1 ortholog of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has been also reported to show 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c27">27</xref>). These results are consistent with the observation that the C-terminal half of human ELAC2 is sufficient for the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity. Human ELAC2, human ELAC1 and their orthologs contain the histidine motif hhh&#x0005b;S&#x0002f;T&#x0005d;HXHXDHXXG (where h can be any bulky hydrophobic residue), which is highly conserved among them and forms a potential divalent metal ion binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c7">7</xref>). It has been demonstrated experimentally that several histidine motifs are crucial for catalysis by enzymes such as &#x003b2;-lactamases and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c28">28</xref>). Curiously, ELAC2-&#x00394;C did not show the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity at all, even though the N&#x02010;terminal half sequence is similar to the C-terminal one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>). This may be because of the lack of an intact histidine motif. The above consideration implies that the histidine motif is important for the 3&#x02032;-tRNase catalytic activity. In contrast, the Walker A motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c29">29</xref>) that exists in the N&#x02010;terminal half region of human ELAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>) is not essential for the activity. This ATP&#x0002f;GTP-binding motif may be involved in regulation of the catalysis by means of ATP or GTP.</p><p>BLAST searches revealed that the human genome contains both <italic>ELAC1</italic> and <italic>ELAC2</italic> genes, while the genomes of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> have only <italic>ELAC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>). This raises an interesting question whether the two distinct 3&#x02032; tRNases from <italic>ELAC1</italic> and <italic>ELAC2</italic> play differential roles in tRNA processing in the cells. It is possible that one is for nuclear tRNA processing, and that the other is for mitochondrial use. Although the iPSORT analysis for human ELAC2 predicted a mitochondrial localization, it has been reported recently that human ELAC2 exists both in cytoplasm and nuclei and interacts with the &#x003b3;-tubulin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c30">30</xref>). The ELAC2&#x0002f;&#x003b3;-tubulin interaction suggests an additional function of ELAC2 such as cell cycle regulation.</p><p>As expected, ELAC2<sup>1641insG</sup>, which lacks most of the C-terminal domain, did not show the enzymatic activity at all. Thus, 1641insG homozygotes must be lethal, unless the cells have another equivalent backup enzyme. Our data suggests that ELAC1 might be such an enzyme. Alternatively, some compensatory frameshift mechanism of the human translation system might generate an active enzyme. How could 1641insG heterozygotes confer increased risk of prostate cancer? The aberrant enzyme could interact with some unidentified regulatory factors, sequester them and interfere with the intact enzyme&#x02019;s function, resulting in perturbation of the network of cellular gene regulation. In contrast, from the present assays, we did not observe meaningful differences in the 3&#x02032;-tRNase activity between the wild-type ELAC2 and three single missense, three double missense and one triple missense variant enzymes. It is possible, however, that some differences could be detected when different pre-tRNA species are tested or kinetic parameters are measured. In any case, these missense variants all had sufficiently strong 3&#x02032;-tRNase activities, although the substitution of Ser217 with the bulky hydrophobic residue Leu could affect the protein structure, and Ala541 which lies at the amino border of the histidine motif could be important for the enzymatic activity. Whether there are causalities between prostate cancer and the above missense mutations in <italic>ELAC2</italic> is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg337c6">6</xref>). From our results, it seems that the causalities could be fairly complicated, if they exist. The variant enzymes could differentially interact with some unknown regulatory proteins, or could be degraded more easily than the wild type, resulting in perturbation of cellular normal metabolism. Although it would not be straightforward to elucidate how such mutations could lead the cells to a malignant state, the present study in which we found out the cellular function of the <italic>ELAC2</italic> product would be a great leap.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg337f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Purification and partial sequencing of pig 3&#x02032; tRNase.
