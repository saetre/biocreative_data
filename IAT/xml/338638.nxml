This study reports the isolation of a mouse Egr-1 genomic clone, its intron-exon structure, and 935 bp of 5' flanking sequence. The gene spans about 3.8 kb and consists of 2 exons and one 700 bp intron. S1 nuclease protection and primer extension analysis were used to define the transcription initiation site. "TATA" and "CCAAT" sequences were located at nucleotides -26 and -337 respectively. In addition, there exist five elements whose sequence is nearly identical to the inner core 10 nucleotide region (CCATATTAGG) of the c-fos serum response element, four Sp1 consensus sequences, two AP1 target sequence analogs, and two potential cAMP response elements. These results will ultimately lead to a detailed definition of the intracellular events regulating Egr-1 expression.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0095-a" xlink:role="8838"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0099-a" xlink:role="8842"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8835"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8836"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8837"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8838"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8839"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8840"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8841"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8842"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8843"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8844"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8845"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00160-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8846"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
