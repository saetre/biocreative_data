HOP was first identified in the developing heart where it modulates cardiac growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Surprisingly, for a homeodomain protein, HOP cannot bind DNA but exerts its action by interacting with Serum responsive factor (SRF) and blocking its transcriptional activity. This interaction was proposed to regulate the balance between cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation. In addition, HOP was described as a tumor suppressor gene, as its expression is lost or low in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and choriocarcinoma, where its re-expression can inhibit cancer growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the initial reports describing HOP in the heart, its expression was also detected in the developing neural tube and in the adult brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This, as well as its role as a regulator of differentiation in the heart, prompted us to assess a role for HOP in adult neurogenesis. Stem cell niches in the mouse forebrain's subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular layer (SGL) of the dentate gyrus (DG) add new neurons to the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus, respectively, in a sustained manner. These processes are tightly regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Cell death has been shown to be essential in the selection of newly formed neurons in the olfactory bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and DG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, even though apoptosis is an essential regulator of embryonic stem cell number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and despite the presence of apoptotic cells in both the SVZ and SGL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], little is known about the regulation of apoptosis in adult stem cell niches.</p><p>Cell lineages in these niches have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the DG, the progenitors of new neurons are SGL radial astrocytes (called B or type 1 cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These cells characteristically extend one or several radial processes across the entire granule cell layer, self-renew and give rise to immature intermediate precursors (D or type 2 cells), which divide and then mature into granule cells. Here, we show that <italic>HOP </italic>is expressed by radial astrocytic stem cells and increases neuronal production by promoting apoptosis of these cells.</p><p>It has been suggested that gliomas in general, and glioblastomas (GBMs) in particular, derive from the transformation of neural stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which may give rise to cancer stem cells. These cells are rare tumor cells that self-renew, are tumorigenic and may be responsible for tumor maintenance, recurrence and possibly metastasis. Since cell death is crucially involved in the regulation of tumor formation and since normal brain stem cells and glioma stem cells share common regulatory mechanisms, we investigated a role for HOP in GBMs.</p><p>We show that <italic>HOP </italic>is down-regulated in GBMs. Its re-expression induces apoptosis in two of four GBM cultures tested and decreases GBM cancer stem cell clonogenicity in one of them. We conclude that HOP is a new regulator of stem cell survival in the adult brain and that its deregulation may participate in the tumorigenic process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SGL radial astrocytic stem cells in the hippocampus express HOP</title><p>To localize <italic>HOP </italic>expression in detail in stem cell niches of the adult mouse brain, we performed <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and immunolocalization studies.

In contrast, they were found in the DG and, in particular, in cells of the SGL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a,b</xref>). The specificity of the immunolabeling with the anti-HOP antibody that we raised was proven by the lack of staining in the SGL of the <italic>HOP</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] that survive the embryonic period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>).

These siRNAs were rendered cell-permeable by reversibly coupling them to Penetratin, a small transducing peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The disulfide bond linking the siRNA and Penetratin is broken in the intracellular context, allowing the siRNA to work in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Infusing <italic>HOP </italic>siRNA-Penetratin into the brain, at a location just above the DG with micro-osmotic pumps, led to a dramatic reduction in HOP immunoreactivity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>) in the hippocampus, compared to the infusion of a control Penetratin-coupled siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>). Semi-quantification of the optical density revealed that HOP signal was reduced by 78% &#x000b1; 5 standard error of the mean (SEM; n = 5). To avoid any possible non-specific effects due to direct injection damage of the DG, the infusions were repeated at a distance, into the lateral ventricle, and diffusion into the hippocampus was verified with a fluorescent siRNA. Lateral ventricle infusions of <italic>HOP </italic>siRNA resulted in a decrease of the optical density by 39% &#x000b1; 3 SEM (n = 5), as compared with control siRNA infusions. <italic>HOP</italic>-siRNA and control siRNA-treated mice infused for three days in the lateral ventricle showed similar levels of BrdU incorporation in SGL GFAP<sup>+ </sup>stem cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2h</xref>). We conclude that HOP does not control the proliferation of hippocampal stem cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Hippocampal SGL stem cell survival requires HOP function</title><p>To evaluate a possible role of HOP in stem cell survival, we analyzed the number of TUNEL<sup>+ </sup>SGL cells in wild-type and <italic>HOP</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a,b</xref>).

The amount of TUNEL<sup>+ </sup>cells expressing <italic>HOP </italic>was 82% &#x000b1; 4 SEM (223 cells of 3 animals), indicating their SGL astrocytic and thus stem cell nature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c&#x02013;i</xref>). TUNEL<sup>+</sup>/HOP<sup>- </sup>cells are likely to be committed neuronal precursors (D/type 2 cells) or neurons, which are normally pruned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Given that a large majority of apoptotic SGL cells in wild-type animals are HOP<sup>+ </sup>and that this number is reduced in the absence of HOP, we conclude that HOP is a pro-apoptotic factor in SGL radial astrocytic stem cells in the hippocampus.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>HOP regulates apoptosis of SGL astrocytic stem cells.

Thus, to resolve between these two possibilities, we tested the effects of an acute knock-down of HOP in the hippocampus of adult mice through RNA interference with cell-permeable siRNAs as described above. After three days of siRNA-Penetratin infusions, mice were pulsed with BrdU and kept for an additional three weeks to be able to assess newly formed neurons in the DG. This treatment led to a 1.7-fold increase in the number of newly formed NeuN<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+ </sup>neurons in mice infused with <italic>HOP </italic>siRNA compared to mice infused with a control siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>; n = 5, Mann-Whitney <italic>U </italic>test, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). The lower penetrance of the RNA interference phenotype (1.7-fold) versus that seen in knock out mice (2.5-fold) is consistent with the common incomplete effects of RNA interference compared with gene deletions. Notwithstanding this difference, the data support a direct role of HOP in the regulation of hippocampal stem cell apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Human glioblastomas display low levels of HOP expression</title><p>Faulty apoptotic control of stem cell lineages could underlie or favor the development of tumors. Gliomas are common adult human brain tumors that are thought to derive, at least in part, from stem cell lineages and harbor cancer stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We thus tested the possibility that loss of <italic>HOP</italic>, which decreases apoptosis in the normal mouse hippocampal stem cell niche, marks human gliomas. Here we have focused on grade IV astrocytomas (or GBMs), which are the most aggressive and invasive type of gliomas and display poor prognosis.</p><p>Analysis by quantitative RT-PCR of four independent glioblastomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] (GBM-6, -7, -8, -10) showed that <italic>HOP </italic>mRNA is down-regulated in tumor excisions compared to the normal cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). Nine normal brain samples were used: one sample of hippocampus from an adult donor, four samples of prefrontal cortex from different adult donors; three samples from the same child donor from three different regions of the cortex (frontal, parietal and temporal); and one commercial sample of total adult brain RNA. On average, expression of HOP was higher in normal samples than in glioma resections. Given the highly invasive nature of GBMs, surgically removed tumors are bound to contain a high proportion of normal brain cells. We thus measured HOP mRNA expression in glioma neurosphere cultures (gliomaspheres), derived from the same matched excision samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These cultures contain and are driven by self-renewing cancer stem cells and are tumorigenic, mimicking the original tumor after transplantation into the brain of nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. <italic>HOP </italic>mRNA expression was very low in the four GBM stem cell cultures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>).

Purified full-length HOP protein, which itself is not cell permeable, was coupled with Penetratin peptide, thus rendering it cell permeable and functional in GBM cells after internalization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). As control, we used the homeodomain of Knotted (Kn-HD), a plant homeoprotein, which can naturally penetrate into cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Analysis of Ki67<sup>+ </sup>cycling cells in GMB-6 stem cell cultures showed no difference in the percentage of proliferating cells after internalization of HOP-Penetratin versus Kn-HD (8.72% &#x000b1; 0.75 SEM versus 8.53% &#x000b1; 0.72 SEM). In contrast, HOP internalization triggered a 50% increase in apoptosis, as measured by the percentage of apoptotic cleaved-Caspase 3<sup>+ </sup>cells compared to Kn-HD (13.9% &#x000b1; 1.1 SEM versus 9.81% &#x000b1; 0.87 SEM; <italic>p </italic>= 0.0001). Restored HOP function in human GBM-6 stem cell lineages is thus able to induce apoptosis without affecting proliferation. Similarly, HOP-Penetratin increased apoptosis in GBM-11 cells, which express high levels of <italic>HOP</italic>, compared with Kn-HD (10% &#x000b1; 0.9 SEM versus 5.81% &#x000b1; 0.46 SEM; <italic>p </italic>= 0.05), whereas no difference in their proliferation was measured by Ki67 staining (1.76% &#x000b1; 0.05 SEM versus 1.7% &#x000b1; 0.12 SEM). In contrast, still in comparison with Kn-HD, HOP-Penetratin did not modify apoptosis in GBM-8 cells (9.7 &#x000b1; 1.31 SEM versus 7.63 &#x000b1; 1.05 SEM; <italic>p </italic>= 0.24), which express low levels of HOP, or in GBM-12 cells (3.75% &#x000b1; 1.4 SEM versus 3.29% &#x000b1; 0.47 SEM), which express higher levels. This also confirmed the lack of non-specific effects of HOP-Penetratin in GBM cells. HOP is thus able to induce apoptotic cell death only in a subset of gliomaspheres with varying levels of endogenous HOP. Analyses of the growth rates of these cultures revealed that HOP was effective only in those that grew poorly: GBM-12 gliomasphere cultures had three times more cells than GBM-6 or GBM-11 cultures after six days under identical conditions and starting with the same number of cells (M Vukicekic and ARA, unpublished). The basis of this difference is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>HOP regulates the self-renewal of apoptosis-sensitive glioma cancer stem cells</title><p>To test if HOP could affect stem cell self-renewal, we used GMB-6 cells that show a clear increase in apoptosis when treated with HOP-Penetratin. GMB-6 gliomaspheres were treated as above but in suspension to allow internalization of HOP-Penetratin or Kn-HD as control and to be able to plate one cell per well in 96-well plates. After two weeks of growth, gliomaspheres were counted in triplicates assays. It should be noted that clonal analyses of glioblastoma cells is stringent even in the presence of 50% conditioned media since these cells do not readily grow in isolation. HOP induced a ten-fold reduction in the number of clonogenic units (gliomaspheres) compared with Kn-HD (0.3% &#x000b1; 0.32 SEM versus 3% &#x000b1; 0 SEM; <italic>p </italic>= 0.01). HOP is thus able to induce apoptosis of glioma stem cells and decrease clonogenicity, used here as a measure of self-renewal.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We find that HOP is expressed in the adult hippocampal stem cell niche from E14.5 to adulthood. Expression is in all DG astrocytes and at high levels in SGL radial astrocytes. HOP protein is not detected in the adult SVZ, the second site of adult neurogenesis, but it is present in Bergmann glial cells in the cerebellum (data not shown), the only other radial astrocytes in the adult brain, confirming and extending previous mRNA localization data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>We describe here a new mode of regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis through modulation of adult progenitor death. A recent study has shown that 85% of the variance in neurogenesis between strains could be explained by different cell-survival rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, attention has been focused on newly formed neurons in the olfactory bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or DG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but not on their progenitors. In contrast, developmental studies have established that apoptosis contributes to the number of neural stem cells and progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the adult brain, apoptotic cells are present in the SVZ and SGL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and, in the SVZ, some of these apoptotic cells are astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A role for apoptosis on the regulation of SVZ stem cells is also suggested by their enhanced number in mice deficient for the pro-apoptotic genes <italic>Bax </italic>and <italic>Bak </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our work extends this concept to adult DG stem cells and, furthermore, identifies HOP as a positive regulator of apoptosis in these cells.</p><p>As fewer hippocampal progenitors die in mice lacking HOP, one could predict that loss of HOP may lead to a change of the total number of progenitors. However, the number of GFAP<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+ </sup>cells (reflecting the number of progenitors) is the same in <italic>HOP </italic>null and wild-type siblings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). We have also counted the number of SGL cells expressing Sox2, a marker of actively dividing astrocytic DG progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and found no difference in the number of Sox2<sup>+ </sup>SGL cells between wild-type and <italic>HOP </italic>null mice (not shown). The reduction of hippocampal progenitor death in mice lacking HOP, therefore, does not lead to an increase in their number. A reduction in progenitor death not leading to an increase in their abundance is puzzling, although it could be explained by a difference in the choice between symmetric and asymmetric divisions in wild-type versus <italic>HOP </italic>null hippocampal stem cells. Indeed, GBM cells that increase apoptosis in response to enhanced HOP levels also decrease their self-renewal (as measured by their clonogenicity). Therefore, there may be a mechanism that senses overall cell numbers and that regulates self-renewal and apoptosis in normal and tumorigenic stem cell lineages.</p><p>HOP has been shown to interact with SRF in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] where it acts as an inhibitor of SRF transcriptional activity. Specific SRF invalidation leads to embryonic lethal cardiac defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. These mice display an abnormally thin myocardium due to increased apoptosis without changes in proliferation. This result is consistent with ours, suggesting that HOP in radial DG progenitors may bind SRF and inhibit its activity We have started to investigate this possibility and find that HOP is co-immunoprecipitated with SRF from hippocampal extracts (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). It is also known that SRF promotes cell survival by activating the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene <italic>Bcl2 </italic>in embryonic stem cell and early embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. One could thus hypothesize that HOP acts in DG progenitors by inhibiting SRF activation of the <italic>Bcl2 </italic>gene. We tried to test this hypothesis by comparing Bcl2 expression in wild-type and knock out mice by quantitative RT-PCR but since the vast majority of hippocampal cells express Bcl2, a potential difference in a minority of progenitors could not be quantified.</p><p>The deregulation of apoptosis in hippocampal stem cells could contribute to dysfunction and/or disease. We report a common down-regulation of <italic>HOP </italic>in glioma excisions (which contain both tumor and normal surrounding tissues) compared to controls and even lower levels of <italic>HOP </italic>in gliomaspheres (which only contain tumor-derived cancer stem cell lineages). Experimentally, increased HOP expression enhanced apoptosis in a subset of gliomasphere cultures. Differences in responsiveness to HOP might depend, for instance, on the region of origin of the tumor or on the presence of co-factors necessary for HOP pro-apoptotic function. The apoptotic-inducing activity of HOP, albeit context-dependent, may be related to its normal function, as brain tumors are thought to derive from the transformation of stem cells and/or progenitors in adult neurogenic regions. Indeed, alterations in the cellular mechanisms that control adult neurogenesis might contribute to tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This is consistent with different studies describing HOP as a possible tumor suppressor because of its down-regulation in choriocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. HOP might thus participate in the regulation of stem cell behavior both in normal and in tumorigenic contexts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We describe here a new function for the homeoprotein HOP as a negative regulator of hippocampal stem cell survival. Our work provides the first evidence that apoptosis of stem cells can regulate adult neurogenesis. In addition, <italic>HOP </italic>expression is low in gliomas and its re-expression in gliomaspheres induces apoptosis and a reduction of glioma cancer stem cell self-renewal in a subset of cases. We suggest that HOP acts as a tumor suppressor in the hippocampal stem cell niche, where its loss could favor the inappropriate survival of stem cells and their descendants, increasing cell numbers and contributing thus to tumor growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>HOP cloning and antibody production</title><p>HOP cDNA was cloned from hippocampal mRNA and subcloned into pGEM vectors for riboprobe synthesis and pGEX vectors for protein production.
