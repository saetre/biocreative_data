Importantly, strong c-Fos activation is also detected in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), particularly in neurons that co-express alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (&#x003b1;-MSH), the anorexigenic product of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene. Interestingly, other hypothalamic regions such as the paraventricular nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus and the lateral hypothalamic area also show c-Fos induction after PP injection. In addition to c-Fos activation, PP injection up-regulates POMC mRNA expression in the ARC as detected by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. These effects are a direct consequence of local Y4 signaling, since hypothalamus-specific conditional Y4 receptor knockout abolishes PP-induced ARC c-Fos activation and blocks the PP-induced increase in POMC mRNA expression.

There is an urgent need for novel strategies to boost the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for weight loss.</p><p>Recent interest has surged in the possible pharmaceutical use of ligands for Y receptors as anti-obesity agents. Y receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5 and y6) are a family of G-protein-coupled receptors with three endogenous ligands: the orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) as well as the gut-derived satiety hormones peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). Much interest has focused on pharmacological antagonism of Y1 and Y5 receptors, due to their designation as &#x02018;feeding receptors&#x02019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Iyengar1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Y2 receptors have also been flagged as potential targets for novel anti-obesity agents, since PYY3-36, an endogenous Y2-preferring ligand, reduces food intake in lean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Batterham1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and obese <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Batterham2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> humans and reduces body weight and adiposity after chronic administration to obese rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Pittner1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Chelikani1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Like other gut-derived satiety hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1, however, PYY3-36 has been shown to induce nausea or conditioned taste aversion at doses that reduce food intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Halatchev1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Parkinson1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Gantz1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

Animal studies suggest that long-term administration of PP would lead to significant benefits in the treatment of obesity.

The aim of this study was to determine the pathways subsequent to Y4 receptor activation via which PP reduces food intake, with particular focus on the early responses to Y4 agonism within the ARC. This was achieved with c-Fos immunostaining to determine which regions of the brain are activated at 30 minutes after PP injection, as well as double immunohistochemistry to determine which neurons are activated by PP, and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to determine acute effects of PP on expression of key hypothalamic regulators of energy homeostasis. Additionally, we used conditional deletion of Y4 receptors within the ARC to determine the specific involvement of these receptors in processes that regulate food intake in response to PP. Finally, we used germline knockout of molecules activated by Y4 agonism, in order to demonstrate the pathways through which Y4 receptor agonism induces its effects on the ARC and subsequently on food intake.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement and Animals</title><p>All research and animal care procedures were approved by the Garvan Institute / St Vincent's Hospital Animal Ethics Committee and the study was conducted in accordance with the Garvan Institute's guidelines for animal husbandry.

PP injection. Significant increases in the number of c-Fos immunoreactive neurons were detected in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and the area postrema (AP) of the brainstem as well as in the ARC as early as 30 minutes after PP injection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008488-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008488-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These c-Fos responses to PP were transient, because at 90 minutes post injection the levels of c-Fos positive neurons in the NTS, AP and ARC were no longer different from baseline levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008488-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, other regions of the hypothalamus showed increased c-Fos labeling also at 90 minutes after PP injection, namely the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMHDM) and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008488-t001">Table 1</xref>). Noteworthy is the fact that the level of c-Fos immunoreactivity in the PVN and LHA was significantly greater at 90 minutes than at 30 minutes after PP injection, suggesting that the heightened response in these nuclei at 90 minutes may include secondary responses to initial activation of other neurons in brain regions such as the brainstem or ARC. Saline injected control mice did not show any difference in c-Fos immunoreactivity at 90 minutes compared to 30 minutes in any brain area (data not shown). Consistent with a specific role of Y4 receptors in PP-induced neuronal activation, these increases in c-Fos immunoreactivity were not observed in the brains of Y4 receptor knockout mice after PP injection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008488-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008488-g001">Figure 1</xref>). As further functional evidence that PP activates intracellular processes within the ARC, immunoreactivity for phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (P-Erk1/2), a marker of activation of intracellular signaling cascades affected by G-protein-coupled receptors, was strongly increased at 30 minutes after i.p.

Moreover, the ability of Y4 receptor agonism with PP to activate the ARC POMC / &#x003b1;-MSH system is mediated by Y4 receptors within the ARC, since conditional knockout of Y4 receptors specifically in this area abolishes PP-induced activation of c-Fos and induction of POMC expression in the ARC. Furthermore, double labeling revealed that the ARC neurons activated by peripheral PP contained immunoreactivity for &#x003b1;-MSH as well as GAD65, a key enzyme in the synthesis of GABA. Besides enhancing ARC mRNA expression of the precursor for &#x003b1;-MSH, POMC, peripheral PP injection significantly inhibits expression of GAD65 with no effect on ARC NPY mRNA expression.Taken together, these findings suggest that peripheral PP may act on Y4 receptors within the ARC to activate &#x003b1;-MSH- and GABA-ergic neurons and thereby stimulate POMC and inhibit GAD65 mRNA expression, ultimately increasing &#x003b1;-MSH action on MC4Rs and reducing food intake.</p><p>While it is clear that hypothalamic Y4 receptors (i.e. in the ARC) are required for PP-induced neuronal activation and stimulation of POMC mRNA expression, this effect could be mediated by direct and / or indirect effects on POMC neurons. Y4 receptors are known to be expressed in the ARC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Parker2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, but it is not known on which neurons (e.g. POMC or GABA-ergic neurons) they are expressed. Our data support the possibility that PP influences POMC neurons via indirect action on GABA-ergic neurons. Indeed, PP increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in GAD65-expressing neurons, but at the same time significantly reduced GAD65 mRNA expression. Whereas PP-induced activation of c-Fos immunoreactivity in GAD65-expressing neurons is most likely via activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway by the &#x003b2;&#x003b3;-subunits of the G-protein that is coupled to Y4 receptors, inhibition of GAD65 mRNA expression in response to PP probably involves Y4 receptor-initiated inhibition of cAMP production via &#x003b1; subunits of the Gi/o protein coupled to Y4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Levi1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Mahon1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, thereby reducing GABAergic neurotransmission onto POMC neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-AcunaGoycolea1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. GABA synthesized in the ARC is released within the ARC as well as in other brain regions to modulate neuronal circuits that control physiological responses such as food intake.

Albeit co-localization of Y4 receptors on ARC GABA-ergic neurons remains to be demonstrated, these findings raise the possibility that the action of PP on Y4 receptors on GABA-ergic neurons in the ARC could contribute to PP-induced hypophagia via inhibition of GABA-ergic inputs to POMC neurons, with a subsequent increase in POMC expression and &#x003b1;-MSH transmission.</p><p>These data also show that &#x02013; unlike the melanocortin system and GAD65 expression &#x02013; ARC NPY mRNA expression was not altered after PP injection. This is in keeping with our observation that PP injection induced c-Fos activity in the lateral (not dorsal) aspect of the ARC, a region known to express POMC but not NPY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008488-Smith1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our current data suggest that any effect of PP on hypothalamic NPY expression is not a primary effect of PP action. In contrast, this work reveals a key role of the melanocortin system in mediating satiety in response to PP. Interestingly, not all gut satiety hormones act via the melanocortin system.
