Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) is strongly expressed in lesional psoriatic epidermis, and recently we have shown that high beta-defensin genomic copy number is associated with psoriasis susceptibility. It is not known, however, if biologically and pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of hBD-2 protein are present <italic>in vivo,</italic> which could support an antimicrobial and proinflammatory role of beta-defensins in lesional psoriatic epidermis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We found that systemic levels of hBD-2 showed a weak but significant correlation with beta defensin copy number in healthy controls but not in psoriasis patients with active disease. In psoriasis patients but not in atopic dermatitis patients, we found high systemic hBD-2 levels that strongly correlated with disease activity as assessed by the PASI score. Our findings suggest that systemic levels in psoriasis are largely determined by secretion from involved skin and not by genomic copy number. Modelling of the <italic>in vivo</italic> epidermal hBD-2 concentration based on the secretion rate in a reconstructed skin model for psoriatic epidermis provides evidence that epidermal hBD-2 levels <italic>in vivo</italic> are probably well above the concentrations required for <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial and chemokine-like effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Serum hBD-2 appears to be a useful surrogate marker for disease activity in psoriasis. The discrepancy between hBD-2 levels in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis could explain the well known differences in infection rate between these two diseases.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Psoriasis is a highly prevalent inflammatory skin disease that has both environmental and genetic components to its etiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Bowcock1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Nickoloff1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Genetic evidence for an (auto)immune basis of psoriasis is provided by the well-known association of the disease with the HLA-Cw6 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Nair1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and the recently discovered associations with IL12B and IL23R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Cargill1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Capon1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Lesional psoriatic skin is characterized by various morphological abnormalities of the epidermis, and a cellular infiltrate of activated T-cells. There are several arguments to invoke an important role of activated T-cells such as the oligoclonal T-cell expansion in psoriatic skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Menssen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and the therapeutic efficacy of T-cell directed drugs such as cyclosporin A and some of the biologics that are currently available. Recent evidence also points to a role of other cell types such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Nestle1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, and cytokine networks associated with cells from the adaptive and innate immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Bowcock1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Nickoloff2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on clinical studies in humans and experimental studies in mice, several of these cytokines have been identified including IL-1, TNF&#x003b1;, interferon-&#x003b3; and IL-6. In the epidermis a regenerative epidermal differentiation program is induced that includes hyperproliferation and expression of genes such as cytokeratin 16 (CK16), SKALP/elafin, psoriasin and hBD-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Harder1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-deJongh1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of these genes is to some extent specific for psoriasis, as they are expressed at low levels, if at all, in lesional atopic dermatitis skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Ong1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Nomura2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recent findings from various labs including our own have indicated that polymorphisms of genes that are expressed in the epithelium, but not necessarily in immunocytes, could also be risk factors for inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Cookson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-deCid1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding was further supported at the cellular level when we found cell-autonomous differences between keratinocytes from psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Zeeuwen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. From these studies we concluded that psoriatic keratinocytes are programmed to secrete large amounts of host defense proteins such as beta-defensins, in response to Th1 or Th17 cytokines.</p><p>Beta-defensins are secreted peptides of low molecular weight ranging from 3 to 5 kDa. These peptides, which are expressed by epithelia, possess a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi and viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Ganz1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides antimicrobial activity, they also exhibit pro-inflammatory properties as chemoattractants for memory T-cells, immature dendritic cells, mast cells and neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Yang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Niyonsaba2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. These peptides, encoded by the <italic>DEFB</italic> genes, are present in three main gene clusters, two on chromosome 20 and one on 8p23.1. The cluster on 8p23.1 contains eight beta-defensin genes of which seven (all but <italic>DEFB1</italic>) are on a large repeat that is variable in copy number. In humans up to 12 copies of this repeat have been found, with a mode of four copies per diploid genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Hollox2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Of the eight beta-defensin genes located on 8p23.1, human beta-defensin-1 (hBD-1) protein, (encoded by <italic>DEFB1</italic>) and hBD-3 (encoded by <italic>DEFB103</italic>) are constitutively expressed at low levels in skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Harder2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. hBD-2 (encoded by <italic>DEFB4</italic>) is not expressed in normal skin but is highly expressed in psoriatic skin. hBD-4 (encoded by <italic>DEFB104</italic>) is less well characterized at the protein level but is found in skin by RT-PCR. hBD-2, hBD-3 and hBD-4 can be induced by cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharides in various epithelial cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Liu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been shown that antimicrobial peptides in general, and above all hBD-2, are induced in lesional epidermal cells of patients with psoriasis, compared with lesional epidermal cells of patients with atopic dermatitis and normal skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-deJongh1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Ong1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings have been interpreted to explain the observed high infection rate in atopic dermatitis and the relatively low prevalence of bacterial and viral infections among psoriasis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Henseler1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to their direct antimicrobial activity, the chemotactic properties of antimicrobial proteins like LL-37 and beta-defensins are thought to amplify leukocyte recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Gallo1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, thereby contributing to an effective antimicrobial response. In non-infectious inflammatory diseases like psoriasis, beta-defensins could augment the influx of T-cells and dendritic cells, and thereby contribute to chronicity and sustained disease. Although the antimicrobial and chemotactic activities <italic>in vitro</italic> have been well documented, there are no quantitative data on <italic>in vivo</italic> concentrations of beta-defensins to substantiate a role of these molecules in host defense or inflammation. In this study we have made a detailed analysis of systemic and epidermal defensin concentrations. We show that both genetic factors and disease activity determine defensin protein expression. Evidence is provided that the <italic>in vivo</italic> concentration of hBD-2 is well above the minimal concentrations that are required for biological activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and healthy subjects</title><p>All psoriasis patients had plaque-type psoriasis diagnosed by a dermatologist.

Defensins are secreted proteins that will easily pass basal membranes, and we expected that epithelium-expressed defensins would reach the circulation and could be measured in serum by ELISA. On the basis of the limited expression of hBD-2 in normal human tissues, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004725-g001">figure 1</xref>, we expected low levels of protein in normal human serum. We developed and validated an ELISA that was sensitive and specific for hBD-2 to allow measurement of low serum hBD-2 levels. In addition, commercially available ELISA kits were used to measure hBD-2 and hBD-3 protein in serum. We have previously shown that most beta-defensin genes on 8p23.1 (including those that encode hBD-2 and hBD-3) are subject to copy number variation. So far no studies have been published that investigated the relation between copy number and protein expression. Here we selected 70 healthy individuals without inflammatory skin disease, that were typed for beta-defensin copy number using multiplex amplifiable probe hybridization (MAPH), restriction enzyme digest variant ratio (REDVR) and paralogue ratio test (PRT). In the normal population, copy number classes of 3 to 5 defensin repeats per diploid genome are the most prevalent. We selected individuals to include sufficient numbers of the more rare copy classes of 2 and 6 to allow analysis of correlation between genomic copy number and serum hBD-2 protein. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004725-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows that there is a modest but highly significant correlation between copy number and hBD-2 protein concentration in serum.

Here we have quantified circulating levels of hBD-2 and hBD-3 by ELISA in healthy volunteers and patients with inflammatory diseases. To assess which of the normal human epithelia would contribute to steady state systemic protein levels, we first performed a comprehensive qPCR analysis of the three major epidermal defensins, hBD-1, -2 and -3 in a large panel of human tissues. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004725-g001">figure 1</xref>, hBD-1 mRNA is widely expressed, and is not subject to regulation by inflammation, as it is not highly induced in psoriatic skin. Measurement of hBD-1 protein in serum would have provided a reference value for a beta-defensin that is expected to be rather constant as it is not present on the psoriasis-associated repeat. We were however unsuccessful in measuring hBD-1 protein by ELISA (not shown). hBD-2 mRNA appears to be expressed constitutively by a few tissues (e.g. oral epithelia), and was indeed found at the protein level albeit weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004725-g002">figure 2</xref>). hBD-2 is absent from normal trunk skin, but it is expressed at low levels in plantar skin. Consequently, serum hBD-2 levels in healthy individuals are very low (less than 1 ng per ml). In addition to our own ELISA (recombinant hBD-2 for calibration), we also used a commercial hBD-2 ELISA kit that uses synthetic hBD-2 for calibration. Although there was a good correlation between the data of both assays (Pearson r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.9), the commercial ELISA yielded apparent hBD-2 serum concentrations 10-fold higher than our ELISA. We found that this was caused by a difference in immunoreactivity of the calibration standards used. We used the values obtained with recombinant hBD-2 throughout this paper, as a conservative estimate of hBD-2 concentration.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004725-g003">figure 3</xref>, genomic copy number only explains part of the variance in serum hBD-2 levels. This is unlikely to be caused by experimental error. We considered sampling error as a potential cause, but we did not find variation in serum hBD-2 level depending on the time of blood sample collection (early morning versus late afternoon). Longitudinal data showed only minor fluctuation of serum hBD-2 levels in blood taken with two-year intervals (not shown). We speculate that the large variation of protein levels in each copy class could be caused by variation in expression regulation, or alternatively, by genetic variation in the defensin copies themselves. Although there is currently no information on the existence of non-functional gene copies within the repeat, this would obviously affect the gene-protein correlation, and it could also affect the observed association with psoriasis, which clearly requires further investigation.</p><p>Although our findings indicate that uninduced hBD-2 production is subject to gene dosage effects, the high systemic serum levels in psoriasis patients are caused by disease activity itself. We think this indicates that hBD-2 can be used as an objective, quantitative marker for disease activity in psoriasis. There are very few reliable serum markers for disease activity in psoriasis. Candidate proteins that are overexpressed in lesional epidermis include SKALP/elafin and psoriasin/S100A7, but only SKALP/elafin was found to correlate with disease activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Alkemade2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Anderson1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous studies have suggested that conventional surrogate markers for disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are not useful for chronic plaque psoriasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Laurent1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. For this reason we looked at the correlation between PASI scores and CRP in a cohort of our own patients that were monitored over time. We did not find a significant correlation between CRP and PASI for 1305 patient visits (data not shown), again suggesting that serum hBD-2 could be a convenient way to monitor disease activity or therapeutic effects.</p><p>At the tissue level, hBD-2 secretion will be determined both by copy number and by stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines. Our data also suggest that disease activity in atopic dermatitis is correlated with serum hBD-2. However, the epidermal expression in atopic dermatitis is far lower than in psoriasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-deJongh1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Ong1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, presumably resulting from the distinct cytokine environments of these diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Nickoloff2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Leung1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. We could indeed show that Th2 cytokines do not induce hBD-2 expression in cultured keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Zeeuwen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and that Th2 cytokines repress the Th1 induced expression (not shown here), as was previously shown for hBD-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Howell1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. An additional level of regulation of hBD-2 expression is the responsiveness of cells to pro-inflammatory cytokines. We have recently shown that cell-autonomous differences exist between keratinocytes of psoriasis patients, atopic dermatitis patients and controls with respect to innate immune responses following Th1 cytokine stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Zeeuwen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> . We would speculate that there are apparently three mechanisms that contribute to high levels of hBD-2 in psoriatic epidermis: a dominant Th1 or Th17 cytokine profile, increased cell-autonomous responsiveness to cytokine stimulation, and high defensin genomic copy number. Although defensins are endowed with cytokine-like properties themselves, there is no information on a possible autocrine effect of hBD-2 on keratinocytes whereby it would induce or sustain its own production. This is clearly an area worth investigating.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the biological activities of human and mouse beta-defensins, such as antimicrobial activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Harder1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, chemotaxis of T-cells and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Yang3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, and activation of TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Biragyn1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In general, many antimicrobial proteins appear to be endowed with other immune-modulatory activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-DiNardo1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Braff1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings have raised the intriguing possibility that beta-defensins are part of the innate immune system that provides a link between the epithelium and the adaptive immune system. This would fit the emerging concept of inflammatory epithelial diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Cookson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> that is supported by findings on the genetics of atopic dermatitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Palmer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, Crohn's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Fellermann1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> and celiac disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Monsuur1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. This would also explain the clinical observation that both T-cell directed drugs (cyclosporine A, UVB, some biologicals) and keratinocyte-directed drugs (retinoids, vitamin D3 derivatives) are effective in the treatment of psoriasis.</p><p>The defensin concentrations used in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to demonstrate their biological activity and their relevance for the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, should be interpreted with some caution. For example, the antimicrobial activity of hBD-2 can only be demonstrated at low salt conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004725-Bals1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, at least in low micromolar concentrations. Notwithstanding these considerations, we attempted to make an estimate of the actual hBD-2 concentration in an active psoriatic lesion. Although there are some caveats associated with modelling of the <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue concentrations based on an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstructed skin model, it is clear that the hBD-2 levels in epidermis and papillary dermis are well above the minimal concentrations that would cause a biological effect in an experimental setting, even allowing for an error of one order of magnitude. Remarkably, we found very little hBD-3 protein in the circulation. Only in a few psoriasis patients we observed detectable levels up to 0.5 ng/ml, which is 160-fold lower than the hBD-2 concentration in patients with severe psoriasis. Whether this also reflects low hBD-3 protein production in the epidermis requires further investigation.</p><p>Our previous finding on the genetic association of psoriasis with the defensin cluster did not allow discrimination between the seven defensins or defensin-like genes contained in the repeated segment. On the basis of available expression data we predicted that hBD-2 and hBD-3 would be the best candidates. Here we provide further evidence that, based on copy number dependent and disease-specific gene expression, high cutaneous protein levels and its known proinflammatory properties, hBD-2 is one of the strongest psoriasis candidate genes contained in the beta defensin cluster on chromosome 8.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004725.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Primers for qPCR</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004725.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004725.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Diffusion model</p><p>(0.35 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004725.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004725.s003"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Calculation of hBD-2 mass transport in reconstructed skin model</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004725.s003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge prof P.C.M. van de Kerkhof, dr P.G.M. van der Valk and dr R.Driessen (department of Dermatology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre), prof P. van Riel, dr C.
