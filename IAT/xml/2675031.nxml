Because the generation of these regulatory T cells is also induced by exposure to transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; and antigen or F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells exposed to TGF-&#x003b2; and antigen <italic>in vitro</italic>, we investigated (i) whether these cells are produced in dominant negative receptor for transforming growth factor &#x003b2; receptor type II (dnTGF&#x003b2;RII) or Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice whose T cells are resistant to TGF-&#x003b2;, (ii) whether DTH is suppressed by wild type (WT) CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells in Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and dnTGF&#x003b2;RII mice and (iii) the effect of antibodies to TGF-&#x003b2; on the suppression of DTH by CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells. DnTGF&#x003b2;RII immunized and Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice produced splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory cells after the intracameral injection of antigen and immunization. The suppression of a DTH reaction by CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells in WT mice was blocked by the local inclusion of antibodies to TGF-&#x003b2; when WT splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells were injected into the DTH reaction site. Moreover, the DTH reaction in immunized dnTGF&#x003b2;RII and Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was not suppressed by the transfer of WT CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells to the site challenged with antigen. In aggregate, these observations suggest that T cell sensitivity to TGF-&#x003b2; is not an obligate requirement for the <italic>in vivo</italic> induction of CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL T cells but the suppression of an <italic>in vivo</italic> DTH reaction by CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells is dependent on TGF-&#x003b2;.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>regulatory T cell</kwd><kwd>TGF-&#x003b2;</kwd><kwd>tolerance/suppression</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The antigen-specific suppression of T cells to self and non-self antigens in T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 immune responses is effected by CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells that are distinct from CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).

The immunosuppressive properties of TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) suggest that this cytokine could be a suppressive mechanism used <italic>in vivo</italic> by CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells. Accordingly, TGF-&#x003b2; potentially could have an afferent and/or efferent role in the immunosuppression mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells.</p><p>In the current studies, we investigated requirements for T cell sensitivity to TGF-&#x003b2; for the generation <italic>in vivo</italic> of splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells induced by the injection of antigen into the AC by using two genetically engineered strains of mice, dominant negative receptor for transforming growth factor &#x003b2; receptor type II (dnTGF&#x003b2;RII) or Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, resistant to TGF-&#x003b2;. In the second strain, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b has been specifically deleted [Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>)]. Cbl-b, a member of the Cbl/Sli family of molecular adaptors and a ubiquitin ligase, has been shown to negatively regulate CD28-dependent T cell activation. Recently, we reported that Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells, though not constitutively activated, are resistant to the inhibitory effects of TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells display increased proliferation after TCR stimulation and produce increased amounts of IL-2, but not IFN-&#x003b2; or tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;. Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have T cells that are independent of CD28 co-stimulation, in that they do not require CD28 engagement for IL-2 production and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Moreover, Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop spontaneous autoimmunity characterized by auto-antibody production, infiltration of activated T and B lymphocytes into multiple organs, and parenchymal damage and are highly susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In the second TGF-&#x003b2;-resistant strain, mice transgenically express a dnTGF&#x003b2;RII in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). This dominant negative TGF-&#x003b2; receptor prevents TGF-&#x003b2; from signaling normally in T cells and T cells from dnTGF&#x003b2;RII mice respond well to antigen but do not respond to TGF-&#x003b2;. A significant percentage of the T cells from dnTGF&#x003b2;RII mice show evidence of prior activation in terms of CD44 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>We show that (i) dnTGF&#x003b2;RII and Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that received an intracameral injection of antigen produce CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells that suppress a DTH reaction when transferred to wild-type (WT) recipients; (ii) The DTH reaction cannot be suppressed in immunized dnTGF&#x003b2;RII and Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients by transferred WT CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells. (iii) Antibodies to TGF-&#x003b2; inhibit the local <italic>in vivo</italic> suppression of a DTH reaction by CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory spleen cells induced by the injection of antigen into the AC. These results suggest that sensitivity to TGF-&#x003b2; by T cells is not obligate for the <italic>in vivo</italic> induction of CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells induced via the AC but TGF-&#x003b2; is likely a suppressive mechanism utilized by CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Female or male C57BL/6 mice 8&#x02013;10 weeks old were purchased from Charles River/NCI Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA).

The DTH response was usually measured approximately 24&#x02013;48 h after the application of PCl or injection of OVA by measuring footpad thickness with an engineer's digital micrometer (Mitatoyo, Tokyo, Japan). Before challenge, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)/xylazine (15 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and the thickness of each footpad was measured. One footpad was then challenged with antigen and the other with vehicle only. Twenty-four hours later the mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and the thickness of each footpad was measured. The thickness of each footpad before the application of PCl was subtracted from that of the thickness 24 h after the application of PCl. The increase in the thickness of the footpad defined as swelling was computed as the difference in the increase in micrometers between the 24 h and 0 h measurement of the thickness of the challenged footpad minus that of the unchallenged footpad.</p></sec><sec><title>Injection of antigen into the AC (intracameral injection)</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (75 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)/xylazine (15 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and, under a dissecting microscope, &#x0223c;3 &#x003bc;l PBS containing 4 &#x003bc;g TNP&#x02013;BSA or 50 &#x003bc;g OVA was injected into the AC.

Thymic NKT cells, activated by these F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells migrate to the spleen where, in concert with F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells, marginal zone B cells and splenic NKT cells activate regulatory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Whether these F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells were circulating cells recruited to the AC and then recirculated or were resident in the iris is not known. However, TGF-&#x003b2; in aqueous humor and/or produced by iris F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells induces a suppressive phenotype in F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether TGF-&#x003b2; is required directly by T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> for the generation of splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells after the injection of antigen into the AC. Although unseparated dnTGF&#x003b2;RII and Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> AC-SPL cells did not suppress the DTH reaction when injected into the footpads of immunized mice immediately after antigenic challenge, CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells enriched from the unseparated cell population suppressed the DTH response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). The unseparated cell population could contain CD4<sup>+</sup>-sensitized T cells resistant to TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated suppression that would transfer the DTH reaction to the sensitized recipients. Because Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and dnTGF&#x003b2;RII mice produce CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory AC-SPL cells, the generation of circulating F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells and regulatory thymocytes is also intact (data not shown). We have observed that the spleens of dnTGF&#x003b2;RII mice receiving intracameral antigen and immunization contain different numbers of DTH-inducing T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells such that each cell population can be demonstrated when transferring higher or lower numbers of cells (R. E. Cone and Y. Lemire, unpublished observations). TGF-&#x003b2; can &#x02018;convert&#x02019; activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to a suppressive phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Therefore, our results do not preclude a direct role for TGF-&#x003b2; in the <italic>in vivo</italic> generation of CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells after the intracameral injection of antigen. In particular, if some circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells migrate to the AC perhaps they will be &#x02018;converted&#x02019; to regulatory T cells in the AC by TGF-&#x003b2; in the aqueous humor. However, F4/80<sup>+</sup> cells in the AC likely have a suppressive phenotype due to the TGF-&#x003b2; in aqueous humor and are central to the induction of peripheral regulatory T cells.</p><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells, unlike CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD25<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells suppress activated T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Moreover, CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells are detected after immunization and there is no evidence at present for naturally occurring CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells. Unlike CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg, the suppression effected by CD8<sup>+</sup> Treg is highly antigen specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) and may be directed toward TCR V-region epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Like CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg, the suppressive mechanisms of CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells have not been defined. This issue is complicated by the description of several types of CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells that may suppress by distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).

We chose to investigate a mechanism of suppression effected by CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells induced <italic>in vivo</italic> because it is well established that the injection of antigen into the AC induces the production of antigen-specific, splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells that are capable of suppressing a DTH reaction in sensitized recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). We confirmed that the suppression of the DTH reaction in the LTS is specific to the antigen injected into the AC. CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells do not suppress the DTH reaction in the LTS or the local adoptive transfer assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that CD4/CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells suppress the DTH reaction in the LTS. However, intracamerally induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induce CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).

CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells are induced (converted?) <italic>in vitro</italic> by TGF-&#x003b2;, the <italic>in vitro</italic> ligation of 4-1BB by anti-4-1BB antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) or the injection of antigen into the AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) produce TGF-&#x003b2;. Therefore, we asked whether TGF-&#x003b2; could be a mechanism used by CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory AC-SPL cells to mediate the suppression of DTH. We determined whether the DTH reaction is suppressed by CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells in the presence of antibodies to TGF-&#x003b2; or whether the DTH reaction in immunized mice with T cells resistant to TGF-&#x003b2; is suppressed by CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells in the LTS. Our observation of a complete inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic> of the suppression of DTH to PCI by TNP-specific&#x02013;BSA-AC-SPL cells by antibodies to TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms 1&#x02212;3 is similar to our observation of the anti-TGF-&#x003b2;-induced inhibition of the suppression of OVA-induced DTH by OVA-specific AC-SPL cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). The inhibition of CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cell-mediated suppression of DTH is consistent with a report that the DTH reaction is enhanced by antibodies to anti-TGF-&#x003b2; injected into the immunized recipients at the site challenged with antigen to elicit a DTH reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Moreover, we observed that two strains of mice, Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and dnTGF&#x003b2;RII, in which the T cells are resistant to TGF-&#x003b2; based on different mechanisms, are also resistant to the suppression of the DTH reaction by CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells. In one strain, dnTGF&#x003b2;RII, there is a proximal defect in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in T cells resulting from the transgenic expression of a dnTGF&#x003b2;RII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). In the second strain, Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have a normal receptor for TGF-&#x003b2; but the absence of the ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b renders the cells incapable of responding to TGF-&#x003b2; signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><p>Although both strains may have immunological defects, we show that the DTH response to immunization is similar (or sometimes stronger) than that induced in a WT mouse. In these studies, we did not generally use isolated splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> cell populations to suppress a local DTH reaction because we demonstrated that CD8<sup>+</sup> but not CD4<sup>+</sup> splenic regulatory T cells induced by the injection of antigen into the AC selectively suppress the <italic>in vivo</italic> DTH reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Moreover, it is unlikely that the suppressive activity of the CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory spleen cells induced by intracameral antigen is mediated through cytotoxicity because in the LTS suppression of the DTH reaction by regulatory spleen cells is independent of perforin and FasL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>Mice deficient in Cbl-b have T cells that are CD28 independent in their activation and hyperactive in their responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In addition, Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice develop spontaneous autoimmunity and have increased susceptibility to elicited autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Although Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have normal numbers of functional CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells, their effector T cells are resistant to the suppression mediated by both TGF-&#x003b2; and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> effector T cells have been shown to express normal levels of TGF-&#x003b2;RII, though an abnormality in Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells in the phosphorylation of Smad2 has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). In the present studies, we extended these findings and demonstrate that Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> effector T cells are also resistant <italic>in vivo</italic> to CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells.</p><p>Because the resistance of Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to TGF-&#x003b2; is likely due to the complexities of signaling dysfunction in these mice, we also investigated TGF-&#x003b2; resistance in dnTGF&#x003b2;RII mice in which the resistance to TGF-&#x003b2; is a result of a dominant negative TGF-&#x003b2; receptor II expressed specifically on T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). As with DTH effector cells in Cbl-b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, DTH effector T cells in dnTGF&#x003b2;RII mice were resistant to suppression by splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory spleen cells. That both strains, resistant to TGF-&#x003b2; by completely different mechanisms, are resistant to the suppression effected by CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells suggests that the resistance of the two strains to suppression mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells has a common basis.</p><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T (OT-1) cells converted to a suppressive phenotype by culture with TGF-&#x003b2; and OVA suppressed the induction of OVA-specific cytotoxic T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and the rejection of a cardiac allograft in mice transgenic for OVA by a TGF-&#x003b2;-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).

Our results with antibodies to TGF-&#x003b2; and the resistance of TGF-&#x003b2;-resistant mice to the suppression of the DTH reaction by CD8<sup>+</sup> AC-SPL cells provide evidence that TGF-&#x003b2; is an efferent suppressive mechanism of these cells. However, the LTS assay measures the suppression of DTH by a limited number of cells. It is possible that the use of larger numbers of cells may reveal additional suppressive mechanisms. Additionally, T cell-derived TGF-&#x003b2;1 has pleiotropic effects and may promote T<sub>h</sub>17 cell differentiation while suppressing T<sub>h</sub>1 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Our experiments have not identified the TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms responsible for immunosuppression by CD8<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells nor the induction of AC-induced F4/80<sup>+</sup> T cells required to induce immunoregulatory thymocytes or splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Accordingly, the afferent and efferent roles for TGF-&#x003b2; in the suppression of cell-mediated immunity induced by the intracameral injection of antigen are likely dependent on the complexity of the phenomenon under investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><grant-num>EY017289</grant-num> and <grant-num>EY017537</grant-num> (to R.E.C.); <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>1R56 AI 072533</grant-num> to R.B.C.); <grant-sponsor>Connecticut Lions Eye Research Foundation</grant-sponsor> to J.O.R.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>AC</term><def><p>anterior chamber</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CS</term><def><p>contact sensitivity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>dnTGF&#x003b2;RII</term><def><p>dominant negative receptor for transforming growth factor &#x003b2; receptor type II</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DTH</term><def><p>delayed-type hypersensitivity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LTS</term><def><p>local transfer of suppression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OVA</term><def><p>ovalbumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCl</term><def><p>picryl chloride</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TGF</term><def><p>transforming growth factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNP</term><def><p>trinitrophenol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WT</term><def><p>wild type</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Chess</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An integrated model of immunoregulation mediated by regulatory T cell subsets</article-title><source>Adv.
