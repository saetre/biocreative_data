In past years, studies on the entry of the virus into its host cell have led to the identification of a number of essential virus receptors and entry mediators. However, viral counterparts for these molecules have remained elusive and this has made rational development of new generation vaccines impossible. The main objective of this study was to identify the viral counterparts for sialoadhesin, a crucial PRRSV receptor on macrophages. For this purpose, a soluble form of sialoadhesin was constructed and validated. The soluble sialoadhesin could bind PRRSV in a sialic acid-dependent manner and could neutralize PRRSV infection of macrophages, thereby confirming the role of sialoadhesin as an essential PRRSV receptor on macrophages. Although sialic acids are present on the GP<sub>3</sub>, GP<sub>4</sub> and GP<sub>5</sub> envelope glycoproteins, only the M/GP<sub>5</sub> glycoprotein complex of PRRSV was identified as a ligand for sialoadhesin. The interaction was found to be dependent on the sialic acid binding capacity of sialoadhesin and on the presence of sialic acids on GP<sub>5</sub>. These findings not only contribute to a better understanding of PRRSV biology, but the knowledge and tools generated in this study also hold the key to the development of a new generation of PRRSV vaccines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major threat to swine health worldwide. The virus specifically targets subpopulations of macrophages, central players in the immune system, and can persist in animals for extended periods of time due to a hampered immunity. At present, no vaccines are available that are both safe and effective and it is clear that a more rational vaccine design is needed to solve this problem. Therefore, advancing our fundamental understanding of PRRSV biology is crucial. The macrophage-specific lectin sialoadhesin is a crucial viral receptor on macrophages and although its role in PRRSV infection is well documented, its viral counterparts have remained unknown. Using a soluble form of sialoadhesin, we identified the M/GP<sub>5</sub> glycoprotein complex of PRRSV as the ligand for sialoadhesin and found this ligand-receptor interaction to be critically dependent on the lectin activity of sialoadhesin and on sialic acids on the GP<sub>5</sub> glycoprotein. These data represent a major breakthrough in the understanding of the role of PRRSV proteins in viral entry and pave the way for the development of a new generation of PRRSV vaccines capable of inducing an immunity that specifically blocks the interaction between viral M/GP<sub>5</sub> and sialoadhesin.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>At the end of the 1980s, a new syndrome was described affecting pig herds in North America and Canada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Collins1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Wensvoort1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. This &#x02018;mystery swine disease&#x02019; manifested itself in respiratory problems and reproductive disorders and was eventually designated Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), reflecting the associated disease symptoms. The causative agent is a positive sense RNA virus that groups within the order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, family <italic>Arteriviridae</italic>, and is referred to as the PRRS virus (PRRSV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Cavanagh1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. At present, the disease is endemic in swine-producing countries worldwide, causing enormous production losses in the swine industry.

Up until now, PRRSV vaccine development often has followed the trial and error approach. As there was a clear gap in the knowledge of PRRSV ligands that bind to specific receptors, it was difficult to aim for specific blocking of crucial steps in PRRSV infection of the porcine macrophage. A fundamental understanding of how PRRSV enters its host cell is crucial to reverse the tide.</p><p>The PRRSV virion consists of a nucleocapsid that is surrounded by a lipid envelope. The capsid structure consists of nucleocapsid proteins (N) and contains the viral genome: a single, positive RNA strand of approximately 15 kb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Benfield1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Snijder1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

These efforts have resulted in the identification of a number of macrophage molecules involved in PRRSV entry. As for many other viruses, initial binding of the virus to its host cell occurs via interactions with heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans present on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Delputte1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Vanderheijden1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The virus receptor that determines subsequent virus entry and that likely accounts for the macrophage tropism of PRRSV has been identified as porcine sialoadhesin (pSn). This macrophage-specific molecule is a sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (siglec) that mediates virus attachment and subsequent internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Vanderheijden2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Nauwynck1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Virus attachment to this receptor is dependent on the sialic acid-binding activity of the N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of pSn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Delputte3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and on the presence of sialic acids on the virion surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Delputte4">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. A study by Delputte <italic>et al.</italic> pointed out that &#x003b1;2-3 linked sialic acids and to a lesser extent &#x003b1;2-6 linked sialic acids, most likely present on complex N-linked glycans attached to viral envelope glycoproteins, are involved in this interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Delputte4">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Clearly, a glycosylated PRRSV protein is responsible for PRRSV binding to pSn, but the exact viral ligand has not yet been identified. After pSn-dependent internalization into the endosomal compartment of the macrophage, the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm, thereby initiating the transcriptional and translational events necessary for the production of new virions. The scavenger receptor CD163 has been shown to be essential for virus uncoating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-VanGorp1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Calvert1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the light of vaccine development, knowledge on this is particularly interesting, since it allows targeting of the immune response to a specific, critical step in virus infection. Vaccination with a functional viral pSn-binding epitope can elicit a protective immune response that specifically blocks the crucial, pSn-dependent internalization of the virus into its host cell. By construction and use of soluble recombinant porcine sialoadhesins, we identified the viral M/GP<sub>5</sub> glycoprotein complex as a ligand for pSn and showed the sialic acid-dependency of the pSn-M/GP<sub>5</sub> interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The experimental procedure for the collection of porcine alveolar macrophages was authorized and supervised by the Ethical and Animal Welfare Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Ghent University.

This study aimed to identify PRRSV glycoprotein ligands for the pSn receptor. For this purpose, a soluble pSn was constructed and characterized. This soluble receptor showed the same binding functionality as wild type pSn, as it showed sialic acid-binding activity and could bind PRRSV in a sialic acid-dependent manner. Via pull-down assays in which the soluble receptor was mixed with lysates of PRRSV, it was shown that the M/GP<sub>5</sub> complex of the PRRS virus interacts with the pSn receptor. This interaction was clearly dependent on the sialic acid-binding capacity of pSn, as a non-sialic acid-binding mutant of the soluble pSn differing in only one amino acid was not able to bind M/GP<sub>5</sub>. Removal of sialic acids from the virus prior to the pull-down assay also blocked the interaction of the M/GP<sub>5</sub> complex with pSn, evidencing the importance of sialic acids on the GP<sub>5</sub> protein for interaction with the receptor. Clearly, the characteristics of the interaction of M/GP<sub>5</sub> with pSn are identical to these of the interaction of PRRSV particles with pSn, suggesting that the M/GP<sub>5</sub> complex indeed mediates PRRSV-particle binding to pSn.</p><p>In this study, the interaction of PRRSV with the pSn receptor was initially studied using MARC-145-grown virus, as it is easy to obtain relatively high virus titers in these cells and it avoids the necessity of animal sacrifice. Moreover, MARC-145-grown virus can infect porcine alveolar macrophages and has been shown to interact efficiently with the pSn receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Delputte3">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-VanGorp1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that MARC-145 cells provide correct glycosylation for the virus to interact with pSn. However, the glycome of the primary porcine macrophage, and hence of the virus grown therein, is most likely very different from the MARC-145 cell glycome. In the light of lectin-glycoprotein interaction, it was therefore imperative to evaluate the interaction of the viral glycoprotein(complexe)s of macrophage-grown PRRSV with the pSn receptor. Via pull-down experiments, in which lysates of macrophage-grown PRRSV were applied to immobilized recombinant sialoadhesins, it was found that also macrophage-grown PRRSV interacts with pSn via the M/GP<sub>5</sub> glycoprotein complex. The interaction was also critically dependent on the sialic acid-binding capacity of pSn, indicating that the interaction of pSn with sialic acids is central to the pSn-M/GP<sub>5</sub> interaction. While it should be kept in mind that primary macrophages cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> may also show different glycosylation than they do <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is clear that the interaction of pSn with macrophage-grown virus is more relevant to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation than the interaction with MARC-145-grown virus.</p><p>Previous studies on PRRSV have shown that virus glycosylation is crucial for its infectivity towards macrophages. Treatment of the virus with N-glycosidase F to remove N-glycans has a negative impact on viral infectivity and removal of sialic acids from the virion surface using sialidase even results in a 10- to 20-fold reduction of the infectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Delputte4">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering the findings of the present study, these results suggest a central role of sialic acid-carrying N-glycans on the GP<sub>5</sub> glycoprotein in the interaction with sialoadhesin. The GP<sub>5</sub> protein of most PRRSV isolates contains two conserved N-glycosylation sites. One or more additional putative N-glycosylation sites can be present, depending on the virus isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Mardassi2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Dea2">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Meulenberg3">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the conserved glycosylation sites, N<sup>46</sup> in European isolates, N<sup>44</sup> in American isolates, is particularly interesting in the light of the present study as it appears to be critical for the formation of infectious PRRSV virions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Wissink2">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Ansari1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Wissink and coworkers showed that N<sup>46</sup> is important for virus infectivity towards macrophages: the specific infectivity of recombinant GP<sub>5</sub>-N<sup>46</sup>Q mutant virus, in which the N<sup>46</sup> glycosylation site was deleted, was reduced 10- to 20-fold when compared to the specific infectivity of wild type virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Wissink2">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. This correlates with the reduction in infectivity seen when virus is treated with sialidase to remove sialic acids from the surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Delputte4">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these data suggest that the critical sialic acid, necessary for M/GP<sub>5</sub> binding to the pSn receptor, is present on the N-glycan appended to the N<sup>46</sup>/N<sup>44</sup> amino acid. Another interesting observation is that the N<sup>46</sup>/N<sup>44</sup> residue is part of the primary neutralization epitope of PRRSV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Plagemann1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Plagemann2">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. While some other segments of the GP<sub>5</sub> protein appear to be hypervariable, this epitope is located in an area of the GP<sub>5</sub> ectodomain that is highly conserved among PRRSV isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Ostrowski1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Pesch1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that this domain has a critical function in virus replication. It has been suggested to be crucial for the disulfide linkage between GP<sub>5</sub> and M, as the cysteine residue involved in this linkage lies within the conserved area and since the linkage between GP<sub>5</sub> and M is critical for virion formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Wissink1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Verheije1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. It is however also tempting to speculate that this critical function lies in the interaction of the GP<sub>5</sub> glycoprotein with the sialoadhesin receptor, this via essential sialic acids present on the glycan appended to the N<sup>46</sup>/N<sup>44</sup> residue of GP<sub>5</sub>. This could also explain why antibodies directed against this epitope appear to have a neutralizing effect on infection of macrophages. Previously, a study by Delputte <italic>et al.</italic> showed that neutralizing antibodies can indeed block attachment and internalization of the virus into macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Delputte5">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Sialic acids are acidic monosaccharides often present at the termini of glycan chains on animal glycoconjugates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Varki1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>. Siglecs like sialoadhesin display a marked preference for specific types of sialic acids. However, also the linkage of the sialic acid to the subterminal sugar residue seems to influence the affinity of a siglec for a specific ligand. In addition, formation of high affinity interactions can depend on additional structural features of the glycoconjugate that carries the sialic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Crocker1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>. These factors contribute to the specificity of a siglec for specific sialylated ligands and may explain why the GP<sub>3</sub> and GP<sub>4</sub> envelope proteins, although they carry sialic acids, do not seem to interact with sialoadhesin, while the M/GP<sub>5</sub> glycoprotein complex shows a strong binding to this receptor. Furthermore, it is well known that physiologically relevant, high affinity lectin-glycan interactions strongly depend on the lectin and glycan valency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Crocker2">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>. As the pSn receptor is abundantly expressed at the macrophage cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Vanderheijden2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and as a single PRRSV virion carries a whole array of M/GP<sub>5</sub> complexes on its surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000730-Meulenberg4">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>, it can be expected that also the interaction between macrophage and virus depends on avidity rather than on simple affinity.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified the M/GP<sub>5</sub> complex of PRRSV as a ligand for the pSn receptor. Furthermore, we showed that the M/GP<sub>5</sub>-pSn interaction is critically dependent on the sialic acid-binding capacity of pSn as well as on sialic acids on the viral GP<sub>5</sub> glycoprotein. The information and tools generated in this study can provide a theoretical and practical basis for the development and evaluation of a new generation of inactivated and subunit PRRSV vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000730.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy</p><p>(0.04 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000730.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000730.s002"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><p>Fc- and pSn-specific ELISA assays</p><p>(0.06 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000730.s002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank C.
