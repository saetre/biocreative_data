Although BALB/c and DBA/2 mice share the same MHC (H-2d) haplotype, the BALB/c strain is susceptible to PGIA, while DBA/2 mice are resistant. Therefore, these two inbred mouse strains provide an opportunity to study arthritis susceptibility factors excluding the effects of MHC-associated genetic components. The goal of this study was to monitor changes in the cellular composition and activation state following intra-peritoneal (i.p.) immunization to induce PGIA; additionally, we sought to identify new susceptibility factors by comparing PG-induced immune responses in BALB/c and DBA/2 mice. Upon i.p. PG injection, resident naive B1 cells are replaced by both T cells and conventional B cells in the peritoneum of BALB/c mice. These peritoneal T cells produce IFN&#x003b3; and IL-17, cytokines shown to be important in RA and corresponding arthritis models. Moreover, peritoneal cells can adoptively transfer PGIA to SCID mice, demonstrating their arthritogenic properties. Our results indicate that repeatedly injected antigen leads to the recruitment and activation of immune cells in the peritoneum; these cells then trigger the effector phase of the disease. The migration and activation of T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>17 cells in the peritoneal cavity in response to PG immunization, which did not occur in the arthritis-resistant DBA/2 strain, may be critical factors of arthritis susceptibility in BALB/c mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cytokines</kwd><kwd>peritoneum</kwd><kwd>rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd>spleen</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteoglycan (PG) aggrecan-induced arthritis (PGIA) is one of the murine models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Repeated intra-peritoneal (i.p.) immunization with human cartilage PG (aggrecan) leads to joint inflammation, progressive cartilage destruction, bone erosion and ankylosis in diarthrodial joints of genetically susceptible BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Autoimmune features of PGIA, such as autoreactivity, T and B cell involvement and the cytokine profile in serum and synovial fluid closely resemble RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Additional features common to RA are that this model includes early involvement of small synovial joints, similar X-ray and histopathologic abnormalities of peripheral joints, greater susceptibility of aging females, dominant, but not exclusive, effect of MHC, the polygenic character and the recessive inheritance of the disease [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>)]. Immunization with human cartilage PG aggrecan leads to the breakdown of self-tolerance, and it triggers an autoimmune response to murine cartilage PG due to the presence of cross-reactive epitopes in human and murine PGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>The i.p. route of immunization appears to be critical for disease induction in the PGIA model. Although intra-dermal, subcutaneous or intra-muscular administration of the same PG antigen induces massive T and B cell responses, the severity of arthritis is weaker. Therefore, it is a logical approach to study immunological events in the peritoneum that may determine the development and progression of this autoimmune disease.</p><p>The peritoneal cavity is a unique microenvironment, lined by a serous membrane that consists of a mesothelial layer and sub-mesothelial connective tissue, containing blood and lymphatic vessels, and lymphoid tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). &#x02018;Milky spots&#x02019; on the human omentum, containing mostly macrophages and lymphocytes, may be considered secondary lymphoid foci within the peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). The peritoneal fluid contains different types of immune cells, such as macrophages, lymphocytes and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). B1 lymphocytes represent a major cell population in the peritoneum; however, this cell type is rare in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). A major function of these B1 cells is thought to be the production of IgM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), although effective antigen presentation is another significant feature of these B1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Furthermore, two functionally different B1 cell sub-populations (B1a/b) can be defined based on the expression of the CD5 molecule, a cell surface receptor that is otherwise expressed by T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>Besides the site of immunization (antigen entry), the direction of the immune response is largely determined by the adjuvant. For example, CFA and dimethyldioctadecyl-ammonium bromide (DDA) are known to induce T<sub>h</sub>1 type immune responses, while alum adjuvant favors T<sub>h</sub>2 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Adjuvants exert these effects mainly by activating the cells of innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). DDA enhances both cellular and humoral immune responses when injected i.p. but primarily supports cellular immunity when administered subcutaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>PGIA can be induced in genetically susceptible BALB/c mice, however, most other strains are resistant, for example the MHC-matched DBA/2 is a resistant strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Although the difference in arthritis susceptibility between these two strains has been known for &#x0003e;20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) and the fundamental cellular and immunological mechanisms leading to the development of PGIA have been described [see for review, ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>)], the most critical susceptibility factors have not been elucidated. PGIA is a T cell-dependent, B cell- and/or antibody-mediated disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). The disease cannot be adoptively transferred by T cells, B cells or antibodies alone to naive BALB/c or SCID mice; successful transfer requires both T cells and either B cells or antibodies from arthritic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). A shift toward a T<sub>h</sub>1-dominant cytokine profile is necessary for disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), and IL-4 has been shown to act as a negative regulator, or a protective cytokine, in PGIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p><p>The induction phase of this autoimmune disease begins with the activation of PG-specific T and B cells, eventually overcoming self-tolerance; this takes place during the immunization regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Therefore, we chose to characterize the early events following i.p. immunization, when joint inflammation was not yet present. We then extended our study by analyzing changes in cellular composition, activation markers, cytokine production, T cell response and antibody production during the entire immunization period.</p><p>Here we report that the earliest events in the peritoneum following i.p. PG immunization are the disappearance of resident naive B1 cells and their replacement by T cells and conventional B cells in BALB/c mice. This re-organization of the cellular composition following repeated injections of antigen suggests that the generation of activated effector cells, beginning in the peritoneum, triggers the effector phase of the disease. Moreover, the arthritogenic potential of these activated peritoneal cells is confirmed by their ability to adoptively transfer PGIA to SCID mice. Adjuvant DDA plays a crucial role in initiating the change of cellular composition in the peritoneal cavity, but DDA itself is not capable of disease induction. Changes in the cellular composition in response to PG injection, which do not occur in the MHC-matched arthritis-resistant DBA/2 strain, appear to determine the arthritis susceptibility of BALB/c mice to PGIA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>All chemicals, unless indicated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

The early changes induced by PG immunization in these tissue compartments, especially in the peritoneal cavity, most likely led to the differentiation and activation of arthritogenic T and B cells which then triggered synovial joint inflammation in BALB/c mice. The adjuvant (DDA) proved to be a major contributor to these early cellular changes, but DDA alone was insufficient to induce any inflammatory reaction in synovial joints as confirmed by histology.</p><p>Relatively, early after the first i.p. immunization, there was a robust T cell influx and/or proliferation in the peritoneal cavity in BALB/c mice, accompanied by the disappearance of the resident naive B1 cell population. Upon repeated immunizations, this skew in the cellular composition became more apparent. The continuously elevated T cell numbers were most likely the result of both the homing of antigen-specific T cells to the peritoneum and the local expansion of resident T cells. This notion is further supported by the fact that the absence of neither CD44 nor CD62L molecules [in knockout (KO) mice] could completely abolish the T cell number increase in the peritoneal cavity (data not shown). The transient decrease in T cell number after the second PG/DDA injection might be the result of the systemic (joint) recirculation of autoreactive T cells and activation-induced cell death locally in the peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). The T cell-enriched peritoneal effusion in BALB/c mice, which could not be detected in arthritis-resistant DBA/2 mice, might well be one of the critical upstream contributors that set the stage for the development of PGIA.</p><p>In BALB/c mice, a dominant production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12/23 p40, IFN&#x003b3;, IL-17 and TNF&#x003b1;) was already detected at the early stages of i.p. immunization-induced peritonitis at 5 and 10 days following the first i.p. injection. This was not due to the injection itself, because i.p. injection of 200 &#x003bc;l PBS did not induce cytokine production and had no evident effect upon peritoneal cell composition (our unpublished data). The massive shift in cellular composition and cytokine production in PLF, which might be due to the combined effects of adjuvant and strain specific factors, may dictate arthritis susceptibility in BALB/c and resistance in DBA/2 mice.</p><p>IL-12 and IL-27 have been shown to promote T<sub>h</sub>1 differentiation, whereas IL-6, transforming growth factor &#x003b2; and IL-23 (which shares a common p40 chain with IL-12) promote and maintain the T<sub>h</sub>17 lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Both T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>17 cytokines have been associated with arthritis in different mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). T<sub>h</sub>1 dominance was shown to be characteristic of PGIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), whereas the absence of IL-17 alone in IL-17a-deficient BALB/c mice did not seem to have a significant effect on PGIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Nonetheless, IL-17 has been shown to be an important mediator in human RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), collagen-induced arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>) and spontaneous arthritis in either SKG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>) or IL-1 receptor antagonist-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), as well as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in which IL-17a deficiency alone seems to play a limited role in PGIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), we show that one of the prominent cytokines produced during the PG immunization period is IL-17 in BALB/c mice. This suggests that in addition to IFN&#x003b3;, IL-17 might play a role in PGIA similar to its implicated role in other autoimmune disease models and RA. Indeed, IFN&#x003b3; and IL-17 were the cytokines that were produced in significantly lesser amounts at most time points (especially by the PLF cells) in the resistant DBA/2 strain, suggesting that high levels of IFN&#x003b3; and IL-17 might contribute to PGIA susceptibility. Results obtained in IFN&#x003b3; and IL-17 double KO mice (A. Finnegan, personal communication) revealed the role of IL-17 in PGIA. While IFN&#x003b3; is a key cytokine in PGIA, IFN&#x003b3; deficiency alone does not abolish completely PGIA. This &#x02018;residual arthritis&#x02019;, however, is completely eliminated by additional IL-17 deficiency. Thus, the absence of IL-17 in the IL-17a-deficient mice most likely is compensated by IFN&#x003b3;. In turn, in wild-type BALB/c mice, both cytokines are present and involved in PGIA.</p><p>B cells are excellent APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), and B cells from PG-immunized BALB/c mice are 1000 times more effective APCs than peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Antigen presentation is known to influence both the magnitude and the direction of the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). It has been shown recently that B1 and conventional B (B2) cells induce different pathways of T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). According to Zhong <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), when B1 cells were used as APCs under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>17 cells accumulated, whereas conventional B cells as APCs induced the proliferation of Tregs. In naive (non-immunized) conditions, the peritoneal cavity is rich in B1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and these B1 cells, through antigen presentation, may initially direct the immune response toward T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>17 differentiation. Although the number of B1 cells decreases upon repeated PG/DDA injections, a low number of B1 cells may be sufficient for maintaining the polarization and dominance of T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>17 CD4+ cells in the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice. In contrast, conventional B2 cells represent the majority of B cells in spleen of DBA/2 mice. This may be one of the reasons for the expansion of the splenic Treg population detected at day 5 after the first PG injection in DBA/2 mice (data not shown). Similar expansion of splenic Tregs was also observed by Zhong <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). This early Treg induction in the spleen could also contribute to the PGIA-resistant phenotype of the DBA/2 mouse strain.</p><p>Upon the second PG injection, T and B cells are reactivated in the peritoneal cavity, and this event is accompanied by a robust change in the T and B cell composition and activation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). This change is reflected by the production of IFN&#x003b3;, IL-17 and auto-antibodies against mouse PG in BALB/c, but not in DBA/2 mice. These PG-specific auto-antibodies, together with activated effector T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>17 cells, may find their targets in the joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Deposition of PG-specific antibodies in the joints and T cell migration to the synovium, also indicated by the transient decrease in the T cell number of the PLF 10 days after the second PG + DDA injection, may trigger the effector phase of autoimmune arthritis, amplifying the local response through pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1;, IFN&#x003b3;, IL-17 and IL-6) production, thereby leading to progressive joint tissue destruction. Since in DBA/2 mice there was significantly less influx of T cells into the peritoneal cavity, T cell help was probably not sufficient for auto-antibody production. Subtle differences in co-stimulation, which might influence the T&#x02013;B cell interactions, cannot be ruled out between the two strains. Our PLF cell transfer experiments show that boosting peritoneal cells with a second PG injection in donor BALB/c mice enhanced the arthritogenic potential of these cells in SCID recipients. This supports the hypothesis that, although PG-primed T and B cells already appear in the peritoneum after the first immunization, their reactivation via clonal expansion is necessary to reach the fully &#x02018;armed effector&#x02019; state.</p><p>A potentially interesting implication of this study is the importance of the peritoneal lymphoid cells in controlling autoimmune joint inflammation. B1 cells, residing in the peritoneal cavity, have been implicated in autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). They produce auto-antibodies spontaneously at low concentrations, and these cells may be considered as physiological regulators of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Although there is no direct evidence for their role in RA so far, it might be interesting to speculate that changes in the physiological peritoneal milieu in susceptible humans, similar to what happens in BALB/c mice as a consequence of i.p. PG/DDA injections, could pave the way to autoimmune joint inflammation. Theoretically, repeated peritoneal antigen (endogenous or exogenous) stimuli, together with chronic exposure to chemicals with potential adjuvant activity, might contribute to such cellular changes, eventually leading to impaired immune regulation.</p><p>A key observation of this study is that injection of adjuvant (DDA) alone induced very similar changes in peritoneal cell composition as the injection of DDA with PG. However, only BALB/c mice injected with PG/DDA developed strong antigen-specific immune responses and arthritis. DDA has been shown to skew the immune response toward the T<sub>h</sub>1 direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) in addition to strongly activating innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Here, we show that DDA induces the recruitment of T cells into the peritoneum, which is in line with earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), but the kinetics of T cell influx was different when the antigen was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). This effect, however, can be attributable to the local induction of inflammatory adhesion molecules and chemokines. The propensity of these T cells to produce IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-12 and IL-17 in the early stage of immunization may create an optimal milieu for the differentiation and activation of autoimmune T and B cells when antigen (PG) is present. Such peritoneal T cell response was lacking in DBA/2 mice, which raises the possibility that the adjuvant itself might not effectively activate innate immune cells in this strain. On the contrary, systemic T cell response and serum antibody levels against the immunizing antigen showed that the immunization was effective, although at different levels, in both strains. This correlates with earlier studies which have shown that DBA/2 mice, similar to BALB/c, are good responders to DDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>).</p><p>As we have shown, PGIA resistance in DBA/2 mice is not the consequence of the lack of the systemic immune response against the immunizing (human) PG. However, the &#x02018;autoimmune switch&#x02019; and the subsequent immune attack on the joints (self-PG) can only be observed in BALB/c mice. Our preliminary transfer experiments with PLF cells from hyper-immunized DBA/2 mice also support the idea that indeed, DBA/2 cells carry some arthritogenic potential, which, otherwise, is suppressed in the original wild-type background. Several candidate molecules can be involved in the development of autoimmunity, including innate immune receptors, like Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>), and co-stimulatory molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). For example, flow cytometry analysis has shown that higher percentage of peritoneal macrophages express TLR1 in DBA/2 than in BALB/c mice (data not shown).</p><p>Therefore, we conclude that the arthritis-susceptible phenotype of BALB/c mice is due to an autoimmune switch during the immunization with human PG. This is potentially determined by differences in the adjuvant response, locally, in the peritoneal cavity and in joint-draining lymph nodes of BALB/c mice with PGIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).
