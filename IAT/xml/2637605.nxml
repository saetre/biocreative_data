We demonstrate that expression of four such subunits A1, B1, E2 and a4 all co-localize with the forkhead transcription factor Foxi1 in a subset of epithelial cells at these three locations. In cells, of such epithelia, that lack Foxi1 we fail to identify any expression of A1, B1, E2 and a4 demonstrating an important role for the transcription factor Foxi1 in regulating subunit availability. Promoter reporter experiments, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and site directed mutagenesis demonstrate that a Foxi1 expression vector can <italic>trans</italic>-activate an a4-promoter reporter construct in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays that Foxi1-dependent activation to a large extent depends on <italic>cis</italic>-elements at position &#x02212;561/&#x02212;547 in the a4 promoter. Thus, we provide evidence that Foxi1 is necessary for expression of at least four subunits in three different epithelia and most likely is a major determinant for proper assembly of a functional vacuolar H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase complex at these locations.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vacuolar-type H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPases (v-ATPases) consist of two major subunits: a membrane anchoring V<sub>0</sub> domain and a catalytic V<sub>1</sub> domain.

Are ubiquitously expressed subunits regulated by a set of common transcription factors in a generic way similar in all tissues of expression or is the regulation of these subunits to some extent depending on distinct sets of transcriptional regulators varying between different tissues/celltypes? In an effort to address this question we studied the role of a tissue specific transcription factor, Foxi1, in regulation of both specifically e.g. B1 and a4 as well as ubiquitously expressed subunits e.g. A1 and E2.</p><p>We can demonstrate an important role of Foxi1 as regulator of B1 subunit expression in FORE cells of the endolymphatic epithelium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Foxi1 is necessary for expression of the v-ATPase subunits A1, E2 and a4 in endolymphatic duct, kidney collecting duct and epididymal epithelia. Several potential Foxi1-binding <italic>cis</italic>-elements have been identified in the human a4 promoter. A cluster of three such sites is shown to interact with Foxi1, which through this interaction trans-activates an a4 promoter reporter construct. Mutations that inhibit interactions also significantly reduce Foxi1 dependent reporter gene activation. Moreover, mRNA in situ experiments demonstrate loss of mRNA encoding the ubiquitously expressed subunits A1 and E2 in kidney epithelia that lacks Foxi1. The data presented here establishes Foxi1 as a potential genetic regulator of subunit availability for at least four v-ATPase subunits all expressed in endolymphatic duct, kidney collecting duct and epididymal epithelia.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Foxi1 is required for and co-localizes with expression of A1, B1, E2 and a4 subunits in endolymphatic sac and duct epithelia</title><p>As can be depicted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g001">figure 1</xref> both the &#x0201c;tissue specific&#x0201d; subunits B1 and a4, expressed in the inner ear, kidney and epididymis, as well as the ubiquitously expressed isoforms A1 and E2 co-localizes with Foxi1 specific immunostaining.

Reporter constructs encompassing these sites show a dose-dependent Foxi1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Some two hundred bases downstream from this cluster we found another potential forkhead binding site (Fk4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). When any of the three sites in the cluster were mutated there was a significant drop in reporter gene activity, the most prominent effect was noted for the Fk3 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). While mutations at this site essentially blocked Foxi1 dependent inducibility the Fk2 site reduced Foxi1 ability to <italic>trans</italic>-activate by approximately half and finally Fk3 reduced this effect by about a third (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). Mutations at Fk4 did not significantly affect reporter activity. In EMSA experiments we could demonstrate a distinct mobility shift using a labeled double stranded oligonucleotide harboring the Fk1-3 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). We could also observe a much weaker interaction for Fk4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) that agrees well with the effects these sites have on total Foxi1 mediated reporter gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). To investigate the nature of these interactions we performed a series of EMSA experiments using the same mutations as in the transfection experiments and wt (wild type) sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5D&#x02013;F</xref>). While it can be deduced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">figures 5D, E and F</xref> that the unlabeled wt probe effectively competes for the Fk1, 2 and 3 protein interactions at concentrations of approximately 10-fold molar excess, compatible with <italic>bona fide</italic> interactions, the mutated Fk1, 2 and 3 probes are significantly less efficient as competitors and display significant competition only at &#x0223c;100-fold molar excess in most instances, a finding that agrees well with transfection data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Foxi1 is able to interact with the <italic>ATP6V0A4</italic> promoter at position &#x02212;561/&#x02212;547 in a sequence specific manner and this argues in favor for direct Foxi1-mediated regulation of <italic>ATP6V0A4</italic> gene expression in kidney, inner ear and epididymis. We have previously shown in transfection experiments that FOXI1 interacts with a key <italic>cis</italic>-element in the <italic>ATP6V1B1</italic> promoter, at &#x02212;102/&#x02212;96, and that this interaction is required for a dose-dependent activation by FOXI1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004471-Blomqvist2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In conclusion, this is compatible with a direct role for Foxi1 in transcriptional regulation of a4 and B1 subunits and establishes these genes as Foxi1 downstream targets. In chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, aimed to study <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions at the Fk1-3 cluster, we confirm that Foxi1 interactions are strongest at Fk3, slightly weaker at Fk2 and weakest at Fk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). When all three sites in the Fk1-3 cluster are mutated we cannot detect any Foxi1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). An <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of upstream regions in the A1 and E2 genes demonstrates the presence of several potential forkhead binding sites conforming to the consensus sequence t(g/a)TTT(g/a)(t/c) (Overdier et al., 1997; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004471-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004471.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Foxi1 can activate an <italic>ATP6V0A4</italic> promoter reporter construct.</title><p>Sequence analysis of the <italic>ATP6V0A4</italic> upstream region reveals four putative FOXI1 sites located at &#x02212;561/&#x02212;547 (Fk1-3) and &#x02212;358/&#x02212;352 (Fk4) relative to start of transcription (NCBI: NC_000007.12, NM_130841).

While the former function is vital for cellular adaptation and ultimately survival the latter supports specialized functions of the multi-cellular organism.

At these three locations the generic pattern of ubiquitously expressed subunits are complemented by expression of cell specific subunits such as a4 and B1. The importance of these specialized functions is underscored by the fact that mutations in the gene encoding the B1 subunit, <italic>Atp6v1b1</italic>, are associated with childhood sensorineural hearing loss and dRTA. This is also true for the gene encoding the a4 subunit, <italic>Atp6v0a4</italic>, although deafness is less common and appears to have a later onset, usually in the third to fourth decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004471-Stover1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The a4 subunit is expressed in Foxi1 positive cells of endolymphatic epithelium, intercalated cells in the kidney and narrow and clear cells of epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g001">Fig. 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g003">3</xref>). The expression appears to be restricted to Foxi1 positive cells and located in the apical aspect of such cells as expected for a factor involved in proton transport over the luminal plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g001">Fig. 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g003">3</xref>). It is also clear that in epithelia lacking Foxi1 there is no detectable expression of the a4 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g001">Fig. 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g003">3</xref>). To further investigate the role of Foxi1 in regulation of a4 subunit expression we identified four potential Foxi1 <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the Atp6v0a4 promoter Fkh1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). While Fk4, if anything, only marginally contributes to reporter gene activity the Fk1-3 cluster seems to be the major site for Foxi1 dependent regulation of a4 transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Site directed mutagenesis of Fk3 makes the a4 promoter virtually insensitive to Foxi1 expression in contrast to the very limited effects on Foxi1 inducibility noted for mutations of Fk4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). EMSA experiments demonstrate significant DNA-protein interaction with Fk1-3 and only limited interactions with Fk4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) supporting the conclusion based on transfection data that the former site is predominant in terms of Foxi1-mediated regulation of a4. Furthermore, EMSA analysis of the Fk1-3 complex shows a pattern of significantly reduced ability of the mutated oligonucleotides to compete for wt interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g005">Fig. 5 D&#x02013;F</xref>) a finding that supports the transfection data and argues in favor of these sites as biologically significant Foxi1 targets. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) also delineate the Fk1-3 complex as a site for Foxi1 interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>. In conclusion, these results support a direct role of Foxi1 in regulation of the a4 subunit in FORE cells of the inner ear endolymphatic epithelium, intercalated cells of the kidney and narrow and clear cells in epidiymis. The presence of 14 and 25 potential forkhead binding sites in the upstream regions of the genes encoding the A1 and E2 subunits suggests the possibility of Foxi1 as a potential regulator of these subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). A fact supported by the finding that kidney epithelium that lacks Foxi1 while retaining expression of carbonic anhydrase II, a marker for intercalated cells, have no detectable levels of neither A1 nor E2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004471-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that Foxi1 through direct DNA-protein interactions, appears to be crucial for transcription of the Atp6v1b1 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004471-Blomqvist2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.
