To determine if additional first exon and transcription start sites are present, 5' RACE (rapid amplification of 5' complementary DNA ends) was performed with exon 1-specific reverse primers and a RACE-ready panel of anchored cDNA libraries derived from 24 mouse tissues (OriGene, Rockville, MD). A list of exons and exon-intron boundaries of the ghrelin locus derived-transcripts identified in this and previous studies is given in [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>].</p><p>Sequencing of clones from the murine stomach, lung, and 9.5-day embryo revealed two transcription start sites (TSS) in exon 0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which are 48 bp [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ355944">FJ355944</ext-link>] and 19 bp [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ355945">FJ355945</ext-link>] in size. The 19 bp exon 0 (exon 0a) is identical to a sequence previously reported in the mouse stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], while the 48 bp exon 0 (exon 0b) is flanked by a CAGE tag starting site (CTSS) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). CTSSs are obtained by large-scale sequencing of concatemers derived from the 5' ends of capped mRNA and indicate the transcription start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Partial genomic sequence of the murine ghrelin gene showing exon 0 and extended exon 1 transcription start sites in a number of tissues</bold>.

This suggested that transcription of the murine ghrelin gene could also be initiated from within intron 0. We isolated murine 5' RACE clones that contained extended exon 1 sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These clones were isolated from 9.5-day embryo, 12.5-day embryo, adult lung, and adult adrenal gland [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ355940">FJ355940</ext-link>&#x02013;<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ355943">FJ355943</ext-link>] and correspond to four transcription start sites within intron 0 of the mouse ghrelin gene.

These human exon 1-derived ghrelin transcripts contain a putative secretion signal peptide, which is not present in the rodent sequence, and may give rise to novel peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Mouse ghrelin appears to lack exon -1, as we have been unable to identify murine exon -1 ghrelin sequence using 5' RACE and RT-PCR (data not shown). Promoter sequences are known to evolve rapidly and show a high rate of sequence turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; thus, it is not surprising that the region corresponding to murine exon -1 is not a functional ghrelin gene exon in the mouse.</p></sec><sec><title>The extended exon 1 of <italic>Ghrl </italic>is transcribed and gives rise to full-length preproghrelin transcripts</title><p>While 5' RACE data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and sequence from a full-length cDNA clone (derived from primary cultures of cystic fibrosis lung epithelial cells) [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BM982194">BM982194</ext-link>] demonstrate the existence of human full-length preproghrelin transcripts with an extended exon 1, there has been no evidence that this region is transcribed in the mouse.

RT-PCRs, employing a sense primer in the extended exon 1 and an antisense primer in exon 1, confirmed that exon 1 is transcribed and not a result of genomic or exogenous contamination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Next, we obtained an amplicon containing the extended exon 1 to 4 in the liver and spleen [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FJ914266">FJ914266</ext-link>], proving experimentally that the extended exon 1 can give rise to full-length preproghrelin transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Verification of an extended exon 1 in the mouse ghrelin gene</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Interestingly, the human extended exon 1 is also differentially expressed, with equal levels of the 20 bp exon 0 and extended exon 1 in the stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, very high levels of the extended exon 1 and almost undetectable levels of the 20 bp exon 0 have been reported in the human thyroid medullary carcinoma TT cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In both humans and rodents, total ghrelin mRNA levels are very high in the stomach, while much lower levels can be found in other tissues, including the adrenal gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting that the expression of the extended exon 1 may be developmental-, cell- and tissue-specific.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Real-time RT-PCR demonstrating tissue-specific expression of murine ghrelin transcripts with an extended exon 1</bold>.

Upstream open reading frames, mRNA secondary structure and other motifs in 5' untranslated exons have been shown to regulate the translation of developmental genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, it has been reported that ghrelin mRNA and protein levels do not directly correlate in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We hypothesise that this may be caused by the transcription of different first <italic>Ghrl </italic>exons with different preproghrelin translation efficiencies. This mechanism is exemplified in the chicken embryo where transcripts harbouring uORFs allow low-level translation of proinsulin, whereas a higher level of proinsulin expression is achieved in the adult pancreas by transcription of mRNAs from a downstream first exon devoid of uORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, alternative 5' untranslated exons can have an mRNA secondary structure that restrains translation, particularly if a hairpin occurs close to the 5' cap, which is the ribosomal entry site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The short 19 bp exon 0, which we and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] have described, is devoid of upstream open reading frames or stable secondary structure. This transcript, therefore, could be more efficiently translated than the 233 bp 5' extended exon 1 (exon 1e) that contains a 266 bp 5' untranslated region, for example (see [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this report, we demonstrate that transcription start sites in exon 0 an extended exon 1 are present in the murine ghrelin gene, suggesting that there are similarities in the proximal first exon organisation of the murine ghrelin gene and its human orthologue. A novel, extended exon 1 is expressed at high levels in the spleen, adrenal gland, stomach, and skin, indicating that the murine ghrelin gene harbours a cell-type, development-stage and/or tissue-specific, proximal promoter in intron 0. Little is known about the promoters of the murine ghrelin gene. Only the role of rat ghrelin sequence, which is upstream of the 19 bp exon 0, has been investigated in promoter constructs in murine cell-lines, and this demonstrated minimal promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

The array plates are loaded with equal amounts of cDNA per well, as described by the manufacturer (OriGene). Extended exon 1 transcript expression levels were examined using 2&#x000d7; SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (AB) and the primers Ext1-F/R (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The amount of mRNA was determined by normalising the levels of expression with the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>Gapdh</italic>) (Gapdh-F/R, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) expression in the tissues. Primers were designed using Primer Express v.2.0 (AB) to yield a single amplicon, and were verified by dissociation curve analysis. The quantitative real-time RT-PCR conditions were optimised using purified PCR products. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the 2&#x000d7; SYBR green PCR master mix on the AB 7000 sequence detection system and data analysed using the absolute standard curve method (User Bulletin #2, AB) to determine expression levels.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>IS conceived and designed the study and carried out all experiments except quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
