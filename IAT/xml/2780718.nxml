Here, microarrays were employed to globally characterize the CO (250 ppm) suppression of early (1 h) LPS-induced inflammation in human monocytic THP-1 cells. CO suppressed 79 of 101 immediate-early genes induced by LPS; 19&#x00025; (15/79) were transcription factors and most others were cytokines, chemokines and immune response genes. The prototypic effects of CO on transcription and protein production occurred early but decreased rapidly. CO activated p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and Akt and caused an early and transitory delay in LPS-induced JNK activation. However, selective inhibitors of these kinases failed to block CO suppression of LPS-induced IL-1&#x003b2;, an inflammation marker. Of CO-suppressed genes, 81&#x00025; (64/79) were found to have promoters with putative NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites. CO was subsequently shown to block LPS-induced phosphorylation and degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; in human monocytes, thereby inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B signal transduction. CO broadly suppresses the initial inflammatory response of human monocytes to LPS by reshaping proximal events in TLR4 signal transduction such as stress kinase responses and early NF-&#x003ba;B activation. These rapid, but transient effects of CO may have therapeutic applications in acute pulmonary and vascular injury.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Carbon monoxide (CO), an endogenous messenger generated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Tenhunen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, has cytoprotective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Morse1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Kirkby1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, anti-proliferative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Ryter1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Kim1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and anti-inflammatory effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Otterbein1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Hoetzel1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> that indicate a potential for clinical applications.

Conversely, other work has associated the anti-inflammatory activity of CO with NADPH oxidase inhibition and decreased oxygen radical generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Nakahira1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Srisook1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, these findings in rodents suggest a complex, compartmentalized pattern of signaling that appears to be highly dependent on experimental conditions and timing.</p><p>Studies using human cells are more limited, but also demonstrate a range of effects and similarly indicate that CO signal transduction may be context dependent. In A549 cells, a human pulmonary epithelial line, CO gas (250 ppm) inhibited IL-17-induced activation of ERK1/2 and had no effect on p38 MAPK or JNK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Ning1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Somewhat differently, CO was shown in Caco-2 cells (an adenocarcinoma line), to decrease cytokine-induced activation of p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK1/2 as well as NF-&#x003ba;B, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Megias1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Another group also reported that CO suppressed NF-&#x003ba;B activation in LPS-challenged human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), attenuating the induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Sun2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Again suggesting that CO may decrease NAPDH oxidase function and ROS production, CO was found to dampen the respiratory burst in human neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Masini1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. However, inhaled CO gas (500 ppm) failed to reduce LPS-induced inflammation in human volunteers, despite substantial anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-challenged mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Mayr1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, human compared to rodent studies show both overlap and differences. Defining the mechanisms, kinetics and targets of CO signaling in human cells is essential to understanding its therapeutic potential.</p><p>The goals of this investigation were to identify the earliest gene targets of CO signaling in human monocytes and to examine its mechanisms. Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to globally characterize the effects of CO on Toll-like-receptor (TLR) 4-mediated gene regulation 1 h after LPS challenge in human THP-1 cells. Pivotal target genes and signal transduction events were subsequently verified in primary human monocytes. The predominant effect of CO was to suppress LPS-induced immediate-early genes including transcription factors, cytokines and chemokines. Suppression of gene transcription was rapid, but also transient. Several LPS-responsive stress kinase pathways, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and Akt, were activated by CO, while LPS-induced JNK phosphorylation was briefly delayed. However, kinase inhibitors failed to block CO-suppression of IL-1&#x003b2;, indicating that effects on these pathways were tangential rather than causative. Most of the genes suppressed by CO were associated with NF-&#x003ba;B regulation and CO was shown to interfere with an early step in LPS/TLR4 mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation in human monocytes. The mechanism and kinetics of inflammatory response suppression by CO has implications for its use as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents</title><p><italic>Salmonella minnesota</italic> Re595 LPS was obtained from List Biologic (Campbell, CA).

microarray data, expression intensities for each probeset were computed as MAS5 signal intensities, and subsequently quantile-normalized and transformed to homogeneous variance using the

ANOVA was carried out on the transformed values, accounting for batch (factor 1) and 4 distinct treatments (factor 2). The empirical Bayes method of pooling residual variance across many probesets was employed to increase the power of the ANOVA, as implemented in JMP-Genomics (SAS, Inc, Cary, NC). Post-hoc contrasts of LPS vs. control and LPS-CO vs. LPS were computed. A composite p-value for the event that both LPS increased and LPS-CO subsequently decreased the expression levels, was computed as follows: p-both events &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; (max (p<sub>1</sub>,p<sub>2</sub>))<sup>2</sup>, where p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub> are the calculated p-values for each separate event, and independence of the events is assumed.

Gene selection cutoffs for CO-suppression were chosen to capture a large enough list of genes for meaningful bioinformatic analyses and thereby allow us to explore mechanisms underlying this response. A review of the literature and preliminary PCR testing of known CO-target genes demonstrated CO to have modest, but reproducible effects on important inflammatory response genes at the very early time point of interest. These considerations led to the use of liberal criteria for CO-suppression, namely FDR &#x02264;20&#x00025; and &#x02265;1.2 fold downregulation (corresponding to FC &#x02264;0.83), which returned 79 genes.</p><p>Transcription factors were identified among differentially expressed genes using Genomatix&#x000ae; Bibliosphere (Munich, Germany), a text mining database derived from published articles. One additional transcription factor was found using PubMed. NF-&#x003ba;B target genes were similarly first sought using Genomatix&#x000ae; Bibliosphere. Gene promoters from our entire list of CO-suppressed transcripts were also subjected to a sequence-based analysis using Biobase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biobase-international.com">http://www.biobase-international.com</ext-link>) to identify additional genes with putative NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites.

In the absence of LPS, CO had little or no effect on gene expression. Only two genes of questionable relevance (putative binding protein 7a5 and uncharacterized gastric protein ZG33P) were identified as CO-suppressed in the absence of LPS, using liberal selection criteria (FDR &#x02264;20&#x00025; and FC &#x02264;0.83). At 1 h, LPS primarily upregulated gene expression as illustrated by the marked asymmetry of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008139-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. Likewise, the predominant effect of CO was to suppress these LPS-induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008139-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Of 101 genes (162 probesets) induced by LPS (FDR &#x02264;10&#x00025;, FC &#x02265;2), CO suppressed the expression of 78&#x00025; (79 unique genes, 120 probesets), using a liberal selection criteria (FDR &#x02264;20&#x00025; and FC &#x02264;0.83) to avoid missing important CO effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008139-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, neither of the two genes that were marginally suppressed by CO in the absence of LPS were significantly suppressed in the presence of LPS.

Although conducted in THP-1 cells, a monocytic cell line, many CO-suppressed genes were subsequently confirmed in primary human monocytes. CO was found to broadly suppress LPS-induced immediate-early genes that initiate and propagate inflammation including pivotal transcription factors (e.g. EGR family members and ATF3), cytokines (e.g. IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;) and chemokines (CCL5, CXCL1 and IL-8). Using IL-1&#x003b2; as a prototypic target gene, CO suppression of transcription was found to be very fast, but transient, a response pattern reminiscent of LPS-induced kinase activation. While CO activated p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and Akt and perhaps more importantly delayed LPS-induced JNK activation, inhibitors of these kinase pathways failed to substantially block CO suppression as measured by effects on IL-1&#x003b2;. An analysis of CO suppressed genes revealed that most were transcriptionally regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B.

Mice deficient in MKK3, an upstream activator of p38 MAPK failed to modulate TNF-&#x003b1; or upregulate IL-10 in response to CO after LPS challenge. In our experiments, CO effects were additive with LPS in activating p38 MAPK, but unlike the mouse experiments, inhibiting p38 MAPK did not block CO suppression of IL-1&#x003b2;. In addition to p38 MAPK activation, CO inhibition of ERK1/2, an effect opposite to our results in human monocytes, has been associated with the suppression of inflammation.

Notably, CO effects on JNK have also been associated with cytoprotection from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-CondedelaRosa1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, an important function of CO that was not examined in the current investigation.</p><p>An <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of our microarray results suggested that the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway might be a pivotal effector of CO suppression in human monocytes. NF-&#x003ba;B is held dormant in the cytoplasm of resting cells by I&#x003ba;B. LPS challenge leads to the rapid phosphorylation and degradation of I&#x003ba;B, allowing NF-&#x003ba;B to translocate to the nucleus, where it binds to promoters and activates the transcription of inflammatory response genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Sharif1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Guha1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Hayden1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. A role for NF-&#x003ba;B in CO suppression is supported by previous studies in murine macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Sarady1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, human umbilical vein endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Sun2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and Caco-2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Megias1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, a human colonic adenocarcinoma line. CO inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation has been associated with the suppression of a number of genes including GM-CSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Sarady1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, iNOS, ICAM-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Cepinskas1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, IL-8, IL-6 and MMP-7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Megias1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. While CORM-2 was shown to attenuate NF-&#x003ba;B activation in the livers of septic mice, another <italic>in vivo</italic> study of inhaled CO found no effect on NF-&#x003ba;B activation in rat liver allografts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Kaizu1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Two other investigations studying the anti-apoptotic activity of CO have reported CO-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation in rat hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Kim2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, and mouse, cow and human endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Brouard1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, CO (250 ppm) was shown in our experiments to reproducibly disrupt I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation and degradation, and subsequent NF-&#x003ba;B activation in LPS-stimulated human monocytes.</p><p>Although CO interference with LPS-TLR4 activation of NF-&#x003ba;B appears to be a pivotal event in the early suppression of gene transcription, the exact mechanism and molecular target(s) of this effect are not entirely clear. Immediate events in LPS-TLR4 signal transduction include the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as MyD88. The MyD88-dependent arm of LPS-TLR4 signaling culminates in the rapid-phase activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and stress kinase pathways. In parallel, the MyD88-independent pathway leads to a slightly later phase of NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Nakahira and colleagues have reported in murine RAW264.7 cells compelling results demonstrating that CO disrupts the recruitment of essential adaptor proteins, specifically MyD88 and TRIF, to the TLR4 receptor complex, thereby reshaping LPS signal propagation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008139-Nakahira1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Alterations in these very early LPS-TLR4 signaling events seem like a plausible explanation for both the brief delay in JNK activation and interference with NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated gene induction. Given the regulatory complexity, it also seems likely that changes in the kinetics of adaptor protein recruitment might produce a variety of stress kinase pathway effects depending on the specific cellular context.</p><p>CO was shown to suppress immediate-early gene induction in LPS challenged human monocytes. CO activated several stress kinase pathways, while LPS-induced JNK activation was delayed and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling was impaired. Future investigations should focus on early events upstream from NF-&#x003ba;B and stress kinase pathway activation, as well as clinical studies to determine the utility of CO-based therapies in the management of acute inflammation. Our results would suggest that the greatest benefits of CO might be realized in situations where the inflammatory challenge is predictable and brief such as cardiac bypass or ischemia/reperfusion in transplant surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008139.s001"><label>Table
