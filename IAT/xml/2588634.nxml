These cancers exhibit a relentless malignant progression characterized by widespread invasion throughout the brain, and thus usually result in a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although multiple genetic alterations are involved in the development and progression of malignant gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], epigenetic silencing of wild-type tumor suppressor genes via aberrant promoter hypermethylation has also been shown to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Aberrant promoter methylation of CpG island-associated genes is a common epigenetic alteration associated with the inactivation of tumor suppressor and other genes in human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Unmethylated in normal tissues, promoters of these genes can become methylated <italic>de novo </italic>in cancer cells. This change is accompanied by alterations in histone modification and chromatin conformation, rendering the promoter transcriptionally inert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Such epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the inactivation of several key regulators of the cell cycle (<italic>RB, p16INK4A, p73</italic>), DNA repair (<italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup><italic>MGMT</italic>), apoptosis (<italic>DAP kinase</italic>), angiogenesis (<italic>THBS1</italic>), and invasion (<italic>TIMP3</italic>) in glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, novel hypermethylated genes in glioma have been identified using a candidate gene approach or by a genome-wide screening method. The former revealed that genes such as EMP3, TMS1/ASC, SLC5A8, hMLH and PTEN are frequently targeted for DNA methylation-mediated silencing in glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A genome-wide screen using a combined approach of pharmacologic inhibition of epigenetic modifications and gene expression microarrays also revealed that several novel genes are subject to aberrant hypermethylation in glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus, aberrant methylation events have become critical to our understanding of the initiation and progression of human brain malignancies and may serve as a biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis and susceptibility to treatment.</p><p>Leucine-rich repeat C4 protein (<italic>LRRC4</italic>) is a new member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily located at 7q31-32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It was found to be predominantly expressed in normal brain tissue and involved in early nervous system development and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but the expression of <italic>LRRC4 </italic>was absent in several malignant glioma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similarly, it was absent or significantly down-regulated in 87.5% of primary glioma biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. More importantly, <italic>LRRC4 </italic>had the potential to suppress tumorigenesis of U251 malignant glioma cells in vivo and cell proliferation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recent studies show that <italic>LRRC4 </italic>can block U251 cells in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>and induce U251 cell-growth arrest and differentiation by down-regulating the ERK/Akt/NF-&#x003ba;B, STAT3 and JNK2/p-c-Jun/p53 signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the loss of <italic>LRRC4 </italic>function may be an important event in the progression of gliomas and may act as a novel candidate for tumor suppression. However, little is known about the mechanism of <italic>LRRC4 </italic>expression loss or down- regulation in glioma cell lines and biopsies. No known studies have found genetic alterations in the <italic>LRRC4 </italic>coding sequence in glioma biopsies or cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This lack of findings led us to explore an alternative mechanism underlying inactivation of <italic>LRRC4 </italic>in glioma.</p><p>In the present study, we cloned the <italic>LRRC4 </italic>promoter with characteristics of a CpG island.

Genetic mechanisms such as mutation, deletion, and structural chromosome rearrangement are known to inactivate tumor-suppressor genes. Our previous studies demonstrated that the expression of the <italic>LRRC4 </italic>gene was not only highly specific in brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], but also a candidate tumor-suppressor gene that may be involved in the pathogenesis of malignant gliomas. However, no genetic alterations of the <italic>LRRC4 </italic>coding region were found in glioma. Based on these data, we speculated that the absence or down-regulation of <italic>LRRC4 </italic>expression in glioma may be caused by the 5' upstream regulatory sequence.</p><p>In the present study, we cloned and characterized 2375 bp (-2475 to -101) of the 5' genomic region of the <italic>LRRC4 </italic>gene, which shows baseline promoter activity. Furthermore, transfection experiments using a series of 5'-deleted constructs demonstrated that the region -835 to -293 is sufficient to mediate maximal promoter activity. This region can also drive eGFP expression in the eGFP-reporter plasmid (data not shown). These results suggest that we have found a function of the <italic>LRRC4 </italic>promoter.</p><p>The functional <italic>LRRC4 </italic>promoter region is a TATA- and CATT- less, high GC content region and has characteristics of a CpG island. This is consistent with brain-specific gene <italic>LRRC4 </italic>since many tissue-specific genes possess CpG islands in regulatory regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>It is well known that aberrant methylation of CpG islands is one of the major modes of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer, and a growing list of genes are being identified as abnormal methylation of promoters having CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Here, the <italic>LRRC4 </italic>promoter was found to be methylated in two glioma cell lines (SF126 and SF767) and all 30 primary gliomas that we have collected, but not in the normal brain tissue samples, suggesting that <italic>LRRC4 </italic>methylation is a tumor-specific event. Furthermore, there was no correlation between clinical stage, sex or age and <italic>LRRC4 </italic>methylation. Methylation of <italic>LRRC4 </italic>was detected in both the early and late stages of glioma, indicating that the inactivation of the <italic>LRRC4 </italic>gene might be essential in the early development of glioma and persist through the course of development.</p><p>Treatment of SF126 and SF767 cells with 5-Aza-dC restored <italic>LRRC4 </italic>expression, which suggests that aberrant hypermethylation of the promoter is directly responsible for transcription inactivation of its expression in glioma cell lines. The molecular mechanism through which DNA methylation silences gene expression is not fully understood. DNA methylation may directly interfere with the binding of transcription factors, resulting in the transcriptional repression of the associated gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, methyl-binding domains containing proteins (MBDs) may bind to areas of dense DNA methylation and recruit histone deacetylases and transcriptional repressor complexes, which is refractory to transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Bisulfite sequence analysis of the CpG island around the <italic>LRRC4 </italic>promoter reveals dense methylation of CpG sites in glioma cell lines and tissues compared with non-tumor brain specimens (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that promoter methylation is an important mechanism in the inactivation of <italic>LRRC4 </italic>in glioma.</p><p>The present study implies that methylation-mediated inactivation of <italic>LRRC4 </italic>is involved in the initiation and development of glioma. Since <italic>LRRC4 </italic>promoter methylation is found in glioma but not in the normal brain, it may distinguish tumors from normal tissue and serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosis. Our previous study indicated that <italic>LRRC4 </italic>may be an adhesive protein or/and receptor, and it inhibited glioma invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Since the ability of invasion and metastasis is closely related to prognosis in glioma, <italic>LRRC4 </italic>methylation may also be a biomarker for prognosis. In addition, our findings demonstrate that methylase inhibitor can reverse <italic>LRRC4 </italic>expression in glioma, and it is possible to restore its function as tumor suppressor gene at some degree. This shows that <italic>LRRC4 </italic>may be a potential target for therapy. Of course, all of these hypotheses must be further studied using a large sample analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, methylation-mediated inactivation of <italic>LRRC4 </italic>is a frequent and glioma-specific event that may be a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, or a useful target for therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZPZ participated in the study design and coordination, data collection, drafting of the manuscript and DNA methylation analysis.
