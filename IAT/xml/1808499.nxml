Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is a cytoplasmic mRNA binding protein whose expression is lost in fragile X syndrome. Here we show that FMRP binds to the coding region of APP mRNA at a guanine-rich, G-quartet&#x02013;like sequence.

Despite these similar endpoints, the pathobiology of AD and FXS have not previously been linked. We have established that translation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is cleaved to generate neurotoxic &#x003b2;amyloid, is normally repressed by the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in the dendritic processes of neurons. Activation of a particular subtype of glutamate receptor (mGluR<sub>5</sub>) rapidly increases translation of APP in neurons by displacing FMRP from a guanidine-rich sequence in the coding region of APP mRNA. In the absence of FMRP, APP synthesis is constitutively increased and nonresponsive to mGluR-mediated signaling. Excess APP is proteolytically cleaved to generate significantly elevated &#x003b2;amyloid in multiple mutant mouse strains lacking FMRP compared to wild type. Our data support a growing consensus that FMRP binds to guanine-rich domains of some dendritic mRNAs, suppressing their translation and suggest that AD (neurodegenerative disorder) and FXS (neurodevelopmental disorder) may share a common molecular pathway leading to the overproduction of APP and its protein-cleaving derivatives.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Westmark CJ, Malter JS (2007) FMRP mediates mGluR<sub>5</sub>-dependent translation of amyloid precursor protein.

The putative G-quartet motif in APP mRNA has the potential to form a stable structure containing three guanine planes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050052-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). FMRP binds to G-rich sequences (so-called G-quartets; consensus site: DWGG-N<sub>(0&#x02013;2)</sub>-DWGG-N<sub>(0&#x02013;1)</sub>-DWGG-N<sub>(0&#x02013;1)</sub>-DWGG, where D is any nucleotide except C and W is A or U) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; arranged in a planar conformation and stabilized by Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds. In the human APP mRNAs, the G-rich region containing the putative G-quartet motif is found in all three splice variants (APP695, APP751, and APP770; 87 nucleotides upstream of the sequence coding for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain, which is missing in APP695). FMRP also binds to kissing complex sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, but APP mRNA lacks such a site.

After 1 hr, APP remained elevated in stimulated SNs over the control, but the difference was less (1.6-fold) than at 15 min, suggesting more persistent translation in the unstimulated controls, slowing of new synthesis after stimulation, and/or compensatory protein turnover in the DHPG-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g003">3</xref>B).

In WT SNs, there was a rapid increase in total APP levels within 5 min of DHPG treatment (1.6-fold, <italic>n &#x0003d;</italic> 3), which was completely absent in KO SNs. Regardless of treatment, APP levels remained nearly constant over time in KO SNs, as did &#x003b2;-actin.

Within 20 min of DHPG treatment, APP levels in WT SNs approached those seen in unstimulated KO SNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Protease inhibitors increased steady-state levels of APP in WT SNs to those seen in KO SNs (unpublished data). These data suggest that APP mRNA is translationally repressed by FMRP in unstimulated WT SNs. mGluR activation rapidly derepresses APP synthesis as shown for FMRP and PSD-95 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

Surprisingly, the G-rich area immediately preceding the G-quartet (nt 699&#x02013;796) was approximately 4-fold more protected from nuclease digestion than fragments containing the predicted G-quartet (825&#x02013;846). Although this protected area does not contain a canonical G-quartet motif, the sequence is very G-rich and contains several closely spaced DWGG repeats. The smallest amplicon (nt 774&#x02013;871) containing the predicted G-quartet motif amplified a 98-base fragment, of which 46 nucleotides were guanines (47&#x00025; G-rich; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050052-st001">Table S1</xref>). Although this is the most G-rich amplicon of those tested, and T1 ribonuclease cuts 3&#x02032; of single-stranded G-residues, the 98-nt protected fragment (amplicon 699&#x02013;796) was 40&#x00025; G-rich, providing nearly equivalent numbers of targets for digestion. Thus, nucleotides 699&#x02013;796 in the coding region of APP mRNA possess a G-rich sequence that is protected from nuclease digestion by an RNP complex containing FMRP.</p><p>The FMRP-containing RNP complex likely protects other <italic>cis</italic>-elements in APP mRNA as well.

The G-quartet&#x02013;like sequence immediately downstream of this G-rich region was not protected from nuclease digestions of FMRP IPs.

DHPG-upregulated translation of APP can be blocked by the translational inhibitor anisomycin or the mGluR<sub>5</sub>-specific inhibitor MPEP. mGluR-mediated translation is concurrent with FMRP dissociation from APP mRNA and is independent of mRNA decay. The rapid dissociation of FMRP from APP mRNA, in response to mGluR activation, suggests that post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate FMRP binding activity. Ceman and colleagues have shown that FMRP is phosphorylated N-terminal to the RGG box and that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation status of the protein is correlated with binding to stalled versus active polyribosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data support a model developing in the literature whereby FMRP acts as an immediate early-response protein that regulates translation at the synapse. When FMRP is bound to APP or other synaptic mRNAs, translation is repressed. Upon mGluR activation, FMRP is released from the nontranslating RNP, resulting in prompt protein synthesis. In FXS, high levels of protein are constitutively produced that are normally translationally repressed by FMRP.</p><p>We would predict that constitutively upregulated APP would lead to increased processing to A&#x003b2;.

APP levels in the puncta of four to seven dendrites per sample were quantitated with IMAGE J software using the Analyze Particles function (minimum of 205 puncta analyzed per treatment) (Rasband, W.S., Image J, U.S. National Institutes of Health, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>; 1997&#x02013;2006).

The samples were thawed and vortexed to prepare SN lysates. To directly reverse-transcribe RNA from SN lysates without an RNA purification step, a modified method for the detection of mRNA in single neurons was utilized &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, 2 &#x003bc;l SN lysate was added per standard RT reaction containing RNase-free DNase I and random nonamer primer. The reactions were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 15 min to destroy any contaminating genomic DNA, 65 &#x000b0;C for 5 min to inactivate the DNase I, and 20 &#x000b0;C for 10 min to anneal the random primer. Omniscript RT was added and reverse transcription proceeded at 37 &#x000b0;C for 60 min before inactivation at 93 &#x000b0;C for 5 min. The RT reactions were diluted 5-fold with DEPC water prior to real-time PCR analysis. For the statistical analysis, APP mRNA levels from triplicate experiments were determined, normalized to 18S rRNA, and plotted as a percentage of total APP mRNA. Error bars depict SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Real-time PCR controls, standard curves, and analyses.</title><p>The PCR primers were designed with Primer Express software from Applied Biosystems, and BLAST homology searches of the amplicons revealed that the primers were gene specific. PCR reactions were optimized for primer and template concentrations and contained 500 nM APP primers (forward: 1701-ccgtggcacccttttgg-1717; and reverse: 1774-gggcgggcgtcaaca-1760) or 300 nM 18S primers (forward: 98-cattaaatcagttatggttcctttgg-123; and reverse: 181-tcggcatgtattagctctagaattacc-155), 10.5 &#x003bc;l 1:5 diluted RT reaction and 12.5 &#x003bc;l SYBR green PCR mix in a 25 &#x003bc;l reaction volume. The cycle conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 &#x000b0;C and 10 min at 95 &#x000b0;C (40 cycles: 15 s at 95 &#x000b0;C, 1 min at 60 &#x000b0;C), followed by a dissociation stage for 15 s at 95 &#x000b0;C, 1 min at 60 &#x000b0;C, and 15 s at 95 &#x000b0;C. The average PCR efficiencies for the APP and 18S primers over a 200-fold concentration range were 100&#x00025; (APP) and 101&#x00025; (18S) (<italic>n &#x0003d;</italic> 9 experiments each), with a delta slope of 0.079. As the difference in slopes between the sample PCR (APP) and the normalization control (18S) was less than 0.1, the comparative C<sub>T</sub> method was utilized to calculate the relative concentration of APP mRNA normalized to 18S rRNA. SNs are void of nuclei; however to ensure there was no genomic DNA contamination, control RT reactions on SN templates in the absence of reverse transcriptase were analyzed by real-time PCR and found void of APP PCR product. The final APP and 18S PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and were single bands of the correct molecular weight by EtBr staining (74 bp for APP; 84 bp for 18S).</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>FMRP IPs and real-time PCR analysis.</title><p>SN lysates were precleared with protein A magnetic beads and immunoprecipitated with 10 &#x003bc;l RNasin, 10 &#x003bc;g 7G1&#x02013;1 FMRP antibody (or no antibody controls), and 100 &#x003bc;l packed fresh protein A magnetic beads for 3 h at 4 &#x000b0;C.
