It is well established that LPS activates this response through NF-&#x003ba;B. In addition, LPS signals through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We previously demonstrated that the Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor 5 [KLF5; also known as intestine-enriched Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor (IKLF)] is activated by the MAPK. In the current study, we examined whether KLF5 mediates the signaling cascade elicited by LPS. Treatment of the intestinal epithelial cell line, IEC6, with LPS resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in KLF5 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Concurrently, mRNA levels of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-&#x003ba;B were increased by LPS treatment. Pretreatment with the MAPK inhibitor, U0126, or the LPS antagonist, polymyxin B, resulted in an attenuation of KLF5, p50 and p65 NF-&#x003ba;B subunit mRNA levels from LPS treatment. Importantly, suppression of KLF5 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in a reduction in p50 and p65 subunit mRNA levels and NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity in response to LPS. LPS treatment also led to an increase in secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 from IEC6, both of which were reduced by siRNA inhibition of KLF5. In addition, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) levels were increased in LPS-treated IEC6 cells and this increase was associated with increased adhesion of Jurkat lymphocytes to IEC6. The induction of ICAM-1 expression and T cell adhesion to IEC6 by LPS were both abrogated by siRNA inhibition of KLF5. These results indicate that KLF5 is an important mediator for the proinflammatory response elicited by LPS in intestinal epithelial cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The gastrointestinal tract is under constant assault by a wide variety of microbial pathogens. The body's first line of defense is the innate immune response. This requires the recognition of pattern-associated membrane proteins (PAMPs), which are bacterial components, by sensors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are examples of these PRRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). A TLR is made up of single-spanning transmembrane domain, extracellular leucine-rich repeats and a cytosolic TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor) domain. To date, 13 TLRs have been identified in mice and 11 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). TLR4, which is recognized by the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), utilizes a dual MyD88-dependent and -independent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Both pathways lead to the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and the subsequent induction of expression of proinflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, LPS can trigger proinflammatory cytokine gene expression by activation of a number of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways that include extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 and c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK). The three MAPK pathways are regulated by different upstream components: ERK1/2 by MAP/extracellular-regulated kinase1/2 (MEK1/2); p38 by protein kinase R (PKR); and JNK by MEK1/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Previous reports indicate that endotoxin exposure results in the expression of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) through the Ras/MEK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Inhibition of the Ras/MEK pathway by U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, results in a reduction of cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Furthermore, LPS also induces the expression of the early response gene, Egr-1, a downstream target of MEK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Collectively, these published results indicate that LPS can activate cellular response through the MAPK.</p><p>Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factors (KLFs) are zinc finger-containing transcription factors that exhibit homology to Kr&#x000fc;ppel from <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Two KLFs are highly expressed in the intestinal epithelium: KLF4 (also known as gut-enriched Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor or GKLF), found in upper villus region, and KLF5 (also known as intestine-enriched Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor or IKLF), present in the lower crypt compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Expression of KLF4 is associated with epithelial differentiation and post-mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Recently, KLF4 has been shown to be regulated by LPS in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Our earlier studies indicate that KLF5 is a pro-proliferative regulator in cultured fibroblasts and intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Studies also demonstrate that KLF5 is activated by the MAPK, ERK1/2, through Egr-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Because LPS also activates the MAPK pathway, we sought to determine whether KLF5 can be activated by LPS in cultured intestinal epithelial cells and to determine the consequence of such activation on signals elicited by LPS. We show that treatment of intestinal epithelial cells, IEC6, with LPS leads to the induction in KLF5 expression and subsequently KLF5-dependent induction in NF-&#x003ba;B expression. We also demonstrate that KLF5 is crucial in mediating LPS-elicited proinflammatory responses due to its critical involvement in the induction of expression of proinflammatory genes. These results indicate an important role played by KLF5 in innate immunity in response to LPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The intestinal epithelial cells, IEC6, were maintained in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 U/ml insulin and 1% streptomycin.

Previous studies indicate that LPS activates NF-&#x003ba;B by a post-translational mechanism involving modification and degradation of the inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B, I&#x003ba;B, followed by nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). We sought to determine whether LPS can regulate NF-&#x003ba;B activity at the level of transcription in IEC6 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that LPS treatment of IEC6 cells led to an increase in the levels of mRNA for the p65 and p50 subunits of NF-&#x003ba;B, as well as those for KLF5. The induction of NF-&#x003ba;B subunit transcripts by LPS has not previously been reported.</p><p>We then determined the effect of PMXB, a LPS antagonist that interferes with the interaction of TLR4 and LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), on expression of KLF5 and NF-&#x003ba;B subunits in IEC6 cells following LPS treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that cells treated with LPS alone had increased mRNA levels of KLF5, and p65 and p50 subunits of NF-&#x003ba;B (lane 2). The levels of these transcripts were also increased when cells were treated with PMXB alone (lane 3). This finding is consistent with a recent observation that PMXB had a direct effect on monocyte-derived human dendritic cells including activation of ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). However, when cells were treated by both LPS and PMXB, there was a nearly complete abolishment of the three mRNAs (lane 4). This reveals that the induction in KLF5 expression is a response to LPS treatment, possibly through TLR signaling.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrate that LPS induces cellular response through the MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Our recent studies indicate that KLF5 is regulated by MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). To determine whether LPS can stimulate KLF5 through the MAPK pathway, we pretreated IEC6 cells with U0126, a MAPK inhibitor. In both water control- and vehicle- [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] treated cells, the levels of KLF5, p50 and p65 transcripts were significantly elevated in the presence of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; lanes 2 and 4, respectively). However, when cells were treated with U0126, the increase in KLF5 and NF-&#x003ba;B subunit mRNAs in response to LPS was abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; lane 6). These results indicate that LPS-stimulated KLF5 expression is mediated by the MAPK pathway, as is expression of the two NF-&#x003ba;B subunits.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of KLF5 by siRNA results in abrogation of LPS-stimulated expression of NF-&#x003ba;B subunits in IEC6 cells</title><p>We next determined whether the LPS-stimulated KLF5 expression in IEC6 cells is responsible for the increased expression of NF-&#x003ba;B subunits. This was accomplished by siRNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that the increased levels of KLF5 mRNA in response to LPS were significantly attenuated in cells transfected with KLF5-specific siRNA as compared to mock-transfected cells or cells transfected with non-specific (NS) siRNA. Importantly, increased mRNA levels of the p65 and p50 NF-&#x003ba;B subunits in response to LPS were also reduced in cells transfected with KLF5-specific siRNA as compared to mock-transfected cells or cells transfected with non-specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, NF-&#x003ba;B binding activity in response to LPS was significantly reduced in cells transfected with KLF5-specific siRNA when compared to mock-transfected cells or cells transfected with non-specific (NS) siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This reduction correlated with blocked induction of KLF5 protein in the presence of LPS in cells transfected with KLF5-specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Lastly, treatment of cells with TLCK, an NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor, did not result in a reduction in the levels of KLF5 mRNA in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results indicate that KLF5 is an upstream mediator of NF-&#x003ba;B subunit expression following LPS treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of KLF5 results in diminished secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 from IEC6 cells following LPS treatment</title><p>Studies showed that LPS activates expression of proinflammatory genes, such as those encoding cytokines and cell adhesion molecules, in a pathway that is dependent on NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). We thus treated IEC6 cells with LPS for various periods of time and measured the quantities of two cytokines, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, in the media. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, LPS significantly increased the secretion of both cytokines over that of the control from 8 to 72 h. To determine whether KLF5 plays a role in LPS-stimulated secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, we inhibited expression of KLF5 by siRNA followed by LPS treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> show that secretion of both cytokines was increased in mock-transfected or cells transfected with non-specific (NS) siRNA following 48 h of LPS treatment. In contrast, LPS treatment failed to increase the secretion of either TNF-&#x003b1; or IL-6 in cells transfected with KLF5-specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Combining the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, our studies demonstrate that KLF5 is necessary for the induction of NF-&#x003ba;B gene expression and subsequent TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 production in IEC6 cells treated with LPS.</p></sec><sec><title>KLF5 inhibition in IEC6 cells results in diminished induction of ICAM-1 expression and heterotopic cell adhesion in response to LPS</title><p>Previous studies showed that expression of ICAM-1 is increased in LPS-treated endothelial cells and that this increase mediates subsequent neutrophil&#x02013;endothelial interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). We sought to determine whether ICAM-1 expression is also increased in IEC6 cells treated with LPS and whether such increase mediates increased cell&#x02013;cell adhesion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that LPS treatment of IEC6 cells exhibited a time-dependent increase in the level of ICAM-1 protein up to 24 h and that this increase was preceded by the increase in KLF5 protein level. Transfection of cells with KLF5-specific siRNA resulted in a diminished induction of KLF5 and ICAM-1 protein levels in response to LPS as compared to mock-transfected cells or cells transfected with non-specific (NS) siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, using a co-culture system, we showed that adhesion of the Jurkat T lymphocytes to IEC6 cells in response to LPS treatment was abolished in IEC6 cells transfected with KLF5-specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, adhesion of Jurkat to IEC6 cells was increased after LPS treatment in mock-transfected or cells transfected with non-specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results demonstrate that KLF5 is crucial in mediating increased cell adhesion between lymphocytes and IEC6 cells from LPS treatment by activating expression of ICAM-1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>TLRs are pathogen recognition molecules that activate the immune system as part of the innate immune response.

LPS, a membrane glycolipid of Gram-negative bacteria, exhibits strong immunostimulating activity among TLR ligands and has been studied in great detail. Recent studies have shown that cell surface TLR4-MD2 physically interacts with LPS and triggers the release of an LPS signal, revealing a host&#x02013;pathogen interaction mediated by TLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). It is now well established that the nuclear transcription factor, NF-&#x003ba;B, plays a crucial role in mediating the intracellular signaling generated by LPS that eventually leads to the induction of expression of proinflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Abundant literature has documented that the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by LPS is mediated by post-translational modification and proteosomal degradation of I&#x003ba;B, an inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p><p>The intestinal epithelium is an integral part of the innate immunity in defense of bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Previous studies indicate that TLR4 is present in several intestinal epithelial cell lines, including IEC6, rendering the cells responsive to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). The rationale behind our study was based on the previous findings that LPS activates the MAPK, ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) and that ERK1/2 stimulates KLF5 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Furthermore, recently published data showed a member of the Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor family, KLF4, is induced in macrophages in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). However, in IEC6 cells, expression of KLF4 is not significantly induced by LPS (results not shown). Instead, we demonstrated an alternative and independent mechanism by which NF-&#x003ba;B becomes activated by LPS that requires the induction of expression of the gene encoding KLF5 in IEC6 cells. We showed that the levels of KLF5 mRNA and protein are increased in IEC6 cells treated with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>, respectively). This increase is inhibited by treatment of cells with the MAPK inhibitor, U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming that the induction of KLF5 in response to LPS is mediated by MAPK. Importantly, LPS treatment of IEC6 cells also increases the mRNA levels of the two NF-&#x003ba;B subunits, p65 and p50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and that this increase is attenuated by the transfection of cells with siRNA that inhibits KLF5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, the increase in NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity in response to LPS is also abrogated in cells transfected with KLF5-specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that KLF5 is necessary and sufficient for the induction of NF-&#x003ba;B subunit expression secondary to LPS. This finding is further confirmed by the observation that TLCK, an NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor, fails to inhibit the increase in KLF5 mRNA level in response to LPS, therefore placing KLF5 upstream of NF-&#x003ba;B in the LPS-induced signaling pathway.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B has been shown to be critically involved in the transcriptional activation of numerous downstream genes that encode mediators of inflammatory and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Among the cytokines activated by NF-&#x003ba;B are TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). We showed that secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 is significantly increased in IEC6 cells treated with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), a response likely mediated by the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. Similar findings have been documented in previously published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of KLF5 by siRNA abolishes LPS-stimulated secretion of both TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), indicating a critical role for KLF5 in mediating the production of proinflammatory cytokines as a result of LPS treatment.</p><p>In addition to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, an occurrence during innate immune response is the recruitment of leukocytes to the target of infection. ICAM-1, a cell adhesion molecule expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells mediates interactions with immune cells expressing CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). LPS stimulation results in an increase in ICAM-1 expression in intestinal epithelial cells and subsequent adhesion of monocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that LPS stimulates ICAM-1 production in IEC6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and increases adhesion of the Jurkat T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Notably, the induction of KLF-5 production in response to LPS precedes that of ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of KLF5 expression abolishes LPS-stimulated ICAM-1 production and adhesion of lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, respectively). Thus, KLF5 also plays an important physiological role in recruiting leukocytes by LPS-activated IEC6 cells.</p><p>Based on the findings of this and previous studies, we present a model in which KLF5 plays an important role in mediating the proinflammatory response elicited by LPS in intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Here, KLF5 functions primarily as an upstream activator of expression of the two NF-&#x003ba;B subunits, p65 and p50, which subsequently stimulates expression of the three proinflammatory genes studies, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and ICAM-1. This mechanism may represent a relatively &#x02018;late&#x02019; response as compared to the classical mechanism of NF-&#x003ba;B activation through post-translational modification. Additionally, although NF-&#x003ba;B has been shown to activate the expression of each of the three downstream proinflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), our results do not rule out a role for the direct involvement of KLF5 in the transcriptional activation of any or all of the three target genes. Moreover, results of previous studies demonstrate a synergistic effect of KLF5 and NF-&#x003ba;B on transcriptional activation of target genes through a mechanism that involves physical interaction between KLF5 and NF-&#x003ba;B subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). It is possible that all of these mechanisms exist as a way to ensure the establishment of a robust proinflammatory response to a harmful bacterial product. Be that as it may, the results of our studies clearly establish a physiologically significant role played by KLF5 in mediating signaling elicited by LPS. Whether KLF5 may mediate signaling by other TLR ligands is currently being investigated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank J. Lingrel for providing the cDNA plasmid containing KLF5.

Treatment of IEC6 cells by LPS activates MAP kinase activity, which leads to induction of KLF5 mRNA and protein levels.
