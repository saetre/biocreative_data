However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms which control the differentiation of mast cells. One of the excellent markers for mast cell differentiation is <sc>l</sc>-histidine decarboxylase (HDC) (EC4.1.1.22). HDC is a unique enzyme that catalyzes the formation of histamine from <sc>l</sc>-histidine. In cells of hematopoietic lineage, the mouse HDC gene is expressed predominantly in mature mast cells and erythroblastic cells, but not in immature mast cells. The mouse immature mast cell line P815 is induced to mature and express high levels of HDC mRNA by peritoneal cavity incubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c2">2</xref>). Thus, HDC expression correlates well with the differentiation of mast cells. In light of these observations, it is important to clarify how HDC gene expression is regulated during the differentiation process.</p><p>The expression of genes conferring certain specific phenotypes during development and differentiation is often controlled by lineage-specific transcription factors. For instance, the mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA), IL-4, high affinity IgE receptor &#x003b1; chain and IL-1 receptor-related T1 genes are activated by GATA factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c6">6</xref>) and the TNF-&#x003b1; gene in mast cells is activated by the Nrf1 transcription factor, one of the Cap &#x02018;n&#x02019; collar basic leucine zipper (CNC-bZIP) members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c7">7</xref>). In addition, we observed that NF-E2, another member of the CNC-bZIP family, transactivates the mouse HDC gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c2">2</xref>). These data imply that several transcription factors are not only expressed but are also functionally important in mast cells.</p><p>In addition to the control by specific transcription factors, DNA methylation plays a suppressive role in the regulation of gene expression during development. Two primary mechanisms are proposed by which this suppression is mediated: (i)&#x000a0;methylation interferes with the initiation of transcription by preventing binding of the cellular factors AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c8">8</xref>), c-Myc&#x0002f;Myn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c9">9</xref>), E2F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c10">10</xref>) and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c11">11</xref>); (ii) methylation attracts proteins which themselves mediate repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c15">15</xref>). We have previously characterized the structure of the human HDC gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c16">16</xref>) and suggested that an alteration of the DNA methylation state of this gene affects its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c17">17</xref>).</p><p>In this report we have analysed the mouse HDC gene structure and the process of DNA methylation in the context of cell-type specific and inducible gene expression. Isolation of the mouse HDC gene allowed us to examine its promoter activity in the P815 peritoneal incubation system and to research the control mechanism of mast cell-specific gene expression. We showed that the promoter region was demethylated not only in the HDC-expressing cell lines but also in P815 cells when HDC expression was induced by peritoneal incubation. We also demonstrated that DNA methylation around the GC box suppressed the expression of a patch-methylated HDC promoter&#x02013;reporter construct in stably transfected cell lines and that treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azaC restored expression of this construct. These observations suggest that demethylation of the promoter region is necessary for mouse HDC gene expression, and may lead to more general conclusions regarding the molecular control of transcription by methylation mechanisms in mast cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Genomic library screening and analysis of phage clones</title><p>Mouse genomic DNA clones were isolated from a 129Sv-derived E14 ES cell DNA P1 phagemid library by PCR screening with primers designed to produce a 147 bp PCR product (nt &#x0002b;1 to &#x0002b;147) within mouse cDNA (5&#x02032; primer, GAG TGC ACA GCA CAG ACA AAG G; 3&#x02032; primer, TCT AGC TCG GTA GTA TTC ACT).

The fragment size produced with <italic>Pst</italic>I&#x0002f;<italic>Hpa</italic>II digestion was assigned to reflect the methylation states of the CCGG sites in each cell type. <italic>Pst</italic>I&#x0002f;<italic>Hpa</italic>II-digested samples produced smaller fragments in MC9 and DS19 cells than those in control P815, IC2 or NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that the degree of DNA methylation was intense in P815, IC2 and NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd417f4">4</xref>B). To further verify the correlation between HDC gene transcription and DNA methylation, we examined the DNA methylation state in P815 cells under different conditions using control cells, those incubated in the peritoneal cavity and those treated with 5-azaC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd417f4">4</xref>C). Although HDC expression increased greatly after peritoneal incubation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd417f2">2</xref>), we could not detect a shift to smaller fragments but, in contrast, we could detect smaller fragments after 5-azaC treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd417f4">4</xref>C). DNA blotting after methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion can detect only gross changes in methylation state. Therefore, we used sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing to analyze the methylation state of each cytosine residue in the promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd417f5">5</xref>). The majority of these CpG sites were methyl&#x000ad;ated in IC2 and NIH 3T3 cells, which expressed no HDC, and in untreated P815 cells, which expressed only a low level of HDC. In contrast, CpG sites in the GC box were demethylated in HDC-expressing cell lines. In P815 cells after 5-azaC treatment, many CpG sites were partially demethylated by 5-azaC treatment. Thus, the number of demethylated CpG sites seemed generally to correlate with the level of HDC expression. It should be noted that one CpG site next to the GC box was found to be demethylated in P815 cells after i.p. incubation, although it was not detectable by Southern blot analysis. These observations indicate that the promoter region is demethylated in differentiated mast cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Stable transfectants of HDC&#x02013;reporter gene constructs</title><p>To further assess the effect of the methylated promoter on transcriptional activity of the HDC gene, we performed stable transfection assays using patch-methylated pGLm-1099. For this patch-methylation method, we first digested out the promoter fragment from pGLm-1099, methylated it <italic>in vitro</italic> and religated it into the reporter vector backbone. This patch-methylated construct was transfected into P815 cells with a selector plasmid to obtain stable transfectants. After picking up the stable transfectants, we assessed the methylation state by sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing and analyzed their luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd417f6">6</xref>A). It seemed that some CpG sites drastically changed the methylation state after transfection (P2M<sup>&#x02013;</sup>). Some lines (P2M<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, P1M<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and C1&#x02013;5) showed high level luciferase activity. In these clones, the cytosine of the CpG site in the GC box (&#x02013;57 bp) was unmethylated, suggesting again that the methylation state of the GC box is important in the regulation of expression of mouse HDC.</p></sec><sec><title>Forced demethylation experiment in stable transfectants</title><p>To further clarify the functional relationship between methyl&#x000ad;ation state and the transcriptional activity, we measured luciferase activity in the P1M<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and P2M<sup>&#x02013;</sup> lines after 5-azaC treatment. Because the increase in luciferase activity was much higher in the P1M<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> line than in the P2M<sup>&#x02013;</sup> line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd417f6">6</xref>B), we assessed the demethylation state in the P1M<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> line. The promoter activity increased by 5-fold after 5-azaC treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd417f6">6</xref>B) with a simultaneous demethylation of the promoter region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd417f6">6</xref>C). These data indicate that demethylation of the promoter region is functionally important for mouse HDC gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We cloned the mouse HDC gene to analyze transcriptional regulation along with the differentiation process of mast cells. Cloning also made it possible to monitor the methylation state of the promoter region of the HDC gene and to prepare and assay patch-methylated stable transfectants in P815 cells. By using these constructs we could show that transcription of the mouse HDC gene is functionally regulated by DNA methyl&#x000ad;ation. HDC expression is mast cell-specific and increases with cell differentiation. Our results suggest that DNA methylation plays an important role during such lineage- and stage-specific HDC gene expression. DNA demethylation has been shown to correlate with differentiation of a particular tissue or cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c34">34</xref>). In a previous report about the human HDC gene, we also observed methylation events in the promoter region, but functional assays were insufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c17">17</xref>). Therefore, in the present study we used 5-azaC to force demethylation of cytosines. 5-azaC has been shown to inhibit DNA methyltransferase activity by forming a covalent complex with this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c35">35</xref>). The treatment resulted in increased levels of HDC mRNA expression, suggesting that demethylation is functionally important to activate transcription of the HDC gene in these cells.</p><p>The promoter region was found to be widely demethylated in HDC-expressing mast cell lines. In particular, the methylation states around the GC box appeared to differ among cell lines expressing different levels of HDC. Since the mouse promoter region is newly demethylated after peritoneal induction, demethylation is assumed to be involved not only in cell-type specific HDC expression but also in induction of HDC expression. Demethylation at a single specific CpG site just upstream of the GC box could first be clarified using sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing, because this method has a higher resolution than the authentic DNA blotting.</p><p>Our previous data revealed that patch-methylation of the human HDC gene promoter region reduced reporter activity in transient transfection assays using HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c17">17</xref>). In this study, we have studied the effects of patch-methylation on the mouse HDC promoter in a stable transfection system of P815 cells. The key advantages of this system are as follows. First, it is important to examine the expression of methylated plasmids using stable rather than transient transfection, because stably transfected DNA has a more chromatin-like configuration than transiently transfected DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c36">36</xref>). Second, we used the mast cell line P815 instead of other cell lines. By establishing stable transfection the low efficiency of transient transfection could be circumvented. Third, we employed plasmids that harbor localized methylation generated <italic>in vitro</italic>. The effect of <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA methylation on gene expression has been analyzed in stable transfection experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c39">39</xref>) and it was reported that <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation of a stably transfected plasmid containing a promoter&#x02013;reporter gene cassette greatly inhibits gene expression. Since the plasmid is methylated indiscriminately <italic>in vitro</italic>, not only the promoter but also the reporter gene is affected. To avoid this complication, we prepared patch-methylated pGLm-1099 in which only the promoter region was methylated and this plasmid was stably transfected into P815 cells. Using such a system, we observed that the degree of methylation of the promoter region correlated well with silencing in stable transfection experiments. The stable transfectant P1M<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> with the methylated promoter expressed low reporter activity. However, expression of the reporter gene increased after 5-azaC treatment. Sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed that the HDC promoter region became demethylated when the transfectants were treated with 5-azaC. Therefore, these observations suggest that demethylation of the promoter region is important for expression of the mouse HDC reporter gene in chromatin.</p><p>The mouse HDC gene was found to be similar in structure and length to its human homolog. This conservation across species indicates the importance of this gene. Although there are many structural similarities between the human and mouse HDC genes, the mouse gene does not undergo alternative splicing, whereas two splicing variants of 2.4 and 3.4 kb are transcribed from the human HDC gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c16">16</xref>). The longer human HDC mRNA (3.4 kb) is generated by use of an alternative splice acceptor site in exon 12, which splices out one-third of the exon together with intron 11 and preserves the entire intron 7. In contrast, the mouse HDC gene produces only a single transcript of 2.4 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c31">31</xref>). The exon&#x02013;intron boundaries of the mouse HDC gene are generally similar to those of the human HDC gene and the nucleotide sequences of the exons of the mouse gene show 83.7&#x02013;91.9&#x00025; homology to their human counter&#x000ad;parts, although exons 1 and 12 are not so strongly conserved (63.8 and 74.9&#x00025; homology, respectively). A consensus branch site and a branch site-like sequence were found in mouse intron 7 within 100 bp upstream of the acceptor site of exon 8, but there is only a single branch site-like sequence in human intron 7. The presence of a consensus branch site might explain why mouse intron 7 is always removed by splicing. The nucleotide sequence of the alternative splice acceptor site in human exon 12 is different from that of the mouse gene (human, CAG&#x0002f;CC; mouse, GAG&#x0002f;CC). This change (C&#x02192;G) is observed in a small minority of cases as an exon&#x02013;intron boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd417c40">40</xref>). Moreover, one conserved branch site sequence and two branch site-like sequences can be found within 100 bp upstream of the second splice acceptor site in the last exon of the human gene, whereas no such sequences were found in the mouse gene. These sequence differences may be involved in the observed differences in splicing patterns between the two species.</p><p>In the present report, we have provided experimental results showing the structure of the mouse HDC gene, the process of DNA methylation in the context of cell-type specific and inducible gene expression and the effect of demethylation around the promoter region on transcriptional activity. Our observations suggest that demethylation of the promoter region is necessary for mouse HDC gene expression, and may lead to more general conclusions concerning the molecular control of transcription mechanisms in mast cells.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd417f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structure of the mouse HDC gene.
