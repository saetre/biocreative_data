However, temporal changes in Pax6 protein expression associated with the generation of various retinal neurons have not been characterized with regard to the cell cycle. Here, we examine the dynamic changes of Pax6 expression among chicken retinal progenitors as they progress through the neurogenic cell cycle, and determine the effects of altered Pax6 levels on retinogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We provide evidence that during the preneurogenic to neurogenic transition, Pax6 protein levels in proliferating progenitor cells are down-regulated. Neurogenic retinal progenitors retain a relatively low level of Pax6 protein, whereas postmitotic neurons either elevate or extinguish Pax6 expression in a cell type-specific manner. Cell imaging and cell cycle analyses show that neurogenic progenitors in the S phase of the cell cycle contain low levels of Pax6 protein, whereas a subset of progenitors exhibits divergent levels of Pax6 protein upon entering the G2 phase of the cell cycle. We also show that M phase cells contain varied levels of Pax6, and some correlate with the onset of early neuronal marker expression, forecasting cell cycle exit and cell fate commitment. Furthermore, either elevating or knocking down Pax6 attenuates cell proliferation and results in increased cell death. Reducing Pax6 decreases retinal ganglion cell genesis and enhances cone photoreceptor and amacrine interneuron production, whereas elevating Pax6 suppresses cone photoreceptor and amacrine cell fates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These studies demonstrate for the first time quantitative changes in Pax6 protein expression during the preneurogenic to neurogenic transition and during the neurogenic cell cycle. The results indicate that Pax6 protein levels are stringently controlled in proliferating progenitors. Maintaining a relatively low Pax6 protein level is necessary for S phase re-entry, whereas rapid accumulation or reduction of Pax6 protein during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle may be required for specific neuronal fates. These findings thus provide novel insights on the dynamic regulation of Pax6 protein among neurogenic progenitors and the temporal frame of neuronal fate determination.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The <italic>Pax6 </italic>gene encodes an evolutionarily conserved paired homeobox protein critically involved in eye development and retinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In both <italic>Drosophila </italic>and vertebrates, ectopic expression of Pax6 induces ectopic eyes or lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], indicating an instructive role of Pax6 in ocular tissue determination. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the dosages of Pax6 strongly impact the formation and growth of ocular tissues. Homozygous or heterozygous loss of function Pax6 mutants have either no eye or small eye phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Conversely, increasing dosages of the Pax6 gene also lead to microphthalmia and malformed retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, Pax6 is involved in pattern formation of the vertebrate eye. Aberrant Pax6 expression results in malformation of the anterior segment of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Pax6 expression in the optic vesicle is required for establishing the naso-temporal axis and the dorsal characteristics of the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], whereas Pax6 expressed in the distal optic cup reciprocally suppresses Pax2 in the optic stalk to establish the optic cup/stalk boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The complex roles of Pax6 in eye development are reflected by the existence of multiple enhancers that regulate the exquisite spatial and temporal expression of Pax6 transcripts in neural and non-neural ocular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Multiple Pax6 isoforms are encoded by the <italic>Pax6 </italic>gene in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The canonical Pax6 and the Pax6(5a) isoform, which contains amino acid residues encoded by an alternatively spliced exon inserted within the paired domain, are commonly found among various vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The mammalian Pax6 and Pax6(5a) isoforms, and their corresponding <italic>Drosophila </italic>homologs encoded by the <italic>eyeless </italic>and <italic>eyegone </italic>genes, exhibit distinct biological activities. Both Pax6 and eyeless can induce ectopic eye formation in the fly wing imaginal disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], whereas Pax6(5a) and eyegone can elicit only cell proliferation but not neuronal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Similarly, in embryonic mouse cortex, Pax6 influences both cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation, but Pax6(5a) only affects proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In mice missing the transcript Pax6(5a), lens abnormalities and iris hypoplasia are observed, but development of the neural retina remains largely normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], suggesting that Pax6 is able to compensate for the function of Pax6(5a) in the neural retina.</p><p>During mammalian central nervous system development, multipotent progenitors undergo a transition from the preneurogenic stage, when symmetrical divisions occur and give rise to proliferative progeny, to the neurogenic stage, during which a subset of progenitors withdraw from the cell cycle and initiate neuronal differentiation. In the cortex, reducing Pax6 expression levels affects the length of the cell cycle and the progression from symmetrical to asymmetrical division among cortical progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, decreased Pax6 expression leads to depletion of basal cortical progenitor and precocious neuronal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the spinal cord, altering Pax6 levels affects the expression of the proneural gene <italic>Ngn2 </italic>and the timing of cell cycle exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>In the vertebrate retina, multipotent progenitor cells give rise to six major types of neurons and one type of glial cell in a conserved temporal order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. At the onset of retinogenesis, the central retinal progenitors enter the neurogenic stage first, while the peripheral retina remains in a preneural state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. When Pax6 is conditionally ablated in the peripheral retina by using the Pax6 &#x003b1; cre mouse, which encodes the Pax6 P0 promoter and the &#x003b1; enhancer driving the expression of cre recombinase, progenitor expansion is affected, resulting in a retina reduced in size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In addition, in the Pax6 &#x003b1; cre-mediated Pax6 conditional knockout mutant, peripheral retinal progenitors are unable to express multiple neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional factors and are limited to producing only amacrine interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that Pax6 &#x003b1; cre-mediated Pax6 deletion in the peripheral retina unmasks a suppression of the cone-rod homeobox gene <italic>Crx </italic>by Pax6, and more centrally localized Pax6 deletion by the Chx10-cre driver also leads to the loss of progenitor multipotency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, Pax6 differentially expressed by the central or peripheral retinal progenitor pools may serve distinct functions during development, but nonetheless is required for generation of multiple retinal neurons.</p><p>In the mature retina, various neuronal cell types express disparate levels of Pax6. How this highly differential Pax6 expression is achieved among specific neurons remains unclear. In this study, we have analyzed Pax6 expression at the cellular level among neurogenic progenitors in the embryonic chicken retina. We demonstrate a significant down-regulation of Pax6 protein as progenitors undergo the preneurogenic to neurogenic transition. In addition, we show that while neurogenic progenitors maintain a uniformly low Pax6 level during the S phase, a subset of retinal progenitors rapidly increase or decrease their Pax6 levels as they enter G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The divergence of Pax6 protein levels correlate with the onset of differentiation for certain neurons. Moreover, disruption of Pax6 levels among neurogenic progenitor cells leads to aberrant proliferation and production of neuronal cell types. These results reveal for the first time the dynamic expression of Pax6 during the neurogenic cell cycle and highlight the importance of Pax6 protein regulation as neural progenitors adapt to different cell fates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Dynamic Pax6 expression during retinogenesis</title><p><italic>Pax6 </italic>mRNA expression in the chicken optic primordium initially begins at Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 8.5 and persists at high levels throughout optic vesicle formation and optic cup morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. At the onset of retinal neurogenesis at HH stage 17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], the expression of Pax6 protein in the central retina begins to decrease among progenitor cells. By HH stage 20, the central retina undergoing active neurogenesis showed significantly lower levels of Pax6 compared to the peripheral retina, and this change in the levels of Pax6 correlated with the propagation of the neurogenic wave, as demarcated by the emergence of NF145-positive neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). At the peak of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) genesis at embryonic day (E)6.5 (HH stage 30), the ventricular zone occupied by proliferative progenitor cells contained low levels of Pax6, whereas postmitotic RGCs exhibited a high level of Pax6 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The subsequently produced amacrine cells also showed high Pax6 levels at E7 (HH stage 32; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). By E12 (HH stage 38), when retinogenesis was near completion, amacrine cells, RGCs and horizontal cells displayed distinct levels of Pax6, in contrast to the absence of Pax6 from the photoreceptor cells and the bipolar cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression patterns of Pax6 in the developing chicken retina</bold>. <bold>(A-G) </bold>Expression of Pax6 protein during the preneurogenic to neurogenic transition (A-C, G) and subsequent neurogenesis (D-F).

Quantification revealed that average Pax6 signal intensity of cells residing in the peripheral halves of the retina was 1.7-fold of that found in the neurogenic central retina at HH stage 25 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Quantitative measurements of Pax6 between HH stages 30 and 32 showed that the total retinal cell population existed as three distinct populations based on their Pax6 protein levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, left panel). Similarly, cell distribution based on DNA content measurements also revealed three cell populations with distinct levels of Pax6 among G0/G1 cells with 2n DNA contents (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, right panel). Based on cell density profiles of G0/G1 cells with distinct Pax6 signal levels, we delineated the boundaries between the three cell populations and designated these populations as: high Pax6 (Pax6<sup>Hi</sup>), low Pax6 (Pax6<sup>Lo</sup>), and no Pax6 (Pax6<sup>Neg</sup>) cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The majority of Pax6<sup>Hi </sup>and Pax6<sup>Neg </sup>cells had 2n DNA content and, therefore, were either G0 or G1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The Pax6<sup>Lo </sup>cells represented the largest population of cells (46.5% of total cells) at this stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) and were distributed throughout the cell cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, right panel), indicating that Pax6<sup>Lo </sup>cells were the proliferating progenitor cells. Immunolabeling of retinal sections showed that progenitor cell marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-labeled cells were absent from the ganglion cell layer and exclusively distributed in the ventricular zone, where Pax6<sup>Lo </sup>cells resided (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In addition, flow cytometry showed that PCNA<sup>+ </sup>progenitor cells were also distributed throughout the cell cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), supporting that Pax6<sup>Lo </sup>cells were progenitor cells. In contrast, Pax6<sup>Hi </sup>cells were mostly co-labeled with cells positive for the neuronal markers NF145 or NF68 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D,D',D",H</xref>) the RGC marker Brn3a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,I</xref>), and the amacrine cell marker AP2&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F,J</xref>), whereas most Pax6<sup>Neg </sup>cells were positively labeled with the early cone photoreceptor marker Visinin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G,K</xref>) and a small subset was NF<sup>+ </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D",H</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Distinct Pax6 expression levels among progenitors and postmitotic neurons</bold>.

Confocal imaging analyses showed that immediately after a 20-minute BrdU incubation, BrdU-positive cells were exclusively located within the middle stratum of the E6.5 (HH stage 30) retina, representing progenitor cells in the S phase of the cell cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Most BrdU-labeled cells co-expressed low levels of Pax6 and none were detected in the outer one-third of the retina (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,D</xref>). Within 30 minutes after the BrdU pulse, a few BrdU-positive cells began to appear in the ventricular surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,E</xref>) and showed very low or no detectable Pax6 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).

Quantification of Pax6 levels among 4n BrdU<sup>+ </sup>cells showed a steady increase of BrdU<sup>+</sup>Pax6<sup>Hi </sup>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). At 30 minutes after the pulse chase, the BrdU<sup>+</sup>Pax6<sup>Hi </sup>cell population already showed a statistically significant increase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). After 6 hours of chase, the percentage of BrdU<sup>+</sup>Pax6<sup>Hi </sup>cells had increased from 7.0% to 20.8% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>; N = 3). Concomitantly, the Pax6<sup>Lo </sup>progenitor cells decreased from 87.6% to 72.5% during the 6 hour chase period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>; N = 3), reflecting altered Pax6 expression as progenitors progressed through the G2/M phase.

We then defined the G1 and G2/M cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, gate d) by exclusion of both neuronal marker-positive G0 phase cells and BrdU<sup>+ </sup>S phase cells from the total cell population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

The production of AP2&#x003b1;<sup>+ </sup>amacrine cells was enhanced when Pax6 was down-regulated and suppressed when Pax6 was elevated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>), suggesting that amacrine interneuron specification was also sensitive to Pax6 levels.

We provide evidence that Pax6 protein levels are highly dynamic in proliferating progenitors and are coupled with cell cycle progression. We also demonstrate that Pax6 levels critically influence cell proliferation and cell fate specification of neurogenic progenitors.</p><p>Pax6 is expressed by retinal progenitors throughout development. However, our results show that Pax6 protein levels are significantly down-regulated as retinal progenitors undergo the preneurogenic to neurogenic transition and initiate production of postmitotic neurons. During the remainder of retinogenesis, the peripheral margin progenitor cells retain a higher level of Pax6 compared to the central progenitor cells. How the down-regulation of Pax6 expression is achieved during the preneurogenic to neurogenic transition remains unknown, but it may involve signals that promote cell-intrinsic changes necessary to enable cell cycle exit and neuronal fate specification. The differing levels of Pax6 in the peripheral versus central retina are achieved, in part, at the transcriptional level through the complex arrays of Pax6 enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our data suggest that translational and/or post-translational regulation may also contribute to the rapid change of Pax6 protein levels during the cell cycle. The cellular distinctions between the central Pax6<sup>Lo </sup>and peripheral Pax6<sup>Hi </sup>progenitors are not well understood. Conditional ablations of the <italic>Pax6 </italic>gene in the peripheral retina by Pax6 &#x003b1;-cre and in the central retina by the Chx10-cre both block expression of proneural genes and limit the pluripotency of retinal progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, the peripherally expressed Pax6 also plays a role in suppressing the <italic>Crx </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], suggesting either a context-dependent or dosage-dependent mechanism. The Pax6 perturbation carried out in our study focused on the central neurogenic retina, where the expression of several proneural genes, including <italic>Ath5 </italic>and <italic>Ngn2</italic>, has begun and postmitotic neurons have accumulated. Thus, our experiments address the importance of Pax6 regulation among neurogenic progenitors.</p><p>We have established by quantitative flow cytometry analysis that the cycling neurogenic progenitor population expresses a relatively low level of Pax6, which when perturbed interferes with BrdU incorporation. Interestingly, overexpression of Pax6 resulted in a decreased number of cells undergoing DNA synthesis, but did not significantly impact the proportion of PCNA<sup>+ </sup>cells remaining in the cell cycle. Since PCNA labels proliferating cells in all phases of the cell cycle, this result suggests that high Pax6 levels potentially alter cell cycle distribution and/or lead to cell cycle arrest. Consistent with our observations, studies in the developing cortex have shown that reducing Pax6 perturbs cell cycle length and affects the preneurogenic to neurogenic transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, activation of Pax6 or Pax6(5a) above endogenous levels in the cortical progenitors disrupts cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Live imaging of a tagged Pax6 isoform has revealed that Pax6p46 is associated with the pericentromeric area of the chromosomes during M phase, and overexpression of this isoform causes abnormal mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our study shows that low levels of Pax6 are expressed by the majority of neurogenic progenitors, but progenitor cells residing within the S phase appear to maintain a more uniformly low level of Pax6 compared to G1 and G2/M phase cells. This raises the possibility that the G1 to S phase transition of neurogenic progenitors may require a narrow range of Pax6 protein. Further analyses are necessary to determine the precise cell cycle defects of retinal progenitors with aberrant levels of Pax6 expression.</p><p>Previous findings show that heterozygous Pax6 loss of function mutations lead to microphthalmia in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which is primarily due to defects in early eye morphogenesis. In transgenic mice carrying multiple copies of Pax6, the eye morphology and retinogenesis are initially normal, but RGC axons show dose-dependent projection defects accompanied by postnatal cell loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This suggests that Pax6 levels affect RGC differentiation and survival. Since Pax6 positively regulates transcription of the proneural gene <italic>Math5 </italic>required for RGC development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], high levels of Pax6 may cause inappropriate Math5 expression, leading to RGC death. Consistent with the finding that aberrant Pax6 levels cause increased apoptosis during cortical development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we have detected increased cell death due to reduced Pax6 or increased Pax6(5a) levels in the neurogenic retina. These findings indicate that stringent regulation of Pax6 levels is critical for cell survival at different stages of eye/retinal development.</p><p>We have demonstrated that various postmitotic retinal neurons exhibit distinct Pax6 levels, suggesting that Pax6 expression is readjusted when neurogenic progenitors become postmitotic, and that Pax6 may, therefore, function in cell fate determination of progenitors and/or subsequent neuronal differentiation. Our data show that perturbing Pax6 during chicken retinogenesis impacts cell fate specification. In close correlation with the contrasting levels of Pax6 in mature RGCs and cone photoreceptors, decreasing Pax6 led to reduced RGC and enhanced photoreceptor genesis. Conversely, forced expression of Pax6 suppressed photoreceptor production. However, we did not detect increased RGC production due to forced Pax6 expression as previously observed in a low density monolayer chicken retinal culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This might be due to the progenitors in our retinal explants already expressing sufficient amounts of Pax6 to facilitate RGC fate specification. Alternatively, Pax6 overexpression enhances early neuronal markers but not the more mature RGC marker Brn3a. The majority of postmitotic amacrine cells express high levels of Pax6 in the chicken retina. Our results show that both reducing and elevating Pax6 altered amacrine production, supporting a requirement for Pax6 in either specification or differentiation of amacrine interneurons. This result is consistent with phenotypes of Pax6 conditional knockout in the more centrally localized progenitors, which also lose their pluripotency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The fact that both gain and loss of Pax6 function impede amacrine cell development in the chicken retina suggests that Pax6 is likely required for amacrine cell fate specification rather than differentiation, but direct perturbation of Pax6 in postmitotic amacrine cells is necessary to distinguish these possibilities.</p><p>In this study, we present the first analysis of Pax6 protein dynamics with regard to the neurogenic cell cycle. We provide evidence that a subset of neurogenic progenitor cells begins to display divergent Pax6 protein levels upon entering into the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This cell cycle-correlated Pax6 protein level change is more readily detectable in the later neurogenic retina (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The dramatic changes of Pax6 levels among the subset of progenitors, coupled with the relatively short G2 phase, indicate that Pax6 protein in neurogenic progenitors may be subjected to rapid proteolytic degradation. In addition, the correlation between decreased Pax6 expression and the appearance of the neuronal marker Visinin in late M phase cells suggests that the subset of progenitor cells showing divergent Pax6 expression in G2/M are likely those that have committed to certain cell fates. Therefore, neuronal fate determination is likely to have occurred prior to the G2 phase of the neurogenic cell cycle, which produces at least one postmitotic neuron.</p><p>Based on our results, we propose that preneurogenic retinal progenitor cells maintain a high level of Pax6 (*Pax6<sup>Hi</sup>), which by an unknown mechanism undergoes a substantial down-regulation when cells enter the neurogenic phase. Neurogenic progenitors maintain a low level of Pax6 (Pax6<sup>Lo</sup>), which is essential for sustaining cell proliferation, survival, and neuronal fate selection. Under the influence of unidentified extrinsic and/or intrinsic cues, a subset of progenitors alters their Pax6 levels upon entry into the G2/M phase in preparation for cell cycle exit. Postmitotic neurons display distinct cell type-specific levels of Pax6, ranging from high (Pax6<sup>Hi</sup>) to no Pax6 (Pax6<sup>Neg</sup>), whereas G1 progenitor cells maintain or regain the characteristic low level of Pax6 (Pax6<sup>Lo</sup>) before the G1 to S transition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Results reported here reveal important functions of Pax6 during the neurogenic phase of retinal development and the dynamic nature of Pax6 protein regulation within the cell cycle. Future investigations probing mechanisms that regulate this cell cycle-dependent expression of Pax6 among progenitor cells will enhance our understanding of how progenitor proliferation and fate specification are coordinated.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Pax6 expression during cell cycle progression and a model of cell cycle-dependent Pax6 regulation</bold>. A model of dynamic Pax6 expression during retinogenesis is depicted. Pax6 protein levels decrease in progenitor cells during the transition from the preneurogenic (indicated with an asterisk) to the neurogenic stage. Neurogenic progenitors express low levels of Pax6 protein, which is essential for maintaining the proliferative state, especially the reentry of S phase. The cohort of S phase cells contains a relatively uniform level of low Pax6. Upon entering into the G2/M phase, the neurogenic progenitor population displays more divergent Pax6 levels, with a subset of progenitor cells showing increased or decreased Pax6 protein expression depending on the developmental stage. Because postmitotic neurons contain distinct levels of Pax6 protein, the divergence of Pax6 expression during the G2/M phase may forecast cell fate specification at or prior to the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Postmitotic neurons achieve and maintain specific and distinct levels of Pax6 during differentiation.

A low level of Pax6 protein is essential for S phase entry and normal proliferation of neurogenic progenitors. A subset of neurogenic progenitors rapidly increase or decrease Pax6 levels in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, forecasting cell fate selections prior to G2. The dynamic regulation of Pax6 protein within the cell cycle is critical for the expansion and fate specification of neurogenic progenitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chicken embryos</title><p>Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA) and were incubated at 38&#x000b0;C in a rotating humidified incubator.

For transfection of retinal tissues, DNA at 2 &#x003bc;g/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected into the subretinal space of the eye at HH stage 24/25. The injected eyes were placed between paddle electrodes and subjected to five pulses at 10 V/mm for 25 ms with 975-ms intervals using ECM 830 Square Wave Electroporation System (BTX, Holliston, MA, USA). Central retinas (posterior halves) were dissected from electroporated eyes and cultured on Nucleopore membrane discs (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) floating on a retinal culture medium containing an equal ratio of F12:DMEM (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS, USA), 2% fetal calf serum, 0.2% chicken serum, 10 mM HEPES, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 72 hours.</p><p>Transfection of 293T cells was carried out using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) and 0.65 &#x003bc;g of U6-Pax6i, U6-Redi1, U6-Redi2, or U6-GFP with 0.5 &#x003bc;g of either RCAS(B)-hPax6 DNA or CMV-HcRedN1 (RFP) as well as 0.35 &#x003bc;g of CAG-nGFP as transfection control. At 48 hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer without deoxycholate, protein extracts were resolved on a 10% BisTris SDS-PAGE gel using MOPS buffer (Invitrogen), and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane.
