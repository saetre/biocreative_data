In the present study, a linkage between TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;R was evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Most strikingly, <italic>in vitro</italic> activation of phagocytes by IgG immune complexes (IgGIC) resulted in an association of TLR4 with Fc&#x003b3;RIII (CD16) based on co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Neutrophils and macrophages from TLR4 mutant (mut) mice were unresponsive to either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IgGIC <italic>in vitro</italic>, as determined by cytokine production. This phenomenon was accompanied by the inability to phosphorylate tyrosine residues within immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of the FcR&#x003b3;-subunit. To transfer these findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, two different models of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by intratracheal administration of either LPS or IgGIC were employed. As expected, LPS-induced ALI was abolished in TLR4 mut and TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Unexpectedly, TLR4 mut and TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were also resistant to development of ALI following IgGIC deposition in the lungs. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;RIII pathways are structurally and functionally connected at the receptor level and that TLR4 is indispensable for Fc&#x003b3;RIII signaling via FcR&#x003b3;-subunit activation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The immune system is traditionally divided into innate and adaptive entities. Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) collectively recognize molecular structures of invading microorganisms, followed by initiation of immune responses. PRRs comprise the toll-like receptor (TLR) family, including TLR4, which is essential for responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As part of the adaptive immune system, Fc receptors (FcRs) on immune cells recognize antigen&#x02013;antibody complexes and link antibody-mediated immune responses to cellular effector functions. Here, we describe cross-talk between the pathogen-recognition-receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and receptors for IgG immune complexes (IgGIC), Fc&#x003b3; receptors (Fc&#x003b3;Rs). We found that TLR4 is involved in Fc&#x003b3;RIII (CD16) signaling and that heterodimerization of TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;RIII occurs in the presence of IgGIC but not LPS. Consequently, dysfunctional TLR4 signaling results in unresponsiveness of immune cells <italic>in vitro</italic> to both LPS and IgGIC, resulting in absence of acute lung injury after intratracheal administration of LPS or intrapulmonary immune complex deposition. In summary, we describe that TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;RIII pathways are structurally and functionally connected. These findings provide new insights of the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity, which closely interact with each other at the receptor level and post receptor signaling pathways.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The immune system is traditionally divided into innate and adaptive entities. Adaptive immunity is organized around T cells and B cells and requires a process of maturation and clonal selection of lymphocytes. In contrast, innate immunity can be immediately activated during the onset of infection in order to control replication of pathogenic microbes and bring about their clearance from tissues or blood. As an important aspect of innate immunity, pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) collectively recognize lipid, carbohydrate, peptide, and nucleic-acid structures of invading microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Trinchieri1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. PRRs comprise the toll-like receptor family (TLR), which consists of at least 12 different evolutionarily conserved membrane proteins that trigger innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Akira1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Initially identified in 1997, TLR4 represents the most thoroughly investigated TLR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Medzhitov1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. TLR4 is essential for responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a well-known pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Medzhitov1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Poltorak1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Besides LPS, various endogenous ligands, such as hyaluronan and high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), appear to engage TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Jiang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Yu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. After binding of LPS to the TLR4/MD-2/CD14 receptor complex, activation of the intracellular signaling pathway is initiated, ultimately leading to NF-&#x003ba;B activation and its translocation to the nucleus, resulting in subsequent cytokine/chemokine production and release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-May1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As part of the adaptive immune system, antibodies of high affinity binding specifically recognize and neutralize intruding pathogens or their products. After antibody binding to antigen, the Fc domain of immunoglobulin (Ig) is recognized by Fc receptors (FcRs) which are predominantly expressed on immune and inflammatory cells and thereby link antibody-mediated (humoral) immune responses to cellular effector functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Gessner1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Selvaraj1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Specific FcRs exist for all classes of immunoglobulins. Binding of IgGs to Fc&#x003b3;Rs on phagocytes triggers a wide variety of cellular functions including phagocytosis, release of inflammatory mediators, and clearance of immune complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Gessner1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Fc&#x003b3;Rs specifically bind IgG and are divided into four subclasses. Fc&#x003b3;RI (CD64), Fc&#x003b3;RIII (CD16), and Fc&#x003b3;RIV are activating receptors, while Fc&#x003b3;RII (CD32) mediates inhibitory functions. The cellular response is determined by the balance between activating (ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and inhibitory (ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Ravetch1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Miettinen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Amigorena1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Nimmerjahn1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Despite extensive research in the past, the highly complex regulation of innate and adaptive immunity and their interactions are still poorly understood.

Recently, evidence has emerged that there is indirect interaction between TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;R pathways.

Therefore, the LPS concentration was determined in reagents used for lung injury induction by deposition of IgG immune complexes (IgGIC), such as DPBS, anti-BSA IgG and BSA, although none of these reagents had been prepared using bacterial (<italic>E.coli</italic>) systems. Using Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Kinetic-QCL assay, LPS levels were not detectable (&#x0003c;5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> units/ml) in any of the reagents (data not shown), suggesting that <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation by IgGIC is based upon a genuine agonist effect that is not due to LPS contamination. In addition to determination of LPS contamination (see above), DPBS, anti-BSA IgG and BSA were subjected to endotoxin removal by solid-phase polymyxin. Using the polymyxin-treated reagents, immune complexes were generated and then applied in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments or the reagents were administered in mice for the formation of immune complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, commercially available, preformed peroxidase/anti-peroxidase immune complexes (PAP IgGIC) were used at the same concentration in order to confirm the results using BSA IgGIC or polymyxin-treated BSA IgGIC. The results of both, polymyxin-treated BSA IgGIC and PAP IgGIC, are presented in the corresponding figures. In summary, using different <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches, it is highly unlikely that any of the effects following IgGIC stimulation in the present study are based on LPS contamination of the reagents.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Association between TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;RIII after IgG Immune Complex Activation</title><p>In order to assess whether crosstalk between TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;R might occur at the receptor level, neutrophils (PMNs) and macrophages from wild-type (Wt) mice were incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> with IgGIC, LPS, or the combination of the two. After incubation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-TLR4 and then analyzed for Fc&#x003b3;RII/III by immunoblotting (IB). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>, immunoprecipitated TLR4 was associated with Fc&#x003b3;R after cell exposure to IgGIC. Inversely, LPS incubation did not result in an association of both receptors as indicated by the absence of bands for Fc&#x003b3;R, whereas the combination of LPS&#x0002b;IgGIC seemed to enhance the signal for Fc&#x003b3;R co-immunoprecipitated by anti-TLR4 IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The band for Fc&#x003b3;R under the conditions described above indicated a protein mass of 55 kDa, in accord with the reported molecular weight for Fc&#x003b3;RIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Santiago1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Huizinga1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, there was no band at the 40 kDa position (data not shown), the molecular weight of Fc&#x003b3;RII, which is also recognized by the anti-Fc&#x003b3;R antibody (mAb, clone 2.4G2) used for Western blot analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Warmerdam1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Gruel1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, under these conditions bands also occurred after stimulation of phagocytes with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g001">Figure 1C,D</xref>), which may suggest that Fc&#x003b3;RIII and TLR4 heterodimerize upon LPS stimulation, although to a lesser extent as compared to IgGIC treated cells. When PMNs and macrophages from Fc&#x003b3;RIII<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were exposed to the same <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions (IgGIC, LPS, LPS&#x0002b;IgGIC), the band for Fc&#x003b3;RIII failed to appear, confirming its specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g001">Figure 1E,F</xref>). In order to examine whether the interaction between TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;RIII was specific for these two receptors or whether there also might be multimerization with other TLRs or Fc receptors, lysates from Wt phagocytic cells under various conditions (see above) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-TLR6 or anti-CD23 (anti-Fc&#x003b5;RII), followed by Western blots for Fc&#x003b3;RIII or TLR4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g001">Figure 1G&#x02013;J</xref>).

In addition, reagents that were used for the formation of IgGIC were administered separately <italic>in vivo</italic> at the same concentration as they were used in combination for intrapulmonary IgGIC deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g005">Figure 5F</xref>).

Similarly, intratracheal injection of anti-BSA and subsequent intravenous DPBS injection (containing a trace amount of I<sup>125</sup>-labelled BSA) did not result in increased lung permeability. In striking contrast, the combination of anti-BSA (i.t.) and by BSA (i.v.) injection lead to the development of acute lung injury, as also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g005">Figure 5B and 5E</xref>.

These findings suggest that the IgGIC-induced lung injury using anti-BSA and BSA is strictly dependent on the Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated signalling, and not on LPS-induced activation of TLR4.

In the present study, TLR4 mut and TLR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse strains unexpectedly also showed greatly attenuated susceptibility to IgGIC-induced lung injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g005">Figure 5</xref>). For this model, it is known that, besides complement activation, Fc&#x003b3;Rs are critical for initiation and development of IgGIC alveolitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Baumann1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Chouchakova1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, particularly through engagement and activation of ITAM-containing Fc&#x003b3;Rs (Fc&#x003b3;RI and Fc&#x003b3;RIII) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Baumann1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

In our study, TLR4 mut mice not only were resistant to lung injury, but also failed to locally release cytokines <italic>in vivo</italic> after intrapulmonary IgGIC deposition, as indicated by baseline levels of IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; in BAL fluids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In companion experiments, <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure of TLR4 mut phagocytes to IgGIC resulted in complete suppression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6) in comparison to phagocytes from Wt mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, TLR4 mut cells showed impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR&#x003b3;-subunit when exposed to IgGIC, in striking contrast to Wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The fact that TLR4 mut PMNs and macrophages responded with cytokine release when incubated with opsonized zymosan particles or with Pam3Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g003">Figure 3</xref>) indicates that 1.) the mutation in the TLR4 gene does not lead to a global impairment of the cellular inflammatory/immune response and 2.) the intracellular signaling pathways are intact since other TLRs (such as TLR2 and TLR6), which share common pathways, could be activated <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the other hand, phagocytes from Fc&#x003b3;RIII-deficient mice are fully responsive to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000464-g003">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that TLR4 signaling does not depend on the functional integrity of Fc&#x003b3;RIII, whereas TLR4 is required for Fc&#x003b3;RIII signaling.</p><p>Especially in the field of immunology, there is an increasing number of reports describing effects of receptor interactions. Examples include a previous study suggesting cross-talk between IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha receptors with signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Takaoka1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. In brief, signalling by IFN-gamma was shown to depend on the IFN-alpha/beta receptor components. A more recent publication describes that signalling triggered by NKG2D and DAP10 is coupled to the interleukin 15 receptor signalling pathway, suggesting that coupling of activating receptors to other receptor systems may regulate cell type-specific signaling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Horng1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of innate immunity, it has been proposed several times that there is a link between TLR4 and the complement system, especially to the C5a signalling pathway, which can negatively regulate TLR4-induced responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Hawlisch1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Rittirsch1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Under physiological conditions, receptor interactions and cross-talk between signalling pathways might represent important regulatory mechanisms of the immune system to provide distinct but fine-tuned responses. In the case of TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;RIII, cross-talk may provide an optimal and rapid response against invading microorganisms by mediating an interplay between adaptive and innate immunity. However, in certain conditions, such as systemic inflammation (sepsis) or autoimmune diseases that are characterized by a loss of inhibitory action or uncontrolled activation of signalling pathways, a loss of control over otherwise carefully orchestrated receptor interactions can become instruments of harm.</p><p>Taken together, the present findings strongly suggest that (<italic>i</italic>) there is a direct link between TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;R pathways, (<italic>ii</italic>) phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the ITAM-containing FcR&#x003b3;-subunit requires the presence and integrity of TLR4 during cellular activation after binding of IgGICs to Fc&#x003b3;Rs, and (<italic>iii</italic>) presence of IgGICs results in an association between TLR4 and Fc&#x003b3;RIII (CD16) on phagocytic cells. These data imply that innate and adaptive immunity are closely connected at the receptor level and post receptor signaling pathways, which might have ramifications for a variety of inflammatory conditions, such as IgGIC-mediated autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis or glomerulonephritis), ischemia/perfusion injury, trauma or systemic inflammation (sepsis), etc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male (22&#x02013;25 g) specific pathogen-free C3H/OuJ (Wt) and C3H/HeJ (TLR4 mut) mice with a missense mutation in the TLR4-gene were used in these studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000464-Poltorak1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.
