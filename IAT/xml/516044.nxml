The syndrome is caused by mutations of the <italic>PDS </italic>gene SLC26A4, which codes for the protein pendrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Deafness is congenital and generally profound although sometimes late in onset and provoked by light head injury. Vestibular dysfunction is uncommon. Goiter is variable and generally develops around puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The cause of goiter appears to be an impairment of iodide fixation in the follicular lumen due to a reduced rate of iodide transport across the apical membrane of thyroid gland epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A positive perchlorate discharge test and an enlarged vestibular aqueduct appear to be the most reliable clinical signs of Pendred syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Pendrin is an anion exchanger that can transport Cl<sup>-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup>, HCO<sub>3 </sub><sup>- </sup>and formate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Expression has been found in the inner ear and thyroid gland consistent with the clinical signs of deafness and goiter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, pendrin expression has been found in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. No expression was found in fetal or adult brain, consistent with a peripheral cause of deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Expression of pendrin mRNA in the inner ear has been found in several places including the cochlea, the vestibular labyrinth and the endolymphatic sac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The precise location of pendrin protein expression, however, has not yet been determined. The variability of deafness in Pendred syndrome and the observation that deafness is sometimes late in onset suggest that pendrin dysfunction may not be the direct cause of deafness. It is conceivable that pendrin dysfunction favors changes in the expression levels of proteins that are critical for the maintenance of the hearing function. Detailed studies aimed at identifying the direct cause of deafness in Pendred syndrome have recently become possible due to the generation of a pendrin-specific polyclonal antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the development of <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, which bear a targeted disruption of the mouse <italic>Slc26a4 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

The mouse strain 129Sv/Ev (Taconic, Germantown, NY) was chosen as the source of <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>controls, since <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice were propagated in the this strain and generated using a stem cell line derived from 129Sv/Ev. <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>were agouti.

Temporal bones were removed and cochleae fixed by perilymphatic perfusion, decalcified in EDTA, processed through a sucrose gradient and infiltrated with polyethylene glycol. Mid-modiolar cryosections (12 &#x003bc;m, CM3050S, Leica, Nussloch, Germany) were blocked in PBS with 0.2% Triton-X (PBS-TX) and 10% bovine serum albumin. Slides were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with primary antibodies in PBS-TX with 1&#x02013;3% BSA [rabbit anti-pendrin, 1:500 (h766&#x02013;780); rat anti-ZO-1, 1:100 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA); goat anti-KCNQ1, 1:200 (C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-KCNE1, 1:200 (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel); rabbit anti-KCNJ10, 1:300 (Alomone); rabbit anti-SLC12A2, 1:100 (Chemicon); and rabbit anti-connexin 26, 1:100 (Zymed, San Francisco, CA)]. Slides were washed in PBS-TX and incubated for 1 h at 25&#x000b0;C with appropriate secondary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS-TX with 1&#x02013;3% BSA [donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488, chicken anti-rat Alexa 594, and chicken anti-goat Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)]. Actin filaments were visualized by staining with Alexa 488 conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). After incubation, slides were washed with PBS-TX, mounted with FluorSave (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), and viewed by confocal microscopy (LSM 5 Pascal or LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss, Jena or G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany). Laser scanning brightfield images were collected to document structural preservation, for morphometric analysis and for analysis of pigmentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg i.p.). Kidneys and brain were removed and pulverized in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Temporal bones were removed and two preparations of inner ear tissues were obtained by microdissection: (1) stria vascularis without spiral ligament, and (2) spiral ganglia including the surrounding bone and the organ of Corti. The dissection medium was changed twice during the microdissection and isolated tissues were washed three times to minimize cross-contamination. The <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>-/-</sup>genotype was verified by the observation of large otoconia in the utricular macula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Total RNA was isolated and residual DNA contamination was removed by enzymatic digestion (RNeasy micro, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Quality and quantity of 18S rRNA obtained from kidneys and brain were determined (Nano Assay, 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Further, the quality of RNA preparations obtained from stria vascularis and spiral ganglia was assessed (Pico Assay, 2100 Bioanalyzer). Real time RT-PCR was performed on RNA obtained from individual animals (OneStep RT-PCR, Qiagen; Smart Cycler, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) in the presence of 0.2&#x000d7; SYBR green I (Molecular Probes). Transcripts of 18S rRNA and mRNA for the K<sup>+ </sup>channels KCNJ10, KCNQ1 and KCNQ4 were amplified using gene-specific primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). RT was performed for 30 min at 50&#x000b0;C and 15 min at 95&#x000b0;C. PCR consisted of 50 cycles of 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C, 1 min at 72&#x000b0;C, 7s heating to hot-measurement temperature, 13s hot-measurement at 3&#x02013;5&#x000b0;C below product melting temperature (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and 1 min at 94&#x000b0;C. Hot-measurements were performed to eliminate the detection of primer-dimers that had melting temperatures between 72 and 75&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. PCR was followed by a melt (60 to 95&#x000b0;C). The generation of a single product of appropriate size was routinely checked by the presence of a single melt peak and by agarose gel-electrophoresis. Product identity was confirmed by sequencing.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Template</td><td align="left">Primers</td><td align="left">Product Length</td><td align="left">Melting Temperature</td><td align="left">Hot Measurement</td><td align="left">Fidelity</td><td align="left">n</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">18S</td><td align="left">gag gtt cga aga cga tca ga (<italic>sense</italic>)</td><td align="left">316 bp</td><td align="left">83.2 &#x000b1; 02&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">78&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">1.89 &#x000b1; 0.02</td><td align="left">17</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">tcg ctc cac caa cta aga ac (antisense)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">KCNJ10</td><td align="left">tgg tgt ggt gtg gta tct gg (<italic>sense</italic>)</td><td align="left">411 bp</td><td align="left">83.2 &#x000b1; 02&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">78&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">1.86 &#x000b1; 0.02</td><td align="left">15</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">tga agc agt ttg cct gtc ac (<italic>antisense</italic>)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">KCNQ1</td><td align="left">ttt gtt cat ccc cat ctc ag (<italic>sense</italic>)</td><td align="left">239 bp</td><td align="left">82.5 &#x000b1; 02&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">79&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">1.85 &#x000b1; 0.02</td><td align="left">17</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">gtt gct ggg tag gaa gag (<italic>antisense</italic>)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">KCNQ4</td><td align="left">ccc gga aac cct tct gtg tc (<italic>sense</italic>)</td><td align="left">245 bp</td><td align="left">83.2 &#x000b1; 02&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">80&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">1.87 &#x000b1; 0.01</td><td align="left">17</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">aaa gat gag cac cag gaa cc (<italic>antisense</italic>)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Template molecules (T) were quantified according to T = P / (F ^C<sub>t</sub>) where P is the number of product molecules, F is the fidelity of the reaction and C<sub>t </sub>is the cycle at which the number of product molecules reaches a chosen threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

Staining was absent when the primary antibody was pre-absorbed with the antigenic peptide (<italic>data not shown</italic>).

The presence of pendrin in spindle-shaped cells suggests that these cells secrete HCO<sub>3 </sub><sup>- </sup>into endolymph. Pendrin-mediated HCO<sub>3 </sub><sup>- </sup>transport has previously been shown in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

Dual labeling with KCNQ1 demonstrated that pendrin expression was clearly limited to vestibular transitional cells and did not extend to other non-sensory cells such as vestibular dark cells, which were clearly identified by the expression of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 in their apical membranes.</p><p>The onset of pendrin expression during development of the mouse inner ear has been determined to be embryonic day (ED) 13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Morphologically detectable differences in the inner ears of <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice become evident as early as ED 15, when <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice start to develop an enlarged endolymphatic space that persists into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, sensory hair cells in the cochlea appear normal until postnatal day (PD) 7 but show clear evidence of degeneration by PD 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These observations suggest that the cochlear environment supports the survival of sensory hair cells in spite of the enlargement of the endolymphatic duct. A normal endolymphatic K<sup>+ </sup>concentration, which is critical for hair cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], is established at PD 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and may persist in <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>at least until PD 7. The time period between PD 7 and 15 is the time when the endocochlear potential develops at the onset of hearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We hypothesized that a lack of a normal endocochlear potential or an alteration of the endolymphatic K<sup>+ </sup>concentration could account for deafness in <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice.

These observations suggest that a primary event leading to deafness in <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, and potentially in patients suffering from Pendred syndrome, is the loss of the endocochlear potential.

We found that <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice lack the endocochlear potential because they do not express KCNJ10 protein. Intermediate cells protect stria vascularis by converting CO<sub>2 </sub>to HCO<sub>3 </sub><sup>- </sup>and by detoxifying free radicals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). CO<sub>2 </sub>and free radicals are generated by the large numbers of mitochondria in the metabolically highly active strial marginal cells. Intermediate cells employ carbonic anhydrase to convert CO<sub>2 </sub>to HCO<sub>3 </sub><sup>- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and catalase to detoxify free radicals. To protect themselves from free radical damage, intermediate cells generate glutathione and melanin pigment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is conceivable that loss of pendrin, which may secrete HCO<sub>3 </sub><sup>- </sup>into endolymph, results in an accumulation of HCO<sub>3 </sub><sup>- </sup>and an alkalinization of the intrastrial spaces. This extracellular alkalinization may enhance free radical stress, since it may inhibit the uptake of cysteine and thereby limit production of the protective glutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Support for the hypothesis of enhanced free radical stress comes from the observed hyperpigmentation in mice lacking pendrin. Strial hyperpigmentation has also been observed in other conditions that are associated with free radical stress, such as acoustic trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Alterations in the cytosolic pH in conjunction with free radical stress may lead to the loss of KCNJ10 protein expression in strial intermediate cells. Function and expression of other K<sup>+ </sup>channels has been shown to be controlled by the cytosolic pH and free radicals, which encode the metabolic state of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].
