Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammatory destruction of the biliary tree, is often complicated by the development of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Here, we aimed to investigate the influence of genetic variations in the <italic>hMYH</italic> and <italic>NEIL1</italic> genes on risk of CCA in PSC patients. The <italic>hMYH</italic> and <italic>NEIL1</italic> gene loci in addition to the DNA repair genes <italic>hOGG1, NTHL1</italic> and <italic>NUDT1</italic> were analyzed in 66 PSC patients (37 with CCA and 29 without cancer) by complete genomic sequencing of exons and adjacent intronic regions. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations were identified and severe impairment of protein function was observed for three non-synonymous variants. The NEIL1 G83D mutant was dysfunctional for the major oxidation products 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8oxoG), thymine glycol and dihydrothymine in duplex DNA, and the ability to perform &#x003b4;-elimination at abasic sites was significantly reduced. The hMYH R260Q mutant had severe defect in adenine DNA glycosylase activity, whereas hMYH H434D could excise adenines from A:8oxoG pairs but not from A:G mispairs. We found no overall associations between the 18 identified variants and susceptibility to CCA in PSC patients; however, the impaired variants may be of significance for carcinogenesis in general. Our findings demonstrate the importance of complete resequencing of selected candidate genes in order to identify rare genetic variants and their possible contribution to individual susceptibility to cancer development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oxidative DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species is a major source of mutation load in living organisms and is believed to play a causative role in aging and degenerative diseases such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Reactive oxygen species are formed as by-products of the electron transport machinery, during conditions of chronic inflammation and by exogenous stimuli such as ionizing radiation and various chemical oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">3</xref>). 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) is one of the most stable products of oxidative DNA damage and has deleterious effects because it can mispair with adenine during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Many tumors have been shown to have G:C to T:A transversion mutations associated with 8oxoG and also to have increased levels of 8oxoG in the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>To counteract the potential harmful effects of oxidative DNA damage, cells primarily use the base excision repair (BER) pathway. BER is initiated by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases that identify and excise the damaged base, leaving an abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) site in the DNA that is further processed by the other enzymes of the BER pathway (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Mammalian cells are equipped with several different DNA glycosylases and 8oxoG DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) is the major enzyme for removal of 8oxoG from an 8oxoG:C pair but not when 8oxoG is already mispaired with adenine. In this case, A is removed by adenine DNA glycosylase (hMutY/hMYH) (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Finally, the NUDT1 (MutT in bacteria) enzyme hydrolyzes 8oxoG triphosphate to 8oxoG monophosphate, thus avoiding the incorporation of oxidized nucleotides into genomic DNA. The DNA glycosylases endonuclease III (NTHL1) and endonuclease VIII-like 1 (NEIL1) are the principal enzymes for removal of oxidized pyrimidines such as thymine glycol (Tg), 5-hydroxy cytosine (5ohC) and 5-hydroxy uracil (5ohU) (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies suggest that polymorphisms in DNA glycosylase genes are associated with several cancers. For example, polymorphisms in <italic>NEIL1</italic> have been linked to gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), whereas those in <italic>hOGG1</italic> have been related to higher risk for prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) and lung cancer (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). For the <italic>hMYH</italic> gene, inactivating mutations and polymorphisms are associated with development of colorectal polyposis (MutY associated-polyposis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Also, approaches based on functional analyses have shown that reduced 8oxoG DNA glycosylase activity is a risk factor in lung, head and neck cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts leading to bile duct strictures and eventually liver cirrhosis and liver transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Importantly, PSC is a considerable risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) that results from a malignant transformation of bile duct epithelial cells. The prevalence of CCA in PSC ranges from 6&#x02013;13% in most reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). The duration and severity of PSC does not seem to correlate with development of CCA, suggesting that individual susceptibility factors are important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). As recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), genetic variants may influence risk of CCA in PSC. Further, an emerging concept in association studies is that rare sequence variants with strong phenotypic effects might contribute substantially to the aggregated risk of complex traits, including cancer. The exact mechanism for CCA development in PSC is unknown. In experimental models, bile has been shown to induce oxidative stress and to increase oxidative DNA damage in cholangiocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Consequently, individual differences in processing of DNA damage could be of importance for transformation of the inflammatory changes of the biliary tree into cancer. In this study, we have evaluated the role of germ line variation in genes important for repair of oxidative DNA damage and their potential role for development of CCA in PSC patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and controls</title><p>The study included 66 Scandinavian PSC patients recruited on admission to the Medical Department, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;48) and Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18).

For <italic>NUDT1</italic>, two frequent SNPs (V83M and D119) were found but no new mutations and, interestingly, no sequence variation at all was identified in the <italic>NTHL1</italic> gene. All novel non-synonymous mutations (except one non-synonymous but conservative mutation) identified in the PSC or PSC-CCA patients were subjected to functional analysis.</p><sec><title>Analysis of hMYH</title><p>Of the four non-synonymous <italic>hMYH</italic> mutations identified, one was in the healthy control group (E155Q) and three in the PSC group (R260Q, H434D and S501F) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Further, His434 resides within a loop involved in 8oxoG recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and interacts with the phosphate backbone of the DNA strand containing 8oxoG. Finally, Ser501 is in a region predicted to be disordered that is also outside of the structural model of <italic>B.stearothermophilus</italic> MutY.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram and 3D structures of hMYH, hOGG1 and NEIL1.

Despite high expression levels, most hMYH was insoluble (data not shown) and we were able to obtain only partially purified hMYH proteins after nickel&#x02013;agarose purification (supplementary Figure 1 is available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online). Using oligonucleotide substrates with the A:8oxoG at a defined position, hMYH DNA glycosylase activity can be monitored by running denaturating polyacrylamide gels, where the cleaved product (C) after NaOH treatment will migrate faster than the intact substrate (I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). DNA glycosylase activity assays revealed that the mutant enzymes hMYH H434D and hMYH S501F removed adenines from duplex oligonucleotides containing A:8oxoG base pairs at rates comparable with wild-type (WT) hMYH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Contrary, for a substrate containing an A:G mispair, hMYH H434D activity was severely reduced (4% cleavage as compared with 36% for WT hMYH with 18 ng enzyme), whereas the S501F mutant showed the same A:G DNA glycosylase activity as intact hMYH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The mutant form hMYH R260Q displayed reduced ability to excise adenines from an A:8oxoG duplex, cleaving only 15% of the substrate as compared with complete removal by WT hMYH with 18 ng enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By increasing the amount of hMYH R260Q up to 240 ng, 40% cleavage of the A:8oxoG duplex was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For A:G-containing substrates, R260Q was almost inactive (1% compared with 36% cleavage by WT hMYH with 18 ng enzyme) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Despite its reduced DNA glycosylase activity, EMSAs revealed that R260Q has retained the ability to bind A:8xoG-containing duplexes and for the A:G substrate R260Q binds even stronger than the WT hMYH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It appears that the hMYH R260Q substitution results in loss of the ability to discriminate between A:8oxoG and A:G when binding to DNA. The mutant hMYH S501F binds the two substrates with similar affinities as the WT enzyme, whereas no shift was observed with the H434D mutant neither for A:8oxoG nor for A:G substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). With higher protein concentration, H434D could bind weakly to the A:G substrate but not to A:8oxoG (data not shown). Under conditions for EMSA, no cleavage of the DNA substrates was observed as assayed by running a small sample of the reaction mixture on a denaturing/urea gel (data not shown). In summary, two of the <italic>hMYH</italic> mutations identified (R260Q and H434D) lead to proteins with defect DNA glycosylase activity.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Analysis of hMYH variants.

As two of the mutations found in the PSC group are silent mutations and one is conservative (T398S), we proceeded with functional studies of the hOGG1 S31P mutation only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). hOGG1 S31P was expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, purified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgp118/DC1">supplementary Figure 1</ext-link> is available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online) and subjected to 8oxoG DNA glycosylase analysis. hOGG1 S31P showed the same capacity as WT hOGG1 to remove 8oxoG from an 8oxoG:C DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). EMSA reveals that WT and S31P bind with the same affinity to an 8oxoG:C DNA oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

E181K and the SNP G83D were subjected for functional studies. Based on a comparison with the <italic>E.coli</italic> endonuclease VIII structure in complex with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), glycine 83 is found in a loop that forms part of the groove of NEIL1 in which the DNA is expected to bind, whereas glutamate 181 is a conserved residue within the helix-2-turn-helix motif that interacts with the lesion-containing strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The NEIL1 E181K protein was produced in <italic>E.coli</italic>, but the protein formed inclusion bodies and we were not able to obtain a pure preparation. NEIL1 G83D was purified to apparent homogeneity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgp118/DC1">supplementary Figure 1</ext-link> is available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online), tested for co-purifying contaminating activities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgp118/DC1">supplementary Figure 2</ext-link> is available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online) and assayed toward several oxidative DNA lesions known to be removed by NEIL1. Because NEIL1 has been shown to process &#x003b2;,&#x003b4;-elimination activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), its activity assay does not need NaOH treatment to detect strand breaks as for hMYH and hOGG1. In contrast to the WT enzyme, NEIL1 G83D showed no activity on 8oxoG:C duplex DNA and had strongly impaired cleavage activity on DHT duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The residual mutant activity on DHT:A was &#x0003c;10% of WT activity. WT NEIL1 is shown previously not to possess 8oxoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>) or DHT DNA glycosylase activity on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA; our unpublished observation). As expected, the G83D mutant protein showed no activity on ssDNA containing a single 8oxoG or DHT (data not shown). Another oxidative pyrimidine lesion cleaved by NEIL1 is Tg. WT Neil1 has higher activity for Tg in double-stranded DNA than in single stranded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The mutant G83D had weak activity for Tg in double-stranded DNA and almost no cleavage was observed for the single-stranded Tg substrate. Moreover, removal of formamidopyrimidine by G83D NEIL1 was strongly impaired as compared with the WT enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These data demonstrate an important role of Gly83 in substrate recognition.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Analysis of NEIL1 variants.

In contrast to the data above, NEIL1 G83D cleaved 5ohC:G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and 5ohU:G (data not shown) duplex DNA at the same efficiency as the WT enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Also for 5ohC and 5ohU on ssDNA, G83D showed almost the same cleavage activity as the WT enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, NEIL1 G83D showed significantly reduced &#x003b4;-elimination activity (50%) as compared with the WT enzyme for both single-stranded substrates. With high concentration of G83D and 5ohC and 5ohU ssDNA substrates, there appears to be some 5&#x02032;-phosphtase or ssDNA nuclease contamination in the reactions. As this is not observed for the Tg single-stranded substrate, the possible contaminating activity might be sequence dependent. To further characterize NEIL1 G83D, EMSAs were performed. The results reveal that G83D binds to 5ohC:G DNA substrate with slightly reduced affinity as compared with WT NEIL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In the lane with the highest concentration of WT NEIL1 (100 ng), there is a 25% reduction in total signal intensity that might be ascribed to copurifying contaminating 5&#x02032;-phosphatase/exonuclease activity.</p><p>To further investigate the role of the G83D mutation on the &#x003b2;,&#x003b4;-reaction, we examined cleavage of a duplex oligonucleotide containing a single abasic site. Surprisingly, we find that the mutant enzyme incise the abasic site more efficiently (two times) than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, only 50% of the cleaved abasic site has been fully processed to the &#x003b4;-elimination end product by NEIL1 G83D, whereas 50% of the cleaved product remains as the &#x003b2;-elimination intermediate. With WT NEIL1 almost 100% of the cleavage product has been fully processed to the &#x003b4;-elimination product. It thus appears that the NEIL1 G83D mutation modulates the catalytic capacity of NEIL1 as well as substrate specificity.</p><p>Intracellular localization studies have revealed that NEIL1 is located to the nucleus of human cells with an accumulation in the nucleoli and a putative nuclear localization signal is found in the C-terminus of NEIL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Constructs of NEIL1 G83D and E181K fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein were generated and used for transfection of HeLa S3 cells. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the distribution of the NEIL1 mutants was confined to the nucleus as seen for WT NEIL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Although we were not able to purify recombinant NEIL1 E181K expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, the corresponding fusion protein localized as WT NEIL1 in HeLa cells indicating that the mutant is folded and distributed correctly in mammalian cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PSC is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bile ducts in which the patients have a high risk for developing CCA. In order to better understand individual susceptibility to CCA, we evaluated the role of SNPs and germ line mutations in genes involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Eighteen genetic variants were identified, six were validated SNPs, whereas 12 were new mutations. Three rare variants identified in PSC and PSC-CCA patients were found to critically affect protein function (hMYH R260Q, hMYH H434D and NEIL1 G83D).</p><p>Importantly, there is increasing awareness of the contribution from rare variants to the genetic susceptibility of complex traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). The detection of such variants is inert to the association study design and requires resequencing of entire study populations with subsequent assessment of functional consequences of identified variants (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Noteworthy, the three variants with severe consequence for the BER pathway were found among patients with PSC with or without CCA. The lack of overall association between any of the investigated variants and PSC or CCA susceptibility may clearly result from lack of statistical power. For instance, it is well established that the oxidative DNA lesion 8-oxoguanine is mutagenic and that hOGG1 represents the major 8oxoG removing activity in human cells. hOGG1 S326C is the most studied SNP in <italic>hOGG1</italic> and is weakly associated with some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and has reduced 8oxoG DNA glycosylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Power calculations based on previous studies of this SNP [odds ratio of GG versus CC genotypes &#x0003e;2.0; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>)] emphasized limitations of the genetic association study design (0.11 for PSC-CCA versus PSC without CCA, 0.14 for PSC-CCA versus healthy controls; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://medipe.psu.ac.th/episoft/pssamplesize">http://medipe.psu.ac.th/episoft/pssamplesize</ext-link>) to conclusively clarify whether this mutation may play a role in cholangiocarcinogenesis in PSC. Although comparable frequencies of S326C were observed in all three study populations, the possibility thus needs to be kept open that weak effects on CCA susceptibility from this variant may exist.</p><p>Two common <italic>hMYH</italic> mutations associated with colorectal adenoma polyposis are Y165C and G382D, which account for &#x0223c;73% of all <italic>hMYH</italic> mutations reported to date (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Neither of these two mutations was found in our study. To date &#x0003e;80 different <italic>hMYH</italic> mutations have been described in MutY associated-polyposis patients (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Approximately 15% of these mutations have been subjected to functional studies and several of the mutants show reduced or no DNA glycosylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). The catalytically impaired hMYH variant R260Q was found in one patient carrying this mutation on one allele. The importance of the mutation for this patient is uncertain, as <italic>hMYH</italic> mutations associated with colon cancer are autosomal recessive. However, R260Q still binds DNA and may prevent access for WT hMYH to A:8oxoG pairs. The same mutation was also identified in a large multisite, population-based colorectal cancer case&#x02013;control study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">43</xref>) and was further analyzed by Ali <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Similarly as in this work, reduced A:8oxoG activity was found for R260Q. Our data show that R260Q has normal A:8oxoG binding, however, Ali <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the mutant has reduced A:8oxoG DNA-binding property. We do not know the reason for the discrepancy but different assay conditions could contribute. The catalytic impairment of hMYH R260Q was unexpected from a structural point of view as R260 is located on the surface of MutY pointing away from the active site pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). From the structure, this residue is predicted to have no role in catalysis or in DNA binding as the distance from R260 to the adenine-binding pocket is &#x0003e;16 &#x000c5;. Future screening for <italic>hMYH</italic> associated mutations in cancer should also include R260Q.</p><p>The C-terminal domain of MutY is required for 8oxoG recognition and deletion of this domain results in a protein with reduced binding affinity and DNA glycosylase activity for A:8oxoG but not for A:G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). The H434 residue is a conserved residue within the C-terminal domain and is part of a loop that intercalates the DNA and makes contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone 5&#x02032; to the oxidized guanine. The presence of aspartate in this position will result in a negative charge and repulsion of the DNA, as demonstrated by the lack of shift in the EMSAs for hMYH H434D. Interestingly, the H434D mutant has the same DNA glycosylase activity for A:8oxoG as WT hMYH; however, the ability to excise adenine from A:G mispairs is significantly reduced, supporting a previous observation that the C-terminal domain is not only involved in 8oxoG recognition but also affects binding and catalytic activities toward A:G mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>).</p><p>The NEIL1 G83D mutant has been shown previously to lack DNA glycosylase activity toward Tg and faPy lesion but has &#x003b2;-elimination activity on AP DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Presumably, the gain of the acidic aspartate alters the surface of the active site of NEIL1 that is dominated by basic amino acid side chains in the WT enzyme. Here, we show that the DNA glycosylase activity for G83D is lost only for 8oxoG, DHT and Tg, substrates that all need to be in a context of double-stranded DNA for NEIL1 to cleave. For lesions known to be substrates for NEIL1 also when present in ssDNA (5ohC, 5ohU), G83D is as active as WT NEIL1. In addition to compromised DNA glycosylase activity for G83D for some substrates, the &#x003b4;-elimination reaction is also affected. After incubation with G83D, about half of the substrate was cleaved by &#x003b2;,&#x003b4;-elimination and the other half by &#x003b2;-elimination only. This was most evident for the single-stranded substrates (5ohC, 5ohU) and for the AP DNA. It thus appears that introduction of an aspartic residue at this position directly or indirectly affects residues involved in &#x003b4;-elimination. Roy <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) reported that G83D yielded primarily &#x003b2;-elimination only. We do not know the reason for this discrepancy but might be due to different assay conditions, variation during expression and purification or the sequence context of the DNA substrate.</p><p>Residue G83 is part of a loop connecting &#x003b2;-strands 4 and 5, which in the <italic>E.coli</italic> EndoVIII structure includes the essential DNA-intercalating residue Leu70 (corresponding to Met81 in NEIL1). Modeling of aspartate in position 83 of NEIL1 suggests that this mutation alter the conformation of this loop, as the negatively charged aspartate side chain is pointing into a hydrophobic pocket in NEIL1. Significant rearrangement of this loop is expected in order to remove unfavorable steric and electrostatic conflicts following a mutation of Gly83 into Asp. Interestingly, according to our model, this loop is close to the non-lesion-containing strand, supporting the observed effect on double-stranded substrates only.</p><p>The NEIL1 G83D SNP was found in two PSC patients with CCA and both were heterozygotic for this polymorphism. As the other allele is healthy, the cells are probably to function with approximately half the level of normal NEIL1 activity. In tissue with severe oxidative stress, such as the bile ducts of PSC patients, a reduction in the DNA repair functions could lead to high levels of oxidative DNA damage and consequently, an increase in the incidence of gene mutations might be the result. Further, defect in one allele could be fatal if the other allele acquires mutations during initial stages of carcinogenesis. It has been estimated that a 20&#x02013;35% reduction in repair capacity of cells is associated with a 4- to 6-fold higher risk of developing cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>).</p><p>An expression study has shown previously that the <italic>NEIL1</italic> messenger RNA level was reduced in about half of primary gastric cancer specimens examined indicating a role of NEIL1 in preventing cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Variations in expression levels of <italic>NEIL1</italic> and also of the other DNA repair genes analyzed may also be of significance for CCA in PSC patient. However, the infiltrating nature of CCA tumors makes it difficult to obtain pure tumor material and such a study awaits further work.</p><p>In conclusion, by sequencing a panel of genes encoding proteins of the BER pathway in patients with PSC, PSC and CCA and healthy controls, we detected nine novel non-synonymous mutations in <italic>hMYH</italic>, <italic>hOGG1</italic> and <italic>NEIL1.</italic> Although no statistical significant differences in allele frequencies between any of the investigated groups were found, severe impairment of protein function was evident in extensive functional analysis of three mutations found in patients with PSC and PSC with CCA. In statistical terms, a causal relationship between either of these mutations and carcinogenesis and PSC is difficult to conclude. Nevertheless, our present findings add to increasing knowledge of the importance of rare, coding variants in complex diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>) and hint to the usefulness of massive sequencing in the search for genetic variants that influence the individual susceptibility to cancer development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgp118/DC1">Supplementary Tables 1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgp118/DC1">2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgp118/DC1">Figures 1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgp118/DC1">2</ext-link> can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/">http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link></p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="bgp118_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="bgp118_carcin-2008-00876-File006_bgp118.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="bgp118_carcin-2008-00876-File007_bgp118.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="bgp118_carcin-2008-00876-File008_bgp118.tif"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><funding-source>Norwegian Cancer Society</funding-source>; <funding-source>Norwegian Research Council</funding-source>; <funding-source>Rikshospitalet University Hospital HF</funding-source>.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>BER</term><def><p>base excision repair</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCA</term><def><p>cholangiocarcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHT</term><def><p>dihydrothymine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EGFP</term><def><p>enhanced green fluorescent protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMSA</term><def><p>electrophoretic mobility shift assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>5ohC</term><def><p>5-hydroxy cytosine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>5ohU</term><def><p>5-hydroxy uracil</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>8oxoG</term><def><p>7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSC</term><def><p>primary sclerosing cholangitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNP</term><def><p>single-nucleotide polymorphism</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ssDNA</term><def><p>single-stranded DNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Tg</term><def><p>thymine glycol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WT</term><def><p>wild-type</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>pGEV1-<italic>hMYH</italic> was a gift from A-Lien Lu (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA).
