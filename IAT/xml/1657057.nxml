In addition, HY5 has been implicated in plant hormone signaling, accounting for the accelerated root system growth phenotype of <italic>hy5</italic> mutants. Mutants in the close <italic>HY5</italic> homolog <italic>HYH</italic> resemble wild-type, despite the largely similar expression patterns and levels of <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH,</italic> and the functional equivalence of the respective proteins. Moreover, the relative contribution of <italic>HYH</italic> to the overall activity of the gene pair is increased by an alternative <italic>HYH</italic> transcript, which encodes a stabilized protein. Consistent with the enhanced root system growth observed in <italic>hy5</italic> loss-of-function mutants, constitutively overexpressed alternative HYH inhibits root system growth. Paradoxically, however, in double mutants carrying <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>hyh</italic> null alleles, the <italic>hy5</italic> root growth phenotype is suppressed rather than enhanced. Even more surprisingly, compared to wild-type, root system growth is diminished in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants. In addition, the double mutants display novel shoot phenotypes that are absent from either single mutant. These include cotyledon fusions and defective vasculature, which are typical for mutants in genes involved in the transcriptional response to the plant hormone auxin. Indeed, many auxin-responsive and auxin signaling genes are misexpressed in <italic>hy5</italic> mutants, and at a higher number and magnitude in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> mutants. Therefore, auxin-induced transcription is constitutively activated at different levels in the two mutant backgrounds. Our data support the hypothesis that the opposite root system phenotypes of <italic>hy5</italic> single and <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants represent the morphological response to a quantitative gradient in the same molecular process, that is gradually increased constitutive auxin signaling. The data also suggest that <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> are important negative regulators of auxin signaling amplitude in embryogenesis and seedling development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Genetic redundancy is the total or partial compensation of inactivation of one gene by another, usually related gene. In <italic>Arabidopsis, HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> are highly similar, principally exchangeable genes.

Nevertheless, if inactive versions of such partially redundant genes are combined in a double mutant, the defects observed in the single mutant often worsen.

Through careful analysis of the double mutant defects and scans of genome-wide gene expression levels, the authors determined that the opposite root system growth of <italic>hy5</italic> single and <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants is a morphological response to a gradually increased quantitative disturbance in the same molecular process, the physiological response to the plant hormone auxin.

In general, loss-of-function mutations of redundantly acting genes are expected to result in no phenotype in the case of full redundancy, or similar phenotypes in the case of partial redundancy. If the mutations in partially redundant genes are combined, an enhancement of the single mutant phenotypes is expected. In this study, we investigated the genetic redundancy between two functionally equivalent <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transcription factors. Surprisingly, their combined loss-of-function leads to a phenotype that is opposite to what would be expected from the single mutant phenotypes. These two genes have been originally identified because of their role in light signaling.</p><p>Light is arguably the most important stimulus in plant development, since growth and reproductive success ultimately depend on the energy harvested from light by photosynthesis. To sense the intensity, direction, and spectral quality of light, plants have developed sophisticated molecular networks &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Plants also possess circadian clocks to measure day length and to adjust their physiology in anticipation of dawn &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Within the light-sensing network, a few factors have a central role in the downstream transcriptional response. Their importance is particularly evident in the most extreme light environment transition in the plant life cycle, the transition from dark-adapted (skotomorphogenic) to light-adapted (photomorphogenic) development.</p><p>Skotomorphogenic seedlings display closed cotyledons, which protect the shoot meristem, reduced root growth, and strongly enhanced hypocotyl elongation. By this behavior, seedlings concentrate their resources toward pushing the shoot meristem through the soil into the light in nature. Light exposure then triggers photomorphogenesis, which comprises light-induced gene expression, cotyledon expansion, photosynthesis, suppression of hypocotyl elongation, and acceleration of root and shoot growth. Factors involved in the transition from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis have mainly been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Among them, the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) play an important role in light-induced gene expression. Loss-of-function <italic>hy5</italic> mutants display dark-grown characteristics in the light &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, most significantly, a loss of the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. While <italic>hy5</italic> mutants display this phenotype in all light conditions, mutants in <italic>hyh</italic> show a similar but very weak phenotype only in blue light &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A general characteristic of the transition from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis is the suppression of cell expansion in some organs, for instance, the hypocotyl, increased cell expansion in others, e.g., the cotyledons, and the onset of growth by cell division in the shoot and root meristems. Notably, both cell expansion and division are thought to be under crucial control of plant hormone signals. Thus, it has long been suspected that light signaling must intersect with hormone signaling or biosynthesis pathways to elicit the desired responses. In fact, several plant hormones have been implicated in light signaling, because they influence cell expansion and/or division, or light-regulated gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Among them, auxin is of particular interest, because it is known to regulate cell elongation as well as division in a dosage-dependent fashion. Accordingly, several genes that act within the auxin signaling framework have been implicated in light responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b010">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p><italic>HY5</italic> has also been implicated in auxin signaling, partly based on photomorphogenic traits of <italic>hy5</italic> mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; but mainly because of the <italic>hy5</italic> root system phenotypes. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root system is dominated by a primary root, which is formed during embryogenesis. After germination, this primary root grows, driven by the cell proliferation and elongation taking place in its apical meristem. Once the primary root has reached a certain length several days after germination, the root system extends through the formation of lateral roots, which emerge along the primary root. In <italic>hy5</italic> mutants, the emergence of lateral roots occurs earlier than in wild-type, resulting in overall enhanced root system growth &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, the gravitropism of <italic>hy5</italic> roots is reduced. Both lateral root formation and root gravitropism are known to require an intact auxin signaling pathway.</p><p>Here we present a detailed analysis of the genetic redundancy between <italic>HY5</italic> and its homolog, <italic>HYH,</italic> which revealed paradoxically opposite root system phenotypes of <italic>hy5</italic> single versus <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants. These phenotypes correlate with quantitatively different constitutive auxin signaling in the mutants. Our data suggest that both genes act redundantly as quantitative modulators of auxin signaling and have a much more central role in this process than anticipated from their respective single mutant phenotypes. This role goes far beyond their role in light signaling and impinges on embryogenesis, root development, shoot development, and vascular differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Expression Patterns of <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> Are Largely Similar</title><p>In contrast to the pronounced seedling shoot phenotypes of <italic>hy5</italic> null mutants, <italic>hyh</italic> null mutants display only very weak phenotypes and only so in blue light. These are slightly decreased anthocyanin biosynthesis and slight decreased inhibition of hypocotyl elongation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In darkness and white light, <italic>hyh</italic> mutants resemble wild-type. The discrepancy between the <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>hyh</italic> mutant phenotypes could be explained by differential expression patterns of the two genes. To test this hypothesis, we constructed transgenic plants expressing a <italic>GFP</italic> reporter gene under control of either the <italic>HY5</italic> or the <italic>HYH</italic> promoter. Similar expression patterns for each construct were observed in several independent transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In several-day-old light-grown seedlings, <italic>HY5</italic> is expressed mainly in the hypocotyl and only very weakly in the cotyledons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">1</xref>F). At this stage, <italic>HYH</italic> is expressed throughout the seedling as well, but at a clearly higher level than <italic>HY5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">1</xref>G). In dark-grown seedlings, both genes are expressed in the apical region of the hypocotyl and in the cotyledons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">1</xref>E). Both genes are also strongly expressed throughout the proliferation zone of the root meristem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">1</xref>I). In the elongation zone, expression becomes gradually concentrated in the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>J and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">1</xref>K), where both genes are primarily expressed in the mature root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>L and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">1</xref>M). Thus, in general, the expression patterns of <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> are largely identical.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Expression Dynamics of <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic></title><p>Differences in expression level rather than pattern could provide an alternative explanation for the different importance of the two genes. For instance, the absence of phenotypes in <italic>hyh</italic> mutants could mean that <italic>HYH</italic> is expressed at much lower levels than <italic>HY5</italic>. However, the GFP fluorescence in the <italic>HYH</italic> reporter lines rather appeared to be consistently higher than in the <italic>HY5</italic> lines in light-grown conditions, where the <italic>hy5</italic> phenotypes manifest. To confirm the quantitative difference proposed by the reporter genes, we determined endogenous <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> transcript abundance by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) in seedlings. Because we detected a truncated alternative <italic>HYH</italic> transcript <italic>(altHYH)</italic> in pilot RT-PCR experiments, the qPCR experiments were designed to differentiate between <italic>altHYH</italic> and full-length <italic>HYH (flHYH).</italic></p><p>In the dark, <italic>HYH</italic> transcripts are present at very low levels, while <italic>HY5</italic> is roughly ten times more abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>N). Upon light stimulus, <italic>HY5</italic> expression is strongly induced 10- to 12-fold within 1 h, before dropping back to approximately twice its dark level within 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>N). The expression of both <italic>HYH</italic> transcripts is also highly light inducible (approximately 50- to 100-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>N) but at a slower pace. Upon light stimulus, <italic>HYH</italic> levels increase steadily, eventually reaching levels comparable to the later steady state levels of <italic>HY5</italic>. However, the two <italic>HYH</italic> transcripts in combination are about twice as abundant as <italic>HY5</italic> in light-grown seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>N and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">1</xref>O). Examination of dissected light-grown shoots and roots reveals that the excess of <italic>HYH</italic> as compared to <italic>HY5</italic> transcript is restricted to the shoot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>O), with a ratio of <italic>HYH</italic> to <italic>HY5</italic> transcripts of roughly 6-fold. By contrast, in roots the abundance of <italic>HY5</italic> transcript is approximately equal to the abundance of the combined <italic>HYH</italic> transcripts. Thus, in the conditions where <italic>hy5</italic> phenotypes are evident, <italic>HYH</italic> levels are similar to or higher than <italic>HY5</italic> levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>altHYH Is Less Susceptible to Proteasome-Mediated Degradation</title><p>Another explanation for the differential activity of the two genes could be differential activity of the respective proteins. In this context, altHYH is of particular interest, because in the <italic>altHYH</italic> transcript the coding region for the COP1-interaction domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; is spliced out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>P). CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) is a ubiquitin ligase, which targets both HY5 and HYH for proteasome-mediated degradation in the dark &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. This process requires the presence of the COP1-interaction domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, altHYH should not be susceptible to COP1-mediated proteasomal degradation. Anti-HYH antibodies detect a protein, previously interpreted to be an flHYH degradation product &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, which unlike flHYH is not degraded when seedlings are shifted from light to darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>Q). Just like flHYH, this band is missing in <italic>hyh</italic> mutants. To confirm that it represents altHYH, we constructed transgenic plants constitutively overexpressing <italic>altHYH</italic> or <italic>flHYH</italic> ORFs under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus <italic>35S</italic> promoter. The transgenic proteins are detected at similar molecular weight as the endogenous ones. Transgenic altHYH is also not susceptible to degradation in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figure 1</xref>R), suggesting that the corresponding endogenous band is indeed altHYH.</p><p>We also introduced the transgenes into a <italic>hy5</italic> background and assayed their capability to rescue <italic>hy5</italic> phenotypes. Consistent with previous reports &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>35S:flHYH</italic> fully compensates the lack of <italic>HY5</italic> in photomorphogenesis, similar to a <italic>35S:HY5</italic> control construct. The <italic>35S:flHYH</italic> transgene also normalizes the <italic>hy5</italic> root system phenotypes, indicating that <italic>HYH</italic> can in principle replace <italic>HY5</italic> in all aspects of seedling development. <italic>35S:altHYH</italic> also complements <italic>hy5</italic> phenotypes, but even beyond wild-type levels: hypocotyl elongation is more strongly suppressed than in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), as is lateral root emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), while root greening is exaggerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Moreover, <italic>hy5</italic> seedlings complemented by <italic>altHYH</italic> also display slightly but significantly reduced primary root growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Thus, the results indicate that HY5 and HYH proteins can act functionally equivalent in both shoot and root development. Because the transgenic plants were assayed in constant light conditions, it also appears that <italic>altHYH</italic> is more active than <italic>flHYH</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Root System Growth Is Decreased in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> Mutants</title><p>In the two blue light&#x02013;specific described traits of <italic>hyh</italic>, anthocyanin biosynthesis and hypocotyl elongation, <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>hyh</italic> behave additively: the relative change conferred by one mutation is proportionally increased by the relative impact of the other mutation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Unlike <italic>hy5</italic> mutants, <italic>hyh</italic> mutants do not display any root system phenotypes. Nevertheless, in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants, the agravitropism observed in <italic>hy5</italic> roots is considerably enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Moreover, the root system growth phenotype of the double mutants represents a reversal of the <italic>hy5</italic> phenotype, because lateral root emergence is delayed rather than enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Also, the total number of lateral roots formed in the double mutants is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). However, lateral root density is largely similar to wild-type, at least early on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). This is because primary root growth is decreased in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). The mature root cell size in the double mutants is similar to the single mutants and wild-type (data not shown), but root meristem size is considerably decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). Thus, <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> mutants display reduced root growth because of reduced cell proliferation in the meristem. Delayed formation of lateral organs appears to be a general feature of <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants, since adventitious root formation on hypocotyls from dark-grown seedlings shifted into light is also delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). Finally, the <italic>hyh</italic> mutation not only suppresses the increased lateral root density in <italic>hy5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) but also suppresses the accelerated growth rate of <italic>hy5</italic> lateral roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g003">Figure 3</xref>H). Thus, in summary, root system growth is enhanced in <italic>hy5</italic> mutants, not affected in <italic>hyh</italic> mutants, but decreased in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Novel Shoot Phenotypes Occur in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> Mutants</title><p>In <italic>hy5</italic> shoots, we observed a previously unnoticed increase in cotyledon size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Although cotyledon size is not affected in <italic>hyh,</italic> it is synergistically enhanced in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The double mutant cotyledons also display a novel phenotype that is not found in either single mutant, that is an altered arrangement of the vasculature. Wild-type cotyledon vasculature has a stereotypic pattern, consisting of a midvein and two connected loops on each side of it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In <italic>hy5</italic>, occasionally three loops or only one loop can be observed. In <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants, however, the stereotypic arrangement is always broken and most loops are not closed. Moreover, in a considerable proportion (approximately 15&#x00025;) of double mutant seedlings, the cotyledons are fused, a phenotype never seen in the wild-type or single mutant lines. The degree of fusion is variable and can range from improper separation of cotyledons at their base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) up to total fusion into one big cotyledon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). The vasculature in fused cotyledons is randomly arranged, with incomplete loops and ramifications. In addition, milder phenotypic classes can be observed, such as altered cotyledon arrangement that results in altered phyllotaxis of early leaves.</p><p>The alterations in the shoot of <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> seedlings are accompanied by a delayed leaf development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). In particular, the emergence of the first true leaves is significantly delayed, and they display a strong hyponasty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). They also display a strong vascular phenotype, which is again absent from the single mutants. Similar to the cotyledons, the vein pattern is altered, and in addition, the number of strands and ramifications is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g004">Figure 4</xref>G). Moreover, the primary veins in the blade run toward the base of the leave instead of away from it. Interestingly, this phenotype is strong in the first four leaves and less penetrant thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Transcriptome Alterations in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> Are More Severe than in <italic>hy5</italic>, but Show the Same Trend</title><p>The novel phenotypes observed in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants, i.e., reduced root system growth, fused cotyledons, and defective vasculature pattern, are reminiscent of the defects typically observed in many auxin signaling mutants. To determine whether auxin signaling is affected in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> mutants, we investigated the transcriptome of the double mutants by microarray analyses.</p><p>Microarray analyses have been performed previously on <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in these experiments, several-day-old, light-grown seedlings were used. At this stage, the different genotypes display significant morphological differences, which could give rise to expression differences of a secondary nature. To minimize such background and get a grasp on genes primarily affected by <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> loss of function, we applied a different strategy.

Further, there are no morphological differences between dark-grown mutant seedlings and wild-type, except for the occasional cotyledon fusions in the double mutants. Upon exposure to light, <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> transcription is induced (see above), and HY5 and flHYH proteins are stabilized within 5 h &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, reaching levels comparable to those seen in seedlings grown in constant light. Thus, after 5 h, HY5 and HYH should be fully active. Therefore, for microarray analyses we germinated seedlings in the dark for 3 d and then transferred them into the light. Seedlings were then harvested after 6 h of light exposure and total RNA was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix ATH1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.affymetrix.com">http://www.affymetrix.com</ext-link>) microarrays to determine the transcriptome profile for the different genotypes.</p><p>To extract meaningful expression differences from our data, we then reasoned that wild-type and <italic>hyh</italic> seedlings do not display morphological differences in the test conditions.

Rather, only genes that are consistently affected between the double mutant and both wild-type and <italic>hyh</italic> should be of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g005">Figure 5</xref>). When applying these criteria, the expression levels of 627 genes (approximately 2.7&#x00025; of all genes on the array) differ significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), applying a threshold of 2-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020202-st001">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Among them, 396 are underexpressed in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> and 231 are overexpressed.

As expected, we found a number of light-regulated genes that have partly been reported to be under HY5 control, e.g., chalcone synthase <italic>(CHS)</italic> genes or chlorophyll a/b binding protein (CAB) genes and other components of the photosynthetic apparatus (16 genes in total) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

Finally, another notable group of genes are genes that have been described to be involved in auxin-mediated transcriptional response (15 genes).

No alterations were detected in the expression of genes that are implicated in auxin transport. Moreover, genes described to play a role in other hormone signaling pathways are conspicuously absent from our set, with the exception of four genes involved in gibberellic acid metabolism and one gene involved in ethylene biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020202-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In summary, as a general trend, the genes that are misregulated in <italic>hy5</italic> represent a subset of the genes misregulated in the double mutant.

Samples were grown in darkness for 3 d, exposed to light for 5 h, and then treated with externally applied auxin for 1 h. In the analysis of the respective microarrays, we concentrated on the set of 627 genes consistently affected in the double mutant. Of these, 246 (approximately 39&#x00025;) were auxin-responsive in wild-type (threshold 2-fold, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), with 129 genes being repressed and 117 genes being induced. A large proportion of these genes do not respond properly to auxin in <italic>hy5</italic> (166 genes, or approximately 66&#x00025;) and the double mutant (199 genes, or approximately 82&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g005">5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020202-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>Of the 246 auxin-responsive genes of the wild-type, 112 do not respond to auxin treatment in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> (i.e., approximately 46&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g005">5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020202-st002">Table S2</xref>). Most of those genes are highly misexpressed in untreated seedlings. Among the 66 genes that are induced by auxin in the wild-type, 62 are overexpressed in the double mutant, and of the 46 auxin-repressed genes, 39 are highly underexpressed. Thus, the data indicate that many auxin-responsive genes are constitutively expressed at auxin-induced or -repressed levels in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> mutants.</p><p>Of the 112 genes that do not respond to auxin in the double mutant any longer, 58 are equally affected in <italic>hy5</italic> single mutants. The other 54 genes still react to auxin. In a small number of cases, opposite regulation in wild-type and <italic>hy5</italic> can be observed; however, as a general trend, with respect to auxin-regulated transcription, <italic>hy5</italic> mutants represent a mild version of <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants. This gradual increase in disturbance of auxin signaling is particularly evident in the expression of a number of well-characterized auxin-responsive genes. Some of these genes are involved in auxin signaling and have been described in the context of hypocotyl elongation and/or photomorphogenesis. For instance, <italic>SHY1/IAA6</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; is mildly overexpressed in <italic>hy5</italic> (approximately 2-fold), more affected in the double mutant (approximately 3-fold), still auxin inducible in <italic>hy5</italic>, but no longer auxin inducible in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020202-t001">Table 1</xref>). The same is true for <italic>IAA19/MSG2</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. In some cases, the gene is not affected in <italic>hy5</italic> but is in the double mutant, as seen for <italic>IAA2</italic>. A similar pattern can be observed for numerous other genes (e.g., <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020202-t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, in the set of 246 genes that are auxin responsive in the wild-type, many genes can be found whose auxin responsiveness is greatly diminished in <italic>hy5</italic> and/or <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020202-t001">Tables 1</xref> and S1). Prominent examples include <italic>IAA1</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; (not affected in <italic>hy5,</italic> approximately 2.5-fold overexpressed in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic>, auxin responsiveness reduced to approximately 2.8-fold in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> from approximately 9-fold in the wild-type) and <italic>ARGOS</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, a gene implicated in auxin-dependent lateral organ formation (not affected in <italic>hy5,</italic> approximately 4-fold overexpressed in <italic>hy5 hyh,</italic> auxin responsiveness reduced to approximately 5 and approximately 2-fold in <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>hy5 hyh,</italic> respectively, down from approximately 7-fold in the wild-type). Similar patterns can be found for many genes annotated as auxin responsive, for instance, <italic>SAUR-AC1</italic> (approximately 2-fold overexpressed in <italic>hy5,</italic> approximately 3-fold in <italic>hy5 hyh,</italic> auxin responsiveness decreased from approximately 10-fold in wild-type to approximately 6-fold and approximately 2-fold in <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>hy5 hyh,</italic> respectively). Finally, for a number of genes, inverse patterns can be observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020202-t001">Tables 1</xref> and S1); that is, they are repressed by auxin in the wild-type, but this repression is lost in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> or <italic>hy5,</italic> because the respective genes are already underexpressed in those mutants.</p><p>In summary, the expression of many auxin-responsive genes is disturbed in <italic>hy5</italic> mutants and increasingly so in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants. Comparison with the transcriptome data from untreated seedlings reveals that this lack of auxin response is generally reflecting a constitutive level of auxin-induced transcription in the mutants.

First, <italic>hy5</italic> null mutants have dramatic seedling phenotypes, while no morphological phenotype is apparent in <italic>hyh</italic> null mutants, except slightly defective inhibition of hypocotyl elongation specifically in blue light &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In light of our expression analyses, this is surprising. Both genes are expressed in nearly identical patterns, and in light-grown seedlings <italic>HYH</italic> is more abundant than <italic>HY5,</italic> although it nevertheless is apparently the dispensable one of the two genes. Finally, the HY5 and HYH proteins are functionally equivalent, because ectopic overexpression of either gene rescues <italic>hy5</italic> phenotypes equally well. Importantly, neither gene is required for the expression of the other (R. Sibout, unpublished data). However, it has been described that HYH protein steady state levels are decreased in <italic>hy5</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. This reduction might be functionally more significant than initially suspected, because of the increased stability of the altHYH protein, which is likely due to the lack of the COP1 interaction domain. Thus, conceptually, <italic>hy5</italic> could be considered a weak <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutant.</p><p>The biological significance of the alternative <italic>HYH</italic> transcript remains to be determined. Although <italic>altHYH</italic> is expressed at relatively low levels in darkness when compared to <italic>HY5</italic>, due to the increased stability of altHYH protein, the difference in protein activity is likely less dramatic. Thus, altHYH could have an important role in kick-starting gene expression upon light stimulus and in sustaining light-regulated gene expression once the initial burst of light-induced <italic>HY5</italic> transcription is dropping to steady state levels. It is also conceivable that altHYH could play a role in the anticipation of dawn. Although our experiments do not differentiate between diurnal and circadian regulation of <italic>HYH,</italic> a direct link to the circadian clock is suggested by our finding that its central component <italic>CCA1</italic> appears to be under <italic>HY5/HYH</italic> control.</p><p>The second paradox is the discrepancy between the <italic>hy5</italic> and double mutant root phenotypes. While lateral root emergence and growth is enhanced in <italic>hy5</italic> mutants, this phenotype is suppressed in the double mutants. Moreover, overall root system growth is even diminished in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic>. This situation correlates with a gradual increase in constitutive auxin signaling in the <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> versus the <italic>hy5</italic> mutant background, as indicated by transcriptome analyses and by the occurrence of novel, auxin-related phenotypes in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutant shoots.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>A General Role of <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> in Auxin Signaling</title><p>Initially, <italic>HY5</italic> had been suspected to play a role in auxin signaling because of the branching phenotype and agravitropism of <italic>hy5</italic> roots &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. The double mutant, however, implicates <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> in auxin signaling in a much wider sense, because the observed novel phenotypes are hallmarks of strongly impaired auxin signaling. The appearance of fused cotyledons in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> is an especially specific indicator. Because the cotyledons are formed in the embryo, this phenotype reveals a role for <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> in embryogenesis. Cotyledon fusions are observed in a number of auxin signaling embryogenesis mutants, e.g., <italic>bodenlos (bdl/iaa12)</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; or <italic>monopteros</italic> (<italic>mp</italic>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, this phenotype is usually not fully penetrant and represents the extreme of a phenotypic range. The <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutant is similar in this respect: fused cotyledons are only observed in approximately 15&#x00025; of seedlings. However, the cotyledons of all <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> seedlings have an altered vasculature, which is also a characteristic of mutants altered in auxin signaling or transport, e.g., <italic>mp</italic>. The correct separation of cotyledons in embryogenesis requires the three partially redundant <italic>CUC</italic> genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.

Therefore, <italic>HY5/HYH</italic> control of <italic>CUC1</italic> might act as a parallel input to provide maximal <italic>CUC</italic> activity in embryogenesis. In summary, the strong auxin-related phenotypes of <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants, combined with the results from our microarray analyses, suggest that <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> have a general role in auxin signaling, from embryogenesis on throughout seedling development.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>A Complementary Strategy for Transcriptome Analysis of <italic>hy5/hyh</italic> Mutants</title><p>In this study, we minimized secondary expression changes in transcriptome analysis by choosing a developmental stage at which mutants and wild-type display minimal morphological differences, but the genes in question are known to be nevertheless active.

One disadvantage of our strategy is that genes primarily affected at later stages of development are missed.

Therefore, it is conceivable that they could repress the expression of some genes but activate the expression of others. It seems unlikely that all 627 genes are direct targets of HY5 and/or HYH. In general, the promoters of direct target genes would be expected to contain a HY5/HYH binding site, the G-box motif. One or more G-box motifs can be found in the 5&#x02032; 1,000-bp promoter regions of 97 genes (C. S. Hardtke, unpublished data). These include, for instance, <italic>CCA1, CHS,</italic> and <italic>CAB</italic> genes and a number of transcription factor genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020202-t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, among the auxin-responsive genes, G-box motifs are not more frequent than in the complete set of 627 genes (approximately 15&#x00025; to 16&#x00025;). Nevertheless, the proportion of auxin-responsive genes among the 627 genes affected in the double mutant (approximately 39&#x00025;) significantly exceeds the proportion of auxin-responsive genes in the wild-type (approximately 16&#x00025;). Thus, in line with the phenotypic analysis of <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutants, <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> clearly modulate auxin-regulated gene expression but most likely by controlling a few central regulators of auxin response. Among the functionally defined auxin signaling genes affected in the double mutant, only <italic>MSG2/IAA19</italic> contains a G-box motif. Interestingly, as in <italic>AXR2/IAA7</italic> and <italic>SLR/IAA14</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, it is located close to the transcription initiation site. Consistent with <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> phenotypes, <italic>MSG2/IAA19</italic> has been implicated in hypocotyl growth responses and lateral root formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, <italic>MSG2/IAA19</italic> is a highly light-responsive gene that is expressed at very high levels in darkness and repressed upon light stimulus, a feature it shares with the equally affected <italic>SHY1/IAA6</italic> gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, <italic>MSG2/IAA19</italic> could represent one of the central auxin signaling components that directly link light- and auxin-induced gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Auxin Signaling versus Auxin Transport</title><p>While the transcriptome analyses demonstrate a perturbation of auxin signaling, it also appears possible that the <italic>hy5</italic> and double mutant phenotypes rather result from altered auxin transport. For example, the reduced basipetal auxin transport is consistent with the agravitropism of <italic>hy5</italic> roots and the increased acropetal transport with enhanced lateral root emergence. In general, however, it is difficult to determine whether the primary defect is in auxin transport or signaling, because of the inherent feedback connections between the two processes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Several observations favor the interpretation that altered auxin transport in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> mutants is a secondary consequence of altered auxin signaling. For instance, root agravitropism and lateral root emergence defects of the <italic>axr4</italic> auxin transport mutant can be rescued by application of the lipid-soluble auxin analog NAA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. This is, however, not the case for <italic>hy5</italic> or the double mutant (C. S. Hardtke, unpublished data). Also, our naringenin feeding experiments exclude the possibility that auxin transport is altered because of reduced flavonoid biosynthesis, since naringenin treatment did not restore gravitropism in <italic>hy5</italic> roots. In contrast, growth of flavonoid-deficient and agravitropic <italic>tt4</italic> mutant seedlings on naringenin restores gravity response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020202-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, acropetal auxin transport is significantly enhanced to the same degree in <italic>hy5, hyh,</italic> and the double mutants, but their root branching phenotypes are very different. Finally, HY5 and HYH are transcription factors, but genes directly implicated in auxin transport are conspicuously absent from the set of genes with altered expression levels in the mutants. Therefore, the combined evidence suggests that <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> mutants are mainly defective in the perception or interpretation of auxin stimulus (i.e., auxin signaling), and alterations in auxin transport are likely a secondary consequence of feedback regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Auxin-Related Phenotypes in <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> Mutants: A Quantitative Affair?</title><p>Our transcriptome analyses and the novel <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> shoot phenotypes support the hypothesis that auxin signaling is constitutively disturbed in <italic>hy5</italic> and the double mutants. The transcriptome analyses also suggest that the molecular defects in <italic>hy5</italic> and <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> are largely similar although quantitatively different. The number of misregulated auxin-responsive genes is higher in the double mutant than in <italic>hy5</italic>. Moreover, in the case of genes that are affected in both genotypes, the magnitude of misregulation is always considerably higher in the double mutant. Finally, the auxin-induction experiments clearly indicate that the vast majority of auxin-responsive genes that are affected in the double mutant are expressed at constitutively auxin-induced or -repressed levels. Therefore, in the microarray analyses, <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> mutants largely mimic auxin-treated wild-type, suggesting that auxin signaling is constitutively elevated. This is also true for <italic>hy5,</italic> albeit at a lower quantitative level.</p><p>The phenotypic progression from wild-type to <italic>hy5</italic> to the double mutant correlates with quantitatively ever-increasing disturbance of auxin-responsive gene expression, reflecting ever-increasing constitutive auxin signaling. Thus, it appears that the smaller increase in constitutive auxin signaling in <italic>hy5</italic> accelerates root system growth, while a further increase beyond a critical threshold, a situation created in the double mutant, suppresses growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we therefore conclude that the disparate root system growth phenotypes of <italic>hy5</italic> and the double mutant reflect a morphological response to a quantitative gradient in the same molecular process, i.e., a gradual increase in constitutive auxin signaling. Finally, because practically all the classic auxin responses, from tropisms to lateral organ formation to cell elongation and proliferation, are impaired in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> double mutant seedlings, we conclude that <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>HYH</italic> are important general negative regulators of the auxin signaling pathway, modulating its amplitude from embryogenesis throughout seedling development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Phenotypic differences in measurements highlighted in the Results section are all statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.01 based on Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant material and tissue culture.</title><p>Seedlings were grown at 22 &#x000b0;C under constant illumination on culture medium (0.5&#x000d7; MS salts, 0.5 g/L MES, 1&#x00025; sucrose, 0.9&#x00025; agar &#x0005b;pH 5.8&#x0005d;) unless otherwise stated.

The strength of (constitutive) auxin signaling in the respective genotype determines the extent of root system growth. Root system growth is maximal at a certain optimum auxin signaling level but decreases if this level is either lower or higher. This assumption is supported by the phenotypic response of wild-type seedling root systems to the external application of increasing amounts of auxin: whereas low auxin concentrations promote root system growth, high concentrations inhibit growth.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020202.g007"/></fig><table-wrap id="pgen-0020202-t001" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>List of Selected Genes Consistently Misregulated in <italic>hy5 hyh</italic> Double Mutants, Ordered According to Functional Classification</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020202.t001"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> RS contributed the data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">Figures 1</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020202-g001">1</xref>P, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
