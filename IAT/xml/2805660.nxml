Nuclear factor I-A (NFI-A), a member of the nuclear factor I (NFI) family of site-specific transcription factors, is a good candidate for controlling L1 transcription, as it regulates the expression of several neural proteins and thereby governs development of the central nervous system in mice and men (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]).

The NFI-A expression plasmid pCHNFI-A has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and expresses the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] murine ortholog of chicken NFI-A1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which, in this paper, is called "standard isoform" due to its widespread expression in various tissues of adult mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To express the brain-specific isoform of mouse NFI-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in an HA epitope-tagged form, pCHBNFI-A was used, which was constructed analogously to pCHNFI-A. A plasmid which expresses brain-specific NFI-A lacking most of the activation domain (pCHBNFI-Am) was created by digesting the parental vector with <italic>Bst</italic>XI and <italic>Kpn</italic>I. 3' overhangs were removed by incubation with Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 68&#x000b0;C for 15 min, and the resulting blunt ends were ligated using the Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). For ChIP experiments, Myc-tagged expression constructs for the standard and brain-specific NFI-A isoforms were made by cutting out the HA tag with <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Sfi</italic>I from pCHNFI-A and pCHBNFI-A, respectively. Two oligonucleotides, NFI-Myc 1 (GGCCGCTATGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGCAC) and NFI-Myc 2 (CAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCCATAGC) (Metabion, Martinsried, Germany), which contain the coding sequence of the Myc epitope combined with Kozak box, start codon and the compatible nucleotide overhangs, were annealed.

Per dish, 13 &#x003bc;g of the respective plasmid were transfected with 26 &#x003bc;l Lipofectamine and 39 &#x003bc;l Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Three h later, the transfection reaction was stopped by addition of 6.5 ml CHO culture medium. 24 h after transfection, cell monolayers were washed once with PBS and harvested by scraping into PBS supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche). Cells were pelleted by spinning for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C (300 &#x000d7; g), the supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in low salt lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 1 &#x000d7; Complete protease inhibitor (Roche)). The cell suspension underwent three freeze-thaw cycles in dry ice/ethanol. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation (15 min, 4&#x000b0;C, 15000 &#x000d7; g), and the supernatant was used for DNA binding analysis. The electrophoretic mobility shift experiments were essentially performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In brief, single-stranded oligonucleotides were purchased (Metabion) and annealed, yielding double-stranded oligonucleotides with 5' overhangs. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with &#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P-dCTP using Klenow polymerase (Roche).

For the supershift, 1 &#x003bc;l of undiluted anti-HA (clone 12CA5, Roche) was added before loading, and incubated for another 20 min. In the case of competition experiments, radioactively labeled oligonucleotides were mixed with a 5-100 fold molar excess of the respective unlabeled oligonucleotides before being added to the binding reaction.

However, 6-well plates were used, with DNA amounts and volumes of media and reagents adjusted accordingly. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed by incubating in Ripa buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) NP-40, 1 &#x000d7; Complete protease inhibitor (Roche)) for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation (15000 &#x000d7; g, 4&#x000b0;C, 10 min). The supernatant was mixed with sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunologically detected as described (Kalus <italic>et al. </italic>2003). Anti-HA (from mouse, clone 12CA5, Roche) was used as primary antibody (1:400 in 4% milk powder in Tris-HCl-buffered saline (pH 7.3)). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) was applied at a 1:10,000 dilution in 4% milk powder in Tris-HCl-buffered saline (pH 7.3). Detection of Myc-NFI-A st and Myc-NFI-A bs expression in N2A cells was performed following the same protocol, using anti-Myc (from mouse, clone 9E10, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany) as a primary antibody. Transfection of the respective plasmids was performed as described under "Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay". However, 6-well plates were used, with DNA amounts and volumes of media and reagents adjusted accordingly. To check for the amount of protein loaded per lane, an anti-GAPDH antibody was applied (anti-GAPDH from rabbit, Cell Signalling, mAb 14C10, 1:1000; followed by anti-rabbit-IgG-HRP, 1:20,000).</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)</title><p>Myc-tagged NFI-A expression for ChIPs was carried out in N2A cells, cultivated on 90-mm dishes until confluency. 13 &#x003bc;g of the respective plasmid were transfected with 26 &#x003bc;l Lipofectamine and 39 &#x003bc;l Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) per dish according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h later, ChIP analysis was essentially performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For reduction of non-specific background, 0.5 &#x003bc;g anti-HA was applied per precipitation. Specific precipitation was achieved using anti-Myc. DNA fragments were purified with the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Subsequent PCR was carried out with the primers ChIP fw, GGAGTTCAAATGCCTTAACATGA, and ChIP rev, CTGGATGCCCTCAATAAATTCAT. For negative control amplifications of remote gene loci, the following primers were used: Chst11 fw, TGGAGACAGCCCTCCATAGATGT; Chst11 rev, GATGGCAGTGTTGGATAGCTCCA; Chst8 fw, GTAAACGACTTCTCCTACCGCA; Chst8 rev, GTATTGTCACAGGGACGATGTCCA. Amplification comprised 25 cycles, with the annealing temperature set to 55&#x000b0;C. As a positive control, genomic DNA from C57BL/6J mouse tail cuts was used, which was prepared according to the following protocol: tail cuts were incubated over night at 55&#x000b0;C in 100 &#x003bc;l lysis buffer (0.1 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany); 50 mM Tris pH 8.0; 50 mM KCl; 2.5 mM EDTA; 0.45% NP-40 and 0.45% Tween-20). The next day, tissue debris were spun down, and the whole supernatant was extracted with an equal volume of PCI (phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volumes of 8 M LiCl. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and, after drying, resuspended in 50-100 &#x003bc;l 1 mM Tris pH 8.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Luciferase-based reporter gene assays</title><p>For transient transfections, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>mouse neuroblastoma (N2A) cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) and transfected the next day with 2.5 &#x003bc;l Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per microgram of DNA. 80 ng reporter plasmid (L1-11), 60 ng of the effector plasmids (pCHBNFI-A or pCHBNFI-Am) or control CMX plasmid coding for &#x003b2;-galactosidase were applied per well. EGFP fluorescence generated by cotransfection of 60 ng pEGFP-C3 (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) was determined after 48 hours with a Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer, Wiesbaden, Germany). Luciferase activity was measured with the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Light emission was normalized to the level of EGFP fluorescence activity from the EGFP control plasmid. Transfections were generally performed in septuplicate.

Their unique N-termini of 32 (NFI-A bs) and 9 amino acids (NFI-A st) are generated by alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

To control for binding specificity, a G&#x02192;C point mutation eliminating an essential GN7 contact for NFI was introduced into both oligonucleotides, yielding Lc and Nc, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Both NFI-A st and NFI-A bs expression caused a significant shift of the L and N oligonucleotides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Neither the Lc nor the Nc oligonucleotide were shifted, indicating that the guanosine in position 3 of the motif is critical for NFI-A binding and that the complex is formed by sequence-specific interaction of NF1-A with both elements. Moreover, no gel shift was observed for the unrelated SIS oligonucleotide (C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], which does not contain an NFI recognition motif.

Western blot analysis revealed the presence of comparable amounts of both NFI-A isoforms in transfected N2A cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

The brain-specific isoform of NFI-A was chosen because it reproducibly bound to the endogenous <italic>L1 </italic>regulatory region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), whereas <italic>in vivo </italic>binding of the ubiquitous NFI-A isoform appeared to be weaker. NFI-A bs reduced <italic>L1 </italic>gene activity to less than one-third of control values (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, second column from the right side). Repression was concentration-dependent, suggesting a specific effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Moreover, we investigated a mutated form of NFI-A bs (NFI-A bs del), which lacked the entire activation/repression domain. NFI-A bs del should therefore be able to bind to DNA, but exhibit a severely reduced ability to activate or repress target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In line with these expectations, expression of the truncated NFI-A bs led to only a slight reduction of L1 transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, rightmost column). Summarizing, our data show a repressive influence of NFI-A bs on <italic>L1 </italic>gene expression, which can be reverted by impairing NFI-A's trans-regulatory abilities.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>NFI-A represses mouse <italic>L1 </italic>gene expression</bold>.

Here, using EMSA and antibody supershift experiments, we showed that the site-specific transcription factor NFI-A specifically interacts with a full NFI recognition site in the first intron of the murine <italic>L1 </italic>gene. The interaction is very strong, as shown by competition analysis. This high affinity is in accordance with a previous <italic>in vitro </italic>study, in which the NFI consensus binding motif was determined by PCR-mediated random site selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We also observed an electrophoretic mobility shift using extracts from cells not transfected with NFI-A expression plasmids, probably caused by expression of endogenous NFI proteins. The respective bands were much weaker when NFI-A was overexpressed, either due to a limiting input or due to a down-regulation of endogenous NFI-A by forced NFI-A expression.</p><p>ChIP analysis confirmed that the brain-specific isoform of NFI-A (NFI-A bs) binds to the regulatory region of the mouse <italic>L1 </italic>gene <italic>in vivo </italic>as well. By contrast, we did not observe reproducible binding of the ubiquitous NFI-A isoform (NFI-A st) to this genomic region <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the <italic>in vitro </italic>interaction of NFI-A st with the full binding site in <italic>L1 </italic>was at least as strong as the one of NFI-A bs. This difference might be caused by the different binding reaction conditions in the two assays. Alternatively, post-translational modifications could be a reason for the different behavior of NFI-A st and NFI-A bs in the two assays, in particular phosphorylation, which has been implied in regulating NFI activity by several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Whereas for EMSA, extracts from CHO cells were used, ChIP was performed using N2A cells. It is thus tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of crucial amino acid residues differs between NFI-A bs and NFI-A st in N2A cells, causing a different affinity to the <italic>L1 </italic>gene regulatory region. Differences in protein phosphorylation or other modifications might also explain why the apparent molecular weights of NFI-A bs and NFI-A st differed slightly more than one would expect from their amino acid composition. Finally, it should be noted that eight half binding sites for NFI proteins can be found in the 2400 bp immediately upstream of the full site. NFI-A binds to such pentanucleotide sequences with a reduced affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In order to understand how binding of NFI-A to the <italic>L1 </italic>regulatory region influences L1 expression, we performed reporter gene assays in mouse neuroblastoma (N2A) cells. NFI-A bs caused a reduction in <italic>L1 </italic>gene activity to approx. 30% of control level. In this context, it is noteworthy that only the brain-specific isoform significantly interacted with the endogenous <italic>L1 </italic>gene regulatory region. Moreover, we could nearly abolish repression of L1 transcription by NFI-A bs by deleting NFI-A's transregulatory domain. To our knowledge, these results are the first experimental evidence for a specific role of NFI-A bs in the regulation of a neuronal gene.</p><p>How could NFI-A activity at the <italic>L1 </italic>gene regulatory region be regulated in a physiological context? Several studies suggest that NFI activity is modulated by NFI phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In our case, NFI-A could be inactivated by phosphorylation, leading to enhanced L1 expression. However, there is no direct evidence that phosphorylation affects NFI activity.</p><p>Interactions with other site-specific transcription factors might also regulate transactivation/transrepression by NFI-A. NFI proteins physically interact with TTF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], Oct-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], ski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and CBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Binding of NFI-A to such factors could alter its inhibitory influence on L1 transcription initiation. Remarkably, the HPD element, which is responsible for stimulation of L1 expression by Pax-6, is located in the same part of the <italic>L1 </italic>gene as the full NFI binding site identified in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, binding of the homeodomain proteins Barx-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and Hoxa-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] to the <italic>L1 </italic>gene is also mediated by the HPD element. This might implicate a functional interaction between NFI transcription factors and Pax-6, Barx-2, or Hoxa-1 in regulating L1 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our data suggest that NFI-A is a repressor of mouse <italic>L1 </italic>gene activity. A role for NFI-A in regulating L1 expression during development is plausible, as expression of both genes starts around embryonic day 9 in the developing nervous system of the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, Kallunki <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] have proposed a second silencer element in the first intron of the L1 gene that functions together with the NRSE to regulate L1 expression. NFI-A, binding tightly to its recognition motifs in this intron and repressing L1 expression, could be part of the proposed silencer. It may prevent L1 expression at inappropriate stages or cell types, like glia of the central nervous system, consistent with the recently demonstrated importance of NFI-A for glial cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As both L1 and NFI-A are crucial for brain development in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], further investigations on regulation of L1 expression by NFI-A, for instance cell type-specific analyses of NFI-A deficient mice during development, are likely to significantly extend our knowledge of human brain formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TS designed and performed experiments shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and participated in writing the manuscript.
