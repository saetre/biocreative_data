Since their initial characterization in 1984 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c2">2</xref>), homeodomain proteins have been studied extensively, because of the crucial role they play in a broad range of developmental processes in virtually all metazoan organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c3">3</xref>). Through their ability to regulate gene expression, these proteins apparently act as switches that control the activities of batteries of genes during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c4">4</xref>).</p><p>Structural studies have revealed that the homeodomain consists of an N-terminal arm and three &#x003b1; helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c5">5</xref>), a structure that confers on the proteins the key property of sequence-specific binding to DNA. Since the repertoire of target genes for most homeodomain proteins is poorly defined, studies of DNA binding specificity have generally focused on <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of their interactions with artificial DNA sequences. This approach has generated a detailed picture of DNA contacts made by a variety of homeodomains &#x0005b;reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c8">8</xref>)&#x0005d;. Homeodomains typically bind a core TAAT sequence, with additional binding specificity contributed by base-specific interactions with the 2 nucleotides 3&#x02032; of the TAAT motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c6">6</xref>). However, numerous studies have indicated that the specificity and affinity of <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding is relatively low, despite the fact that these proteins function in a very precise and specific manner during development and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Several explanations for this &#x02018;homeodomain paradox&#x02019; have been proposed. For instance, additional DNA binding regions present on a subset of homeodomain proteins (e.g. the POU domain family) have been shown to substantially increase DNA binding affinity and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c10">10</xref>). Alternatively, it has been proposed that cofactors may facilitate the high specificity of action observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c11">11</xref>). Indeed in recent years, members of the PBC family of homeodomain proteins have been shown to serve as cofactors of homeodomain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c12">12</xref>). PBC proteins are capable of interacting with a subclass of homeodomain proteins via a conserved hexapeptide motif located N-terminal of the homeodomain, thereby expanding the DNA recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c14">14</xref>). A third explanation, the &#x02018;widespread binding&#x02019; model, proposes that multiple monomer binding sites exist in target gene promoters, thereby increasing promoter occupancy, perhaps aided by cooperative binding mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c15">15</xref>).</p><p>PDX1 (also known as IPF1, IDX-1 and STF-1) is a highly conserved 284 amino acid homeodomain protein expressed selectively in pancreatic precursor cells and in mature pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c16">16</xref>). It is essential for pancreas development, since loss of PDX1 function results in agenesis of the organ both in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c17">17</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c18">18</xref>). PDX1 is also needed for normal function of mature pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c19">19</xref>). Indeed under some circumstances, PDX1 may be sufficient to activate a pancreatic developmental program in non-pancreatic lineages, since ectopic expression of PDX1 in liver cells can bring about conversion to a pancreatic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c22">22</xref>).</p><p>PDX1 represents one of the few homeodomain proteins for which several potential target genes with well-characterized promoters &#x0005b;e.g. the insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) and pancreatic glucokinase genes&#x0005d; have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c25">25</xref>). Yet the mechanism whereby these genes are selectively activated remains unclear. PDX1 contains a hexapeptide motif N-terminal to the homeodomain, and it has been shown that heteromeric complexes of PDX1 with PBC family members, e.g. PBX and Meis proteins, are able to bind with high affinity to the TAGTTAAT elements on the somatostatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c26">26</xref>) and elastase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c27">27</xref>) gene promoters. However, this high-affinity site is not found on the majority of potential beta cell target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c26">26</xref>). Thus, interaction with PBC proteins may not be essential for PDX1 function in mature pancreatic beta cells. This is consistent with the observation that the hexapeptide appears to be dispensable for activation of the insulin gene promoter in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c28">28</xref>), and raises the possibility that selection of target genes is accomplished by PDX1 alone, perhaps as a monomer.</p><p>The aim of this study was to analyze the binding site preference of PDX1 with a view to better understanding the mode of action of the protein, and to help define the repertoire of target genes. Upon comparison of PDX1 binding sites on the insulin gene and other putative PDX1 target genes, we observed a strong conservation of nucleotides on either side of the TAAT core. This prompted us to test the functional significance of these flanking nucleotides. Our results indicate that PDX1 is able to discriminate <italic>in vitro</italic> among potential binding sites on natural promoters and on artificial binding sites, by virtue of 3 bp flanking the TAAT motif. By transfecting cultured beta cells with reporter genes bearing wild-type and mutated promoters, we showed that these flanking sites are also important for PDX1 action <italic>in vivo</italic>. The unanticipated ability of PDX1 to recognize an extended DNA sequence may help to explain how target gene preference of this crucial gene is determined <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The plasmids pGL3.Synt.LUC and pRL.RSV have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c29">29</xref>). The unique BamHI site in pGL3.Synt.LUC was destroyed by fill-in and religation, to produce pGL3.Synt-DB. For mutations in the A1 region (&#x02013;83 to &#x02013;74), the backbone reporter plasmid pGL3.S8a-DB was made by substituting the rat insulin I gene promoter region between PstI (&#x02013;160) and HindIII (&#x0002b;1) in pGL3.Synt-DB with that from pS8a-CAT, a derivative of the plasmid pOK1 that contains a unique, transcriptionally silent BamHI site (&#x02013;85) just upstream of the A1 element in the rat insulin I gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c30">30</xref>). This construct was first digested at the unique HindIII site (&#x0002b;1), dephosphorylated, and then digested at the unique BamHI site (&#x02013;85). Synthetic oligonucleotides with the desired mutations in the A1 TAAT flanking bases were annealed and ligated, together with a 64-bp linker, between the BamHI (&#x02013;85) and HindIII (&#x0002b;1) sites of pGL3.S8a-DB. The 64-bp linker spanning the positions from &#x02013;63 to &#x0002b;1 was produced by annealing the following oligonucleotides: 64-top d(AAGTCCAGGGGGCAGAGAGGAGGTGCTTT GGACTATAAAGCTAGTGGAGACCCAGTAACTCCCA) and 64-bot d(AGCTTGGGAGTTACTGGGTCTCCACTAG CTTTATAGTCCAAAGCACCTCCTCTCTGCCCCC). For mutations in the A3 region (&#x02013;216 to &#x02013;207), a unique EcoRI site (&#x02013;250) was introduced in pGL3.Synt.LUC using the Quick Change&#x02122; site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). This construct was then digested at the EcoRI site, dephosphorylated and subsequently digested at the unique AvrII site (&#x02013;205). Synthetic oligonucleotides with the desired mutations in the A3 TAAT flanking bases were then annealed and ligated, together with an 18-bp linker, between the EcoRI and AvrII sites. The 18-bp linker spanning the positions from &#x02013;252 to &#x02013;235 was produced by annealing the following oligonucleotides: 18-top d(AATTCCTTCATCAGGCCA) and 18-bot d(GCCAGATGGCCTGATGAAGG). Double mutations were then made by substituting the wild-type rat insulin I gene promoter region between the PstI (&#x02013;160) and HindIII (&#x0002b;1) sites of the A3 type mutations with those from the A1 mutations. The constant 64- and 18-bp linkers were phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase prior to ligation. The relevant regions of recombinant plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and transfections</title><p>Hamster insulinoma cells HIT (subclone M2.2.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c32">32</xref>) were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagles medium in the presence of 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum, penicillin (200 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 &#x000b5;g/ml).

EMSA experiments were carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c34">34</xref>), with the following modifications. For competition experiments, nuclear extract (2&#x02013;3 &#x000b5;g protein) was incubated for 10 min on ice in 10 &#x000b5;l of EMSA binding buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 150 mM KCl, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 5 mM DTT) containing 600 ng of poly dI&#x02013;dC (Sigma) and 600 ng of poly dA&#x02013;dT (Sigma). Radioactive probe (&#x0223c;20 000 c.p.m.) containing the desired molar excess of unlabeled DNA competitor in EMSA binding buffer was then added, and incubation was allowed to continue for an additional 20 min on ice. Following electrophoresis on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the dried gels were analyzed by phosphorimager (Bio-Imaging Analyzer, BAS-2500; Fuji). The extent of DNA binding was calculated using Image Gauge 3.41 software (Fuji) and compared with that observed in the absence of competitor DNA.

The recombinant protein was purified by batch purification using glutathione&#x02013;Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech). Oligonucleotide selection was performed with a DNA fragment containing degenerate bases at three positions on both sides of the ATTA core flanked by non-random sequences: d(GATCGACGTCCAGTGGATCCTTGA<underline>NNN</underline><bold>ATTA</bold><underline>NNN</underline>GATGCCGGCAAGACTGGGAACAGTAG). The single-stranded oligonucleotide containing the random sequence was made double stranded by annealing with an oligonucleotide complementary to the 3&#x02032; non-random sequence: d(CTACTGTTCCCAGTCTTG) (SAAB bot), and fill-in reaction using PCR in the presence of 50 &#x000b5;Ci &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dATP, and 200 &#x000b5;M dATP, 200 &#x000b5;M dCTP, 200 &#x000b5;M dGTP and 200 &#x000b5;M dTTP in a final volume of 50 &#x000b5;l.

The A1 element contains a single TAAT motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f1">1</xref>B) flanked on both sides by a number of evolutionary conserved bases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f2">2</xref>). A3/4 is a more complex element, containing from one to four TAAT sites that differ from each other both in their flanking bases and in the degree of evolutionary conservation among the rat, mouse and human insulin gene promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f2">2</xref>). The A3 region is highly conserved, whereas the A4 region is much more variable: only in the rat insulin I gene does it possess a core TAAT sequence. These differences suggest that PDX1 may act differently on these elements. Furthermore, the strong evolutionary conservation of PDX1 function implies that within the A3/4 element the protein will primarily act at the most conserved site, i.e. the A3 element. Thus, PDX1 may be able to distinguish TAAT of the A3 site from irrelevant TAATs nearby, by recognizing bases flanking these TAATs. To test these ideas, we compared PDX1 binding to these naturally occurring sequences by competitive EMSA. Nuclear extracts from HIT cells were incubated with the rat insulin I A3/4 probe in the presence of increasing concentrations of competitor sequences containing the A1 and A3/4 elements from the rat insulin I and II gene promoters, or rat insulin I A3/4 element with a mutated A4 TAAT site (m1 A3/4) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f1">1</xref>B). The E1 sequence, derived from the rat insulin 1 gene lacks a TAAT sequence and was used as a control for non-specific binding. We observed that all the A1 and A3/4 sequences tested displayed similar ability to compete for DNA binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f1">1</xref>C), indicating similar binding affinities. Since the A3/4 element displays binding indistinguishable from that of m1 A3/4 that lacks A4, it seems likely that A3 is the primary binding site for PDX1 in this region, as expected from its evolutionary conservation.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of PDX1 binding properties among its potential target promoters <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We analyzed the distribution of bases flanking the TAAT core in a number of potential PDX1 target genes of rat, mouse and human. Alignments were compiled using the programs ClustalW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c40">40</xref>), PileUp (GCG) and FindPatterns (GCG). We restricted the analysis to conserved sites that have been experimentally shown to be PDX1 responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c46">46</xref>).

The rat insulin I gene A1 sequence (containing a single TAAT site) was used as a probe, and incubated with nuclear extract from HIT cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of competitor sequences containing TAAT elements from promoters of the following genes: rat insulin I (A1 element), rat pancreatic glucokinase &#x0005b;UPE-3 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c41">41</xref>)&#x0005d;, rat IAPP &#x0005b;A2 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c42">42</xref>)&#x0005d;, mouse glucose transporter type 2 &#x0005b;GLUT2 TAAT site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c45">45</xref>)&#x0005d; and mouse albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c24">24</xref>) (a gene expressed in liver but not in pancreas, and therefore not a PDX1 target) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f3">3</xref>A). The sequences fell into three groups in terms of their ability to compete for binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f3">3</xref>B). The most effective competitor was A1 itself, while TAAT sequences from GLUT2 and albumin gene promoters showed low efficiency of competition; the sites from IAPP and pancreatic glucokinase gene promoters both displayed intermediate competition efficiency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f3">3</xref>B).</p><p>The competition analysis allowed us to measure the affinity of PDX1 binding to DNA, by calculating apparent <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> values. The <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> values obtained for PDX1 were in the nanomolar range, typical for homeodomain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c50">50</xref>).

The effects of these substitutions were tested by competition EMSA using HIT cell nuclear protein extracts. Simultaneous substitutions both upstream and downstream of TAAT (G5C &#x0002b; C2T&#x02014;as in albumin, and G4A &#x0002b; C1A&#x02014;as in GLUT2) led to a substantial decrease in PDX1 binding, although the extent of the effect was less than that observed for the corresponding TAAT elements from the albumin and GLUT2 promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f3">3</xref>C). Therefore, the 2 nt mutated in each case are important in determining binding affinity, but are insufficient to explain completely the differences between high and low affinity TAAT core sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of TAAT flanking bases <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To assess the physiological role of TAAT flanking nucleotides within PDX1 binding sites, we made a series of reporter plasmids based on the firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of the rat insulin I gene promoter. For this purpose, the A1 site (TAAT and three bases flanking it on both sides) was substituted with the corresponding sequences from the previously examined PDX1 binding sites from the promoters of the following genes: rat insulin I (A3 site), IAPP, pancreatic glucokinase, GLUT2 and albumin (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f2">2</xref> for sequence details).

As expected, the A3 sequence, which has PDX1 binding affinity similar to A1, showed activity essentially identical to the wild-type promoter (104&#x00025;). On the other hand, the TAAT sequences from the GLUT2 and albumin promoters, that display weak PDX1 binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, showed significantly weaker promoter activity (23 and 49&#x00025;, respectively). The UPE-3 site from the pancreatic promoter of the glucokinase gene (moderate PDX1 binding <italic>in vitro</italic>) showed intermediate activity (74&#x00025;). The IAPP site (PDX1 binding similar to that of glucokinase) produced unexpectedly high (106&#x00025;) promoter activity, probably indicating involvement of additional parameters <italic>in vivo</italic> not detected <italic>in vitro</italic> by EMSA, that are beyond simple PDX1&#x02013;DNA interactions. Conceivably, the presence of an intact A3 site may partially compensate for a sub-optimal binding site in the A1 location.</p><p>To confirm these results, we made a series of double mutations in the rat insulin I gene promoter with substitutions of both A1 and A3 sites by the TAAT elements from albumin and GLUT2 genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f4">4</xref>). Since the A3 and A4 sites are located very close to each other, we designed substitutions within A3 that involved only the 3 nt downstream of the TAAT site on the sense strand, thereby maintaining the wild-type A4 sequence. Simultaneous replacement of both A1 and A3 regions with the corresponding sequences from albumin and GLUT2 genes led to a further substantial reduction in promoter activity, as compared with single mutations, to 7 and 9&#x00025;, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f4">4</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that the TAAT core is not sufficient to bring about activation of the promoter, and that 3 bp adjacent to the core play an important role in determining target gene selection both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, since the TAAT motif from the GLUT2 promoter shows inefficient binding <italic>in vitro</italic> and functions relatively inefficiently <italic>in vivo</italic>, this promoter seems unlikely to serve as a direct target of PDX1 action.</p></sec><sec><title>SAAB analysis of PDX1 binding</title><p>In order to determine systematically the <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding specificity of PDX1, we used the SAAB procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c51">51</xref>). GST&#x02013;PDX1 fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione&#x02013;Sepharose beads. The DNA binding properties of this purified GST&#x02013;PDX1 were assessed by EMSA analysis. This recombinant protein specifically binds the A1 DNA, and is efficiently competed with unlabeled A1, but not E1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f5">5</xref>), indicating DNA binding properties similar to that of native PDX1. We used this purified GST&#x02013;PDX1 protein to select sequences possessing optimal TAAT flanking bases.</p><p>Comparison of the 30 sequences obtained after four rounds of site selection shows a strikingly non-random distribution of TAAT flanking bases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f6">6</xref>A) resembling natural PDX1 binding sites. The sequences fall into three different groups according to the number and relative position of the TAAT core (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f6">6</xref>A). The first group (seven clones, designated SAAB1) has consensus sequence (based on most frequently occurring nucleotides) ACC<bold>TAAT</bold>GAG, resembling (three out of six bases identical) the A1 site of insulin gene promoters (CCT<bold>TAAT</bold>GGG) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f6">6</xref>B). The largest group (17 clones, SAAB2) contains a palindromic double TAAT sequence (TAATTA) with consensus sequence A/CGC<bold>TAAT</bold>TAC. This sequence is closely similar (five out of six bases identical) to the insulin gene A3 consensus site (CTC<bold>TAAT</bold>TAC) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f6">6</xref>B). The third group (six clones) also contains a palindromic double TAAT site, but of opposite orientation, generating a CAT<bold>TAAT</bold>AGG consensus sequence that we did not observe in putative PDX1 target promoters analyzed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f6">6</xref>A). Thus, the majority of sequences selected by SAAB are related to natural PDX1 binding sites in the insulin gene promoters.</p><p>The SAAB approach is expected to select sequences of relatively high binding affinity. To validate the effectiveness of the SAAB procedure, we examined the properties of the SAAB1 consensus sequence. Natural TAAT flanks of the A1 probe were substituted with the corresponding bases from the single TAAT consensus sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f7">7</xref>A) and analyzed by competition EMSA. The relative PDX1 binding affinity of this construct (designated SAAB1) was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type A1 sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f7">7</xref>B), confirming that the SAAB procedure indeed selected high affinity binding sites.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have examined the DNA binding specificity of the key pancreatic transcription factor PDX1. Although the crucial role of PDX1 in pancreas development and beta cell gene expression is well established, the mechanism whereby it selectively activates genes and the identity of its target genes, particularly those activated during development, remain poorly understood. This is a reflection of our incomplete understanding of the actions of homeodomain proteins.</p><p>PDX1 contains a hexapeptide domain that permits dimerization with PBC proteins and binding to compound <italic>cis</italic> elements on the somatostatin and amylase promoters. However, since most pancreatic somatostatin- or amylase-producing cells do not express PDX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c52">52</xref>), the significance of the dimerization is not clear. Indeed it appears that binding sites for PDX1/PBC heterodimeric complexes are absent in several PDX1 target genes, e.g. the insulin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c26">26</xref>). Furthermore, PDX1 protein bearing a mutation in the hexapeptide motif was able to partly rescue the phenotype of PDX1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c28">28</xref>). Thus, for at least some of the <italic>in vivo</italic> actions of PDX1, it appears that promoter recognition is mediated without involvement of PBC co-factors, perhaps through DNA binding by a monomer of PDX1. A key question therefore surrounds the mechanisms whereby PDX1 is able to select target genes as monomers.</p><p>A considerable amount of evidence suggests that the insulin gene represents a direct target of PDX1, including recent chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showing that PDX1 is bound to the insulin gene promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c25">25</xref>). We therefore initially examined the ability of PDX1 to discriminate among <italic>cis</italic> elements located in the insulin gene promoter, a well-characterized promoter which has been shown previously to contain two <italic>cis</italic> elements (A1 and A3/4) that are efficiently recognized <italic>in vitro</italic> by PDX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c26">26</xref>). Using a competition EMSA procedure, we showed that the A1 and A3 sequences were recognized with similar efficiency by PDX1. On the other hand, the A4 region was apparently not required for efficient binding. The A4 region has been shown previously to represent a binding site for the transcription factor HNF1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c53">53</xref>). Interestingly, only in the rat insulin I gene does the A4 region contain a TAAT core: this region is not conserved in other characterized insulin gene promoters (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh156f2">2</xref>). Thus, A4 is unlikely to represent a physiologically relevant PDX1 target site. The data do indicate however, that the evolutionarily conserved A3 and A1 regions are the key determinants of PDX1 binding within the promoter. Furthermore, the differences between A1 and A3 on the one hand, and A4 on the other, indicate the likely contribution of additional nucleotides flanking the TAAT core in determining the efficiency of PDX1 binding. In the case of A1 and A3, there is significant conservation of at least 3 nt on either side of the TAAT motif.</p><p>PDX1 represents one of the few homeodomain proteins, for which several multiple well-characterized promoters have been identified as potential direct targets. This enabled us to correlate DNA binding preferences of PDX1 to the occurrence of particular bases flanking the TAAT core site in the native target sequences. To our knowledge, this represents the first time such an analysis has been performed for a homeodomain protein. We observed a strikingly non-random organization of bases flanking the TAAT core. Utilizing the quantitative EMSA assay, we were able to show that these binding sites could be classified into several groups based on their relative binding affinities. Thus, the IAPP and pancreatic glucokinase sites bind relatively efficiently, though at significantly lower affinity than the insulin A1 and A3/4 sites. In contrast, the GLUT2 site exhibits lower binding affinity, similar to that shown by a site contained within the albumin promoter, a gene expressed selectively in liver cells, and therefore not a PDX1 target gene. These analyses clearly indicate that the PDX1 protein possesses the ability to discriminate <italic>in vitro</italic> between potential binding sites based on the nucleotides flanking the TAAT core.</p><p>To examine systematically the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding preference of PDX1, we utilized the SAAB procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c51">51</xref>) with oligonucleotides degenerate at the 3 nt upstream and downstream of the TAAT core. The selected sequences fell into three groups showing a non-random distribution of nucleotides flanking the TAAT core. Two of the groups bear a similarity to natural TAAT binding sites, particularly the A1 and A3 regions of the insulin gene promoter. To verify the ability of the SAAB-selected sequences to efficiently bind DNA, we used EMSA analysis. Indeed the SAAB1 sequence showed DNA binding affinity indistinguishable from A1. These results confirm that efficient PDX1 binding to DNA involves sequences flanking the TAAT core, and that the A1 and A3 sites of the insulin gene promoter correspond to preferred binding sites. Thus, DNA recognition by PDX1 seems to involve at least two different mechanisms. When the TGATTAAT sequence is available, e.g. in the somatostatin promoter, PDX1 can bind as a heterodimer with a PBC family co-factor. Alternatively, PDX1 binds as a monomer to TAAT sequences different from TGATTAAT, with affinities according to the flanking bases as described in this study.</p><p>Previous studies have examined systematically the DNA binding preference of homeodomain proteins, and have observed a variable degree of sequence specificity in bases flanking the TAAT core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c55">55</xref>). Homeodomain proteins possessing a glutamine at residue 50 of the homeodomain, preferentially recognize the sequence TAAT G/T G/T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c47">47</xref>). The significance of flanking bases <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been examined in detail previously. Utilizing the well defined beta cell transcriptional activity of the insulin gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c56">56</xref>), we examined the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of the sequence variability surrounding the TAAT core. Indeed the observed <italic>in vivo</italic> activity showed a strong correlation with the ability of PDX1 to bind these TAAT elements <italic>in vitro</italic>. These data indicate that PDX1 is able to discriminate among TAAT elements both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by virtue of the flanking nucleotides. Thus, the intrinsic DNA binding ability of monomer homeodomain proteins may play a more important role than suspected previously in determining the spectrum of target genes.</p><p>GLUT2 is an isoform of a membrane glucose transporter that is predominantly expressed in liver and pancreatic beta cells, and has been proposed to comprise part of the glucose-sensing mechanism of the beta cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c57">57</xref>). Yet the role of PDX1 in regulating GLUT2 gene expression is not clear. On the one hand, it has been shown that PDX1 expression activates the GLUT2 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c58">58</xref>). On the other hand, transgenic mice expressing dominant negative FGFR1 show strongly reduced GLUT2, but essentially no effect on PDX1 expression, consistent with a model whereby PDX1 activates GLUT2 indirectly, through FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c59">59</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies support this idea, since PDX1 apparently does not bind to the GLUT2 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c24">24</xref>). Our data indicate that this may be the result of an intrinsically low efficiency of binding to the TAAT element of the GLUT2 gene, rather than chromatin accessibility effects.</p><p>The molecular basis for the extended sequence recogni tion by PDX1 is not clear. A substantial number of three-dimensional structures of homeodomain&#x02013;DNA complexes have been elucidated by X-ray crystallography and NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c4">4</xref>). These reveal a conserved protein&#x02013;DNA interface, in which sequence-specific DNA protein interactions are mediated principally by residues located in the so-called &#x02018;recognition helix&#x02019;, the highly conserved third alpha helix of the homeodomain. These contacts involve primarily the TAAT core and 2&#x02013;3 nt 3&#x02032; terminal to the core. The structures reveal little or no sequence-specific interaction with nucleotides 5&#x02032; from the core. Since evolutionary comparisons and the SAAB analysis clearly indicate a significant role for at least 3 nt at the 5&#x02032; side, previously unrecognized mechanisms must be involved. These may include additional protein&#x02013;DNA interactions, perhaps mediated by amino acids outside the homeodomain, or through interactions involving indirect readout of the DNA sequence, or a possible involvement of heterodimeric DNA binding complexes with an as yet unidentified partner protein. Detailed structure&#x02013;function analysis of the binding sites will be required to better define these issues.</p><p>Previous studies of homeodomain&#x02013;DNA interaction have tended to focus on <italic>in vitro</italic> binding properties of homeodomain proteins, or the homeodomain itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh156c6">6</xref>). The approach we have used differs from these in that we have also examined the functional significance of homeodomain binding sequences in the context of a native full-length promoter of a bona fide PDX1 target gene. Thus, we have been able to demonstrate that reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> binding to particular TAAT elements correlates with substantially reduced biological activity, and thereby pinpoints DNA binding specificity of PDX1 as an important factor in determining the spectrum of target genes. As additional target genes of other homeodomain proteins are identified, it will be possible to apply this type of analysis to better understand the process of selective gene regulation by these homeodomain proteins also.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh156f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Competition EMSA analysis using the rat insulin I A3/4 probe.
