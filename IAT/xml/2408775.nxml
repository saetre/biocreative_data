Corneal epithelial cell migration and proliferation, keratocyte apoptosis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and transdifferentiation of keratocyte to fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are involved in corneal wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. These processes are largely regulated by the cytokines and growth factors through the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways including those involving mitogen-activated proteins (MAP) kinases, Janus kinases (JAKs), and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Recently, a family of inhibitory molecules called the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. These proteins have highly divergent amino termini, a central Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a conserved COOH-terminal region known as the SOCS box. Cytokines rapidly induce SOCS expression, and SOCS proteins in turn regulate cytokine signal transduction and STAT activation negatively either through inhibition of JAK kinases or by direct binding to signaling chains in the receptor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Mutational analysis of SOCS1 has established that both the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus and SH2 domain are essential for blocking JAK activity and cytokine signaling, but the COOH-terminal SOCS-box region is not required. Furthermore, the SH2 domain is necessary but not sufficient to inhibit JAK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Another SOCS protein, SOCS3, can be induced by many cytokines and growth factors such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL3, leptin, and insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. The expression of SOCS3 is rapidly induced in T cells in response to IL2 and can strongly inhibit IL2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Unlike other SOCS proteins, SOCS3 is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated after IL2 stimulation, although the importance of this phosphorylation is still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Although SOCS proteins inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, their function in the modulation of other signaling pathways is unknown. Recently, SOCS gene expression has been shown to be induced by many cytokines and growth factors including the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Gene microarray analysis of PDGF-stimulated human corneal fibroblasts showed a significant increase in SOCS3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p><p>Cytokines and chemokines also regulate immune response by regulating proliferation and migration of inflammatory and other cells to help in the process of wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. A proinflammatory cytokine, IL8, is produced by epithelial and fibroblast cells and plays an important role in inflammation and wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. IL8 has a capacity to recruit T-cells as well as nonspecific inflammatory cells into sites of inflammation by activating neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. IL8 has been shown to stimulate &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin production in human fibroblasts when applied to the excision wounds in chickens and causes the wounds to contract and close more rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, IL8 is chemotactic for fibroblasts and accelerates their migration and can stimulate deposition of tenascin, fibronectin, and collagen I during wound healing in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Both human corneal keratocytes and epithelial cells have been shown to synthesize and release IL8 following cytokine stimulation and/or infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>].</p><p>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a known modulator of fibroblast cell mitosis and chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Earlier, we have demonstrated the expression of PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, and PDGF-AB and their receptors in the human cornea and their role in proliferation and chemotaxis using cultured human corneal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Out of the three tested isoforms, PDGF-BB demonstrated a significantly higher chemotactic effect compared to PDGF-AA or PDGF-AB in human corneal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, PDGF-AA showed strongest chemotactic response in rabbit corneal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Because of the chemotactic role of PDGF in corneal wound healing, we hypothesized that PDGF regulates the neutrophil chemoattractant, IL8. IL8 is known to enhance corneal wound healing by chemoattracting leukocytes and fibroblasts into the wound site rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. We anticipated PDGF-mediated SOCS3 overexpression as a mechanism to regulate corneal inflammation and hypothesized that PDGF regulates IL8 chemokine secretion to promote cell migration and aids in other processes of wound repair and healing. The intracellular signaling mechanisms of PDGF-induced fibroblast migration, proliferation, and corneal wound healing are poorly understood. Jester et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>] reported that PDGF has a synergistic effect on TGF&#x003b2;-induced transformation of rabbit corneal keratocytes to myofibroblasts and proposed that PDGF is an important mediator of wound healing. A recent report on skin fibroblasts suggests that STAT3 is involved in PDGF-driven cell migration, and this process is negatively regulated by SOCS3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. A significant increase in SOCS3 transcript levels by PDGF in human corneal fibroblasts noted on gene array analysis together with our previous investigations with PDGF prompted us to hypothesize that PDGF-mediated cellular proliferation and migration in cornea involve JAK/STAT pathway under negative feedback regulation by SOCS3. Using cultured human corneal fibroblasts, we showed that PDGF-induced cellular proliferation and migration involves JAK2-STAT3 pathway under the regulation of SOCS3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Donor human corneas were procured from the Hartland Eye Banks (St. Louis, MO). Primary human corneal fibroblasts (HSF) were generated from donor human corneas using a method described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. Briefly, the cornea was washed with an HSF medium, and the epithelium and endothelium were removed by gentle scraping with a scalpel blade. The corneal stroma was cut into small pieces and incubated in humidified CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum to obtain HSF. Seventy percent confluent cultures of HSF (passages 1&#x02013;3) were used for experiments. To investigate the effect of PDGF, a mixture of PDGF containing equal amounts of PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, and PDGF-BB was used for all experiments. Cultures were exposed to the mixture of PDGF (AA, AB, and BB) at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml for 1 h or 8 h. The JAK-STAT inhibitor, AG-490, was used at 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M final concentration for the indicated time to inhibit downstream signaling. For all the experiments, cultures were serum-starved for 24 h before being exposed to the cytokine and/or the inhibitor. The cytokines were bought from R&#x00026;D System (Minneapolis, MN), and the AG-490 inhibitor was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Total RNA from the cells was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and was reverse transcribed to cDNA (Promega, Madison, WI) following the vendor&#x02019;s instructions using the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription kit. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using the iQ5 real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Fifty microliters of a reaction mixture containing 2 &#x000b5;l cDNA (250 ng), 2 &#x000b5;l forward primer (5&#x02032;-TGG CGA AGG AAA TGG TCA CA-3&#x02032;; 200 nM), 2 &#x000b5;l reverse primer (5&#x02032;-GGT GAC TGT CCC GGA GGA GA-3&#x02032;; 200 nM), and 25 &#x000b5;l 2X iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was run at universal cycle (95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30 s followed by 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 60 s) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The &#x003b2;-actin forward primer (5&#x02032;-CGG CTA CAG CTT CAC CAC CA-3&#x02032;) and reverse primer (5&#x02032;-CGG GCA GCT CGT AGC TCT TC-3&#x02032;) were used as a housekeeping gene. The threshold cycle (Ct) was used to detect the increase in the signal associated with an exponential growth of PCR product during the log-linear phase. The relative expression was calculated using the following formula, 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup>. The &#x00394;Ct validation experiments showed similar amplification efficiency for all templates used (the difference between linear slopes for all templates is less than 0.1). Three independent experiments were performed and the average (&#x000b1;SEM; standard error of the mean) results are presented in graphic form.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting</title><p>Cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS and lysed directly on plates using M-PER protein lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce Biotech, Rockford, IL). To immunoprecipitate SOCS3, we used 1000 &#x000b5;g/ml of total corneal fibroblast protein extracts and incubated them with 50 &#x000b5;l of protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 3 h at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. After preclearing, 5 &#x000b5;l of 1&#x000a0;mg/ml SOCS3 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was added to each treatment group and 5 &#x000b5;l of pre-immune serum served as the negative control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. Protein A/G agarose beads (50 &#x000b5;l) were added to each tube after 1 h followed by overnight incubation at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

At end-time points, supernatants were collected from three independent experiments and IL8 levels were measured using solid-phase amplified sensitivity immunoassay as specified by the manufacturer (ELISA system, BioSource Europe S.A, Nivelles, Belgium). Standards and cytokine controls were included. The plates were read at 450 nm on a 96-well microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using SOFT-MAX-Pro software (Molecular Devices). The mean blank reading was subtracted from each sample and control reading.

The assay utilizes a tetrazolium compound, MTT (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), that is bio-reduced by viable cells to a purple colored formazan product (proportional to the number of viable cells), which can be detected by measuring its absorbance at 570 nm. Using a 96 well plate, 2x10<sup>3</sup> cells were plated in each well in 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of DMEM, and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of MTT reagent was added to each well.

However, the underlying mechanism through which PDGF acts in the cornea is largely unknown. PDGF, upon binding to the receptors, can activate numerous signaling pathways including the tyrosine kinases from JAK and transcription factors from the family of STAT proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. Binding to tyrosine kinase family receptors leads to dimerization, auto phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, and recruitment of a variety of Src-homology 2 domains containing intracellular proteins, which activate downstream pathways such as mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase, JAK/STAT, and PI3 kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. Multiple reports showed that STAT signals are under stringent regulation by a family of endogenous negative feedback regulators generically called SOCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. SOCS proteins bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors and non-receptor tyrosine kinases and prevent recruitment of STATs to the activated receptor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]</p><p>Although the role of PDGF in corneal fibroblast proliferation and migration has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], it is unknown whether effects of PDGF in the cornea are mediated through the activation of JAK2-STAT3 pathways and whether its activity in this ocular tissue is regulated by SOCS. Moreover, both PDGF and IL8 are chemoattractant and contribute in corneal wound healing, but the role of PDGF in IL8-mediated chemotaxis is not described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. This is a first report to demonstrate that PDGF induces IL8 chemokine secretion in human corneal fibroblasts. The induction of IL8 facilitates an early innate immune response to infection in the corneal stroma and represents an elementary defense mechanism in corneal wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. IL8 enhances healing by rapidly chemoattracting leukocytes and fibroblasts into the wound site, stimulating the latter to differentiate into myofibroblasts. In turn, myofibroblasts are critical for wound contraction and closure and for the production of extracellular matrix molecules, which leads to precocious development of granulation tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. Our data suggest that PDGF-mediated IL8 chemokine secretion and cell growth and migration in corneal fibroblasts occur via JAK2-STAT3 pathway. We observed that the JAK2-STAT3 inhibitor (AG-490) inhibits PDGF functional activity in human corneal fibroblasts. A high (100 &#x000b5;M) concentration of AG-490 did not completely block the PDGF functional activity, suggesting the possibility of additional regulators in PDGF-induced cell proliferation, migration, and IL8 secretion. The role of signaling pathways like Ras-ERK, Akt, and PIP3-PKC in PDGF-mediated cell proliferation and migration has been shown earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>]. We observed that PDGF induces both STAT3 and SOCS3 expression and that the JAK2-STAT3 inhibitor suppresses SOCS3 expression in human corneal fibroblasts. This observation suggests that PDGF activity in the cornea may be under the negative feedback regulation of SOCS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="f6" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Schematic of PDGF-mediated corneal wound healing. PDGF secreted at the site of the corneal wound induces its receptors on the corneal fibroblast that induces JAK2 followed by STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. STAT3 induces the transcription of genes involved in cell growth, migration, and IL8 chemokine secretion resulting in the initiation of corneal wound healing. SOCS3 serves as an endogenous regulator of JAK2-STAT3 inhibition as seen with the chemical inhibitor, AG-490, in vitro.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mv-v14-1020-f6"/></fig><p>We have previously shown the role of STAT1 in keratocyte apoptosis that occurs in response to corneal epithelial injury using STAT1 null mice and proposed that STAT1 could be a therapeutic target for transient inhibition of keratocyte apoptosis to modulate corneal wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. Our gene array study showed time-dependent regulation of SOCS3 in human corneal fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF. Our study results suggest that SOCS3 has a role in PDGF-mediated wound healing in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Nagai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>] demonstrated the role of STAT3 and SOCS3 in skin fibroblast cell migration. These authors noted nearly complete inhibition of PDGF-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and over 50% decrease in cell migration in the skin fibroblasts that were overexpressing SOCS3. Using the transgenic animal approach, Akira and his coworkers reported that STAT3 modulates numerous biological activities including apoptosis, cell growth, and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. We report that PDGF-mediated cell growth and migration in human corneal fibroblast involves STAT3-SOCS3.</p><p>IL8 gene transcription is induced by various proinflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide, IL1&#x003b2; and tumor necrosis factor&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. The half-life of IL8 mRNA in human corneal fibroblast has been reported to be less than 1.5 h while neuropeptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P have been shown to enhance its half-life by increasing its mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>]. Proinflammatory stimuli are considered to be a major regulator of IL8 steady-state levels in response to injury. IL8 has been shown to be involved in many of the wound healing processes. It not only serves as a chemotactic factor for leukocytes and fibroblasts but also stimulates fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and promotes angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. More studies are required to investigate other components modulated by the IL8 in corneal wound healing. Based on the involvement of JAK2-STAT3 pathway in PDGF-mediated corneal wound healing, we predict that PDGF-induced IL8 chemokine secretion could be one of the mechanisms that might be a critical mediator of wound healing in the cornea.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates the mechanism of PDGF-mediated corneal wound healing in vitro. The PDGF induces the proliferation, migration, and IL8 chemokine secretion in human corneal fibroblasts in part through the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Additionally, we observed that PDGF induces the expression of SOCS3 as a potential mechanism to negatively regulate inflammatory signaling during corneal wound healing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the RO1EY17294 (R.R.M.) grant from the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, R03NS059831 (M.M.T.) grant from the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, and by an unrestricted grant from the Research to Prevent Blindness, New York, NY.
