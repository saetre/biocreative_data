Here, we show that hypothalamic signals contribute to the regulation of bone mass in a manner consistent with the central perception of energy status. Mice lacking neuropeptide Y (NPY), a well-known orexigenic factor whose hypothalamic expression is increased in fasting, have significantly increased bone mass in association with enhanced osteoblast activity and elevated expression of bone osteogenic transcription factors, Runx2 and Osterix. In contrast, wild type and NPY knockout (<italic>NPY <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) mice in which NPY is specifically over expressed in the hypothalamus (AAV-NPY&#x0002b;) show a significant reduction in bone mass despite developing an obese phenotype. The AAV-NPY&#x0002b; induced loss of bone mass is consistent with models known to mimic the central effects of fasting, which also show increased hypothalamic NPY levels. Thus these data indicate that, in addition to well characterized responses to body mass, skeletal tissue also responds to the perception of nutritional status by the hypothalamus independently of body weight. In addition, the reduction in bone mass by AAV NPY&#x0002b; administration does not completely correct the high bone mass phenotype of <italic>NPY <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, indicating the possibility that peripheral NPY may also be an important regulator of bone mass. Indeed, we demonstrate the expression of NPY specifically in osteoblasts. In conclusion, these data identifies NPY as a critical integrator of bone homeostatic signals; increasing bone mass during times of obesity when hypothalamic NPY expression levels are low and reducing bone formation to conserve energy under &#x02018;starving&#x02019; conditions, when hypothalamic NPY expression levels are high.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone remodelling has traditionally been viewed as an endocrine- and paracrine-regulated process. This view is rapidly changing, however, with growing evidence demonstrating that neuronal factors are critical for normal bone homeostasis. Moreover, efferent neural pathways from the hypothalamus potently modify the activity of bone cells. Studies in leptin-deficient (<italic>ob/ob</italic>) mice revealed that the adipokine leptin, in addition to its actions as an important circulating indicator of the level of adiposity, also modulates bone formation through activation of central, hypothalamic relays via efferent sympathetic nervous output which directly modulates osteoblast activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Moore1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Takeda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. A major target of leptin in the hypothalamus is the neuropeptide Y (NPY) system, one of the most prominent regulators of appetite and energy homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Stanley1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, these Y-receptors have also been reported to be critical in the regulation of bone homeostasis with the specific deletion of the Y2-receptor in the hypothalamus resulting in a bone anabolic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Baldock1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>However, the actions of the NPY system in bone are more complex than a simple downstream mediator for leptin. Specifically, Y2-mediated changes occur consistently throughout the skeleton in these mice, while alterations in leptin levels induce opposing effects on cortical and cancellous bone, as evident in studies involving Y2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;<italic>ob/ob</italic> double mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Baldock3">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although NPY is the predominant ligand in the central nervous system, Y receptors can also be activated by the two other family members, peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP).

A generalized bone anabolic response resulting from loss of NPY signaling was evident throughout the skeleton, including cortical and cancellous bone as well as axial and appendicular sites. In contrast, NPY over expression in the hypothalamus resulted in an inhibition of bone formation. This central action is consistent with signaling via Y2 receptors expressed on neurons of the arcuate nucleus, as is evidenced by the opposing response reported following specific deletion of Y2 receptors from this region of the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Baldock1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus NPY acts in the hypothalamus to tonically inhibit bone formation, and likely does so through signals transduced by Y2 receptors.</p><p>Results from this study suggest that in addition to the well defined actions of loading from body weight on bone mass, the central &#x02018;perception&#x02019; of energy status may have an important influence on bone mass. This is particularly evident in rAAV-NPY&#x0002b; injected mice. The viral promoter controlling NPY production prevents the normal feedback by signals such as increased serum leptin from inhibiting hypothalamic NPY expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Ducy1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Sipols1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result, the &#x0201c;starvation&#x0201d; signal is not attenuated and body weight continues to increase. Importantly, despite the marked increase in body weight caused by this experimental condition, a decrease in bone mass occurred. While the decrease in bone formation in these mice may in part also result from reduced physical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Heilig1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and thereby altered weight bearing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Sample1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, this result is also consistent with a skeletal response to the starvation signal induced by AAV NPY&#x0002b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Hamrick1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus the central perception of body weight may be important to the regulation of bone mass, in addition to the actual mechanical forces in the bone tissue itself. In this manner, during weight loss, increasing NPY ensures calories are not wasted on the production/maintenance of unneeded skeletal tissue, thereby also increasing the supply of minerals and nutrients stored in skeletal tissue for other vital processes. Conversely, during periods of high nutrient intake and resultant weight gain, reduction in NPY expression ensures sufficient bone formation to guarantee mechanical competence of the skeleton during the period of increased weight bearing. Importantly, we showed here that reduced NPY levels in NPY knockout mice are not associated with significant changes in activity levels, indicating the skeletal response to NPY are not activity-dependent. NPY is therefore ideally placed to match bone mass to body weight, a major regulatory influence on bone homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Reid2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008415-g006">Figure 6b</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0008415-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008415.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the co-ordinate regulation of body weight and bone by NPY.</title><p>(a) Altered energy homeostatic demand regulates hypothalamic NPY production, which signals via arcuate Y2 receptors through efferent sympathetic relays to the osteoblast.

(b) NPY exhibits an inverse relationship with both energy homeostasis and bone mass. As body weight increases as a result of positive energy homeostasis, the decrease in NPY signaling stimulates the production of bone to match body weight to bone mass. Likewise, negative energy homeostasis, and the coincident reduction of body weight is accompanied by increased NPY, which inhibits the production of bone, thereby conserving energy and increasing the mobilization of nutrient stores form bone.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0008415.g006"/></fig><p>Central circuits alone, however, do not appear to explain the entire NPY-mediated signaling pathway to bone, as restoration of hypothalamic NPY expression in <italic>NPY <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice failed to completely normalize osteoblast activity. This incomplete rescue of the <italic>NPY <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> phenotype by central NPY replacement indicates a potential role for non-hypothalamic NPY pathways. This finding is consistent with a Y1 receptor-mediated action in the periphery, since hypothalamus-specific deletion of Y1 receptors did not replicate the greater bone formation evident in germline <italic>Y1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Baldock4">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, in terms of NPY's coordination of body weigh and bone mass, NPY expression has been identified in both osteoblasts and osteocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Baldock4">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Igwe1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, this expression was reduced following exposure of cultured osteoblasts to fluid sheer stress, indicating the potential for a local, load-responsive regulation of NPY. In this manner, increasing load would decrease NPY expression, thereby reducing the tonic repression of osteoblast activity as body weight increased. Thus central efferent signals may provide a systemic regulatory influence, via Y2 receptor action in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, whilst osteoblastic Y1 receptor action may enable local fine-tuning of the systemic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008415-g006">Figure 6a</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data highlight the critical role of NPY in the co-ordinated regulation of skeletal tissue. We propose that in situations where hypothalamic NPY expression is decreased, as in short-term overfeeding in which serum leptin levels rise and in turn reduces central NPY signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Ducy1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Sipols1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, bone formation is stimulated as was the case in <italic>NPY <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. Moreover, when central NPY levels are elevated as in negative energy balance, bone formation is inhibited as was the case in rAAV-NPY&#x0002b; injected mice. While hypothalamic NPY is ideally placed to modify bone mass to match changes in body weight induced by altered energy homeostasis, NPY produced in bone itself may play an important role in the regulation of bone mass. This later circuit offers also an attractive target to modulate and opens the possibility to increase bone mass without affecting central NPY controlled pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of NPY <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Mice</title><p>The generation of the <italic>NPY <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008415-Karl1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.
