These findings suggest a hypothesis that, with the exception of vertebrates, aquatic life supports selenium utilization, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element due to an unknown environmental factor.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Selenium is an essential trace element in many, but not all, life forms. Its essentiality is based on the fact that this element is present in natural proteins in the form of selenocysteine (Sec), a rare amino acid that chemically differs from serine or cysteine (Cys) by a single atom (for example, Se instead of O or S) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Sec is known as the 21st amino acid in the genetic code as it has its own biosynthetic machinery, a tRNA and an elongation factor, and is inserted into nascent polypeptides co-translationally in response to the Sec codon, UGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Selenoproteins often escape attention of genome annotators, because in-frame UGA codons are interpreted as stop signals. However, several bioinformatics tools have recently been developed that help identify these genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The use of these methods begins to shed light on proteins and processes dependent on selenium, as well as on the occurrence and distribution of these processes in various life forms.</p><p>Sec is typically found in active sites of redox enzymes, which are functionally similar to thiol-based oxidoreductases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Sec-containing proteins occur in all major lines of descent (for example, eukaryota, eubacteria and archaea), but not all organisms have these proteins. Prokaryotic genomes have been extensively analyzed for the occurrence of selenoprotein genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], but among eukaryotes, only the genomes of mammals (human, mouse) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], nematodes (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>and <italic>C. briggzae</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], green alga (<italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and Plasmodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have been analyzed with regard to the entire set of selenoproteins (selenoproteomes). In addition, the genomes of the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>and the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>have been scanned for the occurrence of selenoprotein genes and Sec biosynthetic/insertion machinery genes and found to have neither [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Selenoproteome analyses also revealed that various organisms have substantially different sets of selenoproteins. One example of uneven selenoprotein occurrence is selenoprotein U (SelU), which occurs in fish, birds and some unicellular eukaryotes, but is present in the form of a Cys-containing homolog in mammals and many other eukaryotes. Even a narrower occurrence has been described for SelJ and Fep15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we characterized the selenoproteomes encoded in several completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Detailed analyses of these selenoproteomes and comparison with those of other eukaryotic model organisms revealed an ancient origin of most eukaryotic selenoproteins and a possibility of increased Sec utilization in aquatic environments and decreased use of Sec in terrestrial habitats. These studies provide important insights into selenoprotein origin and dynamics of selenoprotein evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Eukaryotic selenoproteomes</title><p>Several eukaryotes have been previously analyzed for their selenoprotein content (selenoproteomes). These studies identified 24-25 selenoproteins in mammals and 0-4 selenoproteins in other organisms. It is generally thought that many eukaryotic selenoproteins evolved in vertebrates, but evolutionary paths have not been examined for the majority of these proteins. In this work, we analyzed the selenoproteomes of several additional model eukaryotes, whose genomes have been completed. These included marine algae (<italic>Ostreococcus tauri </italic>and <italic>O. lucimarinus</italic>), a diatom (<italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic>), a soil amoeba (<italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>), an insect (<italic>Drosophila pseudoobscura</italic>), and a red alga (<italic>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</italic>).</p><sec><title>Drosophila pseudoobscura</title><p>The <italic>D. pseudoobscura </italic>subgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] is found mainly in the temperate and tropical zones of the New World [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Application of an earlier version of SECISearch to the <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>genome identified three selenoprotein genes (SelK/G-rich, SelH/BthD and SPS2); however, it was not known whether this set represents the entire <italic>Drosophila </italic>selenoproteome. We applied an advanced version of SECISearch (see Materials and methods and Additional data file 1) to analyze the <italic>D. pseudoobscura </italic>genome and, in addition, analyzed <italic>D. pseudoobscura </italic>and <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>genomes in parallel to identify evolutionarily conserved selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements using relaxed SECIS criteria. These searches resulted in the same, already known set of three selenoproteins (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting that the selenoproteome of insects of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>genus consists of these three proteins. By homology analyses, we then identified three selenoproteins in a mosquito, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, and one in a honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Identification of selenoprotein genes in eukaryotic model organisms</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center" colspan="2">Loose pattern</td><td align="center" colspan="2">Default pattern</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Organism name</td><td align="center">Genome, thousands of bp</td><td align="center">Primary sequence criteria</td><td align="center">Energy criteria</td><td align="center">Primary sequence criteria</td><td align="center">Energy criteria</td><td align="center">Number of selenoproteins</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>O. lucimarinus</italic></td><td align="center">13,393</td><td align="center">31,132</td><td align="center">7,541</td><td align="center">2,120</td><td align="center">464</td><td align="center">29</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>O. tauri</italic></td><td align="center">16,414</td><td align="center">30,381</td><td align="center">7,379</td><td align="center">1,934</td><td align="center">401</td><td align="center">26</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>T. pseudonana</italic></td><td align="center">32,577</td><td align="center">81,040</td><td align="center">8,977</td><td align="center">3,129</td><td align="center">675</td><td align="center">16</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>D. discoideum</italic></td><td align="center">34,564</td><td align="center">37,435</td><td align="center">7,11</td><td align="center">2,128</td><td align="center">37</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic></td><td align="center">138,581</td><td align="center">181,793</td><td align="center">20,702</td><td align="center">6,303</td><td align="center">1,010</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>C. merolae</italic></td><td align="center">16,381</td><td align="center">27,578</td><td align="center">5,987</td><td align="center">651</td><td align="center">149</td><td align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Ostreococcus tauri</title><p><italic>O. tauri </italic>is a unicellular green alga that was discovered in the Mediterranean Thau lagoon in 1994. It belongs to the family Prasinophyceae, which is thought to be the most primitive in the green plant lineage from which all other green algae and ancestors of land plants have descended. This organism has a very small genome, 11.5 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], especially when compared to other sequenced Plantae genomes (for example, the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome is 125 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and that of <italic>Chlamydomonas </italic>exceeds 100 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). The <italic>O. tauri </italic>genome is densely packed and provides a useful genomic model for green plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Previous research revealed the lack of selenoproteins in land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], whereas 10 selenoproteins were detected in the green alga <italic>C. reinhardtii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Surprisingly, we detected 26 selenoprotein genes in <italic>O. tauri</italic>.</p><p>Among the known selenoproteins detected in <italic>O. tauri</italic>, fourteen were homologs of human selenoproteins (thioredoxin reductase (TR), SelT, SelM, SelK, SelS, Sep15, SelO, SelH, SelW and five glutathione peroxidase (GPx) homologs), five were homologs of eukaryotic selenoproteins with restricted distribution (MsrA, SelU and three PDI homologs) and three were homologs of bacterial selenoproteins (methyltransferase, thioredoxin-fold protein and peroxiredoxin). We also identified four novel eukaryotic selenoproteins in the <italic>O. tauri </italic>genome. These included a predicted membrane selenoprotein (MSP) and three hypothetical proteins of unknown function. In addition, several excellent SECIS element candidates were identified during analysis, but at present no suitable open reading frames (ORFs) could be identified upstream of these structures, in part because of the inadequate length of contigs. Therefore, the total number of <italic>Ostreococcus </italic>selenoproteins might be even higher than 26.</p><p>Of interest was the observation that all <italic>O. tauri </italic>SECIS elements except one had a conserved G in the position directly preceding the quartet of non-Watson-Crick interacting nucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

None of the selenoproteins matched the overall Sec trait (compared to the occurrence of Sec machinery). SelK was among the most widespread selenoproteins. This protein of unknown function is present in nearly all eukaryotes that utilize Sec (but is replaced with a Cys-containing homolog in nematodes and several other organisms). An additional widespread selenoprotein was SelW, which also occurs in most (but not all) selenoprotein-containing eukaryotes. Several other selenoproteins, such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, also had a wide distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Origin of many selenoproteins precedes animal evolution</title><p>Since mammalian selenoproteomes were large and included essentially all known eukaryotic selenoproteins, they were initially thought to represent the entire eukaryotic selenoproteome. Subsequent identification of selenoproteins with highly restricted occurrence added further complexity, but did not challenge the overall idea of recent evolution of the majority of eukaryotic selenoproteins. However, our analysis of selenoproteomes of six eukaryotic model organisms and their comparison with the previously characterized selenoproteomes revealed that 20 of the 25 human selenoproteins have Sec-containing homologs in many unicellular organisms. Similarly, taking into account protein families, at least 11 of the 16 mammalian selenoprotein families could be traced back to single-cell eukaryotes. SelU, which is not a selenoprotein in mammals, is present in some animals and protozoa and may be viewed as an additional ancient selenoprotein family. Overall, these data suggest that the origin of many selenoproteins not only precedes animal evolution, but can be dated back to the ancestral eukaryotes. Thus, many of these original selenoproteins were preserved during evolution and remain in vertebrates (including mammals), green algae and a variety of protists, whereas many other organisms manifested massive selenoprotein losses.</p><p>It should be noted that Cys/Sec replacement is not always unidirectional and that prior evolutionary analyses suggest that both a Sec loss and gain is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, the probability of independent parallel Sec gain, as well as consecutive homoplastic Sec-to-Cys and Cys-to-Sec substitutions in a single protein position, is extremely rare, and no selenoprotein families are known that evolved more than once. Two factors are required for a Cys-to-Sec change to take place. First, the presence of Sec insertion machinery, such as Sec tRNA, SECIS-binding protein SBP2, Sec-specific elongation factor and Sec synthase. This requirement is met (for example, all components of the machinery are present) if at least one other selenoprotein is present in the same organism. Second, a SECIS element should evolve in the 3'-untranslated region. While only a single nucleotide change is sufficient to change the codon from Cys to Sec (that is, UGA instead of UGC or UGU), evolution of new SECIS elements is difficult. On the other hand, once Sec is replaced with Cys, the presence of the SECIS element provides no competitive advantage and this structure is quickly lost. Unless the reverse Cys-to-Sec mutation takes place before disruption of the SECIS element, the probability of restoring Sec is extremely low. Unless strong pressure exists to preserve Sec, its functional replacement with Cys may be expected. Combined, these factors allow us to assume that the character-state Sec follows Dollo's behavior.</p></sec><sec><title>Selenoproteins with restricted occurrence are common to organisms with large selenoproteomes</title><p>In addition to the many ancient eukaryotic selenoproteins, several selenoproteins have a more narrow distribution. For example, SelP, SelN, MsrB and SelI appear to be specific to animals, whereas MSP, peroxiredoxin and thioredoxin-like protein could be detected only in unicellular eukaryotes. These observations suggest an emerging picture of selenoprotein evolution wherein core selenoprotein families evolved first, followed by the origin of additional selenoproteins in more narrow groups of organisms. The new selenoproteins further increased the size of the selenoproteomes and remain prevalent in organisms with large selenoproteomes. In our current analysis, several <italic>Ostreococcus </italic>and <italic>Thalassiosira </italic>selenoproteins fit this pattern, in addition to the rare selenoproteins previously discovered (for example, SelU, SelJ and Fep15). However, it could not be excluded that new selenoproteins might also occasionally evolve in organisms with small selenoproteomes (for example, red algae).</p></sec><sec><title>Independent events of massive selenoprotein loss in eukaryotes</title><p>We further identified and examined several groups of organisms characterized by massive selenoprotein loss. Location of these organisms on the eukaryotic tree of life suggests independent events of selenoprotein loss (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). Five examples of selenoprotein loss are discussed below.</p><sec><title>Plants</title><p>As discussed above, <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>O. sativa </italic>and other higher plants lost both selenoproteins and Sec insertion machinery, whereas these genes were preserved in green algae, for example, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>Volvox </italic>and <italic>Ostreococcus</italic>. An early Streptophyte, <italic>M. viride</italic>, has both Sec machinery and selenoproteins. Thus, there was a specific selenoprotein loss event in the Streptophyte subset of Viridiplantae, which invaded land. Analysis of selenoproteins present in green algae suggests that they were either replaced with Cys-containing homologs or entirely lost in land plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>).

On the other hand, aquatic arthropods, such as shrimp, have many selenoprotein genes (based on the expressed sequence tag (EST) analyses as the genomes are not yet available; unpublished data). Thus, it appears that selenoprotein genes were massively lost in either insects, or all terrestrial arthropods.</p></sec><sec><title>Nematodes</title><p>The selenoproteomes of <italic>C. elegans </italic>and <italic>C. briggsae </italic>have only one selenoprotein, thioredoxin reductase, and, therefore, the Sec insertion system is used to decode only a single UGA codon in these nematodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The decreased size of selenoproteomes in these five groups of organisms appears to be not only due to the loss of entire selenoprotein genes, but also due to replacement of Sec with Cys. Thus, Cys-containing homologs, while often catalytically inefficient, may occasionally compensate for selenoprotein loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>A hypothesis for association of large selenoproteomes and aquatic life</title><p>The mosaic occurrence of eukaryotic selenoproteins and their consistent loss in different phyla suggest that the decreased selenoproteome size is the result of a selective force. What could be the factors responsible for or associated with selenoprotein loss? Comparative analysis of organisms with large and small selenoproteomes shows that many of the selenoprotein-rich organisms live in aquatic environments. In contrast, almost all organisms that lack or have a small number of selenoproteins are terrestrial (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Considering independent, large-scale selenoprotein loss in these organisms, a common denominator appears to be the non-aquatic habitat. It should be noted, however, that the differences between aquatic and terrestrial selenoproteomes are ultimately influenced by specific environmental factors that differ with habitat. Therefore, the aquatic/terrestrial association should not be viewed as the basis for selenoprotein loss/gain, but rather a convenient illustration of differences between these organisms. Once environmental factors are identified, this association may be modified to reflect these factors rather than habitat.</p><p>To further examine selenoprotein content of aquatic and terrestrial organisms, we analyzed organisms that are well represented by ESTs. We excluded large animals (vertebrates) from this analysis because their intra-organismal environment would be less affected by environmental conditions due to availability of their outside protective cover and complex morphology. With this limitation, aquatic eukaryotes had more selenoprotein genes than terrestrial organisms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Aquatic invertebrates have more selenoproteins than terrestrial organisms. Numbers of detected selenoproteins were plotted against the total number of available (redundant) ESTs for organisms that are represented by more than 25,000 ESTs. Vertebrate ESTs were excluded from this analysis due to large size of these organisms. Blue circles correspond to aquatic and brown squares to terrestrial organisms. The difference is statistically significant (<italic>P </italic>value is less than 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6</sup>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2007-8-9-r198-7"/></fig><p>Whether <italic>C. merolae </italic>fits this association is not clear. This organism lives in highly acidic sulfate-rich hot springs (pH 1.5, 45&#x000b0;C). It is possible that this extreme environment is responsible for the reduced use of Sec in red algae. The pKa of Sec is approximately 5.5. Whereas this residue would be ionized in most organisms under physiological conditions, at low pH, protonation of Sec may minimize its catalytic advantages. Abundance of sulfate in hot springs might also be of importance, as selenium and sulfur have similar chemistries.</p><p>One possible explanation for the occurrence of large selenoproteomes in aquatic organisms is bioavailability of selenium in oceans. Dissolved organic selenides can account for approximately 80% of the dissolved selenium in ocean water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and represent an important source of selenium for phytoplankton. Following the food chain, this could explain a large number of selenoproteins in algae and fish. Likewise, a considerable number of selenoproteins in mammals could reflect the consequence of food sources, body size and relatively recent (in evolutionary terms) emergence of these organisms from marine environments. An additional factor may be constancy in the environmental conditions and nutrients in the aquatic environments. For aquatic organisms, environmental changes are slower and involve gradients of temperature, pH, pressure, oxygen and chemical environment. In contrast, in terrestrial environments, the changes are more frequent and they happen more suddenly. As a result, terrestrial organisms often face feast and starvation situations. An attractive factor to explain the differences between aquatic and terrestrial selenoproteomes may be oxygen content. Higher content of oxygen in air than in aquatic environments may make highly reactive selenoproteins more susceptible to oxidation in terrestrial organisms and select against the use of these proteins.</p><p>Whether mammals and other vertebrates fit the hypothesis on the preferential use of selenium in aquatic environments is not clear. We note, however, that fish have larger selenoproteomes than those living in terrestrial environments, including mammals, reptiles and birds. Further genomic analyses of these organisms could clarify evolutionary changes in utilization of selenium. In future studies, it would also be important to determine which of the factors discussed above influence the preferential use of Sec in aquatic organisms or are responsible for the loss of selenoproteins in terrestrial organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Until recently, the mammalian selenoproteome was thought to represent accurately eukaryotic selenoproteins and to be of recent (perhaps vertebrate) origin. However, as additional genome sequences became available, selenoproteins with restricted occurrence have been identified. In mammals, these proteins either occur in the form of Cys-containing homologs or are absent altogether; instead, these rare selenoproteins have been found in several lower eukaryotic organisms. In our work, the searches of additional eukaryotic genomes identified new selenoprotein genes, revealed examples of convergent evolution of SECIS elements, and identified many features of selenoproteome organization and evolution. Integrated analyses of eukaryotic selenoproteomes suggested that the majority of eukaryotic selenoprotein families evolved in single-celled eukaryotes. Our data show that the mosaic occurrence of selenoproteins is the consequence of selective, independent selenoprotein loss events in various eukaryotic phyla. Moreover, these analyses revealed an interesting pattern: large selenoproteomes tend to occur in aquatic life, whereas the organisms that lack selenoproteins or have small selenoproteomes are mostly terrestrial (with the notable exception of mammals, whose large bodies and intra-organismal homeostasis support an internal environment that may be less dependent on habitat). Further studies will be needed to test this hypothesis and identify environmental factors that influence selenium utilization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Databases and programs</title><p>All genome, EST and predicted protein sequences were downloaded from NCBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], except for the genomes of <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>, <italic>O. tauri</italic>, and <italic>O. lucimarinus</italic>, which were obtained from Joint Genome Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].
