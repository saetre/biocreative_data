MAR&#x003b2;, a matrix-associated region (MAR) located upstream of the T cell receptor &#x003b2; (TCR&#x003b2;) enhancer (E&#x003b2;), serves a crucial role in silencing E&#x003b2;-mediated TCR activation. By DNaseI hypersensitivity assays, we show here that overexpression of the MAR binding proteins SMAR1 and Cux&#x0002f;CDP modulate the chromatin structure at MAR&#x003b2;. We further demonstrate that the silencer function of MAR&#x003b2; is mediated independently by SMAR1 and Cux&#x0002f;CDP as judged by their ability to repress E&#x003b2;-dependent reporter gene expression. Moreover, the repressor activity of SMAR1 is strongly enhanced in the presence of Cux&#x0002f;CDP. These two proteins physically interact with each other and colocalize within the perinuclear region through a SMAR1 domain required for repression. The repression domain of SMAR1 is separate from the MAR&#x003b2; binding domain and contains a nuclear localization signal and an arginine&#x02013;serine (RS)-rich domain, characteristic of pre-mRNA splicing regulators. Our data suggest that at the double positive stage of T cell development, <italic>cis</italic>-acting MAR&#x003b2; elements recruit the strong negative regulators Cux and SMAR1 to control E&#x003b2;-mediated recombination and transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The T cell receptor &#x003b2; gene locus (TCR&#x003b2;) has been well studied with respect to V(D)J recombination and transcription. Besides, <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulators such as the recombination-activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2), <italic>cis</italic>-elements such as enhancers and promoters also play a critical role in the recombination process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c2">2</xref>). Transcriptional enhancers and promoters are known to provide tissue-, lineage- and developmental stage-specific accessibility to the V(D)J recombination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c4">4</xref>). The TCR&#x003b2; gene enhancer (E&#x003b2;), an indispensable <italic>cis</italic>-element within the TCR&#x003b2; locus, has been shown to regulate germline transcription as well as recombination of D&#x003b2; and J&#x003b2; gene segments. Deletion of E&#x003b2; from the endogenous locus results in impaired transcription and rearrangement of D&#x003b2; to J&#x003b2; as well as V&#x003b2; to D&#x003b2;J&#x003b2; gene segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c7">7</xref>). Similarly, in transgenic mice, insertion of E&#x003b2; into recombination-competent substrates leads to germline transcription and recombination of not only D&#x003b2; to J&#x003b2; but also of V&#x003b2; to D&#x003b2;J&#x003b2; gene segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c9">9</xref>).</p><p>V(D)J recombination is a tightly regulated complex process that occurs during transition from double negative (DN) to double positive (DP) stage of T cell development. Once the process is complete, the DP cells differentiate into single positive stage expressing either CD4 or CD8 markers and the cells are finally exported to the periphery. To regulate chromatin accessibility for V(D)J recombination, various <italic>cis</italic>-elements are involved that include S&#x0002f;MARs (scaffold&#x0002f;matrix attachment regions), LCRs (locus control regions), silencers and insulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c10">10</xref>). MARs are the <italic>cis</italic>-elements that are closely associated with promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c13">13</xref>) and are often found to flank antigen receptor genes, including the Ig&#x003ba; light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c14">14</xref>), IgH heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c17">17</xref>), the TCR &#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b4;18, TCR&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>) and the TCR co-receptor CD8&#x003b1; gene loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c20">20</xref>). Depending on the context, MARs have been shown to exhibit widespread transcriptional regulatory functions whereby they may either promote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c22">22</xref>) or inhibit transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c26">26</xref>).</p><p>MARs are known to provide binding sites for specific proteins (MAR-binding proteins or MARBPs) that can influence the transcription of associated gene loci. Several MARBPs have been identified, some of which include Cux&#x0002f;CDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c22">22</xref>), SATB1 (<italic>s</italic>pecial <italic>AT</italic>-rich DNA-<italic>b</italic>inding protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c28">28</xref>) and Bright (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c30">30</xref>). Another MARBP that has been recently added to this list is SMAR1 (scaffold&#x0002f;matrix associated region 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>). SMAR1 binds to MAR&#x003b2;, an ATC-rich sequence located &#x0223c;400 bp upstream of E&#x003b2;. Its high sequence conservation in human and mouse suggested that MAR&#x003b2; might play an important functional role during T cell development. This idea was further strengthened by the observation that MAR&#x003b2; (HS1) is the major DNaseI hypersensitive site induced during the TCR co-receptor CD4CD8 DN to DP stage of thymocyte development, whose induction is concomitant with the halt of TCR&#x003b2; V(D)J recombination in DP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c32">32</xref>). By electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), three MARBPs&#x02014;SMAR1, Cux&#x0002f;CDP and SATB1&#x02014;have been shown to bind to MAR&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>smar1</italic> gene is expressed in three alternatively spliced forms, one having a deletion of 117 bp in the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>). Each SMAR1 protein isoform shares a significant homology with MARBPs-SATB1, Cux and with the tetramerization domain of Bright (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>). SMAR1, recently, has been shown to function as a candidate tumor suppressor protein that regulates the cell cycle through direct interaction with p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c33">33</xref>). The MARBP SATB1 is expressed preferentially and abundantly in the thymus. It was first reported to bind to a region of high unwinding potential within the 3&#x02032; MAR of the IgH enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c27">27</xref>). SATB1 has been demonstrated to repress the transcription of a stably integrated reporter gene appended to a MAR associated with the human interferon-&#x003b2; gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c28">28</xref>). CDP&#x0002f;Cux (CCAAT-displacement protein&#x0002f;Cut homeobox) is a component of NF-&#x003bc;NR (nuclear factor &#x003bc; negative regulator), a candidate repressor first identified as a nuclear factor that binds to both flanking regions of the IgH intronic enhancer (E&#x003bc;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c25">25</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrated that NF-&#x003bc;NR can inhibit nuclear matrix attachment of E&#x003bc; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c34">34</xref>). The Cux&#x0002f;CDP homeoprotein represses the E&#x003bc; enhancer by antagonizing the transcription activator Bright via preferential competition for shared binding sites within the E&#x003bc; flanking MARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c22">22</xref>). Cux&#x0002f;CDP is ubiquitously expressed and has been shown to exhibit wide transcriptional repressor activities of many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c36">36</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that chromatin modulation at MAR&#x003b2; occurs only at the DP stage of thymocyte development. Interestingly, upon overexpression of the MARBPs, SMAR1 and Cux, MAR&#x003b2; gets modulated even in non-T-cells. On the other hand, chromatin at the E&#x003b2; enhancer is accessible uniformly during all stages of T cell development but is not detected in B cells. We show that the silencer function of MAR&#x003b2; is mediated by MAR&#x003b2;-associated proteins, SMAR1 and Cux&#x0002f;CDP, both of which either independently or synergistically function as strong transcriptional repressors for the E&#x003b2; enhancer. The repressor activity of SMAR1 lies within a short region (residues 160&#x02013;350) rich in arginine&#x02013;serine (RS) that contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS). SMAR1 and Cux physically associate, and the RS-rich region is sufficient for maximum interaction. SMAR1 and Cux, presumably as a complex, colocalize primarily within the perinuclear envelope, a site consistent with a model of cooperative interaction of the two MARBPs within the nuclear matrix.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid DNAs and probes used</title><p>The generation of pBK-CMV-SMAR1<sup>S</sup> and 3&#x000d7;FLAG&#x02013;SMAR1<sup>S</sup> expression constructs was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c33">33</xref>). The luciferase reporter constructs pGL2-HS1-E&#x003b2; and pGL2-E&#x003b2; have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>), where the SV40 promoter in pGL2 promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was deleted by BglII&#x02013;HindIII digestion and replaced by a 424 bp EcoRI&#x02013;NcoI fragment containing the V&#x003b2;13 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>). In the pGL2-E&#x003b2; construct, an 830 bp BglII&#x02013;NcoI fragment containing E&#x003b2; was cloned into the BamHI site located downstream of the poly(A) site of luciferase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>). A 1 kb BsgI&#x02013;NcoI fragment containing HS1 (MAR&#x003b2;) and E&#x003b2; in their natural configuration has been inserted into the same position of pGL2-E&#x003b2; to generate pGL2-HS1-E&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>B). The Renilla luciferase reporter vector, pRL-CMV (Promega), was used as an internal control in the luciferase assays. SMAR1 truncations were generated as follows: full-length pBK-CMV-SMAR1 construct was digested with AflIII, followed by klenowing and digestion with EcoRI to generate an 850 bp fragment. This fragment was cloned into the EcoRI&#x02013;SmaI site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), resulting in a SMAR1 (1&#x02013;245 amino acids) N-terminal construct. The truncation SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350), and SMAR1 (350&#x02013;548) were made by generating forward and reverse primers (using pBK-CMV-SMAR1 as template) having EcoRI and BamHI sites at 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends, respectively. The products generated by PCR were directly cloned into the EcoRI&#x02013;BamHI site of the pEGFP-C1 vector. The truncations SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350), SMAR1 (1&#x02013;245) and SMAR1 (350&#x02013;548) were FLAG-tagged by cloning them as EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII products into 3&#x000d7; FLAG (Sigma). For EMSAs, 128 bp AccI&#x02013;BsgI DNA fragment upstream of 170mer MAR&#x003b2; was isolated from p780 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>). For isolation of 170 bp MAR&#x003b2; fragment, SW14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>) plasmid was digested by XhoI and EcoRI and the DNA fragment was labeled and used in the EMSAs. The 37 bp core MAR&#x003b2; was generated by annealing oligos that were commercially synthesized (Genomechanix, USA). The core 37mer probe was prepared by annealing 47 bp sense (5&#x02032;-TCGAGAGGTAATATAAATAGGGAGATAGGAGTGTGAGAGAGTGAGCT) and 39 bp anti-sense oligos (5&#x02032;-TCTCTCACACTCCTATCTCCCTATTTATATTACCTCTCGA) in the presence of 1&#x000d7; SSC. The mixture was incubated at 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min followed by annealing till the temperature comes down to room temperature. The annealed product was gel-purified and labeled using [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP, dNTPs and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The labeled double-stranded DNA was further purified using probequant G-50 columns (Amersham, Pharmacia) following the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell lines used and FACS analysis</title><p>The thymoma line P4980 and P4833 were derived from CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN thymocytes of mouse deficient in both p53 and RAG1, and the thymoma line &#x003b8;4b was derived from DP thymocytes of a mouse deficient in both p53 and TCR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c32">32</xref>).

Among these sites, HS1, located 400 bp upstream of the TCR&#x003b2; enhancer (E&#x003b2;) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>A), was most prominently induced at the DP stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c32">32</xref>). Later studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>) confirmed HS1 as an ATC-rich nuclear matrix-associated region (referred to as MAR&#x003b2;) whose induction is accompanied with increased binding of two known MARBPs, CDP&#x0002f;Cux and SATB1. EMSA further demonstrated that a novel MARBP, SMAR1, binds specifically to this MAR&#x003b2; region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>).</p><p>To study the chromatin modulation at MAR&#x003b2;, DNaseI hypersensitivity assays were performed on DNA isolated from nuclei of primary thymocytes and peripheral (lymph node) T cells purified from wild-type mice, from T cell lines derived from DN (P4980 and P4833) or DP (&#x003b8;4b) thymomas and from M12 lymphoma mature B cells. Using a 1.6 kb V&#x003b2;14 upstream probe, within a 6.6 kb BamHI&#x02013;BglI fragment, four hypersensitive sites (HS1, HS2, HS3 and HS4) were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c32">32</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>B). Among these, HS2, corresponding to the E&#x003b2; enhancer, was equally accessible in all T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;20). However, in the M12 B cell line, cleavage products corresponding to HS1&#x02013;HS4 were not detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>B, lanes 21&#x02013;26), indicating the absence of chromatin modulation within this region. In P4980 DN T cells, HS1&#x0002f;MAR&#x003b2;-associated cleavage was only faintly detected, as compared to nuclei from either &#x003b8;4b (DP cell line) or TCR&#x003b2; transgenic RAG<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;14). In TCR&#x003b2; transgenic RAG<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice, 98% of the thymocytes are arrested at the DP stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c32">32</xref>). Interestingly, no MAR&#x003b2; signal was observed in nuclei isolated from mature Con A-stimulated lymph node T cells, a population representative of SP T cells (1B, lanes 15&#x02013;20). This suggests that in DN T cells and peripheral mature T cells, the MAR&#x003b2; region is not accessible, indicating stage-specific modulation of MAR&#x003b2;. Thus, MAR&#x003b2;, the binding site for SMAR1, is accessible primarily at the DP stage of thymocyte development where SMAR1 was found to be abundantly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>), suggesting that SMAR1 may be involved in the modulation of MAR&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec><title>SMAR1 and Cux together modulate MAR&#x003b2; region</title><p>MAR&#x003b2; was previously shown to be bound by both SMAR1 and Cux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>). To determine their effect upon binding to MAR&#x003b2; <italic>in vivo</italic>, SMAR1 and Cux were stably expressed in either a RAG<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> DN T cell line (P4833) or a non-T-cell line (B16 F1). DNaseI hypersensitivity assays were performed as described above. Untransfected B16F1 nuclei showed a faint band corresponding to HS1&#x0002f;MAR&#x003b2; but did not show prominent bands for the other three hypersensitive sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;4). Upon overexpression of SMAR1 and Cux, the MAR&#x003b2; site was more prominently induced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>C, lanes 6&#x02013;9), indicating enhanced chromatin alteration in the presence of these two proteins. Densitometry analysis of HS1&#x0002f;MAR&#x003b2; band shows a 1.8- to 2-fold increase in B16F1 cells overexpressing Cux and SMAR1 compared to the control B16F1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>C, lane 9 versus 4, respectively). On the other hand, by performing DNaseI hypersensitivity assays in a DN T cell line, all other HS sites except HS1&#x0002f;MAR&#x003b2; were present (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>D, lanes 1&#x02013;5). Interestingly, upon co-expression of SMAR1 and Cux, HS1&#x0002f;MAR&#x003b2; was significantly induced and accessible to DNaseI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>D, lanes 6&#x02013;9). However, chromatin alteration at the MAR&#x003b2; site was not as prominent when either SMAR1 or Cux were independently expressed in either T- or non-T-cell lines (data not shown). These results suggest that accessibility to MAR&#x003b2; region requires the coexistence of two MARBPs, SMAR1 and Cux. To compare the DNaseI digestion in the four panels, the blots were reprobed with 0.8 kb probe that scans V&#x003b2;14 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>). These two cell lines showed two DNase1 hypersensitive sites that correspond to HS5 and HS6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f1">1</xref>E, lanes 1&#x02013;4 and 5&#x02013;9) showing that the DNase digestion series in the B16F1 cells is similar to the P4833 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>SMAR1 negatively regulates enhancer (E&#x003b2;) function</title><p>MAR&#x003b2; is highly accessible at the DP stage of thymocyte development and is known to function as a silencer of E&#x003b2; transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>). Since SMAR1 is abundantly expressed at the DP stage and binds to MAR&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f2">2</xref>A), we were interested in deciphering the role of SMAR1 in the context of E&#x003b2;. To analyze the effect of SMAR1 on E&#x003b2; transcription, transient transfections were performed using luciferase reporter constructs driven by the V&#x003b2;13 promoter that contain the enhancer alone (pGL2-E&#x003b2;), the MAR&#x003b2; alone (pGL2-MAR&#x003b2;) or the enhancer-MAR&#x003b2; silencer (pGL2-HS1-E&#x003b2;) regions as described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f2">2</xref>B and in Materials and Methods. Within the 1 kb HS1-E&#x003b2; fragment, MAR&#x003b2;&#x0002f;HS1 spans &#x0223c;170 bp, whereas the E&#x003b2; constitutes the core enhancer of &#x0223c;550 bp in length (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f2">2</xref>A). We showed previously that compared with pGL2-E&#x003b2;, the transcriptional activity of pGL2-HS1-E&#x003b2; was reduced in various thymoma lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>). To confirmatively establish that the effect of SMAR1 is specific for HS1-E&#x003b2;, both MAR&#x003b2; and E&#x003b2; constructs were checked for their activity upon overexpression of SMAR1. MAR&#x003b2; alone shows a basal activity while a 4- to 6-fold higher activity was observed for E&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f2">2</xref>C, lanes b and e, respectively). However, there was no significant decrease in the activity of MAR&#x003b2; and E&#x003b2; with increasing concentrations of SMAR1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f2">2</xref>C, lanes c and d, f and g, respectively) as seen with HS1-E&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f2">2</xref>D, lanes d&#x02013;f). This suggested that MAR&#x003b2;, presumably through its binding factors (SMAR1, Cux and SATB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>), was interacting with the E&#x003b2; enhancer to mediate transcriptional repression. To test this further, initial transfections were performed in a DN (P4980) T cell line that expresses low levels of SMAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>). Upon transfection with the control pGL2 vector, no appreciable transcriptional activity was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f2">2</xref>D, lane a). When the cells were transfected with pGL2-HS1-E&#x003b2;, there was a 1.4-fold decrease in transcription as compared to pGL2-E&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f2">2</xref>D, lanes c and b, respectively). However, cotransfection and overexpression of SMAR1 resulted in a significant (&#x0223c;3- to 30-fold) dose-dependent repression of pGL2-HS1-E&#x003b2; transcription in 4980 cells relative to control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f2">2</xref>D, lanes d&#x02013;f). Thus, SMAR1 upon binding to MAR&#x003b2;&#x0002f;HS1 strongly represses TCR&#x003b2; enhancer function.</p></sec><sec><title>Repressor activity of SMAR1 resides within 160&#x02013;350 amino acids</title><p>SMAR1 shares sequence similarity with various MARBPs.

To delineate the specific region involved in inducing transcriptional repression of E&#x003b2;, various truncation products of SMAR1 fused to either GFP or FLAG were generated as described in Materials and Methods. Prior to transcriptional analysis, the expression of the full-length GFP&#x02013;SMAR1 and GFP-fused truncated domains of SMAR1 (1&#x02013;245, 160&#x02013;350 and 350&#x02013;548) were confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f3">3</xref>B). Localization studies of GFP&#x02013;SMAR1 and GFP&#x02013;SMAR1-truncations were performed to determine the region(s) required for nuclear localization. We observed that compared with other truncations (A. Jalota <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished data), SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350) localized within the nucleus in a pattern similar to that of full-length GFP&#x02013;SMAR1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f3">3</xref>D and C, respectively), whereas the cells transfected with the SMAR1 truncations, 1&#x02013;245 and 350&#x02013;548 showed a diffused expression (both cytoplasmic and nuclear) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f3">3</xref>E and F, respectively). SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350) contains an arginine-rich (<underline>RTAWRRKQR</underline>) domain (residues 324&#x02013;332) as well as a serine-rich (SFSRRTPSSSSYSAS) domain (residues 342&#x02013;356) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f10">10</xref>). Similar arginine-rich motifs have been found to mediate translocation of test proteins into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c37">37</xref>), consistent with our conclusion that the 160&#x02013;350 region harbors the NLS of SMAR1.</p><p>Full-length and truncated GFP&#x02013;SMAR1 fusion constructs were tested for their ability to repress pGL2-HS1-E&#x003b2; luciferase activity in 4980 cells.

In contrast, SMAR1 (1&#x02013;245) gave only a 1.5-fold decrease in transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f3">3</xref>G, lane c) and SMAR1 (350&#x02013;548) did not show any appreciable decrease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f3">3</xref>G, lane b). These results indicate that the repression domain of SMAR1 resides within residues 160&#x02013;350. Curiously, this region contains only the N-terminal portion (Box 1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f3">3</xref>A) of the multiple CUT DNA-binding domains conserved between SMAR1 and Cux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>).

Using the same reporter constructs pGL2-E&#x003b2; and pGL2-HS1-E&#x003b2;, as described above, we tested the transcriptional activity of E&#x003b2; upon overexpression of either Cux alone or Cux in association with SMAR1. Compared with the control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f4">4</xref>A, lane a), SMAR1 and Cux independently repress the transcriptional activity of the enhancer by 1.8- and 4-fold, respectively, in 4980 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f4">4</xref>A, lanes b and c). Co-expression of Cux and SMAR1 resulted in significant dose-dependent increases in E&#x003b2; repression from 2.5- to 27-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f4">4</xref>B, lanes e and f) compared with the control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f4">4</xref>B, lane d).

Thus, independently both SMAR1 and Cux function as negative regulators of E&#x003b2; transcription, but together they synergize to reduce transcription markedly.</p><p>Various truncations of SMAR1 were cotransfected with Cux to identify the domain that effectively cooperates to repress transcription. Maximal repression (&#x0223c;3.2-fold) was achieved by SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350) and Cux (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f4">4</xref>C, lane e), as compared with the control (lane a). More modest repression was observed under these expression conditions for Cux cotransfected with full-length SMAR1 (1.9-fold, lane b) or the SMAR1 (1&#x02013;245) truncation (1.8-fold, lane c). Thus, whether in the presence or absence of Cux, the region of SMAR1 between residues 160&#x02013;350 is necessary and sufficient for maximum repression.</p></sec><sec><title>SATB1 fails to cooperate with SMAR1 for transcriptional regulation of E&#x003b2;</title><p>Previous EMSA-super shift assays employing anti-SATB1 antiserum demonstrated that SATB1 also binds to the MAR&#x003b2; region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>).

Neither dose of SATB1 employed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f5">5</xref>A (lanes b and c) significantly altered E&#x003b2; transcription under conditions where the lower dose equivalent of SMAR1 alone exhibited a 2.3-fold decrease in transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f5">5</xref>A, lane d). SATB1 does not cooperate with SMAR1, since co-expression of the two proteins gave no appreciable difference in repression (2.5-fold; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f5">5</xref>A, lane e) than SMAR1 alone (lane d).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f5">5</xref>B, lanes 1 and 4 show the endogenous levels of SATB1 in T cells. Overexpression of Cux, which also binds to MAR&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>), reduced E&#x003b2;-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner (1.7- and 2.8-fold, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f5">5</xref>C, lanes b and c, respectively). Again, under similar conditions, SATB1 alone produced no significant effects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f5">5</xref>C, lanes d and e). Upon co-expression of Cux and SATB1, there was a slight decrease in repression (1.9-fold, lane g) relative to the equivalent dose of Cux (2.8 fold, lane c), indicating that repression was mediated solely by Cux and not by SATB1. Thus, SATB1 does not function as a repressor and fails to cooperate with either SMAR1 or Cux in modulating E&#x003b2;-mediated transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Colocalization of Cux and SMAR1 in the nucleus</title><p>The repression synergy demonstrated for SMAR1 and Cux prompted us to investigate their localization properties.

Interestingly, in the majority of the cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f6">6</xref>C and D), most of the Cux protein (green panels) colocalized with SMAR1 (red panels) within a perinuclear ring (yellow, merged panels), indicative of an interaction of these two proteins at the nuclear periphery.</p></sec><sec><title>SMAR1 interacts with Cux through the RS-rich domain</title><p>Since residues 160&#x02013;350 of SMAR1 are sufficient for nuclear localization and E&#x003b2; repression, we carried out similar Cux colocalization experiments with a FLAG-tagged SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350) truncation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f7">7</xref>A and B). Virtually, every B16F1 cell cotransfected with Cux (green panels) and SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350) (red panels) exhibited exclusive perinuclear colocalization (yellow panels of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f7">7</xref>A and B). Since the expression achieved for SMAR1 and SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350) were similar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f7">7</xref>C), it appears that, as with the transcription synergy results of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f6">6</xref>, the isolated RS domain containing fragment of SMAR1 is more efficient in driving the expressed protein to the nuclear envelope.</p><p>Nuclear colocalization of SMAR1 and Cux suggested that the two proteins might be physically interacting to regulate E&#x003b2; mediated transcription. Whole-cell lysates of B16F1 cells were prepared 48 h following transfection with Cux- and FLAG-tagged versions of either full-length or truncated SMAR1 expression constructs. Immunoblotting with anti-FLAG confirmed the expression of SMAR1 proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f7">7</xref>C). The cell lysates were incubated with FLAG-tagged beads, then the bound proteins were eluted, fractionated on SDS&#x02013;PAGE and western blotted with an anti-Cux antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f7">7</xref>D). Consistent with our confocal results, full-length SMAR1 as well as the SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350) truncation interacts with Cux (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f7">7</xref>D). A region from residues 350 to 548, which did not have an appreciable effect in the repression experiments, does not pull down Cux (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f7">7</xref>D). The immunofluorescence microscopy and pull-down studies together indicate that SMAR1 and Cux physically interact with each other and for this protein&#x02013;protein interaction; the RS-rich domain of SMAR1 is essential.</p></sec><sec><title>Specific binding of SMAR1&#x02013;Cux complex to MAR&#x003b2;</title><p>Previously, we demonstrated by South&#x02013;western blotting that SMAR1 and Cux&#x0002f;CDP bind to the MAR&#x003b2; region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>). EMSA-super shift assays performed with mouse thymocyte nuclear extract had suggested that Cux specifically bound to that site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c32">32</xref>). Analysis of the 170 bp sequence spanning MAR&#x003b2; identified a 37 bp core region of 100% ATC base composition&#x02014;a characteristic feature of MARs. We have employed both the 37mer core and the 170 bp MAR&#x003b2; MAR sequences to confirm and extend these results with purified Cux and SMAR1 proteins. In line with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c32">32</xref>), GST&#x02013;Cux protein binds specifically in a dose-dependent manner to the 170mer MAR&#x003b2; sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f8">8</xref>A) and shows a strong binding affinity for the core 37mer MAR&#x003b2; region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f8">8</xref>D, lanes 2&#x02013;5). To determine the specificity of Cux&#x0002f;CDP binding, we examined if the complex was immunoreactive with anti-Cux&#x0002f;CDP antiserum. With increasing doses of antibody, the Cux&#x0002f;CDP complex was supershifted quantitatively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f8">8</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;5), whereas equivalent quantities of pre-immune serum produced no effect (data not shown). To further confirm the binding specificity, competition experiments were carried out with either the 170 bp MAR&#x003b2;-containing fragment or a fragment located 128 bp upstream (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f8">8</xref>C). High doses of the MAR&#x003b2;-containing competitor DNA completely abolished the nucleoprotein complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f8">8</xref>C, lanes 2&#x02013;6), whereas the 128 bp upstream DNA gave no competition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f8">8</xref>C, lanes 7&#x02013;10).</p><p>GST&#x02013;SMAR1 formed a single complex on the core 37mer in the presence of increasing amounts of the protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f9">9</xref>B, lanes 2&#x02013;6), whereas the GST protein that was used as a negative control did not form any complex even at higher doses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f9">9</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;3). However, this binding was relatively weak compared to that of GST&#x02013;Cux, indicating that SMAR1 might require additional DNA sequences within the 170 bp MAR&#x003b2; region for efficient binding. We utilized various truncated forms of SMAR1 to identify the region(s) required for 37mer binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f9">9</xref>C). The DNA-binding region of SMAR1 lies within residues 350&#x02013;548 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f9">9</xref>C, lanes 3 and 4) compared with SMAR1 (400&#x02013;548) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f9">9</xref>C, lanes 5 and 6). Thus the DNA-binding domain of SMAR1 is different from the protein&#x02013;protein interaction domain (160&#x02013;350 amino acids), which shows no binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f9">9</xref>C, lanes 1 and 2). The weak DNA-binding affinity observed for SMAR1 (400&#x02013;548) suggests that a region from residues 350&#x02013;400 is sufficient for full DNA binding. This extra 50 amino acids share homology with the MAR binding domains of both SATB1 and Cux (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f10">10</xref>B).</p><p>EMSAs were performed to determine if SMAR1 and Cux&#x0002f;CDP form a ternary 37mer DNA-binding complex. In the presence of a constant amount of SMAR1 (1 &#x003bc;g) there was hardly any complex formed at the lowest amount (0.25 &#x003bc;g) of Cux&#x0002f;CDP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f9">9</xref>D, lane 1). As the amount of Cux&#x0002f;CDP was increased, a SMAR1&#x02013;Cux complex began to form (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f9">9</xref>D, lanes 2 and 3), and at the highest amount of Cux (1.0 &#x003bc;g), the ternary complex was evident (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f9">9</xref>D, lane 4). We conclude that both SMAR1 and Cux can bind together to sequences within the 37 bp ATC core of the MAR&#x003b2; silencers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The TCR&#x003b2; enhancer (E&#x003b2;) is critical for both transcription and V(D)J recombination that occurs during DN to DP transition. This complex process requires chromatin structure modulation so that the gene segments are made accessible to the recombinase machinery as well as to other factors involved in recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c44">44</xref>). The E&#x003b2; enhancer is known to cross-talk with other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements such as promoters and MARs as well as <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that allow accessibility through chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c45">45</xref>). Thus, fine-tuning the regulation of the E&#x003b2; enhancer is critical for V(D)J recombination. Interestingly, the induction of the hypersensitive site HS1 (MAR&#x003b2;) at the TCR&#x003b2; locus during DP stage is important for maintaining locus accessibility during V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c32">32</xref>).</p><p>Here, we showed that accessibility of MAR&#x003b2; as well as the E&#x003b2; enhancer is detected only in T cells and not in B cells, implying that the lineage-specific presence of these two <italic>cis</italic>-elements is critical for V(D)J rearrangement of TCR&#x003b2; gene segments. Moreover, MAR&#x003b2; chromatin is modulated differentially during different stages of thymocyte development, but the locus is not accessible in peripheral T cells. Thus, chromatin remodeling at MAR&#x003b2; appears to be transient and stage-specific within a specific lymphoid lineage. Since MAR&#x003b2; functions as a transcriptional silencer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>), it is possible that MAR&#x003b2; along with its associated <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors might regulate V(D)J recombination through regulation of E&#x003b2; function. Interestingly, upon overexpression of the MAR&#x003b2; binding proteins, SMAR1 and Cux, together, HS1 (MAR&#x003b2;) is prominently induced in both T as well as non-T-cells. These results suggest that overexpression of SMAR1 and Cux modulate the chromatin at MAR&#x003b2;.</p><p>MARBPs are known to play significant roles in regulating transcription of antigen receptor gene loci through specific binding to their target MAR sequences. Some MARBPs, depending on the context, either function as transcriptional repressors or as activators. MARBPs such as Cux&#x0002f;CDP and SATB1 can function as transcriptional repressors in non-B-cells by interacting with their target MAR sequences flanking the IgH intronic enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c28">28</xref>). On the other hand, the MARBP Bright acts as a transcriptional activator in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c29">29</xref>), and this activation is context-dependent in that it requires an intact IgH enhancer core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c30">30</xref>). MAR&#x003b2;, which resides at the 5&#x02032; end of the TCR&#x003b2; enhancer (E&#x003b2;), is the docking site for three MARBPs&#x02014;SMAR1, Cux and SATB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>). SMAR1 is a relatively recently characterized MARBP that was isolated from a murine DP thymocyte expression library using MAR&#x003b2; as a probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>). This screen gave the first clue that Cux was also involved in MAR&#x003b2; function, as three of four clones identified were found to be alternatively spliced forms of SMAR1 and the fourth clone encoded the 3&#x02032; region of Cux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>). Subsequent expression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>) established that SMAR1 mRNA and protein accumulated maximally within DP thymocytes, providing a specific time and place for a biologically relevant role for SMAR1 in repression of E&#x003b2;-mediated V(D)J recombination at the DP stage of thymocyte development. Since two negative regulatory proteins Cux and SATB1 also bind to MAR&#x003b2;, we investigated their contribution in the context of SMAR1. Our results show that SMAR1 is a strong repressor of E&#x003b2;-mediated transcription. These results are consistent with our preliminary observation that transgenic mice expressing SMAR1 exhibit decreased E&#x003b2;-dependent transcription as well as severe perturbation in V(D)J recombination of commonly used V&#x003b2;s (R. Kaul-Ghanekar <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished data). Thus, in addition to the previously identified cell cycle regulatory function for SMAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c33">33</xref>), upon binding to MAR&#x003b2; at the DP stage of thymocyte differentiation, SMAR1 negatively regulates E&#x003b2; enhancer function at the TCR&#x003b2; locus.</p><p>We report, here, evidence that Cux also represses E&#x003b2;-mediated transcription and coexpression of SMAR1 and Cux results in a marked synergistic reduction of enhancer activity. On the other hand, SATB1, which also binds specifically to MAR&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>), neither represses E&#x003b2; independently nor cooperates with SMAR1 to enhance repression. While binding to MAR&#x003b2; is known to repress E&#x003b2;-mediated transcription in cultured cell lines, the targeted deletion of this region in mice had no apparent effect on transcription or V(D)J recombination of the TCR&#x003b2; gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c19">19</xref>). The reason for this could be that after deletion of MAR&#x003b2;, the binding sites for the negative regulatory factors, SMAR1 and Cux, are lost, thereby eliminating the opportunity for these proteins to fine-tune transcription mediated by the enhancer. Thus, an orchestrated recruitment of at least two repressor proteins, SMAR1 and Cux&#x0002f;CDP, is required at the MAR&#x003b2; region to regulate E&#x003b2; function at the TCR&#x003b2; locus. Cux&#x0002f;CDP is known to repress the transcription of its target genes either by interfering with the binding of transcriptional activators through competition for binding-site occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c47">47</xref>) or by recruiting HDACs through its C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c48">48</xref>). Therefore, SMAR1 repression might be mediated by recruiting HDACs, either directly or indirectly through interaction with Cux.</p><p>To delineate the core repressor domain within SMAR1, various truncated constructs of SMAR1 were generated. Among these, residues 160&#x02013;350 exhibited maximum repressor activity both independently as well as in conjunction with Cux. Interestingly, this short truncated domain of SMAR1 is sufficient for direct interaction with Cux and for colocalization with Cux (in most cells) within the perinuclear space. Nuclear periphery and perinuclear localization of chromatin has been known to facilitate transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c50">50</xref>). The SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350) domain lies within a central region of SMAR1 and is rich in RS residues that harbor the NLS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f10">10</xref>A). There are reports suggesting that arginine richness exists in DNA- or RNA-binding domains of various factors, including HIV Tat and Rev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c37">37</xref>). RS-domain-containing hnRNP proteins have been implicated as regulators of pre-mRNA splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c51">51</xref>). There are additional precedents for multiple regulatory functions of RS domains, and the RS domain of SMAR1 provides a potentially novel one for TCR&#x003b2; gene regulation. It provides not only a prototypic NLS function for SMAR1, but may also modulate intra-nuclear localization within a region of the nuclear periphery associated with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c50">50</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results demonstrate that the protein&#x02013;protein (RS) and DNA&#x02013;protein interaction domains of SMAR1 can function independently; the former, SMAR1 (160&#x02013;350), being essential for interaction with Cux, and the latter, SMAR1 (350&#x02013;548), forming a complex with MAR&#x003b2; DNA. Interestingly, the DNA-binding domain of SMAR1 has significant homology with the MAR binding domains of Cux and SATB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh807c31">31</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh807f10">10</xref>B). The core 37mer G-less region within the 170 bp MAR&#x003b2; DNA exhibits stronger affinity for Cux than SMAR1 suggesting that SMAR1 requires a larger DNA scaffold for attachment. At increased protein concentrations, significant DNA&#x02013;protein as well as protein&#x02013;protein interactions are observed. This is consistent with our findings that overexpression of SMAR1 and Cux results in prominent induction of MAR&#x003b2; DNaseI hypersensitivity in T- as well as non-T-cells. Together, these data provide compelling evidence that SMAR1 and Cux must interact and bind in concert to the MAR&#x003b2; region in order to negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of the E&#x003b2;. We anticipate, therefore, that a SMAR1&#x02013;Cux ternary complex with MAR&#x003b2; may regulate T cell development by controlling V(D)J recombination via regulation of E&#x003b2; enhancer. It will be informative to identify additional molecular partners that associate with SMAR1 and Cux to fine-tune the regulation of E&#x003b2;-mediated transcription and V(D)J recombination.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh807f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Analysis of DNaseI hypersensitive sites at the TCR&#x003b2; locus in T- and non-T cells.
