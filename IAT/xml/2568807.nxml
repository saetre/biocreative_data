Post-translational modifications control intracellular trafficking, functionality and degradation of clock proteins and are keys to the functioning of the clock as recently exemplified for the F-Box protein Fbxl3. The SCF<sup>Fbxl3</sup> complex directs degradation of CRY1/2 proteins and Fbxl3 murine mutants have a slower clock. To assess whether the role of Fbxl3 is phylogenetically conserved, we investigated its function in the sheep, a diurnal ungulate. Our data show that Fbxl3 function is conserved and further reveal that its closest homologue, the F-Box protein Fbxl21, also binds to CRY1 which impairs its repressive action towards the transcriptional activators CLOCK/BMAL1. However, while Fbxl3 appears to be ubiquitously expressed, Fbxl21 expression is tissue-specific. Furthermore, and in sharp contrast with Fbxl3, Fbxl21 is highly expressed within the suprachiasmatic nuclei, site of the master clock, where it displays marked circadian oscillations apparently driven by members of the PAR-bZIP family. Finally, for both Fbxl3 and Fbxl21 we identified and functionally characterized novel splice-variants, which might reduce CRY1 proteasomal degradation dependent on cell context. Altogether, these data establish Fbxl21 as a novel circadian clock-controlled gene that plays a specific role within the mammalian circadian pacemaker.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endogenous circadian clocks generate rhythms of physiology and behaviour, and are synchronised to the environment through rhythmical stimuli, principally the light/dark cycle.

We therefore cloned a full-length cds for ovine Fbxl21 (oFbxl21fl, GenBank EU239380). This yielded a 1305 nt sequence giving a protein of 434 amino acids with a greater degree of inter-species divergence than was the case for Fbxl3 (94, 84 and 82&#x00025; homology with bovine, mouse and human Fbxl21 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003530-g001"><bold>Fig 1D</bold></xref>). Fbxl21 appears to be a paralogue of Fbxl3 that arose through gene duplication relatively recently; indeed, unlike Fbxl3, no clear orthologue of Fbxl21 could be identified in fish genomes (Ensembl database). Within the region corresponding to the CBD of Fbxl3, amino acid identity to mFbxl21 was only 79&#x00025; although most substitutions were either conservative or semi-consevative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003530-g001"><bold>Fig 1D/E</bold> and <bold>G</bold></xref>). Here too, a splice-variant (oFbxl21sv, GenBank EU239381) was isolated. This splice-variant lacks 70 nt, is therefore out of frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003530-g001"><bold>Fig 1D/E</bold></xref>; fs: frame-shift) and presents an early stop-codon (TGA). This transcript yields a predicted protein of only 171 amino acids, leaving the F-box motif intact but lacking the CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003530-g001"><bold>Fig 1D/E</bold></xref>). Such a protein is therefore unlikely to bind CRY proteins while coupling with the proteasome degradation pathway would be retained. As for oFbxl3, we designed primers (O49C/O50C) to determine the tissue distribution of oFbxl21fl and oFbxl21sv. This revealed that Fbxl21 exhibited much more varied levels of expression between tissues than Fbxl3, with maximal expression in the adenohypophysis, hypothalamus and pineal (all neuroendocrine structures associated with timing and homeostasis) and no expression evident in liver, adrenal or white adipose tissue (WAT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003530-g001"><bold>Fig 1F</bold></xref>). The truncated transcript, oFbxl21sv, was detected in all tissues in which oFbxl21fl was also expressed. A similar distribution pattern was observed when RNA were extracted from animals sampled at either ZT4 (present data) or ZT15 (data not shown) indicating that absence of detection of Fbxl21 in liver, adrenal and WAT is unlikely due to a time-of-day effect on sampling (see below).</p><p>Transcripts encoding truncated protein products such as oFbxl21sv have long been considered as erroneous splicing events but recent evidence indicates they may have specific functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003530-Graveley1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003530-Kim1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003530-Pan1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this context it is noteworthy that the same in-frame Fbxl3sv transcript characterized in the sheep is also present in the mouse (data not shown). Furthermore, we cloned a novel splice-variant for Fbxl21 in the mouse that encodes for a truncated protein product of a sequence reminiscent to that of oFbxl21sv (GenBank EU770600).
