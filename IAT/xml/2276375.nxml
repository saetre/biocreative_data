StAR acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to facilitate movement of cholesterol from the OMM to the inner mitochondrial membrane to be converted to pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroid hormones. The mechanisms of the action of StAR remain unclear; the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, an OMM protein, appears to be involved, but the identity of OMM proteins that interact with StAR remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylated StAR interacts with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) on the OMM, which then facilitates processing of the 37-kDa phospho-StAR to the 32-kDa intermediate. In the absence of VDAC1, phospho-StAR is degraded by cysteine proteases prior to mitochondrial import. Phosphorylation of StAR by protein kinase A requires phosphate carrier protein on the OMM, which appears to interact with StAR before it interacts with VDAC1. VDAC1 and phosphate carrier protein are the first OMM proteins shown to contact StAR.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by grants from <grant-sponsor>Pfizer</grant-sponsor>, the <grant-sponsor>March of Dimes</grant-sponsor>, the <grant-sponsor>American Heart Association</grant-sponsor>, a start up package from the <grant-sponsor>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</grant-sponsor> (to H.

StAR moves cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) where it is converted to pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroid hormones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Lack of StAR causes potentially lethal congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (lipoid CAH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). StAR, which acts exclusively on the OMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), is expressed in the cytoplasm as a 37-kDa protein, is activated by phosphorylation of Ser<sup>195</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>), processed to a 32-kDa intermediate, imported into mitochondria, and cleaved to a 30-kDa protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>).</p><p>Despite intense investigation, the mechanisms of the action of StAR on the OMM remain unknown. Several models have been proposed to explain the mechanism of StAR action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Much attention has focused on the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), an OMM protein that appears to be involved in steroidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>), but despite evidence for a functional interaction between PBR and StAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), the identity of the OMM proteins with which StAR interacts remains undefined. Here we demonstrate that StAR interacts with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), and with phosphate carrier protein (PCP) on the OMM to initiate the action of StAR. VDAC1 and PCP are the first OMM proteins definitively shown to interact with StAR.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Reagents and Antibodies</italic>&#x02014;Antibodies against VDAC1, PCP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, PBR and COX IV were from Chemicon, Sigma, Calbiochem, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The generation of antiserum against bacterially expressed human StAR, which detects both phospho- and dephospho-StAR, has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Antiserum specific for phospho-StAR was a gift from Dr. Steven King (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Rabbit IgG was from Sigma, protein A beads were from Amersham Biosciences, and 2,4-dinitrophenol from Riedel-de Haen (Germany). Dithiocyanate was from Serva/Invitrogen, and 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate was from Research Organics. RNase A and Proteinase K were from Roche and GE Health-care, and digitonin was from Calbiochem. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technology (Ames, IA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise specified.</p><p><italic>Plasmid Construction, Cell Culture, Transfection, Mitochondrial Isolation, and Western Blotting</italic>&#x02014;Construction of full-length StAR, R182L StAR, P450scc, and SCC/N-62 StAR cDNA expression vectors was described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). For the StAR-DHFR fusion, residues 1 to 284 of StAR were fused to residues 2 to 224 of DHFR deleting the StAR stop codon and cloned in SP6 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Cell culture, transfections, and mitochondrial isolation from cultured cells were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). In all cases 100 ng/ml trilostane (Steraloids, Los Angeles, CA) was added as an inhibitor of 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Media were collected from cultures 48 h after transfection and assayed for pregnenolone by radioimmunoassay (MP Biomedicals) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in 1&#x000d7; SDS sample buffer (0.1% SDS, 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tris, pH 6.8, 100 m<sc>m</sc> &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol or 10 m<sc>m</sc> dithiothreitol), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated in 1:100 dilutions of primary antibody, with the exception of anti-StAR antiserum (1:10,000) and anti-phosphoserine StAR antiserum (1:800).</p><p>For mitochondrial isolation from adrenal tissue, sheep adrenals were isolated immediately after sacrifice. Adrenal tissue was placed in pre-chilled mitochondria isolation buffer (250 m<sc>m</sc> sucrose, 10 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m<sc>m</sc> EGTA, 1 m<sc>m</sc> phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 40 &#x003bc;g/ml protease mixture (Roche)). Tissue was then homogenized in an all glass, hand-held Dounce homogenizer with 12 up and down strokes, and cleared of debris by centrifugation at 3,500 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. The supernatant (mitochondrial fraction) was centrifuged at 10,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> at 4 &#x000b0;C, and the resulting mitochondrial pellet was washed twice and re-pelleted at 3,500 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>. For storage, pellets were suspended in import buffer (125 m<sc>m</sc> sucrose, 2 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, 2 m<sc>m</sc> NADH, 50 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 0.05 m<sc>m</sc> ADP, 2 m<sc>m</sc> dithiothreitol, 5 m<sc>m</sc> sodium succinate, 2 m<sc>m</sc> Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, 2 m<sc>m</sc> KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 m<sc>m</sc> creatine phosphate, 10 &#x003bc;l of creatine kinase (4 mg/ml), 10 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES pH 7.4), and frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> for <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity and protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>).</p><p><italic>Chemical Cross-linking</italic>&#x02014;Disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) was dissolved in Me<sub>2</sub>SO and sequentially diluted with import buffer just before cross-linking. Freshly isolated mitochondria from adrenal tissues (100 &#x003bc;g) were incubated with cell-free synthesized [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR for 15 min at 20 &#x000b0;C. Disuccinimidyl suberate was then added directly to the reaction mixture, to a final concentration of 0.1 m<sc>m</sc>, and incubated at 4 &#x000b0;C and at room temperature for 5 min to 2 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tris, pH 9.5, and 1&#x000d7; SDS sample buffer. Samples were then boiled for 15 min and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The darker radioactive band was excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Equivalent results were obtained with three other homobifunctional cross-linking agents: disuccinimidyl glutarate, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride.</p><p><italic>Mass Spectrometry</italic>&#x02014;Excised bands were processed for mass spectrometry in an automated in-gel tryptic digestion (&#x0201c;Waters MassPREP Station&#x0201d; system, Waters, MA). Following electrophoresis, blue native-PAGE gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, washed with water for 24 h, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The radioactive gel bands were excised, reduced, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin (Promega Sequencing grade modified). The resulting peptides were analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS (Waters) coupled with a Q-ToF-2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK/Waters, MA). Proteins were identified from MS/MS spectra by searching the NCBI non-redundant data base using Mas-cot MS/MS Ion Search (Matrix Science, UK). Search parameters included carbamidomethylation of cysteine, possible oxidation of methionine, and one missed cleavage per peptide. In our experiment, an individual ion score greater than 39 (&#x02013;10 log(P) at 95% confidence) indicated extensive homology; mass spectrometry scores ranged from 60 to 438.</p><p><italic>Immunoprecipitation</italic>&#x02014;Total digitonin extracts or fractions from sucrose density gradients were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C with antibodies in 25 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture. The protein-IgG complex was harvested with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, eluted by boiling for 15 min in 1&#x000d7; SDS-sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.</p><p><italic>K&#x000f6;enig's Polyanion Treatment</italic>&#x02014;K&#x000f6;enig's polyanion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) (KPA, a kind gift from Dr. Marco Colombini, University of Maryland) was dissolved in 10 m<sc>m</sc> NaOH, adjusted to pH 7.0 with 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaOAc, pH 4.0, and stored at 4 &#x000b0;C. Prior to use, the solution was equilibrated with import buffer or media as required. Two different concentrations of KPA (30 and 90 mg/ml) were incubated with COS-1 cells 24 h prior to co-transfection with StAR and the F2 fusion of the cholesterol side chain cleavage system (H<sub>2</sub>N-P450scc-AdRed-Adx-COOH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Pregnenolone concentrations in the media were then determined, and cell lysates were analyzed for StAR processing by Western blot. Western blot signals were developed by West-Pico chemilumiscent reagent (Pierce). For direct measurement of activity, mitochondria (2 &#x003bc;g of protein) were incubated with the above mentioned concentration of KPA for 2 h and then incubated with biosynthetic StAR. For transient VDAC channel blockage, mitochondria were incubated with 30 mg/ml KPA, re-isolated, and resuspended in import buffer. For analysis of StAR mitochondrial import, 100 &#x003bc;g of mitochondria were incubated with cell-free synthesized [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR in the presence of 10 to 90 mg/ml KPA. Mitochondrial [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.</p><p><italic>Blocking Phosphate Carrier Protein</italic>&#x02014;Mitochondria (20 mg of protein) isolated from adrenal tissues were incubated with 2 m<sc>m</sc> phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) or sulfo-PITC for 10 min on ice, and reactions were terminated by adding 10 m<sc>m</sc> dithiocyanate. Mitochondria were then washed twice with 10 m<sc>m</sc> dithiocyanate, resuspended in import buffer, and incubated with cell-free synthesized [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR for 2 h at 26 &#x000b0;C. In some cases, 1 m<sc>m</sc> ATP was included in the reaction mixture. Mitochondrial import was examined by analyzing a 20-&#x003bc;l aliquot by SDS-PAGE.</p><p><italic>Antibody Shift Native-PAGE and Blocking Experiments</italic>&#x02014;Cell-free synthesized [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR was imported into mitochondria (20 &#x003bc;g of protein) from MA-10 cells or sheep adrenals for 10 min. Mitochondria were then resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;l of mitochondria isolation buffer and incubated with antiserum (suspended in 40 &#x003bc;l of import buffer) for 30 min on ice. Reisolated mitochondria were washed with import buffer two times and extracted in digitonin buffer (1% digitonin) and analyzed by native-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). For antibody blocking experiments, mitochondria were incubated with IgG or VDAC1 antiserum to VDAC1 prior to import.</p><p><italic>Bioactivity in Isolated Mitochondria</italic>&#x02014;Mitochondria (2 &#x003bc;gof protein) from control or VDAC1 knockdown MA-10 cells or from adrenal tissues were resuspended in a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l of bioassay buffer (125 m<sc>m</sc> sucrose, 80 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 5 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 m<sc>m</sc> NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 m<sc>m</sc> isocitrate, 25 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, and 10 mg/ml cholesterol, pH 7.4), incubated with full-length, cell-free synthesized or biosynthetic StAR under the conditions described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Supernatants were then assayed for pregnenolone by radioimmunoassay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Generation of VDAC1 Antiserum</italic>&#x02014;Antiserum specific to VDAC1 was custom raised by Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX) against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 151&#x02013;165. New Zealand White rabbits received an initial injection of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide and 14 days later received an additional injection, followed by a booster injection on every 7th day to day 63. At this time, the antiserum titer exceeded 1:1000, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Rabbits were then sacrificed and all serum was collected. The affinity purification of VDAC1 antibody was carried out after cross-linking a peptide corresponding to residues 151&#x02013;165 of VDAC1 with a SulfoLink column following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce, Sulfolink Immobilization kit). The SulfoLink column was equilibrated at room temperature with coupling buffer. Peptide-(151&#x02013;165) (1 mg) was dissolved in coupling buffer, then coupled with the resin by mixing 15 min at room temperature on a rocker followed by an additional 30 min of incubation without rocking. The unbound peptide was removed by centrifugation and three washes with coupling buffer, then nonspecific sites of the column were blocked with 50 m<sc>m l</sc>-cysteine. Before purification, the column was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. The antiserum was purified in batches. Antiserum (2 ml) was incubated with the column on a rocker for 30 min, the unbound antibodies were removed, and the column was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl and eluted with 100 m<sc>m</sc> glycine at pH 3.0, which was immediately titrated by addition of 65 &#x003bc;l of 1.0 <sc>m</sc> Tris, pH 9.5. The purified antiserum was dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline.</p><p><italic>VDAC1 Knockdown and Development of Stable Cell Lines</italic>&#x02014;siRNA (CCCUAAAACCAGGUAUCAA) for VDAC1 was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). COS-1 and MA-10 cells were transfected with 30 and 60 pmol of VDAC1 siRNA, respectively, using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (Ambion) served as a control in all experiments. A combination of two non-targeting scrambled siRNAs (Ambion) was also included as control in all experiments. A subset of cells was co-transfected with an expression vector for VDAC1 cDNA in which two nucleotides in the siRNA target region were mutated. VDAC1 was mutated without altering the amino acid sequence as follows: CCCTAAAA(C&#x02192;T)CA(G&#x02192;A)GTATCAA. The pSilencer siRNA expression plasmid was constructed by ligating the 55-mer siRNA template into a pSilencer 4.1 CMV expression vector (Ambion, TX). Complementary 55-mer siRNA oligonucleotides (5-GATCCCCCTAAAACCAGGTATCAATTCAAGAGATTGATACCTGGTTTTAGGGAGA-3&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;-GGGGATTTTGGTCCATAGTTAAGTTCTCTAACTATGGACCAAAATCCCTCTTCGA-5&#x02032;) were annealed, ligated into pSilencer neovector (Ambion), and transformed into competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to screen for positive hairpin siRNA inserts. The accuracy of the knockdown was determined by Western blotting. For generation of stable cell lines, COS-1 and MA-10 cells were independently transfected with the purified plasmid using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, single clones were generated by limiting dilution into a selection medium containing 600 &#x003bc;g/ml G418 (Geneticin, GE Healthcare). Individual clones were then transferred to 24-well plates (Greiner, Germany) for propagation and then later transferred to 6-cm plates for transfection with StAR and F2. Individual clones were examined for VDAC1 expression by Western blotting. For knockdown of PCP, 20 pmol of PCP siRNA (GGUUAUGCCAACACUUUGATT) was transfected, as described for VDAC1 siRNA. Expression of PCP was examined 48 h after transfection. Western blotting was performed with 12.5 &#x003bc;gof protein and PCP-specific antibody (1:200) dilution. Signals were developed with West-Pico chemilumiscent reagent (Pierce).</p><p><italic>In Vitro Transcription/Translation, Mitochondrial Import, and Protein Complex Isolation</italic>&#x02014;<italic>In vitro</italic> translation was performed in the T<sc>n</sc>T rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega). Translation of cDNA was carried out in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine or unlabeled methionine with SP6 polymerase at 30 &#x000b0;C for 90 min, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ribosomes and ribosome-bound nascent polypeptide chains were removed by ultracentrifugation at 148,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. Translated proteins were allowed to undergo brief import by incubation with sheep adrenal mitochondria (100 &#x003bc;g of protein) at 26 &#x000b0;C for 10 min. For import and blocking experiments, mitochondrial import of [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR (2 &#x003bc;l) was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 26 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Partial proteolysis was carried out with 10 &#x003bc;g/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. Reactions were terminated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and heat inactivation. For analysis of the assembled proteins in the complex, mitochondria were re-isolated and lysed in digitonin buffer ((1% (w/v) digitonin, 20 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 50 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 m<sc>m</sc> phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). The digitonin lysate was combined with native-PAGE sample buffer (5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 100 m<sc>m</sc> BisTris, pH 7.0, 500 m<sc>m</sc> 6-aminocaproic acid) and subjected to 3&#x02013;16% gradient native-PAGE at 100 V overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. Protein complexes were further fractionated by applying 100 &#x003bc;l of digitonin lysate to a 30-10% sucrose density step gradient, with a 200-&#x003bc;l 66% sucrose cushion at the bottom (final volume = 2.0 ml). Following centrifugation at 55,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> in a Beckman TLA55 rotor for 4 h, the sample was immediately equally aliquoted and loaded onto gradient, native-PAGE (20 &#x003bc;l) or SDS-PAGE gels (20 &#x003bc;l). Radiolabeled proteins were detected by digital autoradiography or on a phosphorimager.</p><p><italic>Pulse-Chase Labeling Experiments</italic>&#x02014;COS-1 cells transfected with StAR or N-62 StAR were incubated with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 30 min, then labeled with 0.1 mCi of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine for 30 min. After labeling, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 m<sc>m</sc> methionine and chased for the times indicated. Cells were than scraped into immunoprecipitation buffer containing 25 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysed cells were aliquoted in smaller fractions and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, as described above.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of the interaction of VDAC1 with StAR on the OMM.</bold><italic>A</italic>, simplified scheme of steroid hormone biosynthesis. <italic>B</italic>, disuccinimidyl suberate cross-linking (<italic>CR</italic>) of [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR synthesized in a cell-free transcription/translation system to OMM proteins on fresh mitochondria at 4 &#x000b0;C and at room temperature (<italic>R</italic>).

[<sup>35</sup>S]StAR synthesized in a cell-free system was chemically cross-linked to OMM proteins on freshly prepared sheep adrenal mitochondria using disuccinimidyl suberate. This consistently generated a 75-kDa consistent complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Other homobifunctional cross-linkers cross-linked a band of similar size (not shown). This 75-kDa band was specific as observed on titration with different concentrations of cross-linkers (data not shown). Mass spectrometry showed that the bands at about 50 and 60 kDa did not contain StAR, and that the dark band at 50 kDa was globulin. Considering the specificity of the cross-linking products, the 75-kDa band was excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. In 12 experiments, 5 peptides corresponding to VDAC1 were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>); two of these, LTFDSSFSPNTGK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>) and VTQSNFAVGYK (not shown), were seen in 10 of 12 experiments. A model structure of VDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) indicates these two peptides are exposed to cytoplasm. Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked proteins with StAR and VDAC1 antibodies also yielded a 75-kDa band, whereas immunoprecipitation with antisera to Tom 40, PBR, or VDAC2 did not, demonstrating the specificity of the StAR-VDAC1 interaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). The relatively minor band above the major 75-kDa band did not yield enough protein for mass spectrometric analysis, even when multiple gel fractions were pooled together.</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p><bold>VDAC1 peptides identified by MS/MS</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><bold>Position</bold></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><bold><italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub></bold></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><bold>Sequence</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> 53-60 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 833.44 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> VTGSLETK </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> 256-265 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 1029.58 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> LTLSALLDGK </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> 163-173 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 1212.59 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"><bold>VTQSNFAVGYK</bold><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1"><bold><sup><italic>a</italic></sup></bold></xref></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> 96-108 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 1399.68 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"><bold>LTFDSSFSPNTGK</bold><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1"><bold><sup><italic>a</italic></sup></bold></xref></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> 34-52 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"> 1958.82 </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> SENGLEFTSSGSANTETTK </td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>a</label><p>Frequently associated with StAR.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p><italic>Role of VDAC1 in StAR Activity</italic>&#x02014;To understand the significance of StAR-VDAC1 interactions, we used siRNA to knockdown VDAC1 in COS-1 cells co-transfected with expression vectors for StAR and the F2 fusion protein of the cholesterol side chain cleavage system (H<sub>2</sub>N-P450scc-Ad-Red-Adx-COOH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), or for F2 and StAR lacking 62 N-terminal residues (N-62 StAR), which is as active as full-length StAR but is not imported into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>). Knockdown of VDAC1 inhibited pregnenolone synthesis, but synthesis could be restored by co-transfecting a VDAC-1 expression plasmid in which two nucleotides within the siRNA region were mutated. As an alternative to siRNA-mediated VDAC1 knockdown, cells were treated with KPA, a selective inhibitor of VDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), reducing activity by 74% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>F</italic></xref>). VDAC1 is associated with adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) on the IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Bongkrekic acid blocks the transfer of phosphate across the IMM and atractyloside inhibits transport of phosphate from the OMM to IMM by blocking ANT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Blocking of ANT with bongkrekic acid or atractyloside in COS-1 cells cotransfected with StAR and F2 showed no effect on pregnenolone synthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>G</italic></xref>). Water-soluble 22(<italic>R</italic>)-OH cholesterol, which bypasses the action of StAR, retained equivalent activity in all conditions, indicating that absence of VDAC1 did not affect P450scc. Similarly, when StAR was incubated with steroidogenic mitochondria, no pregnenolone was synthesized in the presence of KPA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>H</italic></xref>), but ANT blockers had no effect (not shown). Re-isolation of the KPA-treated mitochondria and reincubation with StAR restored pregnenolone synthesis, showing that temporary blocking of VDAC1 prevented cholesterol delivery. These results provide evidence that StAR-VDAC1 interactions are required for mitochondrial cholesterol import.</p><p>Western blotting showed that VDAC1 knockdown in StAR-transfected cells reduced expression of the 37-kDa precursor, 32-kDa intermediate, and 30-kDa mature forms of StAR, respectively, and that there is no expression of phosphorylated StAR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Western blotting of COS-1 cells co-transfected with F2, N-62 StAR, and a VDAC1 knockdown vector showed reduced expression of phospho-StAR, but the expression of nonphosphorylated N-62 StAR remained unaltered (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). This effect is specific to StAR, as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial COX-IV remained unchanged in VDAC1 knockdown cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Surprisingly, blocking VDAC1 after preincubating the cells with two different concentrations of KPA suppressed the processing of phosphorylated 32-kDa StAR to 30-kDa StAR in transfected COS-1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). Pulse-chase experiments of StAR-transfected COS-1 cells showed no processing of 32 to 30-kDa phospho-StAR in the presence of KPA, but processing of non-phosphorylated StAR was not altered (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>). These results suggest that processing from 32 to 30 kDa phospho-StAR requires VDAC1.</p><p>We next addressed how VDAC1 influences StAR phosphorylation and activity. The import kinetics of [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR with mitochondria from normal or VDAC-1 knockdown COS-1 cells were almost identical (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>). Cell-free synthesized StAR is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) and VDAC1 is necessary for the processing of StAR, thus the import of [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR remained unchanged in VDAC1 knockdown cells. In the absence of VDAC1, StAR might be misfolded, rendering it susceptible to proteolytic degradation. To test this hypothesis, VDAC1 knockdown cells were incubated with MG132, lactacystin, and E64; MG132 and lactacystin are proteasomal inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>), whereas E64 is an inhibitor of cysteine proteases but not proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Pregnenolone synthesis was marginally increased with MG132 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>F</italic></xref>), but lactacystin had no effect on StAR activity or expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>G</italic></xref>). Surprisingly, pregnenolone synthesis was restored to 100% with E64 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>F</italic></xref>), accompanied by restoration of 37- and 32-kDa phospho-StAR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>G</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom panel</italic>). Increased levels of the non-phosphorylated 37- and 32-kDa StAR were seen in cells treated with MG132 and E64 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>G</italic></xref>, <italic>top panel</italic>), suggesting that these proteasome inhibitors protected non-phosphorylated StAR. These data suggest that misfolded StAR cannot remain in the cytoplasm and is degraded by cysteine proteases.</p><p><italic>Identification of PCP</italic>&#x02014;It is not clear how StAR is dephosphorylated in the absence of VDAC1. Yeast mitochondria have a 32-kDa PCP that mediates phosphate transport across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). PCP was initially identified in mitochondrial contact sites, but has also been found in the OMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Methotrexate binds to cytosolic dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), so that addition of methotrexate during import of a mitochondrially targeted protein fused with DHFR at the C terminus will retain the protein at the OMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). To explore the potential role of PCP in StAR activity, we examined sheep adrenal mitochondrial import of [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR-DHFR (1&#x02013;284 StAR + 2&#x02013;224 DHFR) with or without methotrexate. Analysis of digitonin lysates of the StAR-DHFR complex on a 3&#x02013;16% gradient native-PAGE revealed a band of about 140 kDa containing wild-type StAR, but not the inactive mutant, R182L StAR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). In the absence of methotrexate StAR-DHFR formed a weak complex of lower apparent molecular weight (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). The complex resisted mild proteolysis with proteinase K (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>), suggesting that StAR was bound tightly. Following sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, the complex was found in fractions 7&#x02013;11 and was resistant to proteinase K, whereas fractions 12&#x02013;16 were digested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>) possibly indicating that they represented aggregates. The bands in fractions 7&#x02013;11 were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry, identifying StAR, VDAC1, and PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). In 6 experiments, 7 peptides corresponding to PCP were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>); one peptide was seen in all 6 experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>); no differences were seen among fractions 7&#x02013;11. Co-immunoprecipitation with antisera to VDAC1, StAR, and PCP confirmed the association of PCP and VDAC1 with StAR in fractions 7&#x02013;11 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Antisera specific for VDAC residues 151&#x02013;165, StAR, or PCP supershifted [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR from the complex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>), whereas preimmune serum or PBR antiserum did not, demonstrating specific association of StAR with VDAC1 and PCP.

This PCP knockdown in cells cotransfected with StAR and F2 blocked pregnenolone synthesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), suggesting that PCP is essential for maintaining phosphorylated StAR. To determine whether PCP stimulates ATP levels, we examined the effect of ATP on StAR activity by depleting ATP via serum starvation or drug inhibition, in contrast to supplementing with exogenously added ATP. VDAC1 knockdown decreased intracellular ATP to 40% compared with control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>), but exogenously added ATP did not restore StAR activity (not shown). Depletion of PCP or serum starving the cells for 48 h reduced ATP levels to 10%. A similar reduction in ATP was seen after incubating cells with the ATP inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose or the electron transport inhibitor, rotenone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). As expected, incubation with rotenone or 2-deoxyglucose reduced pregnenolone synthesis similarly to knockdown of VDAC1 or PCP in COS-1 cells co-transfected with StAR and F2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). Consistent with the PCP knockdown experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>), preincubation of mitochondria with the irreversible mitochondrial phosphate carrier inhibitors, PITC or <italic>p</italic>-sulfo-PITC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), blocked the import of [<sup>35</sup>S]StAR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>). Similar results were obtained in response to mersalyl, a reversible sulfhydryl blocking reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). The addition of mersalyl to <italic>p</italic>-sulfo-PITC-treated mitochondria did not rescue StAR import, but StAR import was restored by adding ATP to mitochondria preincubated with PITC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>).

These results indicate that PCP regulates phosphate availability needed for StAR phosphorylation.

StAR acts exclusively on the OMM prior to import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), must undergo a structural transition to exert activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>), and phosphorylation of Ser<sup>195</sup> augments its steroidogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). The ability of StAR to transfer cholesterol between membranes is distinct from its ability to induce steroidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). The proposal that StAR acts through an OMM receptor was challenged by data showing it had activity with mitochondria subjected to proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Nevertheless, substantial data suggest that cholesterol import into mitochondria requires the 18-kDa PBR on the OMM. PBR has five transmembrane domains; its N terminus binds benzodiazepines that stimulate steroidogenesis and its C terminus binds cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). A functional association with StAR is indicated by the loss of StAR activity in PBR-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Several proteins appear to interact with PBR, including VDAC1 and ANT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>), a 10-kDa protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>), PRAX-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>), and PBR-associated protein 7 (PAP7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). Photoaffinity labeled PBR forms a complex of 170&#x02013;210 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>) or 200&#x02013;240 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), but these complexes did not include StAR. Therefore the nature of the StAR receptor has been unclear. We have now shown that StAR directly interacts with VDAC1 and PCP on the OMM.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Role of phosphate carrier protein in pregnenolone synthesis.</bold><italic>A</italic>, Western blot.

The association with PCP is consistent with the need to phosphorylate StAR to achieve maximal activity. StAR appears to be phosphorylated by PKA, and PAP7 appears to act as an anchoring protein to promote the interaction of PBR and PKA regulatory subunit 1a (PKAR1&#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). PCP may play a role in delivering phosphate to PKAR1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Only the cytoplasmically exposed domains of VDAC1 interacted with StAR, and the C terminus of StAR formed contacts with VDAC1, consistent with data that this domain of StAR also interacts with synthetic membrane models of the OMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). We suggest that StAR acts by interacting with VDAC1, which is part of a larger OMM complex including StAR, VDAC1, PCP, PBR, PAP7, PKAR1&#x003b1;, and possibly other proteins. It remains unclear whether VDAC1 forms the channel through which cholesterol passes or if this function is served by PBR. As VDAC1 knock-out mice are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>) but PBR knockouts are embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>), we suggest that the channel is formed by PBR in association with other proteins.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Charles Wood for adrenal tissues, Dr. Marco Colombini for the K&#x000f6;enig's polyanion and for reviewing an earlier version of this manuscript, Dr. Steven King for the phospho-StAR antibody, Dr. Vivian Aires for VDAC2 antibody, and Drs.
