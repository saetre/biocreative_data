In this study, we investigate the functional relationship between ciliary PDGFR-&#x003b1; and the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE1 in directional cell migration. NHE1 messenger RNA and protein levels are up-regulated in NIH3T3 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) during growth arrest, which is concomitant with cilium formation.

In growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells, NHE1 is activated by the specific PDGFR-&#x003b1; ligand PDGF-AA. In wound-healing assays on growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells and wild-type MEFs, NHE1 inhibition by 5&#x02032;-(<italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-isopropyl) amiloride potently reduces PDGF-AA&#x02013;mediated directional migration.

PDGF-AA failed to stimulate migration in NHE1-null fibroblasts. In conclusion, stimulation of directional migration in response to ciliary PDGFR-&#x003b1; signals is specifically dependent on NHE1 activity, indicating that NHE1 activation is a critical event in the physiological response to PDGFR-&#x003b1; stimulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The process of cell migration is pivotal to many fundamental physiological processes, including embryonic and fetal development, immune responses, wound healing, and tissue homeostasis. Consequently, altered function of components of the migratory machinery is associated with severe pathophysiological conditions, including developmental defects, chronic inflammatory diseases, and cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwab et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Cell migration is a complex multistep process involving extensive cytoskeletal rearrangement and the concerted action of multiple ion transport proteins and membrane receptors. These processes result in the formation of lamellipodia and other protrusive structures and in local changes of cell&#x02013;matrix interactions and cell volume, which collectively enable the cell to move forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwab et al., 2007</xref>). Directional migration relies on the ability of the cell to sense and react to chemosensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu, 2005</xref>) such as PDGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heldin and Westermark, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jechlinger et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, exposure to PDGF activates the ubiquitous plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cassel et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yan et al., 2001</xref>), which is a central player in the regulation of proliferation, survival, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Putney et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pedersen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stock and Schwab, 2006</xref>). We and others have demonstrated an essential role for NHE1 in cell migration and invasion in many cell types, including a variety of cancer cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lagana et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denker and Barber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stock et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardone et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stuwe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayashi et al., 2008</xref>). In migrating cells such as fibroblasts or epithelial cells, NHE1 localizes predominantly to the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lagana et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cardone et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stock et al., 2007</xref>), and findings in fibroblasts indicate that NHE1 activity and attachment to the ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family of plasma membrane F-actin linker proteins are required for cell polarity and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denker and Barber, 2002</xref>). This is of substantial interest in the context of human cancers, in which metastatic capacity is linked to increased expression of NHE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardone et al., 2005b</xref>). However, the possible link between PDGF signaling and NHE1 in migration/chemotaxis has not previously been addressed.</p><p>PDGF exists as homo- or heterodimers of PDGF-A, -B, -C, and -D chains. Although PDGF-BB activates both homo- and heterodimers of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) &#x003b1; and PDGFR-&#x003b2;, PDGF-AA is specific for the PDGFR-&#x003b1; homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heldin and Westermark, 1999</xref>). Both PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB have been shown to stimulate migration in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shure et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, we showed that PDGFR-&#x003b1; signaling is coordinated by the primary cilium in mammalian fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>). PDGFR-&#x003b1;, which is encoded by a growth arrest&#x02013;specific (gas) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lih et al., 1996</xref>), is targeted to the primary cilium, where ligand-dependent activation of the receptor and of the ERK1/2 and protein kinase B/Akt pathways is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>; unpublished data). The primary cilium is an essential sensory organelle in most growth-arrested mammalian cells and coordinates a series of critical signal transduction pathways in development and tissue homeostasis, which, in addition to PDGFR-&#x003b1; signaling, include the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>). In NIH3T3 fibroblasts, we previously showed that primary cilia are virtually absent in nonconfluent cycling interphase cells but grow on almost all confluent quiescent growth-arrested cells within 24 h of serum starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, serum-starved wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) grow normal primary cilia that coordinate PDGFR-&#x003b1;&#x02013;mediated signal transduction and directional cell migration, whereas defects in assembly of the primary cilium in <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> MEFs block these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>; unpublished data). These results indicate that the primary cilium is part of the positioning machinery that coordinates cell polarity, which is essential for wound healing and developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schneider and Haugh, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the interactions between the primary cilium and NHE1 in PDGFR-&#x003b1;&#x02013;dependent directional cell migration. We demonstrate that NHE1 mRNA and protein levels are increased during growth arrest independent of the formation of the primary cilium. In contrast, NHE1 activity is strongly attenuated by serum deprivation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts, which is coincident with the time course of primary cilia appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>). NHE1 activity is partly restored by stimulation with PDGF-AA, which also stimulates directional cell migration (unpublished data). Inhibition of NHE1 activity by 5&#x02032;-(<italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) potently inhibits PDGF-AA&#x02013;mediated directional cell migration in growth-arrested WT MEFs in which primary cilia are present, whereas migration in growth-arrested <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> mutant MEFs is unaffected by either PDGF-AA or EIPA. Furthermore, PDGF-AA fails to stimulate migration in NHE1-deficient fibroblasts. We conclude that in fibroblasts, PDGFR-&#x003b1; signaling initiated in the primary cilium controls directional migration responses via up-regulation of NHE1 activity, indicating that NHE1 activation is a critical event in the physiological response to activation of PDGFR-&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression and localization of NHE1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and in WT and <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> MEFs</title><p>We first asked whether NHE1 is up-regulated during growth arrest in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (i.e., concomitant with formation of the primary cilium).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> (top), the NHE1 mRNA level was up-regulated about twofold after both 12 and 48 h of serum starvation.

Collectively, these data indicate that NHE1 is a gas protein but that, in contrast to the up-regulation of PDGFR-&#x003b1; during growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>), up-regulation of NHE1 is independent of assembly of the primary cilium. In growth-arrested WT and <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> MEFs, NHE1 localized to the plasma membrane, in particular to lamellipodia-like structures at the edges of the cells and intracellularly, in perinuclear membranes and in a cytoplasmic vesicular-like pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B, c and d</xref>). A similar pattern of localization was observed in NIH3T3 cells (unpublished data). The NHE1 localization pattern was not detectably different in WT or <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> MEFs after 1 h of exposure to 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA (<italic>n</italic> = 3; unpublished data). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NHE1 expression is up-regulated concomitant with formation of the primary cilium and that neither expression nor localization of NHE1 are compromised in <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> MEFs.</p></sec><sec><title>NHE1 activity in NIH3T3 cells</title><p>Because NHE1 activity is very tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pedersen, 2006</xref>), an up-regulation of NHE1 expression does not mean that NHE1 activity is also up-regulated. To address this point, NHE1 activity was determined in NIH3T3 fibroblasts using an NH<sub>4</sub>Cl prepulse, which is a classical protocol for evaluating intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) recovery after an acid load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boron, 2004</xref>). In this protocol, the cells initially rapidly alkalinize as NH<sub>3</sub> diffuses across the plasma membrane and combines with cytosolic H<sup>+</sup>. This is followed by a second phase of slow acidification as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> enters the cells (e.g., through K<sup>+</sup> channels) and, finally, a rapid acidification when NH<sub>3</sub> rushes out as extracellular NH<sub>4</sub>Cl is removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). In interphase cells under control conditions, the rate of pH<sub>i</sub> recovery after acidification was 0.24 &#x000b1; 0.03 pH units/min (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and recovery was nearly abolished in the presence of 5 &#x000b5;M of the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger inhibitor EIPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and D</xref>). Because we previously established that NHE2, a related Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger isoform that is also partially EIPA sensitive, is not detectable in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rentsch et al., 2007</xref>), this indicates that NHE1 is the major effector in pH<sub>i</sub> regulation after an acid load in these cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Roles of NHE1 and PDGFR-&#x003b1; in pH<sub>i</sub> regulation in NIH3T3 cells during interphase and growth arrest.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Original tracings of pH<sub>i</sub> recovery measurements in the absence and presence of 5 &#x000b5;M EIPA. 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl was present in the Ringer&#x02019;s solution as indicated by the horizontal line. Cells grown in the presence of serum (A), cells which had been serum starved for 48 h (B), and serum-starved cells treated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA for 1 h before the experiment (C) are shown. It may be noted that the rate of slow acidification in the presence of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, representing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> influx via either K<sup>+</sup> channels or other transporters with substrate affinity for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boron, 2004</xref>), is reduced in the growth-arrested cells in the absence but not in the presence of PDGF-AA. This indicates that these transporters are regulated during the cell cycle and also means that the total acidification after NH<sub>4</sub>Cl removal is less in the growth-arrested cells. However, this does not affect the comparison between the recovery rates in the absence and presence of EIPA. (D) Summary of the pH<sub>i</sub> recovery rates under the conditions shown. The rate of pH<sub>i</sub> recovery (in pH units/minute) was calculated from the slope of the initial linear part of the curve after NH<sub>4</sub>Cl removal.

The slope of this curve, obtained by linear regression, corresponds to the velocity of directional movement into the wound. The slope of the corresponding plots for the movement parallel to the wound edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, the y direction) was always close to zero (not depicted), indicating that movement in this direction was random and essentially nonprogressing so that directional movement occurred only perpendicular to the wound edge. The directional migration data for growth-arrested, PDGF-AA&#x02013;treated NIH3T3 cells are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>.

As seen, the level of PDGFR-&#x003b1; expression and the ability of PDGF-AA to induce Tyr<sup>754</sup> phosphorylation of PDGFR-&#x003b1; were unaffected by the presence of EIPA. Furthermore, neither EIPA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806019/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>) nor siRNA-mediated knockdown of NHE1 (Fig. S1 B) significantly affected the ability of fibroblasts to form primary cilia. These results show that the inhibitory effect of EIPA on PDGF-AA&#x02013;induced cell migration is not caused by an effect of cilia formation and that EIPA exerts its effect on NHE1 downstream from activation of PDGFR-&#x003b1;. Finally, confirming that the effect of EIPA on cell migration reflected inhibition of NHE1, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NHE1 inhibited cell migration (Fig. S1 C).</p><p>Next, we performed similar experiments on WT MEFs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref> shows the trajectories of growth-arrested WT MEFs in the presence of PDGF-AA and in the absence and presence of EIPA, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref> provides statistical summaries (see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806019/DC1">Videos 1&#x02013;3</ext-link>).

Similar to what was seen in the growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells, the effect of EIPA was substantially greater in the presence of PDGF-AA, but in WT MEFs, this effect was even more pronounced than in NIH3T3 cells. Inhibition of NHE1 by 10 &#x000b5;M EIPA had no statistically significant effect on translocation in WT MEFs in the absence of PDGF-AA but nearly abolished translocation in the PDGF-AA&#x02013;treated WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref> shows WT MEFs migrating into the wound and illustrates the x and y axes used to estimate directionality, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref> summarizes the directionality data.

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 (A and B)</xref>, the translocation of interphase NIH3T3 cells was 60.0 &#x000b1; 8.7 &#x000b5;m (17 cells in three experiments) under control conditions. Inhibition of NHE1 by 10 &#x000b5;M EIPA reduced translocation by &#x0223c;50% to 30.0 &#x000b1; 3.0 &#x000b5;m (25 cells in three experiments). Importantly, in the interphase NIH3T3 cells, stimulation with PDGF-AA did not increase translocation, and NHE1 inhibition similarly reduced translocation after PDGF-AA stimulation by &#x0223c;50% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). This indicated that the role of NHE1 in translocation was reduced in interphase NIH3T3 cells compared with growth-arrested, PDGF-AA&#x02013;treated cells, in which EIPA inhibited translocation by &#x0223c;70% (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Therefore, we next addressed whether this was also the case for directional migration. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, in interphase NIH3T3 cells, migration into the wound proceeded at a velocity of 0.173 &#x000b1; 0.002 &#x000b5;m/min under control conditions and was reduced by &#x0223c;55% to 0.077 &#x000b1; 0.001 &#x000b5;m/min in the presence of EIPA compared with 75% in the growth-arrested cells (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>).

To this end, we performed 5-h wound-healing assays similar to those performed on NIH3T3 cells and MEFs on growth-arrested NHE1-null PS120 fibroblasts (PSNEO) and on growth-arrested PS120 fibroblasts stably expressing NHE1 (PS120-NHE1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denker et al., 2000</xref>). In the growth-arrested state, these cells migrated relatively slowly in wound-healing assays. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, the mean translocation of the NHE1-expressing cells was 5.8 &#x000b1; 0.60 &#x000b5;m (<italic>n</italic> = 52 cells in six independent experiments) and 8.9 &#x000b1; 0.71 &#x000b5;m (<italic>n</italic> = 63 cells in six independent experiments) in the absence and presence of PDGF-AA stimulation, respectively (i.e., exposure to PDGF-AA&#x02013;stimulated translocation; P &#x0003c; 0.01). In the NHE1-null cells, the mean translocation in the 5-h wound-healing assay was 6.6 &#x000b1; 0.65 &#x000b5;m (<italic>n</italic> = 45 cells in four independent experiments) and 6.7 &#x000b1; 0.54 &#x000b5;m (<italic>n</italic> = 64 cells in four independent experiments) in the absence and presence of PDGF-AA stimulation, respectively (i.e., in these cells, there was no effect of 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA on translocation). Thus, despite the fact that growth-arrested PS120 fibroblasts migrate slower than NIH3T3 cells and WT MEFs, these results confirm our conclusion that cells with primary cilia only respond to PDGF-AA stimulation when NHE1 can be activated. However, we noted that, compared with NHE1-expressing cells, NHE1-null cells exhibited reduced, although not abolished, PDGFR-&#x003b1; activation in response to PDGF-AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>), reflecting a significantly reduced number of primary cilia in the NHE1-null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Therefore, the extent to which these factors contribute to the lack of PDGF-AA&#x02013;mediated stimulation of migration in NHE1-null cells requires further investigation. Importantly, this is not a concern for the EIPA-treated cells because EIPA affected neither the ability of cells to form primary cilia (Fig. S1 A) nor the activation of PDGFR-&#x003b1; by PDGF-AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Migration, PDGFR-&#x003b1; activation, and cilia formation in NHE1-null and NHE1-expressing cells.</bold> (A) PS120 (expressing NHE1) and PSNEO (deficient for NHE1) cells were serum starved for 48 h to induce growth arrest, and migration was analyzed in 4-h wound-healing assays in the absence and presence of 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA, as indicated.

In this study, we demonstrate that the expression but not the activity of the ubiquitous Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE1 is up-regulated upon quiescence in serum-free medium, identifying NHE1 as a gas protein. Moreover, we show that NHE1 activity is required for control of directional cell migration by ciliary PDGFR-&#x003b1; signaling, indicating that NHE1 activation is a critical event in the physiological response to activation of PDGFR-&#x003b1;.</p><p>The marked, reversible up-regulation of NHE1 protein levels upon growth arrest observed in fibroblasts appears to occur at the transcriptional level because NHE1 mRNA levels were increased to a similar extent. A similar level of up-regulation of NHE1 expression upon serum deprivation was previously reported in kidney epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carraro-Lacroix et al., 2006</xref>). Up-regulation of NHE1 expression during growth arrest in <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> MEFs occurs at a level comparable with that in WT MEFs, indicating that up-regulation proceeds through mechanisms that are independent of ciliary assembly. This is in sharp contrast to the up-regulation of PDGFR-&#x003b1; during growth arrest, which is blocked in <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>). In a previous study in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing a fragment of the NHE1 promoter, it was reported that the addition of serum (from a serum level of 0.5 to 10%) increased NHE1 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Besson et al., 1998</xref>). This could indicate that the growth arrest&#x02013;induced increase in mRNA and protein levels observed in this study reflects increased mRNA stability. However, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity, which is a well-known consequence of serum deprivation in NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>), was reported to stimulate NHE1 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Besson et al., 1998</xref>), which appears to be in accordance with the present finding that NHE1 expression is increased during growth arrest. The promoter region of NHE1 contains binding sites for several transcription factors, which are known or likely known to be regulated by serum deprivation, including AP-1 and cAMP response element&#x02013;binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller et al., 1991</xref>); however, the potential roles of these proteins in the up-regulation of NHE1 observed in this study remain to be tested.</p><p>In contrast to the up-regulation of NHE1 expression in growth-arrested cells, NHE1 activity in NIH3T3 cells was strongly reduced during growth arrest, a finding which is in agreement with studies on other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reshkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lehoux et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, in spite of increased expression, NHE1 activity was lower in quiescent cells, presumably reflecting a very tight control of NHE1 activity under these conditions. Recent work has demonstrated a permissive role for an NHE1-mediated increase in pH<sub>i</sub> in cell cycle progression, apparently through regulation of cyclin D expression and Cdc2 kinase activity and, thus, G2/M entry and transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putney and Barber, 2003</xref>). It is likely that up-regulation of NHE1 expression, but tight repression of its activity, serves to prepare the cell such that it can elicit a rapid intracellular alkalinization at the appropriate time for reentry into the cell cycle upon delivery of the relevant signal. Thus, the dual control of NHE1 at the expression and posttranscriptional levels may serve as a form of coincidence detection, ensuring that these processes are tightly regulated both by cell cycle stage and by the availability of the relevant ligand. A similar mechanism likely pertains to the control of other NHE1-dependent processes (a case in point being the directional migration process addressed in this study). Finally, although our findings clearly show that the increase in NHE1 expression was not dependent on the formation of the primary cilium, the close temporal correlation between these two important consequences of growth arrest warrants future investigations.</p><p>Exposure of growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells to the specific PDGFR-&#x003b1; ligand PDGF-AA partially restored NHE1 activity, which is measured as the global, cytoplasmic NHE1-dependent pH<sub>i</sub> recovery after acidification. Although activation of NHE1 by nonisoform-discriminating PDGFR ligands has been demonstrated in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cassel et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yan et al., 2001</xref>), this is, to our knowledge, the first study to show that a specific PDGFR-&#x003b1; ligand activates NHE1.</p><p>Consistent with the marked decrease in NHE1 activity in quiescent cells, migration was strongly reduced in growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells. In addition to stimulating NHE1 activity, PDGF-AA markedly stimulated directional cell migration in growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells in a manner fully dependent on NHE1 activity. In growth-arrested WT MEFs, which, similar to growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells, have a primary cilium, both the net translocation and the directionality of PDGF-AA&#x02013;mediated migration were similarly dependent on NHE1 activity. In congruence with the involvement of NHE1, PDGF-AA had no effect on translocation in NHE1-null fibroblasts. In the NHE1-null fibroblasts, reduced PDGFR-&#x003b1; activation may also have contributed to this effect because these cells have problems forming primary cilia as compared with their NHE1-expressing counterparts. As neither EIPA nor acute siRNA-mediated NHE1 knockdown affected cilia formation in NIH3T3 cells, this clearly does not represent a role for NHE1 in cilia formation but appears to be an anomaly reflecting long-term genetic alterations in the PSNEO cells, which was not further addressed in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Putney and Barber, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In marked contrast, in <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> MEFs, which are deficient in primary cilia and, thus, in PDGFR-&#x003b1; expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>), migration was unaffected by PDGF-AA and only very modestly affected by EIPA, further supporting the notion of a PDGFR-&#x003b1;&#x02013;NHE1 axis being required for directional migration. Because PDGF-AA activates only the homodimeric PDGFR-&#x003b1; receptor, which is virtually only localized in the primary cilium, whereas NHE1 is activated at the leading edge of the cell, this poses the question of how activation of NHE1 may act at a distance. NHE1 in both WT and <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> MEFs localized to the cell surface in the leading edge, which is in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lagana et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denker and Barber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stock et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frantz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stuwe et al., 2007</xref>), but also to intracellular vesicle-like structures. It remains a possibility that when PDGF-AA is added to the medium, NHE1 may be transported to the lamellipodial plasma membrane at a higher level in quiescent WT cells, presumably by vesicular exocytosis. However, our initial observations have not convincingly shown an increase in overall plasma membrane localization of NHE1 after PDGF-AA treatment.</p><p>Several mechanisms may underlie the linkage between ciliary PDGFR-&#x003b1; signaling and NHE1 activation. One possible pathway is through ERK1/2 and its effector p90RSK, which activates NHE1 by direct phosphorylation on Ser<sup>703</sup> of its C-terminal tail, after several types of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takahashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuello et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with such a mechanism, we have previously shown that ERK1/2 is activated in NIH3T3 cells and WT MEFs but not in <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> MEFs in response to PDGFR-&#x003b1; activation in the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>). The PI3K&#x02013;Akt pathway is also activated in MEFs downstream of PDGFR-&#x003b1; activation (unpublished data) and could also contribute to NHE1 stimulation, e.g., by direct phosphorylation of NHE1 (Ser<sup>648</sup> of human NHE1 being a high-probability consensus site for phosphorylation by Akt1) and/or by inducing actin and microtubule cytoskeletal rearrangements.</p><p>In contrast to the almost complete ablation of PDGF-AA&#x02013;mediated migration by EIPA in cells with primary cilia (i.e., growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells and WT MEFs), migration of cells lacking cilia (i.e., interphase NIH3T3 cells and <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> MEFs) had a substantial EIPA-insensitive component. This was also the case for unstimulated, growth-arrested cells and points to redundancy and/or compensatory mechanisms in basal cell migration. In accordance with this view, translocation in the absence of PDGF-AA was similar in growth-arrested NHE1-null and NHE1-expressing PS120 fibroblasts. In contrast, during interphase growth, the rate of cell migration was previously found to be &#x0223c;40% lower in NHE1-null compared with NHE1-expressing PS120 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denker and Barber, 2002</xref>), which is comparable with the difference between growth-arrested and interphase NIH3T3 cells seen in this study. The difference between interphase and growth-arrested cells presumably reflects the fact that although NHE1 expression is up-regulated in growth-arrested cells, NHE1 activity is essentially absent (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> for NIH3T3 cells). Collectively, these data indicate that the relative role of NHE1 in directional cell migration is cell cycle state and cell type dependent and that other ion transport proteins can fulfill roles similar to that of NHE1 under some conditions. A major candidate is Na<sup>+</sup>-HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> cotransport, for which a role in cell migration was previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schwab et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>A recent study showed that Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport appeared more important than NHE1 in pH<sub>i</sub> regulation in both WT and <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> choroid plexus epithelia in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banizs et al., 2007</xref>). This only partial role for NHE1 in pH<sub>i</sub> regulation contrasts with the fact that during growth arrest when primary cilia were present, both NIH3T3 cells and WT MEFs were fully dependent on NHE1 activity for PDGF-AA&#x02013;mediated migration. Notably, NHE1 played a greater role in global pH<sub>i</sub> recovery after acidification in interphase NIH3T3 cells than in growth-arrested, PDGF-AA&#x02013;treated NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), but the relative contribution of NHE1 to both translocation and directional migration was greater in the latter. In other words, there is no strong correlation between the effect of NHE1 on global pH<sub>i</sub> and its role in directional migration. These data reinforce the possibility that the role of NHE1 in directional migration in response to ciliary PDGFR-&#x003b1; signaling involves a local signaling circuit at the leading edge of the migrating cells and does not reflect the contribution of the transporter to global pH<sub>i</sub> recovery. We can envision a sequences as follows: when PDGF-AA is added, (a) important ciliary PDGFR-&#x003b1; signaling components are activated, (b) the activation of downstream signaling components (e.g., ERK1/2 or Akt) activates NHE1 in the cell membrane for ion transport or alternatively promotes increased lamellipodial localization of NHE1, and (c) at the leading edge, NHE1, in turn, is pivotal for the F-actin organization required for cell migration. The effect of NHE1 on F-actin organization may be mediated via effects on Cdc42 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frantz et al., 2007</xref>), on protein kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2007a</xref>), or as a consequence of direct pH sensitivity of F-actin regulatory proteins such as cofilin or talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srivastava et al., 2007</xref>). Another possible pathway involves the interaction of NHE1 with ERM proteins, which has been found to play a role in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denker and Barber, 2002</xref>) as well as in Akt activation after some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2004</xref>) albeit not all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rasmussen et al., 2008</xref>) stimuli.</p><p>In a few experiments, we observed by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis a weak localization of NHE1 to primary cilia of NIH3T3 cells (unpublished data), although, in most cases, we could not detect increased NHE1 labeling in the cilium. NHE1 contains two unique ciliary targeting peptide motifs, including an N-terminal sequence motif (R14IFP), which is similar to that required for ciliary targeting of the transient receptor potential ion channel, and polycystin-2 (R6VXP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geng et al., 2006</xref>). Although speculative at this point, it is thus possible that NHE1 has dual functions, i.e., in the primary cilium, where PDGFR-&#x003b1;&#x02013;mediated signal transduction is initiated, and in the plasma membrane, where NHE1 is activated at the leading edge of migrating cells.</p><p>Thus, we have shown in this study that NHE1 activity is specifically required for PDGF-AA&#x02013;mediated stimulation of fibroblast migration in a manner downstream from activation of PDGFR-&#x003b1; and not reflecting a role for NHE1 in formation of the primary cilium. Although a role for leading-edge NHE1 activity in cell polarity and directional migration has been demonstrated in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lagana et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denker and Barber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Patel and Barber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stock et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frantz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stuwe et al., 2007</xref>), this study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate a pivotal role of NHE1 in the response to chemical stimuli detected and transmitted through the primary cilium. These findings support the notion that the primary cilium functions as a cellular positioning detector in directional cell migration. Therefore, the interplay between the primary cilium and NHE1 may be critical to the physiological response to PDGFR-&#x003b1; signaling in development processes and tissue homeostasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>Experiments were performed on NIH3T3 fibroblasts, WT and <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> mutant MEFs, NHE1-null PS120 fibroblasts (denoted PSNEO), and PS120 fibroblasts stably expressing NHE1 (provided by D.

Fibroblasts (interphase or quiescent as indicated) were grown to 80&#x02013;90% confluency in 12.5-cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks, and a wound was scratched in the cell layer using a fine sterile pipette tip. The culture medium was changed to fresh, serum-free medium, and the cells were allowed to recover for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> before recording. The cells were placed in a heated chamber (37&#x000b0;C) on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 25 or Axiovert 40C; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with 10&#x000d7; or 20&#x000d7; objectives. Migration into the wound was monitored for &#x0223c;5 h with a video camera (XT-ST70CE and XC-77CE; Hamamatsu Photonics) controlled by HiPic software (Hamamatsu Photonics). In some experiments, cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA in the absence or presence of 10 &#x000b5;M EIPA. Images were taken at 15-min intervals and stored as stacks of tiff files. For data analysis, the circumferences of the cells were labeled at each time step throughout the entire image stacks using Amira software (Mercury Computer Systems; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tgs.com/">http://www.tgs.com/</ext-link>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dreval et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dieterich et al., 2008</xref>). Migration was quantified as the movement of the cell center. The x and y coordinates of the cell center (in micrometers) were determined as geometric means of equally weighted pixel positions within the cell outlines. We used two parameters to quantify migration. The translocation (in micrometers) was calculated as the mean distance between the position of the cell center at the beginning and at the end of the experiment for the observed group of cells. Translocation summarizes stochastic movements of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dreval et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dieterich et al., 2008</xref>) and contributions from directed migration induced by the wound-healing condition and is a measure of sustained migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwab et al., 2006</xref>). The directionality of movement was estimated by plotting the mean of the numerical distance of the cells traveled in the direction perpendicular to the wound (the x direction) as a function of time. The mean positions of cells were fitted to the functions <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>v<sub>x</sub></italic> &#x000d7; <italic>t</italic> and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>v<sub>y</sub></italic> &#x000d7; <italic>t</italic>. The velocities <italic>v<sub>x</sub></italic> and <italic>v<sub>y</sub></italic> and their uncertainties were estimated with the least-square fit routine of gnuplot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">http://www.gnuplot.info/</ext-link>). The slope of the x distance versus time plot is the velocity in the x direction (in micrometers/minute) and is a measure of directionality in our experimental setup. The corresponding plots for directionality in the y direction (parallel to the wound) were always close to zero, indicating that in this experimental setup, directional movement is measured only perpendicular to the wound.</p></sec><sec><title>siRNA-mediated knockdown of NHE1</title><p>NHE1 knockdown in NIH3T3 cells was performed using SMARTpool siRNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) against mouse NHE1 (<italic>NHE1</italic>) or scrambled oligonucleotides of comparable GC content (mock), both at 50 nM, and FECT transfection agent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The day after siRNA treatment, the cells were serum starved as described in Cell culture and reagents and were used for experiments 48 or 72 h after siRNA treatment as indicated. Cilia counting experiments were always accompanied by parallel Western blots against NHE1 to verify knockdown.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>All experiments were repeated 3&#x02013;11 times, and data are presented as representative individual experiments or as mean values &#x000b1; SEM.
