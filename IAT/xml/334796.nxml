One 20-OH-ecdysone responsive transcription unit was detected which is expressed into two transcripts which accumulate upon the incubation of salivary glands of 3rd instar larvae with 20-OH-ecdysone. This accumulation is correlated with the 20-OH-ecdysone induced activity of puff 75B. 75B cDNA analysis indicates that the activity of puff 75B leads to the synthesis of a protein which belongs to the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. The highest similarity of the derived 75B protein sequence was found to the DNA and ligand binding domains of human retinoic acid receptor. A study of the tissue distribution in larvae revealed that 75B mRNA is present in most, if not all 20-OH-ecdysone target tissues. It is proposed that 75B protein is a DNA-binding protein playing a key role in mediating the regulation of the larval molt by 20-OH-ecdysone.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0036-a" xlink:role="7169"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0041-a" xlink:role="7174"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0043-a" xlink:role="7176"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7167"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7168"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7169"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7170"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7171"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7172"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7173"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7174"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7175"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7176"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7177"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7178"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
