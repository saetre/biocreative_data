Mycolic acids are key components of this cell wall. The genes involved in joining the &#x003b1; and mero mycolates are located in a cluster, beginning with <italic>Rv3799c</italic> and extending at least until <italic>Rv3804c</italic>. The role of each enzyme encoded by these five genes is fairly well understood, except for <italic>Rv3802c</italic>. Rv3802 is one of seven putative cutinases encoded by the genome of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. In phytopathogens, cutinases hydrolyze the waxy layer of plants, cutin. In a strictly mammalian pathogen, such as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, it is likely that these proteins perform a different function. Of the seven, we chose to focus on <italic>Rv3802c</italic> because of its location in a mycolic acid synthesis gene cluster, its putative essentiality, its ubiquitous presence in actinomycetes, and its conservation in the minimal genome of <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>. We expressed Rv3802 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified the enzymatically active form. We probed its activities and inhibitors characterizing those relevant to its possible role in mycolic acid biosynthesis. In addition to its reported phospholipase A activity, Rv3802 has significant thioesterase activity, and it is inhibited by tetrahydrolipstatin (THL). THL is a described anti-tuberculous compound with an unknown mechanism, but it reportedly targets cell wall synthesis. Taken together, these data circumstantially support a role for Rv3802 in mycolic acid synthesis and, as the cell wall is integral to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis, identification of a novel cell wall enzyme and its inhibition has therapeutic and diagnostic implications.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infects one third of the world, makes over 8 million ill each year, and kills 1.8 million, 450,000 of whom are children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Corbett1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Key to the success of the tubercule bacillis is its uniquely complex lipid rich cell wall, and cell wall synthesis pathways are current target areas for drug development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Barry1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-McKinney1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The cell wall of mycobacteria is considered a bilayer, and the lipids integral to the bilayer are the myolic acids. Just exterior to the cell membrane lies the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex (mAGP). This complex forms the stable scaffolding for the outer component of surface-exposed lipids and glycolipids, such as trehalose monomycolate (TMM) and dimycolate (TDM). The mycolic acids of these glycolipids are noncovalently intercolated with the mAGP. Mycolic acid containing lipids are not only essential for the survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, they contribute to pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms from cell signaling and host evasion to granuloma formation. The genes involved in joining the mero and &#x003b1; mycolate into a mature mycolic acid and transferring it to trehalose or arabinogalactan are located in a gene cluster from <italic>Rv3799c</italic> to at least <italic>Rv3804c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004281-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The role of each enzyme encoded by these five genes is fairly well understood, except for the product of <italic>Rv3802c</italic>, though these five genes do not account for all the necessary steps in the pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Takayama1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. A summary is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004281-g002">Figure 2</xref>. In brief, FadD32 (fatty acid dehydrogenase, <italic>Rv3801c</italic>) and AccD4 (<italic>Rv3799c</italic>), along with the other acyl-CoA carboxylases, AccA3 and AccD5, participate in deriving meroacyl-AMP (from FAS-II) and 2-carboxyl-C26-S-CoA (from FAS-I), respectively. These are attached via thioester bonds to phosphopentathienes on the acyl carrier domains of Pks13 (polyketide synthase, <italic>Rv3800c</italic>), a multidomain protein which, via Claisen condensation, creates a mature mycolic acid. A reduction step is needed and one enzyme so far, CmrA, has been identified for this role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-LeaSmith1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The deposition and export of the mycolates is less well understood. A mature mycolic acid is eventually transferred either to arabinogalactan (to form mAGP) in part by the Ag85 proteins, or to an &#x003b1;,&#x003b1;-trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P, leading to TMM) by an unknown mycolyltransferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Jackson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. A phospholipid carrier, 6-0-mycolyl-a-D-mannopyranosyl-1-monophosphoheptaprenol (Myc-PL), is reported to be involved in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Besra1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. For TDM formation, a second mycolic acid is added to TMM by the antigen 85 complex mycolyltransferases, including Ag85A (<italic>Rv3804c</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Belisle1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we investigated the possible contributions of the <italic>Rv3802c</italic> gene product to the mycolic acid synthesis pathway. Our data demonstrate that the products encoded by <italic>Rv3802c</italic> and the non-orthologous but homologue <italic>MSMEG_1403</italic> possess both phospholipase A (PLA) activity and thioesterase activity. These activities are consistent with a role in mycolic acid biosynthesis as this pathway involves multiple ester and thioester bonds. In addition, the <italic>Rv3802c</italic> gene product, but not that of the distant homologue <italic>MSMEG_1403</italic> in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, is inhibited by the known human fatty acid synthase thioesterase (FASTE) domain inhibitor, THL. THL has been demonstrated to decrease mycolic acid synthesis, leading to defects in the mycobacterial cell wall, though the targets of its antimycobacterial action were unknown. Though these lines of evidence are circumstantial, taken together with the genetic data, these findings support a role for Rv3802 in mycobacterial mycolic acid synthesis.</p><fig id="pone-0004281-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004281.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mycolic acid synthesis gene cluster in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv.</title><p>Cluster is highly conserved in all actinomycetes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004281.g001"/></fig><fig id="pone-0004281-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004281.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Approximate schematic of proposed mycolic acid synthesis.</title><p>Fas I enzyme and FasII system elaborate the &#x003b1; and mero chains for nascent mycolic acids. Carboxylation by AccD4, AccA3 and AccD5 and activation by FadD32 convert these to their respective acyl-S-CoA and acyl-S-AMP forms. The AT (acyltransferase) domain of Pks13 attaches these via a tioester bond to the phosphopentathiene-modified ACP domains, and facilitates transfer to the KS (ketosynthase) domain. Via Claisen-type condensation and reduction, the two chains are joined to form a mature mycolic acid attached via a thioester to Pks13, with loss of CO<sub>2</sub>. The mature mycolic acid is then hydrolyzed from Pks13 by either the TE1 domain of Pks13, or an external TE. An external TE2 may function to unclog the Pks13 if it is mis-acylated. The liberated mycolic acid may be transferred to a lipid carrier, such as Myc-PL, via an unkown MT (mycolyltranferase); this may facilitate its transfer across the plasma membrane. Eventually it is tranferred by another MT to TMM. TMM is used as a mycolic acid donor for the acceptors of TMM, to form TDM, or AG, to form mAG.

Like all &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-hydrolase fold enzymes, the predicted structure has an oxyanion hole, which provides a positively charged hole to stabilize the transient oxyanions formed during acylation and deacylation, and an acyl binding pocket lined with hydrophobic residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Martinez1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Devedjiev1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Rv3802 and Antigen85A (Rv3804), a known mycolyltranferase, are both &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-hydrolase fold enzymes. The acyl binding pocket of Ag85A functions to transfer the second mycolic acid onto TMM to from TDM. We therefore investigated acyltransferase activity of Rv3802 and MSMEG_1403. Various acyl donors were paired with acceptors in enzyme assays. First, to investigate transacylation of trehalose (similar to Ag85) <sup>14</sup>C-trehalose was used as the acceptor, and cell wall lipids or crude cell wall extract (with lipid and protein) were used for donation; no transacylation was detected except with the positive control, Ag85C (data not shown). T6P is not currently commercially available, thus a similar assay was done with the acceptors mannose-6-phosphate and glycerol-6-phosphate, with no observed acylated product. These same acceptors were used but the donor changed to <sup>14</sup>C-P-CoA (thioester bond) or <sup>14</sup>C-DPPC (ester bond), and again no acylation occurred, though hydrolysis of the donors did occur. <sup>14</sup>C-P-CoA and <sup>14</sup>C-DPPC were again used as donors, with crude cell wall extract (lipids and proteins, ATP also added) used for the acceptor; no new acylated products emerged. These <sup>14</sup>C-P-CoA and <sup>14</sup>C-DPPC assays were repeated with the addition of crude cell wall extract alone and with cytosolic extract, with the hope that native donor or acceptor would be present, and again, no transacylation was observed. Transacylation assays were repeated several times with different amounts of donor, acceptor and enzyme, and different amounts of time from 1 to 72 H. The only result for Rv3802 and MSMEG_1403 in all assays was the release of fatty acid (not shown).</p><p>As a more global cell wall assay, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mc<sup>2</sup> 155 cell wall was radiolabeled with <sup>14</sup>C-acetate, and the outer cell wall was extracted as in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref>.

Mass spectrometry of the apparent substrate revealed it as phosphatidylinositol mannoside 2 (PIM2); this was purified by normal phase chromatography on a silica column, and hydrolysis by Rv3802 and MSMEG_1403 confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004281-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

A comparison between similarly acylated thioesters and esters would be of interest, but we are limited by available substrates and solubility of compounds, as the nitrophenyl esters are less soluble in aqueous solvents than CoA thioesters, and thus one would end up comparing a soluble substrate to a micellar substrate, which may influence results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Deems1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

We previously attributed mycobacterial PLA activity to the cutinases, and in this manuscript additionally ascribe thioesterase activity. Logical potential uses for these activities by a mammalian pathogen include host lipid hydrolysis for carbon scavenging, or mycobacterial cell wall construction/remodeling. As there are seven annotated cutinases in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, it may be they serve a variety of functions. The function of <italic>Rv3802c</italic> and its orthologs is suggested by its location in a gene cluster for mycolic acid synthesis.

This genetic data implying a role in mycolic acid synthesis is further supported by Rv3802's: (i) membership in the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-hydrolase fold family with known PLAs, mycolyltransferases and thioesterases; (ii) possession of thioesterase activity; and (iii) enzymatic inhibition by a known mycolic acid synthesis inhibitor, THL.</p><p>The compound THL is sold over the counter as the weight loss agent Alli&#x02122;.

FAS is a modular protein like Pks13.

Based on our knowledge that Rv3802 is an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-hydrolase fold with TE activity, and the structure of THL, we investigated the ability of THL to inhibit recombinant Rv3802 and found it to inhibit at nanomolar concentrations, as described. The mechanism of inhibition is assumed to be similar to the mechanism of human FASTE inhibition. For human FASTE, THL is demonstrated to inhibit competitively, with the palmitic core of THL fitting into the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket and the hexanoyl tail packing against the catalytic histidine, significantly delaying hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004281-g007">Figure 7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Richardson1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Pemble1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Eventually it is hydrolyzed, thus inhibition is reversible. The inhibition of an enzyme whose gene is located in the mycolic acid synthesis gene cluster, together with previously published observations that THL affects the cell wall and decreases mycolic acids, supports a cause and effect relationship between THL and Rv3802. Although we demonstrated that THL inhibits Rv3802 in assays, this does not confirm that Rv3802 is the primary target of THL in culture. It is likely that THL inhibits other enzymes. In any case, the knowledge that THL inhibits Rv3802 at least gives a framework for exploring inhibition of Rv3802 and other THL targets further in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>Though further investigation will be required to pinpoint the exact function of Rv3802, examination of the mycolic acid synthetic pathway suggests a role as a Pks associated thioesterase or as a mycolyltransferase. Though we could not demonstrate mycolyltransferase activity, our data is limited by the need to use surrogate substrates and acceptors, thus this remains a distinct possibility. There are multiple unknown mycolyltransferases required in the pathway, and similarities between the known mycolyltranferase Ag85 proteins and Rv3802 are hard to ignore. However, the unusual ability to hydrolyze thioesters strongly suggests some type of interaction with nascent mycolic acids while docked via thioester bonds on Pks13.</p><p>Interaction with Pks13 could be in the form of an exogenous type 1 thioesterase, (TE1) or as an exogenous type 2 thiosterase (TE2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Koglin1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) are modular, &#x0201c;assembly line&#x0201d;-like enzymes responsible for the steps in the biosynthesis of polyketides and mycolic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Keating1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Pks13 in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has all the necessary modules to produce a mature mycolic acid: one acyltranferase domain for loading and transfer of selected acyl chains to the phosphopentatheine (PP) binding motif of the acyl-S-carrier protein (ACP) domain; two ACPs for thioester binding, via a PP, of the meroacyl chain from FadD32 and the 2 carboxyl-C<sub>26</sub> chain from AccD4, AccA3 and AccD5; a ketoacyl synthase domain for Claisen-type condensation; and one TE1 domain for chain termination and hydrolysis. The reduction event to form the mature mycolic acid may be catalyzed by more than one protein, but to date CmrA has been identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-LeaSmith1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The mature mycolic acid can then be exported and transferred to the mycolate containing components of the mycobacterial cell wall, via unknown mycolyltranferases. However, it has been proposed that the TE1 on the C terminal domain of Pks13 does not liberate the mature mycolic acid because the presence of free mycolic acid would be unwieldy for the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Takayama1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. A solution to this problem is to have an external TE1 with mycolyltranferase activity. In theory, Rv3802 could fill this role, though admittedly we find no clear precedent for this in the literature.</p><p>An alternative role for this protein is that of the precedented TE2. TE2s are well described in association with Pks and NRPS modules in bacteria, fungi and plants, and serve to proofread the nascent product on the synthetic module <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004281-Linne1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.
