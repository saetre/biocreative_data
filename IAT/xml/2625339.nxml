Previous studies have suggested that regulatory differences between the two subtypes can be partially explained by unique consensus phosphorylation sites included in the pNBC1, but not the kNBC1 sequence.

Forskolin (10<sup>-5 </sup>M) had no effect in untransfected cells, but inhibited the pH<sub>i </sub>recovery in cells expressing pNBC1 by 62%. After preincubation with carbachol (10<sup>-4 </sup>M), the pH<sub>i </sub>recovery was enhanced to the same degree both in transfected and untransfected cells, indicating activation of endogenous alkalizing ion transporters. Acid-activated Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>cotransport via pNBC1 expressed in renal cells is thus inhibited by cAMP and not affected by cholinergic stimulation, as opposed to the findings in native intestinal tissue. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Regulation of pNBC1 by secretagogues appears to be not solely dependent on its primary structure, but also on properties of the cell type in which it is expressed.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-cotransporter isoform 1 (NBC1) is basolaterally expressed in the renal proximal tubule, where it mediates HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>reabsorption by concerted action with the apical Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchanger isoform NHE3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and in gastrointestinal epithelia, where it serves the intracellular supply of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>destined for secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These striking differences in function and transport direction have prompted studies to elucidate the structural and regulatory properties of the respective transporters. It was found that renal NBC is inhibited by an increase in intracellular cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], enabling the parallel regulation with NHE3, which is also inhibited in a cAMP-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In contrast, we could previously show that forskolin stimulates intestinal NBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, exposure to cholinergic compounds causes an increase of both the renal and the intestinal Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>cotransporter rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>One explanation for the differential regulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>cotransport in these tissues comes from the identification of structurally distinct splice variants of NBC1. The renal (kNBC1) and intestinal (pNBC1) NBC subtypes possess a common C-terminal PKA-dependent phosphorylation site (Ser<sup>982 </sup>and Ser<sup>1026</sup>, respectively), which was reported to determine transport stoichiometry in renal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, however, the longer N-terminal tail of pNBC1 contains unique phosphorylation sites for PKA (Thr49), PKC (Ser<sup>38 </sup>and Ser<sup>65</sup>), and casein kinase II (Ser<sup>68</sup>), which are not found in the kNBC1 sequence and of which at least the cAMP-dependent site is relevant for transporter regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that the cell type plays a central role in determining how ion transport is regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. As knowledge of intestinal Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>cotransporter function and regulation is overall limited, this important aspect has not been studied in great detail. There is only one report on cAMP-dependent stoichiometry changes of heterologously transfected pNBC1 involving the common C-terminal phosphorylation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, information on cell-type dependency of intestinal NBC regulation by secretagogues during its presumed physiological function, which is HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>uptake in the process of anion secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], is lacking. We therefore set off to investigate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>import via pNBC1 transfected into HEK293 cells in acidification experiments. The aim of the study was to clarify whether regulation of heterologously transfected pNBC1 by secretagogues is similar as in native colonic tissue and thus essentially dependent on structural determinants of the transporter protein, or different and thus affected by the cell type in which it is expressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To determine the distribution of NBC1 subtypes in HEK293 cells compared to native tissue, we first performed PCR analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Neither pNBC1 nor kNBC1 mRNA was amplified from untransfected HEK293 cells. As anticipated, pNBC1-specific primers detected a signal in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with pNBC1, and in human colon. kNBC1 was detected in human kidney and, to a lesser degree, in human colon samples.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>RT-PCR in untransfected HEK293 cells (HEK293), HEK293 cells transiently transfected with pNBC1 (+pNBC1), as well as human kidney and colon samples using kNBC1- and pNBC1-specific primers (see methods section)</bold>. While neither isoform was detected in untransfected HEK293 cells, a pNBC1 fragment of the expected size (612 bp) was amplified from transfected HEK293 cells and human colon. kNBC1 was exclusively detected in human kidney samples (expected PCR product size: 489 bp).

The transfection efficiency was consistently at 10&#x02013;15% of the cells. After selecting regions of interest (ROIs) covering the major part of the cytoplasm, the image was digitized for documentation, and cells were <italic>in situ </italic>loaded with BCECF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Two groups of cells were identified: Cells with a strong GFP signal along the cell membrane (subsequently called "GFP-positive" or "transfected"), and cells with no or very faint fluorescence in this location (subsequently called "GFP-negative" or "untransfected"). To exclude cells with intermediate GFP signal which only weakly express the transfected construct, the signal was quantified by placing a rectangular plot profile with vertical averaging over at least 20 pixels (for noise reduction) perpendicularly over the cell membrane using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/"/>) under standardized illumination settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Indeed, the first group of cells exhibited fluorescence intensity values of 98.8 &#x000b1; 14.2 AU (arbitrary units), and the second group values of 17.0 &#x000b1; 3.1 AU (p &#x0003c; 0.01 vs. first group, not significantly different from the background); the amount of cells with intermediate GFP signal was low (&#x0003c;10%), and these cells were not used for the functional experiments. Cells were then subjected to an NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-prepulse protocol to impose an acid load in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). It is important to note in this context that the high pH<sub>i </sub>values achieved during the prepulse are overestimated, since our calibration approach is optimized for the low pH<sub>i </sub>values where transporter activity is actually measured. pH<sub>i </sub>recovery upon readdition of Na<sup>+ </sup>occurred faster in GFP-positive than in GFP-negative cells. Since the steady-state pH<sub>i </sub>appeared to be higher in transfected cells, we statistically compared the obtained values from untransfected and transfected cells, which indeed demonstrated a significantly more alkaline pH<sub>i </sub>in pNBC1-transfected cells, pointing to increased basal NBC activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The reference pH<sub>i</sub>, however, was not significantly different between the two (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Overall, the correlation between GFP signal intensity and recovery rates were excellent, demonstrating the correct identification of the transfected cells. The resting pH<sub>i </sub>and the reference pH<sub>i </sub>of mock-transfected cells were equal as in untransfected cells (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Confocal images of HEK cells transiently transfected with GFP-pNBC1</bold>. Panel (A) shows the GFP staining of transfected cells and the weak autofluorescence of untransfected cells. After placing regions of interest covering most of the cytosol, cells were in situ loaded with the pH-sensitive dye BCECF (B), and the time course of the intracellular pH was recorded. C: To determine the optimal calibration procedure for the pH range of interest (for calculation of the recovery rates at the reference pH<sub>i</sub>, see Fig. 3B), a calibration curve was constructed using high K<sup>+</sup>/nigericin solution to clamp intracellular pH at different levels. As expected, its slope is less steep at low pH<sub>i </sub>values and steeper in the linear range (n = 6). To minimize the error during the calibration procedure within the pH range of interest, the calibration points 6.2 and 7.0 were chosen. Since the ratio values varied considerably between the experiments, each individual region was calibrated after the respective experiment subsequently.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-9-70-2"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Starting pH<sub>i</sub>, reference pH<sub>i</sub>, and representative pH<sub>i </sub>tracings from pNBC1-transfected and untransfected HEK293 cells</bold>. A, B: Box and whisker diagram of the starting- and reference pH<sub>i </sub>values from pNBC1-transfected and untransfected cells. Steady-state pH<sub>i </sub>was significantly higher in transfected cells, pointing to increased baseline Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>cotransport activity (*: p &#x0003c; 0.001, Student's t-test for paired samples, n = 7). The reference pH<sub>i </sub>after acidification was, however, not different between the two. C: After imposing an acid load using the "NH<sub>4</sub>-prepulse" method, cells acidified to a similar extent. Upon Na<sup>+ </sup>readdition, most untransfected cells showed no significant recovery, while pH<sub>i </sub>increased rapidly in transfected cells (representative tracings). It should be noted that our 2-point calibration approach is optimized for the low pH<sub>i </sub>values at which transporter activity is measured, and that the higher pH<sub>i </sub>values are therefore overestimated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-9-70-3"/></fig><p>To determine whether pNBC1 transfected in HEK293 cells is functional, pH<sub>i </sub>recovery rates were quantified in untransfected and transfected cells in the presence and absence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In HEPES buffered solution, no significant difference in &#x00394;pH/&#x00394;t was observed, indicating no Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-cotransport in HEK293 cells due to the lack of substrate (A). The alkalization under these conditions is most likely mediated by the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchanger, of which the NHE1 and NHE3 isoforms are expressed in HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, however, pH<sub>i </sub>recovery occurred significantly faster at a 5-fold higher rate in transfected vs. untransfected cells (B). This finding clearly demonstrates successful functional transfection of pNBC1. &#x00394;pH/&#x00394;t appeared somewhat lower in untransfected cells in the presence than in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, probably due to a higher buffering capacity in its presence, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. To exclude that the GFP signal significantly influences the recovery rates, control experiments using mock-transfected HEK cells were carried out (C, D). Here, recovery rates were generally low, and not significantly different between mock-transfected vs. untransfected in the presence and absence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>pH<sub>i </sub>recovery from an acid load in untransfected (Ctr) and transfected cells (pNBC1, mock) in the absence and presence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></bold>. A: in O<sub>2</sub>/HEPES buffer, no significant difference in the pH<sub>i </sub>recovery rate in untransfected and pNBC1-transfected cells was noted (n = 8).

C, D: in mock-transfected vs. untransfected cells on the same slide, pH<sub>i </sub>recovery rates were relatively low, and no significant differences were noted between mock-transfected and untransfected, or between the absence and presence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, respectively (n = 6&#x02013;8).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-9-70-4"/></fig><p>In our previous work, we had delineated the effects of secretagogues on endogenous Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-cotransport, which is most likely effectuated predominantly by the pNBC1 subtype of the electrogenic isoform NBC1, in murine proximal colonic crypts. In accordance with the concept of NBC as an anion importer during cAMP-dependent and cholinergic stimulation of anion secretion, we could demonstrate transporter activation by both types of secretagogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We now set off to investigate the influence of the cell type on cotransporter regulation by secretagogues, and therefore studied the effect of forskolin and carbachol on pNBC1 transfected into HEK293 cells as a non-intestinal cellular model. As depicted in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, an increase in intracellular cAMP did not significantly change pH<sub>i </sub>recovery rates in untransfected cells, indicating that this measure possibly causes differential, and balanced effects on the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchanger isoforms expressed in HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and/or on endogenous NBC. However, forskolin stimulation significantly decreased pH<sub>i </sub>recovery rate in pNBC1-transfected HEK293 cells by more than 50%, which is in sharp contrast to the findings in native tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of cAMP-dependent and cholinergic stimulation on pH<sub>i </sub>recovery in untransfected and pNBC1-transfected HEK293 cells</bold>. A: Forskolin did not elicit any significant changes in pH<sub>i </sub>recovery in untransfected cells (n = 6). Again, transfected cells displayed a significantly faster pH<sub>i </sub>recovery under control conditions than their untransfected counterparts (*: p &#x0003c; 0.05 vs. untransfected control, Student's t-test for paired samples, n = 6). However, forskolin strongly inhibited pH<sub>i </sub>recovery in pNBC1-transfected HEK293 cells (**: p &#x0003c; 0.01 vs. unstimulated control, Student's t-test for unpaired samples, n = 7). B: Carbachol caused a slight acceleration of pH<sub>i </sub>recovery in untransfected cells, which might be due to effects on endogenous Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchange or on Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>exchanger isoforms other than pNBC1 or kNBC1 (*: p &#x0003c; 0.05 vs. unstimulated control, Student's t-test for unpaired samples, n = 6). pNBC1 transfection again led to a significantly faster pH<sub>i </sub>recovery (**: p &#x0003c; 0.05 vs. untransfected control, Student's t-test for paired samples, n = 8). However, carbachol did not cause any additional significant changes to pH<sub>i </sub>recovery in transfected cells (ns: not significant, n = 8).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-9-70-5"/></fig><p>HEK293 cells have been shown functionally express the M3 subtype of cholinergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], which mediates NBC activation by carbachol in murine colonic crypts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. When untransfected cells were subjected to cholinergic stimulation, &#x00394;pH/&#x00394;t was increased compared to the control, which points to the activation of NHE1 which is expressed in HEK293 cells. In pNBC1-transfected cells, however, carbachol had no additional stimulatory impact on pH<sub>i </sub>recovery and did not cause changes in pH<sub>i </sub>recovery altogether (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Given its effect on untransfected cells, carbachol does not stimulate NBC, but might even have an inhibitory effect on this transport system. This finding represents another discrepancy of endogenous intestinal versus heterologously transfected pNBC1 regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The renal and intestinal Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>cotransporters are differentially regulated by cAMP-dependent and cholinergic agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Possible explanations for these findings are differences in their primary structure influencing regulatory properties, or features of the cell type in which they are expressed. In this study, we investigated the secretagogue regulation of the intestinal-pancreatic NBC subtype pNBC1 in HEK293 cells.</p><p>The group of Ira Kurtz has thoroughly studied the stoichiometry of NBC1 and found that the renal subtype kNBC1 is transporting 1 Na<sup>+ </sup>and 3 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>with each cycle, which results in outward-directed transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Functional inhibition of kNBC1 by cAMP is probably in part due to a stoichiometry shift from 3:1 to 2:1, leading to a switch from export to import. On the other hand, the intestinal subtype pNBC1 serves the uptake of both ions with a 2:1 ratio under physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and a stoichiometry change was not reported for the endogenously expressed transporter. However, pNBC1 can be activated via cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which is due to the phosphorylation of a unique consensus phosphorylation site in its N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As to a structure-function relationship regarding cholinergic stimulation, which increases the transport rate of both subtypes in a PKC-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the possible relevance of the unique PKC-dependent phosphorylation site in the pNBC1 N-terminus remains to be assessed.</p><p>Importantly, cell type- and tissue-specific regulation has been recognized for many ion transporters including Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], anion exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Expression of pNBC1 and kNBC1 is not restricted to the pancreas/intestinal tract and the kidney, respectively, and expression in other organs such as the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the gallbladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] has been reported, but it has not been investigated whether these different cell types modulate transporter regulation. Gross et al. have previously studied the regulation of murine pNBC1 endogenously occurring in pancreatic duct cells and heterologously transfected into a mouse proximal tubule cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They found that cAMP causes upregulation of endogenous pNBC1 via one PKA-dependent phosphorylation site not present in the kNBC1 sequence, while changing the stoichiometry from 3:1 to 2:1 and thereby transport direction via another common C-terminal site (Ser<sup>982 </sup>and Ser<sup>1026 </sup>for kNBC1 and pNBC1, respectively), the latter resembling kNBC1 regulation. In our experiments, however, we sought to clarify the cell-type dependency of the regulation of the presumed physiological function of pNBC1, which is HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>uptake during stimulated anion secretion, and which can be activated by imposing an acid load on the cytosol. In this setting of inward transport, stoichiometry would be expected to be already 2:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and there is no evidence that secretagogues can reverse it to 3:1 in either of the NBC1 subtypes. Accordingly, Pedrosa et al. did not find any influence of cAMP stimulation on kNBC1 in renal cells in pH<sub>i </sub>recovery experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; however, it is under debate whether kNBC1 can be a relevant base loader under physiological conditions, a recent study suggesting rather an adaptation of the pNBC1 and kNBC1 expression pattern in renal and submandibular gland epithelia during acid-base disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The differential regulation of SLC4 gene family members in different cell types might be related to possibly specialized roles of the transporters in the respective tissues (e. g. vectorial transport vs. homeostatic functions), but this aspect of NBC function is yet poorly understood.</p><p>With respect to the HEK293 cells used in the current study, transfection studies investigating human heart (hhNBC) or renal NBC did not reveal any endogenous expression of the these isoforms by immunoblotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In their functional experiments, one group reported Na<sup>+</sup>- and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-dependent pH<sub>i </sub>recovery after an acid load, which could be due to NHE or NBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], while another group described no recovery in the additional presence of amiloride, arguing against the presence of endogenous NBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In support of these findings, the recovery rates we measured in untransfected cells in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>were very low, and, although not statistically comparable since measured in a different experiment, not higher than in its absence. Therefore, the transfection-independent recovery rate is most likely due to endogenous Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchangers, of which the NHE1 and NHE3 isoforms have previously been detected in HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Since recovery rates were considerably lower in untransfected vs. transfected cells in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), no attempt was made to pharmacologically inhibit the presumably relatively low endogenous transporter activities in the subsequent experiments. One limitation of the present study is therefore the lack of information on potential effects of carbachol and forskolin on endogenous base loading mechanisms.</p><p>The transfection efficiency was relatively low under all conditions we tried, e. g. serum free/serum containing media, lipophilic agents, or calcium precipitation. Furthermore, a suitable transfection system to serve as a control is not available, since the intestinal cell lines Caco-2 and HT-29 show endogenous NBC activities which are not well molecularly characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], T84 cells express kNBC1 rather than pNBC1 (B. Bridges, communication), and our attempts to transfect pNBC1 into Caco-2 or T84 cells did not yield sufficient overexpression to achieve unequivocal results. One possible reason for the overall low transfection efficiency could be that NBC increases intracellular pH<sub>i </sub>above the optimum for cellular metabolism. However, the pH<sub>i </sub>changes we measured were minor, and the acidification of cytosolic pH by lowering medium pH did not improve NBC abundance (data not shown). More likely, transfection efficiency is limited by the large size of the GFP-pNBC1 transcript. To differentiate between transfected and untransfected cells in this setting, the fluorescence signal of the GFP tag was visualized using confocal microscopy. Since the C-terminal phosphorylation site was characterized as a crucial regulatory sequence which explains the regulation of kNBC1 and pNBC1 in renal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], it appeared reasonable to tag the pNBC1 N-terminus to avoid interference of the tag with this sequence. Nevertheless, we observed an inhibition of NBC after preincubation with forskolin, which cannot be readily explained by the N-terminal GFP tag. However, we cannot exclude that the GFP tag interferes with the binding site for IRBIT close to the N-terminus (see below), which could in part explain our results with carbachol.</p><p>The molecular basis for the differential regulation of pNBC in intestinal vs. HEK293 cells remains unknown. The observed acid-induced NBC activity in HEK293 cells under basal conditions and the strong inhibitory effect of forskolin are difficult to reconcile with mere stoichiometry changes as described by Gross et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], since they would further increase HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>import and thus accelerate pH<sub>i </sub>recovery. Possibly, the signal transduction machinery of the cell types provides an explanation. One could speculate about a possible role of associated proteins, such as NHERF (NHE regulatory factor) family members, IRBIT (IP<sub>3</sub>R binding protein released with IP<sub>3</sub>), and carbonic anhydrase. NHERF has been shown to be necessary for cAMP-dependent inhibition of renal NBC; however, no binding, NBC phosphorylation or change in NBC surface expression were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As another regulatory protein, IRBIT was found to bind to pNBC1, but not kNBC1, and pNBC1 transfected into X. oocytes only attains functional activity comparable to the one of transfected kNBC1 when IRBIT is co-transfected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. IRBIT is expressed in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], while its presence in HEK293 cells and the intestinal tract has not yet been clarified. Furthermore, carbonic anhydrase, of which several isoforms are differentially expressed in the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], could potentially influence NBC transport capacity by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>generation, but its functional relevance for NBC regulation is highly controversial at present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we succeeded in functionally transfecting GFP-pNBC1 into HEK293 cells, thereby providing a non-intestinal cellular model to study its regulation. Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-cotransporter response to secretagogues in this system was strikingly different from our previous findings in native murine colon. This suggests a relevance of cellular factors, possibly associated proteins, in addition to structural features of this NBC1 variant. The characterization of the involved molecular mechanisms requires further studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Construction of tagged full-length pNBC1</title><p>Full-length pNBC1 was generated by PCR, using the following sense and antisense primers: 5'-GAATTCAGGATGGAGGATGAAGCTGTCCTG-3' and 5'-AGCGGCCGCCTCAGCATGATGTGTGGCGTTCAAGGAATGT-3', respectively, based on the pancreatic NBC1 cDNA (AF069510).
