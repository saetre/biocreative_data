Bacterial RNase III orthologs cleave their substrates in a highly site-specific manner, which is necessary for optimal RNA function or proper decay rates. The processing reactivities of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III substrates are determined in part by the sequence content of two discrete double-helical elements, termed the distal box (db) and proximal box (pb). A minimal substrate of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III, &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA, was characterized and used to define the db and pb sequence requirements for reactivity and their involvement in cleavage site selection. The reactivities of &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA sequence variants were examined in assays of cleavage and binding <italic>in vitro</italic>. The ability of all examined substitutions in the db to inhibit cleavage by weakening RNase III binding indicates that the db is a positive determinant of RNase III recognition, with the canonical UA/UG sequence conferring optimal recognition. A similar analysis showed that the pb also functions as a positive recognition determinant. It also was shown that the ability of the GC or CG bp substitution at a specific position in the pb to inhibit RNase III binding is due to the purine 2-amino group, which acts as a minor groove recognition antideterminant. In contrast, a GC or CG bp at the pb position adjacent to the scissile bond can suppress cleavage without inhibiting binding, and thus act as a catalytic antideterminant. It is shown that a single pb+db &#x02018;set&#x02019; is sufficient to specify a cleavage site, supporting the primary function of the two boxes as positive recognition determinants. The base pair sequence control of reactivity is discussed within the context of new structural information on a post-catalytic complex of a bacterial RNase III bound to the cleaved minimal substrate.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ribonucleases are a structurally and mechanistically diverse group of enzymes with essential roles in RNA maturation, RNA decay, gene regulation and host defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Ribonucleases involved in RNA processing are highly selective <italic>in vivo</italic>, and can function in a coordinated manner in multi-step maturation and degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The substrate selectivity and cleavage site specificity are necessary for the correct operation of RNA maturation and decay pathways, and to prevent inappropriate cleavage of other RNAs. Double-stranded (ds) RNA structures are functionally important targets of enzymatic cleavage, and are recognized by members of the ribonuclease III family of endoribonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In bacterial cells, RNase III cleavage of dsRNA is a key step in the maturation and degradation of coding and noncoding RNAs, and can regulate gene expression by controlling RNA stability and translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In eukaryotic cells the RNase III orthologs Dicer and Drosha participate in the maturation of microRNAs&#x02014;small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Dicer also initiates RNA interference and related gene silencing pathways by processing dsRNA structures to short interfering (si) RNAs, that in turn target homologous RNA sequences for enzymatic destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The action of Dicer underscores the functional flexibility of RNase III orthologs in their ability to cleave cellular substrates in a highly site-specific manner, while processing dsRNAs of broad sequence content to short products.</p><p>Bacterial RNase III orthologs are the structurally simplest family members, and consist of a polypeptide of &#x0223c;220 residues, containing an N-terminal nuclease domain and a C-terminal dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). The latter domain consists of a single copy of the conserved dsRNA-binding motif (dsRBM), which is present in many other proteins that recognize dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Since bacterial RNase III orthologs function as homodimers, the holoenzyme contains two dsRBDs. A typical target site in a bacterial RNase III substrate is cleaved on both strands, creating 2 nt 3&#x02032;-overhangs and 5&#x02032;-phosphate, 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl product termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). In a proposed reaction pathway for bacterial RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), one of the two dsRBDs recognizes a correctly-sized substrate, which is then engaged by the nuclease domain and the second dsRBD to create the catalytically competent complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>Cleavage sites of bacterial RNase III substrates are determined by specific RNA structural and sequence elements, also referred to as reactivity epitopes. Helix length is a primary reactivity epitope, with substrates of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III typically exhibiting two helical turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The coaxial stacking of short helices can provide a quasi-continuous helix of sufficient length to allow cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). However, the shortest helix that confers appreciable reactivity under standard conditions has not been defined for any bacterial RNase III ortholog. Other structure-based reactivity epitopes include internal loops or bulges, which can limit cleavage of a target site to a single phosphodiester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). This pattern of cleavage provides 3&#x02032;-hairpin stem&#x02013;loop structures that can protect the processed RNA from 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonucleolytic digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). A bulge-helix-bulge motif has been identified that can permit binding of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III, but inhibits cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The existence of an &#x02018;uncoupling&#x02019; motif supports genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) and structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) evidence that <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III can regulate gene expression as an RNA-binding protein.</p><p>Base pair sequence elements also participate in controlling substrate reactivity, and may also be involved in target site selection. While a sequence alignment analysis of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) did not identify any conserved sequences that could act as positive recognition determinants, it was observed that specific base pair sequences are excluded from two discrete double-helical segments, termed the proximal box (pb) and distal box (db) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Introduction of one or more of the excluded base pairs into either box within a model substrate inhibited cleavage by <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III, with the inhibition due to an interference with enzyme binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Based on these findings it was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) that <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III cleavage sites are determined by a default mechanism, in which the reactive site is identified by the absence of inhibitory base pairs within the pb and db, and with the other phosphodiesters effectively protected by inhibitory base pairs in the corresponding pb and db positions. This mechanism served to rationalize the ability of bacterial RNase III to degrade long dsRNAs of broad sequence content to short duplex products in a largely base pair-sequence-independent manner, while carrying out site-specific cleavage of cellular substrates. This mechanism of cleavage site selection does not involve positive sequence recognition determinants. Nonetheless, such elements may exist, and could be nonobvious features of the diverse substrates for bacterial RNases III. To more precisely define the role of base pair sequence in controlling processing reactivity and target site selection, we present here an analysis of a minimal substrate of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III. We show that specific base pair sequence elements function as positive recognition determinants. In addition, two functional classes of negative determinants (antideterminants) are defined that either inhibit recognition, or suppress cleavage without affecting recognition. The RNA sequence-reactivity correlations are discussed in reference to the recently-reported structure of a bacterial RNase III bound to a cleaved minimal substrate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Water was deionized and distilled.

A minimally-sized substrate is expected to be sensitive to changes in sequence or structure, thus facilitating the characterization of reactivity epitopes. A time course for cleavage of R1.1[WC] RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) (structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) yielded two intermediates, with each species resulting from cleavage of one of the two target site phosphodiesters (site 1 or site 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It was noted that the site-2-cleaved intermediate in isolated form can be cleaved at site 1 at a rate comparable to that of the parent substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Based on this observation, substrates were prepared that were based on the site-2-cleaved R1.1[WC] RNA intermediate, and that contained either a shortened double-helical stem or a shortened 5&#x02032; single-strand extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The cleavage reactivities of the RNAs were determined under standard conditions (see Materials and Methods). To allow detection of any changes in reactivity due to either an altered binding affinity or an altered catalytic rate, the enzyme and substrate concentrations were significantly less than the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA (see below). A high enzyme/substrate ratio provided single-turnover kinetics, and the extent of cleavage was measured at short times, in which only a limited amount of substrate was converted to product. These conditions allowed determination of the relative reactivity, defined as the fraction of a variant that is cleaved divided by the fraction cleaved of a reference substrate (&#x003bc;R1.1 RNA; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and also below), determined under identical conditions.</p><p>Representative cleavage assays, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, demonstrate that substrate reactivity is sensitive to helix length. Thus, deletion of a single base pair from the top of the stem (&#x003bc;R1.1[&#x00394;1] RNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) causes a 50-fold drop in reactivity, while deletion of 2 bp (&#x003bc;R1.1[&#x00394;2] RNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) essentially abolishes cleavage. Gel shift assays of the two shortened &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA variants (assays not shown; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and 4 for representative experiments) reveal that the diminished reactivities are due to a loss of RNase III binding affinity. We conclude that an 11 bp helix between the cleavage site and tetraloop represents the shortest length that provides significant reactivity. Also, the comigration of the 5&#x02032; end-containing cleavage products of &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA and &#x003bc;R1.1[&#x00394;1] RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 6 and 8), establish that the base pair deletions do not alter the site of cleavage. In this regard, the 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels used here can detect single-nucleotide differences in lengths of short [(<underline>&#x02264;</underline>&#x0223c;10 nt) cleavage products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>); data not shown]. Shortening the sequence between the cleavage site and the 5&#x02032; end to 6 nt does not significantly affect cleavage reactivity (relative reactivities of &#x003bc;R1.1[5&#x02032; + 2] RNA and &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA are 1.26 and 1.0, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, a further reduction in length strongly reduces reactivity (data not shown). The steady-state kinetic parameters for &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA were determined by measuring the initial rate as a function of substrate concentration. A best-fit curve to a Michaelis&#x02013;Menten kinetic scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) yielded a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 148 nM and a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of 2 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Based on these data we conclude that the 34 nt &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA represents a minimal substrate for <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III. A gel shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) reveals that &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA binds RNase III to form a complex with a measured apparent dissociation constant (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M3"><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>K</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>D</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02032;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula>) of 205 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although the gel shift assay cannot directly provide stoichiometric information, the observation of a single shifted band is consistent with the formation of a 1:1 protein&#x02013;RNA complex.</p></sec><sec><title>The scissile phosphodiester is not determined by tetraloop position or sequence</title><p>&#x003bc;R1.1 RNA exhibits a GCAA tetraloop, which belongs to the GNRA family of tetraloops that stabilize stem&#x02013;loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). We sought to determine whether the tetraloop sequence or position participates in cleavage site selection. In this regard, cleavage sites of hairpin substrates of the yeast RNase III ortholog Rnt1p are determined by their distance (&#x0223c;14&#x02013;16 bp) from a conserved RGNN tetraloop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). A &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA variant was prepared that contains a 4 bp insertion between the db and the GCAA tetraloop (&#x003bc;R1.1[+4 bp] RNA). This variant is cleaved at the canonical site, as indicated by the comigration of the 5&#x02032; end-containing cleavage product with that of &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 10). Thus, changing the position of the tetraloop does not change the cleavage site. However, the reactivity of (&#x003bc;R1.1[+4 bp] RNA is &#x0223c;5-fold lower than the parent substrate (see also below). To determine whether the tetraloop sequence determines the cleavage site or affects reactivity, two &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA variants were prepared that contained either an AGAA tetraloop (which conforms to the RGNN motif of yeast Rnt1p substrates) or a UUUU tetraloop. A cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, compare lanes 6 and 8 with lane 4) shows that the two variants retain comparable activity as the parent substrate, and are cleaved at the canonical site. Thus, there is no strict tetraloop sequence requirement for reactivity.</p></sec><sec><title>The db functions as a positive recognition determinant</title><p>The cleavage reactivities were determined for a set of &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA variants that exhibited the full range of base pair substitutions at each position in the helical stem. The measured relative reactivities reveal three discrete double-helical regions, within which base pair substitution significantly affects reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). One region corresponds to the db, in which it is seen that all substitutions significantly reduce (&#x0003e;&#x0223c;5-fold) cleavage reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In particular, there is a stringent requirement for a UG pair in the second position. Here, a UG&#x02192;GU substitution causes a 50-fold reduction in reactivity, while the UG&#x02192;AU substitution causes a &#x0003e;30-fold reduction in reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The effect of the latter substitution is consistent with the substrate alignment analysis that revealed an exclusion of the AU pair from this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Based on the comigration of the 6 nt, 5&#x02032; end-containing cleavage products (gel electropherograms not shown), none of the db substitutions alter the cleavage site. The binding affinities of the db variants were assessed by gel shift assays. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows representative assays and provides the <inline-formula><mml:math id="M4"><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>K</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>D</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02032;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> values for a subset of the &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA variants, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> demonstrates a correlation of cleavage reactivity with binding affinity. Based on this correlation, and the stringent sequence requirement we conclude that the db functions as a positive determinant of recognition, with the canonical UA/UG sequence providing optimal function in binding RNase III.</p></sec><sec><title>The pb is a positive recognition determinant, and a site of catalytic antideterminant action</title><p>The base pair substitution analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) establishes the pb as a 4 bp element, with each position exhibiting specific sequence requirements for optimal cleavage reactivity. Gel shift assays were performed and the <inline-formula><mml:math id="M5"><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>K</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>D</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02032;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> values determined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The data shows that base pair substitutions at pb positions 1, 2 and 3 inhibit RNase III binding. The particularly strong inhibitory effect on binding of the CG or GC bp at pb position 2 was examined further. Since Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing is formally retained with either substitution, the decreased reactivity suggests an involvement of one or more base functional groups. To assess this, the guanine of the inhibitory CG bp was changed to inosine (I). The CI pair lacks the purine C2 exocyclic amino group, but retains two standard hydrogen bonds, and therefore is not expected to disrupt secondary structure. A cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, middle panels) reveals that &#x003bc;R1.1[C<sub>9</sub>:I<sub>30</sub>] RNA has a relative reactivity of 0.33, which is &#x0223c;5-fold greater than that of &#x003bc;R1.1[C<sub>9</sub>:G<sub>30</sub>] RNA, but is only 3-fold less than that of &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA. Thus, removal of the purine 2-amino group restores the majority of the cleavage reactivity. We also examined the consequences of introducing a 2-amino group into the functionally innocuous UA bp. Thus, while &#x003bc;R1.1[U<sub>9</sub>:A<sub>30</sub>] RNA exhibits a relative reactivity of 0.8, substitution of A<sub>30</sub> with DAP reduces the relative reactivity by &#x0223c;25-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, middle panels). A gel shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lower panels) shows that the DAP-containing variant exhibits a low affinity for RNase III, similar to &#x003bc;R1.1[C<sub>9</sub>:G<sub>30</sub>] RNA. Based on the analysis of the inosine- and DAP-containing variants we conclude that the purine 2-amino group at pb position 2 is primarily responsible for inhibition of RNase III binding. Moreover, the low reactivity of &#x003bc;R1.1[G<sub>9</sub>:C<sub>30</sub>] RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that the purine 2-amino group does not need to occupy a precise position in the minor groove in order to confer inhibition. To assess the involvement of the guanine 6-keto group in inhibition, 2-aminopurine (2AP) was inserted in place of G<sub>30</sub> in &#x003bc;R1.1[C<sub>9</sub>:G<sub>30</sub>] RNA. The 2AP-containing variant has a relative reactivity (0.05) that is essentially unchanged with respect to that of &#x003bc;R1.1[C<sub>9</sub>:G<sub>30</sub>] RNA (relative reactivity 0.06) (gel electropherograms not shown). Thus, the guanine 6-keto group does not appear to contribute to the inhibitory action of the CG bp at pb position 2. However, it should be noted that removal of the 6-keto group would formally create a wobble pair, which itself could cause inhibition through a local structural effect.</p><p>Base pair substitutions at pb position 4 affect &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA reactivity in a qualitatively different manner than substitutions at pb positions 1&#x02013;3. Thus, the AU&#x02192;GC and AU&#x02192;CG substitutions cause 14- and 7-fold reductions in cleavage reactivity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but do not inhibit substrate binding, as indicated by the similar K'<sub>D</sub> values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The GC or CG bp therefore function as catalytic antideterminants, which suppress cleavage without affecting substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). If the inhibition is due to the increased strength of the GC or CG bp compared to the canonical AU (or UA) bp, then reactivity should be restored upon substitution of guanine by inosine, which would reduce the number of hydrogen bonds from 3 to 2. In fact, the GC&#x02192;IC substitution enhances cleavage reactivity by &#x0223c;3-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; cleavage assays not shown), suggesting that base pair strength is a contributing factor. However, the reactivity of the inosine-containing variant is still &#x0223c;4-fold lower than that of &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that additional features of the CG or GC bp contribute to inhibition of cleavage (see also Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>A db+pb set is sufficient to specify a cleavage site</title><p>If the db and pb are positive recognition determinants, then introduction of an additional db+pb &#x02018;set&#x02019; into the minimal substrate would specify a new target site. To test this we prepared a substrate that contains two db+pb sets. R1.1[db1pb1,db2pb2] RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is based on &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA[+4 bp] RNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but includes an extended stem below the target sites in order to minimize any effects of the helix terminus on reactivity. The db1pb1 pair corresponds to that of &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA, with db1 directly adjacent to the tetraloop. Given the overlapping positions of the two db+pb sets it is expected that there would be mutually exclusive recognition by RNase III of the two sets. A cleavage assay reveals that 5&#x02032; <sup>32</sup>P-labeled R1.1[db1pb1,db2pb2] RNA is cleaved at the site specified by db1pb1 (site 1), and also at the site specified by db2pb2 (site 2), albeit with lower efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 2). Thus, the introduction of a second db+pb site creates a new target site. Sequencing gel analysis of the cleaved products (gel electropherogram not shown) confirmed the positions of the cleavage sites determined by each db+pb set. Given the lower reactivity of &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA[+4 bp] RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), cleavage of the target site specified by db2pb2 (where db2 also is 4 bp from the tetraloop) is expected to be less efficient than cleavage of the target site specified by db1pb1. A significant reduction in cleavage at site 1 is observed when an inhibitory base pair substitution is introduced into db1, or into both db1 and pb1. However, the same substitutions in db2 and/or pb2 do not inhibit cleavage at site 1, and that mutations in all four boxes cause a decrease in overall reactivity of the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 8). We conclude that the two db+pb sets exhibit functional independence, in that an inhibitory base pair in one db+pb set does not adversely affect cleavage directed by the second db+pb set. In this regard it should be noted that an enhancement of cleavage at site 2 is observed when an inhibitory mutation is placed in db1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane 4). This observation suggests that this mutation may cause an equalization in affinity of the two sites for RNase III (see also Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study has characterized the effects of base pair sequence on the cleavage reactivity and binding affinity of a minimal substrate of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III. The properties of &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA as a substrate are relevant in considering the basis for the sequence control of reactivity. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 148 nM is &#x0223c;3-fold larger than that of the parent substrate, R1.1 RNA (&#x0223c;50 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), and the <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6"><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>K</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>D</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02032;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> for the &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA&#x02013;RNase III complex also is significantly larger than the K'<sub>D</sub> values of complexes of RNase III with R1.1 RNA and variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). The values indicate a relative weak binding affinity. The reduced affinity is consistent with the recent structural analysis of <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> RNase III (D44N mutant), bound to a cleaved RNA (RNA 6) that is identical to the 28 nt product of cleavage of &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows the sites of interaction of RNA 6 with specific regions (RBMs) of <italic>A.aeolicus</italic> RNase III. Substrates that are shorter than &#x0223c;22 bp, such as &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA, would not be able to engage in the full complement of protein contacts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and therefore would be expected to have a reduced binding affinity. The protein&#x02013;RNA contacts observed in the <italic>A.aeolicus</italic> RNase III&#x000b7;RNA 6 cocrystal span &#x0223c;11 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), which is consistent with the finding that an 11 bp helix between the db and cleavage site is the minimal length needed for significant reactivity. In this regard, the exhaustive cleavage by <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III of long dsRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> yields products ranging in size from &#x0223c;11&#x02013;15 bp, with negligible amounts of products &#x0003c;&#x0223c;11 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The absence of products shorter than 11 bp may in part reflect the low binding affinity of these products, effectively preventing further cleavage.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> summarizes the base pair sequence elements that specify a target site for <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III. The elements are located within an 11 bp helix, and include: (i) the 2 bp db, with a UA and UG pair at positions 1 and 2, respectively; (ii) the 4 bp pb, with a GC pair at pb position 1; an AU or UA pair at pb position 2; an AU pair at pb position 3; and an AU or UA pair at pb position 4; and (iii) a 2 bp segment between the db and pb, termed the middle box (mb), whose sequence content can modulate reactivity (see also below). That a single pb+db set is sufficient to specify an RNase III cleavage site provides additional evidence that the two boxes function as positive recognition determinants. The two target sites in the substrate that contains two db+pb sets exhibit unequal reactivity, with the less reactive site distal to the tetraloop terminus. Mutation of the db for the preferred site yields comparable levels of cleavage at both target sites. These results are consistent with mutually exclusive recognition by RNase III of two sites of unequal affinity. However, further mutational and footprinting analyses are needed to more precisely define the mode of interaction of RNase III with substrates containing multiple overlapping recognition sites.</p><sec><title>Evidence that db structure, but not sequence, functions as a positive recognition determinant</title><p>The pattern of inhibition by base pair substitutions in the db does not indicate in any obvious manner a direct recognition of sequence by RNase III. Instead, the canonical sequence may provide a unique local structure that is optimally recognized by RNase III. This proposal is supported by hydroxyl radical footprinting and ethylation interference analyses of RNase III&#x02013;substrate complexes, which show protein contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the db (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). In addition, nucleotide analog interference mapping using substrates containing 2&#x02032;-deoxyribonucleotide phosphorothioates identified protein contacts with specific 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl groups within the db (A. Harmouch and A. W. Nicholson, unpublished data). The crystal structure of an <italic>A.aeolicus</italic> RNase III(D44N)&#x02022;RNA 6 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) reveals the db minor groove as a site of recognition by a segment of the RNase III polypeptide, termed RBM4, that connnects the &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;6 helices of the nuclease domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). One interaction involves a hydrogen bond between the Arg97 side chain and a ribose 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). It is therefore possible that the strong inhibitory effect of the UG&#x02192;GU substitution (as well as other substitutions) may reflect an alteration of local structure, causing disruption of one or more hydrogen bonds involving the sugar-phosphate backbone and RBM4. In this regard, the UG pair seen in the <italic>A.aeolicus</italic> RNase III(D44N)&#x02022;RNA 6 cocrystal exhibits the canonical wobble structure, with the attendant local distortion of the double-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).</p><p>Additional RNase III side chains may participate in db recognition. The recently-reported crystal structure of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> RNase III, and molecular modeling analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) suggest a close proximity to the db of a conserved glutamic acid (E100 in <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is known that the E100A mutation increases the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for substrates of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), and that the E100A mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) as well as the <italic>rnc</italic>-97 (G97E) mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>)&#x02014;both of which map within RBM4&#x02014;cause a requirement for a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration for optimal activity. This suggests that divalent metal ion may either be directly involved in the db-RBM4 interaction, or that it rescues reactivity in an indirect manner. Since RBM4 sequence and length vary among bacterial RNase III orthologs (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), the specific features of the db-RBM4 interaction also may vary across phylogeny, and that the db sequences in turn may be nonconserved. The availability of high-resolution structural data on RNase III&#x02013;substrate complexes provides a basis to determine the source of specificity and binding energy in db-mediated recognition of substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>On the function of the pb as a positive recognition determinant, and as a site of action of catalytic antideterminants</title><p>Pb positions 1&#x02013;3 function as positive recognition determinants for <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III, with a preferred sequence at each position. In contrast, pb position 4 is a site where specific base pair substitutions can suppress the catalytic step without inhibiting binding. The structure of the <italic>A.aeolicus</italic> RNase III&#x02022;RNA 6 cocrystal reveals a cluster of hydrogen bonds involving RNA functional groups at pb position 2 and specific side chains in the N-terminal portion of the &#x003b1;8 helix (RBM1) in the dsRBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Specifically, the uracil O2 atom in the canonical AU pair and a neighboring ribose 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group engage in hydrogen bonds with the Q157 carboxamide group. This interaction suggests a source for the sequence specificity, and also how a purine 2-amino group at pb position 2 could disrupt RNase III recognition. In the latter instance, the inhibitory CG pair would place a 2-amino group (a hydrogen bond donor) adjacent to the Q157 carboxamide amino group (also a hydrogen bond donor). This juxtaposition would not allow hydrogen bond formation, and perhaps also disrupt the hydrogen bond involving the adjacent 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group. Moreover, the involvement of two hydrogen bonds rationalizes the ability of the CG&#x02192;CI substitution to afford only a partial functional rescue. Since the inosine base does not contain a hydrogen bond acceptor group at the C2 position, the Q157 side chain would engage substrate with only a single hydrogen bond. The conservation of the glutamine residue in RBM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; A. Pertzev and A. Nicholson, unpublished data) suggests that the Q157 side chain-pb interaction is conserved among RNase III orthologs. It is of interest that RBM1 maps within the dsRBD, whose RNA-binding ability has generally been assumed to be base pair sequence-nonspecific. Ji and coworkers also noted the interaction of specific base functional groups within a bound, non-cleavable dsRNA with the side chains of Q157 and Q161 of <italic>A.aeolicus</italic> RNase III, and the potential for this interaction to provide base pair sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). The apparent ability of the RNase III dsRBD to recognize Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair sequence at pb position 2 provides the first evidence for the base pair sequence specificity for the dsRBD, and suggests a broadened functional versatility of this motif in mediating dsRNA&#x02013;protein interactions.</p><p>Pb position 4 represents a separate locus of protein interaction. Here, a ribose 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group and a non-bridging phosphate oxygen engage in hydrogen bonds with the side chains of specific residues in the &#x003b1;4 helix, termed RBM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). No base-specific contacts are observed. The ability of the GC or CG substitution at pb position 4 to suppress cleavage without inhibiting substrate binding formally classifies these sequences as catalytic antideterminants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). While the mechanism of inhibition is not known, one possibility is that a substrate conformational change required for cleavage may be hindered by the stronger GC or CG bp. Consistent with this proposal, substitution of guanine by inosine lessens the inhibition caused by the GC bp substitution. However, since reactivity is not fully restored, other features unique to the GC/CG bp apparently participate in the uncoupling of binding and cleavage. It is noteworthy that R1.1[CL3B] RNA&#x02014;a cleavage-resistant, but binding-competent R1.1 RNA variant identified by <italic>in vitro</italic> selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>)&#x02014;contains a GC pair at pb position 4, while the efficiently cleaved R1.1 RNA contains a nominally stable UC pair at the same position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Catalytic antideterminants have been identified in substrates of the yeast RNase III ortholog, Rnt1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). It was shown in one of the studies that a UA bp substitution at the tetraloop closing position uncouples binding and cleavage, and that the adenine 6 amino group is specifically responsible for uncoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). The ability of Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs to function as catalytic antideterminants suggests that regular double-helical structures can provide cleavage-resistant binding sites for RNase III, with potential gene-regulatory functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Modulation of reactivity by a double-helical element between the pb and db</title><p>The sequence content of a 2 bp segment between the db and pb modulates substrate reactivity. Here, the U<sub>12</sub>:G<sub>27</sub>&#x02192;GU or GC substitution enhances cleavage reactivity (relative reactivity of 1.4), while the C<sub>13</sub>:G<sub>26</sub>&#x02192;GC substitution decreases reactivity (relative reactivity of 0.36) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The structure of the <italic>A.aeolicus</italic> RNase III&#x02013;RNA complex reveals that this segment, termed the middle box (mb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), is a site of protein contact. Specifically, a ribose 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group in the mb engages in a hydrogen bond with the side chain of a Histidine (H180) residue within the segment, termed RBM2, that connects the &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 strands of the dsRBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The lack of strong inhibition by Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair substitutions supports the absence of base-specific contacts. However, it is possible that certain substitutions (e.g. non-Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs) that alter local structure could control reactivity by determining whether the observed hydrogen bond is established, and thus serve to &#x02018;fine-tune&#x02019; substrate reactivity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUMMARY</title><p>It was originally proposed that <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III cleavage sites are identified by a default pathway, wherein specifically positioned Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair antideterminants mask otherwise reactive phosphodiesters, thereby limiting cleavage to a single target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). The model did not require the involvement of positive recognition determinants. This study has allowed a refinement of the model to include positive recognition determinants in the form of specific base pair sequences. Thus, both positive as well as negative (i.e. antideterminant) elements cooperate to identify the cleavage site(s) and control reactivity of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III substrates, and by extension other bacterial RNase III substrates. The ability of base pair sequence to modulate reactivity can serve to establish hierarchical reactivities among the diverse array of cellular substrates. Thus, the binding affinity can determine cleavage efficiency, that in turn can establish the RNA decay rate, if RNase III action represents the rate-limiting event in a multi-step pathway. Finally, given the growing number of characterized substrates for eukaryotic RNase III orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>), and the identification of functionally essential RNase III polypeptides in kinetoplastid RNA editosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) it can be anticipated that base pair sequence control of RNase III action may be operative in RNA processing and decay pathways in eukaryotic cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper is dedicated to the memory of Hugh D.

The arrow indicates the RNase III cleavage site.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl459f7"/></fig><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Locations of RBMs 1&#x02013;4 in bacterial RNase III polypeptides. Shown is a sequence alignment of four bacterial RNase III polypeptides, indicating the locations of secondary structural elements (highlighted in green) as determined by X-ray crystallography, and also the positions of RBMs 1&#x02013;4. Noted by each motif is the site of interaction with the minimal substrate (pb, db or mb), as provided by the crystallographic analysis of <italic>A.aeolicus</italic> (Aa) RNase III bound to a cleaved minimal substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). The secondary structural elements for Aa RNase III and <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> (Mt) RNase III were from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), respectively. The secondary structure of the dsRBD of Mt RNase III is not shown, since the position of the dsRBD is disordered in the crystal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). The secondary structural elements of <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (Tm) RNase III were provided by the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (San Diego) (PDB entry 1O0W). The secondary structure of <italic>E.coli</italic> (Ec) RNase III is not known, since the structure of the protein has not been determined. The nuclease domain (NucD), dsRBD, and flexible linker regions are noted. The asterisks indicate conserved residues within RBM1 and RBM4 that interact with the pb and db, respectively (see also Discussion).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl459f8"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Effect of proximal box substitutions on RNase III binding to &#x003bc;R1.1 RNA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><graphic xlink:href="gkl459t1"/></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Effect of inosine substitution on the uncoupling of binding and cleavage by the GC bp substitution at proximal box position 4</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><graphic xlink:href="gkl459t2"/></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></back></article>
