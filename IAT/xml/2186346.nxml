We have recently reported loss of Smad4 in every fourth carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Smad4 transmits signals from the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily of cytokines and functions as a versatile transcriptional co-modulator. The prevailing view suggests that the tumour suppressor function of Smad4 primarily resides in its capability to mediate TGF-&#x003b2; growth inhibitory responses. However, accumulating evidence indicates, that the acquisition of TGF-&#x003b2; resistance and loss of Smad4 may be independent events in the carcinogenic process.

Loss of Smad4 occurs in one half of pancreatic adenocarcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], in one third of metastatic colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and in every fourth carcinoma of the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We have recently reported that Smad4 is also implicated in cervical carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Four of 13 cervical cancer cell lines displayed Smad4 deficiency due to insertional inactivation or homozygous loss of 3' exons. Furthermore, Smad4 expression was lost in 10 of 41 primary squamous cervical carcinomas and reduced in 26 cases as shown by immunohistochemistry, whereas all cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) retained normal Smad4 expression levels.</p><p>Defining the mechanisms of Smad4 tumour suppressor function and identifying Smad4 target genes is critical to address its potential as a therapeutic or diagnostic target. Smad4 is characterised as a transmitter of signals of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily of cytokines. The founding member of this family, TGF-&#x003b2;1, potently inhibits the growth of normal epithelial cells. Cancer cells typically have lost sensitivity to TGF-&#x003b2; antiproliferative responses. When Smad4-deficient tumours were first identified, it was assumed that loss of TGF-&#x003b2; antiproliferative and proapoptotic responses underlie the tumour suppressor function of Smad4. However, during recent years it has become evident that the relationship of TGF-&#x003b2; and Smad4 is much more complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Accumulating evidence from our lab and others has suggested that Smad4 loss and TGF-&#x003b2; resistance attainable via multiple molecular alterations may be independent events.</p><p>Squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix is typically initiated through infection with high-risk human papillomavirus types, in particular HPV16 and HPV18. The E6 and E7 viral proteins deregulate cell growth control through inactivation of the p53 and pRB tumour suppressor gene products. Again, the postulated association of Smad4 loss with TGF-&#x003b2; resistance appears less clear. Only few from the cervical carcinoma cell lines display some residual TGF-&#x003b2; responsiveness, irrespective of their Smad4-positive or Smad4-negative status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Loss of Smad4 is a late step in gastrointestinal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] as well as in cervical cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], consistent with the hypothesis that Smad4 may function as a suppressor of invasion. TGF-&#x003b2;, in contrast, is characterised as a promoter of invasion in late stages of carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Stable reexpression of Smad4 in colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma cells at physiological levels was adequate to suppress tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, but did not restore TGF-&#x003b2; responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Rather, we have shown that Smad4 regulates an angiogenic switch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and functions as a positive regulator of the invasion suppressor gene, E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and of the heterotrimeric laminin-5 molecule, which is a major basement membrane constituent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>These data show that cell culture models are suited to investigate mechanisms underlying Smad4-mediated tumour suppression. However, it has been argued that stable transfection of Smad4 might select for clones that are resistant to the growth inhibitory function of Smad4 due to defects downstream of Smad4. Thus, we decided to generate stable transfectants from Smad4-deficient C4-II cervical cancer cells conditionally expressing Smad4. We have obtained clones with a range of expression levels for Smad4, spanning no expression, physiological expression and overexpression up to approximately 50-fold of the physiological level. Reduction of tumour growth in nude mice was observed in clones with either physiological or high Smad4 expression levels. In contrast, cell growth <italic>in vitro </italic>was not affected, except in clones with very high Smad4 overexpression. Resistance towards TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated growth inhibition, as measured by response of cell-cycle associated genes such as c-myc, p21 and p15, was retained in clones expressing physiological and 50-fold increased Smad4 levels.</p><p>We then used expression profiling to search for Smad4-dependent target genes. This revealed three genes, namely PAI-1, fibronectin and BigH3, which were induced in response to TGF-&#x003b2; in high as well as in low Smad4-expressing C4-II cells. Interestingly, all of these genes encode secreted proteins presumably affecting tumour matrix and stroma. It is notable that the basal expression levels (and TGF-&#x003b2; response) of these genes were also increased by Smad4 reexpression in Smad4-negative pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, and were reduced upon Smad4 knockdown in Smad4-positive cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>C4-II cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco). As Smad4 deficiency has not previously been reported for cervical carcinoma cells, we first checked the identity of the cell line. C4-II cells contain integrated HPV18 DNA. HPV18 specific transcripts were detected by RT-PCR. In addition, Southern hybridization of C4-II genomic DNA with an HPV18 specific probe yielded restriction fragments, which are indicative and specific for the HPV18 integration site in C4-II cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Constructs</title><p>The set of vectors for tetracycline-inducible transgene expression were purchased from Clontech Laboratories. The full-length coding sequence of DPC4/Smad4 was derived from the pBK-DPC4 constitutive expression construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The DPC4/Smad4 coding sequence was inserted into the NheI/EcoRI sites of the pTRE-vector. The construct was confirmed by direct sequencing (Sequitherm Cycle Sequencing, Epicentre). All plasmids used for transfections were CsCl<sub>2 </sub>purified followed by proteinase K digestion, phenol extraction and precipitation.</p><p>Smad4 reconstituted pancreatic carcinoma cells were generated by retroviral transduction. The stable knockdown derivatives from human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, Paca44, were established through transfection of an siRNA construct kindly provided by F.

Transfectants were selected in media with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>g/ml G418 and single colonies were isolated and expanded. Clones that showed a low basal activity and high inducibility of the transactivator in the presence of doxycycline were identified by transient transfections with the TRE-luciferase reporter. Transient transfections were carried out with DAC 30&#x02122; transfection reagent (Eurogentec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase was determined using a luciferase detection kit (Promega). Two clones displaying approximately 5-fold (clone 28) and 10-fold (clone 18) induced luciferase expression in transient assays were chosen for the second round of transfections. The TRE-DPC4 plasmid was cotransfected with pTK-Hyg or pY3-Hyg plasmids coding for the hygromycin B resistance gene. Selection was carried out in media with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>g/ml G418 and 15 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>g/ml hygromycin B, yielding a total of 49 clones.</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blot analysis</title><p>RNA was isolated by acid phenol extraction or using a commercial kit (RNeasy; Qiagen).

Protein lysates were subjected to standard SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The blots were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against Smad4 (anti-Smad4 B8; dilution 1:500, Santa Cruz). Antibodies against phospho-Smad2 and Smad3 from Biomol were used at a 1:1000 dilution.</p></sec><sec><title>Transient transfection assays with p6SBE and p3TPlux reporter plasmids</title><p>The p3TP-Lux construct was a kind gift from J.

C4-II cells were plated in 10 cm dishes. One day before transfection, half of the cells were treated with doxycycline (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6 </sup>g/ml) to induce Smad4 expression. Twenty-four hours later, 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well were plated in 24 well plates with or without doxycycline. Using the effectene transfection protocol, the cells were transfected with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>g p6SBE-luc reporter plasmid containing 6 Smad binding elements concatemerised in front of the reporter promoter or with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>g p3TPluc reporter plasmid containing AP1 and PAI-1 promoter elements. Transfection efficiency was determined from cotransfection of the &#x003b2;-gal reporter plasmid (4.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>g per well). The transfection mixture was removed 24 h later, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without TGF-&#x003b2; (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9 </sup>g/ml). The luciferase and galactosidase activities were measured after another 24 hours. All assays were done in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of TGF-&#x003b2; responses <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>For <italic>in vitro </italic>growth analysis 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells were plated on 60 mm dishes in medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum with or without 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6 </sup>g/ml doxycycline. Two days after plating medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9 </sup>g/ml recombinant transforming growth factor beta 1 (R&#x00026;D systems). Cell numbers were counted from duplicate plates every 3 or 4 days. Alternatively the cell cycle phase distribution was determined by flow cytometry after propidiumiodide incorporation.</p><p>For the analysis of endogenous transcriptional responses, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells were plated on 60 mm dishes in standard medium or in serum-reduced medium (0.5% fetal calf serum) with or without doxycycline. TGF-&#x003b2; (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9 </sup>g/ml) was added after 24 hours, and cells were harvested for RNA preparations 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours later. Where indicated, cells were treated with cycloheximide solubilised in 0.25% ethanol at a final concentration of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6 </sup>g/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumour growth in nude mice</title><p>Suspensions of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells in a volume of 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6-week old female athymic nude mice (Balb/c01aHsd-nu/nu). Smad4 expression was induced prior to injection of the cells through incubation in standard medium containing 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6 </sup>g/ml doxycycline, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>g/ml G418 and 75 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6 </sup>g/ml hygromycin B. To maintain Smad4 induction <italic>in vivo</italic>, drinking water for nude mice bearing doxycycline-induced cells was supplemented with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>g/ml doxycycline hydrochloride (Sigma) and 2.5% sucrose. Tumour growth was assessed every 3 days, and animals were sacrificed 2 weeks (clones 18-2 and derivatives) and 4 weeks (clones 28 and derivatives) after injection of the cells, when the largest tumour in the group reached a diameter of 10 mm. Tumours were excised, weighed and snap frozen. The tumour growth assays were performed twice with 3 mice per cell clone both with and without Smad4 expression. Statistical significance of tumour growth suppression was calculated using a t-test after Welch correction using Graph Pad Prism 4 software.</p></sec><sec><title>Atlas hybridisation experiments</title><p>Macroarray hybridisation was performed on BD Clontech ATLAS human 1.2 microarrays according to the manufacturer's instructions.

In a first transfection round, the tetracycline-dependent reverse transactivator was transferred and clones displaying inducible expression of a reporter gene under control of a tetracycline response element (TRE) were identified in transient transfections. Two &#x0201e;tet-on" clones, namely clone 18 and clone 28, were used in a second round of transfections with the TRE-Smad4 expression plasmid yielding a total of 49 derivative clones. We used Northern blot analysis to screen all clones, and identified 15 clones with inducible Smad4 expression and very low or absent background expression (examples are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Characterisation of inducible Smad4-reexpression in C4-II tet-on cell clones</bold>. a) Northern blot showing Smad4-specific mRNA in a number of independent clones derived from tet-on clones 18 and 28.

Smad4-specific transcripts were detectable after 4 hours in clone 18-2, and as soon as 1&#x02013;2 hours in clone 28-14. Maximal levels were reached after 6&#x02013;9 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). As expected, Smad4 protein expression closely followed the time-course of mRNA induction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). The titration of RNA and protein revealed that the Smad4 expression level in clone 18-2 was approximately in the physiological range (similar to SW480 derivatives characterised in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]) and that clones 28-14 and 28-8 expressed roughly 20- to 50-fold more Smad4 RNA and protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d, e</xref>). Thus, the inducible expression system allows investigation of Smad4 effects exerted at "normal" levels as well as upon strong overexpression.</p></sec><sec><title>C4-II cell growth <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>We have shown previously that Smad4-deficient C4-II cells do not respond to TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This result was confirmed with the C4-II tet-on clones 18 and 28 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a, b</xref>). Smad4 is known to mediate TGF-&#x003b2;-induced growth inhibition in normal epithelial cells. Thus, we wondered if inducible Smad4 expression was adequate to restore TGF-&#x003b2; responsiveness in these cells. Cell growth in standard medium was not affected by physiological Smad4 expression levels in clone 18-2, and addition of recombinant TGF-&#x003b2; did not exert a measurable effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a, b</xref>). In contrast, growth of clones 28-8 and 28-14 was moderately reduced in standard medium and upon long-term incubation, nearly came to a halt in TGF-&#x003b2;-containing medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Notably however, effects of TGF-&#x003b2; on the cell cycle distribution were moderate in 28-8 cells as compared to HaCaT cells, which served as a positive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cell growth of Smad4-reexpressing C4-II tet-on cell clones <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic></bold>.

To determine whether conditional Smad4 expression is functional <italic>in vivo </italic>in C4-II cell clones and is sufficient to mediate suppression of tumour growth, Smad4 expression was induced <italic>in vitro </italic>in one half of the cells by overnight incubation in doxycycline containing media. Cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of nude mice and doxycycline was added to the drinking water of mice bearing the induced cells. Tet-on clones 18 and 28 were included as controls and tumour growth was scored twice a week (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Addition of doxycycline to the drinking water did not affect tumour growth from tet-on clones 18 and 28, ruling out unspecific effects of the inducer. In contrast, mean tumour mass was significantly reduced to less than half as compared to the uninduced cells in the low expressor clone, 18-2, as well as in the high expressor clones, 28-8 and 28-14. Low and high Smad4 expression levels were retained in vivo, as confirmed in Northern blots of tumour-derived mRNA (data not shown). Thus, physiological Smad4 levels in this cell model are adequate to significantly reduce tumor growth.</p></sec><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2; responses in Smad4-deficient and in Smad4-reexpressing C4-II cells</title><p>The ability of Smad4 to mediate tumour suppression has largely been attributed to its presumed role as a mediator of TGF-&#x003b2;-induced growth inhibition. Our results do not support this hypothesis. Restoration of some TGF-&#x003b2; responsiveness was restricted to clones displaying 20- to 50-fold overexpression of Smad4, while physiological Smad4 levels were capable of exerting a Smad4-mediated reduction in tumour growth.</p><p>We, therefore, proceeded to characterise TGF-&#x003b2; responses in Smad4-deficient C4-II cells and in their Smad4-reexpressing derivatives in more detail. As the activation of TGF-&#x003b2; receptors might be limiting, we first analysed phosphorylation of receptor Smads, Smad2/3, in response to the addition of recombinant TGF-&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). No constitutive phosphorylation was observed, and phosphorylation in response to TGF-&#x003b2; did not differ between Smad4-deficient and Smad4-reexpressing clones. This result differs somewhat from published data, where high constitutive phosphorylation of receptor-Smads was reported in Smad4-deficient pancreatic cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Restoration of TGF-&#x003b2; responses in Smad4-reexpressing C4-II clones</bold>. a) Phosphorylation of R-Smad2/3 in response to TGF-&#x003b2; was assessed through Western blotting with a phospho-Smad2/3-specific antibody. b) TGF-&#x003b2; response in transient transfections with the p6SBE-luc promoter; the induction factor in Smad4-reexpressing clones is 5&#x02013;8. c) TGF-&#x003b2; response in transient transfections with the p3TP-luc promoter; induction in Smad4-negative cells is approximately 1.5 and rises to 3&#x02013;4 in Smad4-reexpressing clones.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-7-209-3"/></fig><p>Next, we tested responses of the p6SBE and the p3TPluc promoter-reporter constructs frequently used to assess TGF-&#x003b2; responsiveness. The p6SBE promoter, constructed to reflect Smad-dependent transcriptional induction, contains concatemerised SBE (Smad binding element) sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As expected, luciferase activity of this promoter was not induced in the absence of Smad4 expression, but was strongly increased by a factor of 5&#x02013;8 in Smad4-reexpressing clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). The p3TPluc promoter is a hybrid promoter carrying sequences derived from the fibronectin and PAI-1 promoters optimised as an indicator of TGF-&#x003b2; responses. Interestingly, this construct was induced independently of Smad4 by TGF-&#x003b2; by a factor of approximately 1.5-fold in the tet-on clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). As expected, all Smad4-reexpressing clones showed increased TGF-&#x003b2; induction of luciferase activity. Notably, induction levels in response to TGF-&#x003b2; using both constructs were quite similar between clone 18-2 and high-expressor clones, 28-8 and 28-14.</p><p>As Smad4 proved fully functional in transmitting TGF-&#x003b2; responses in transient transfection assays, we then determined responses of endogenous TGF-&#x003b2; target genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2;-induced growth inhibition in normal epithelial cells is associated with Smad4-dependent alterations in cell cycle-associated target genes, namely the transcriptional repression of c-myc and induction of p15 and p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Minor effects on the levels of c-myc transcripts were observed here, but were not dependent on Smad4 expression. No changes in the levels of p15 and p21 transcripts were detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results show that reexpression of Smad4, even at much higher levels, is not adequate to restore TGF-&#x003b2;-induced growth inhibition through the classical pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Northern blot analysis of endogenous TGF-&#x003b2; target genes</bold>.

We used expression profiling in order to detect alternative Smad4 target genes. Macroarrays were hybridised with cDNA derived from 18-2 cells and from 28-8 cells cultured in the absence or presence of doxycycline and untreated or treated with TGF-&#x003b2;. We detected no significant differences in expression profiles of 18-2 cells +/- doxycycline or +/- TGF-&#x003b2;. Likewise, 28-8 cells grown in standard media in the absence and presence of doxycycline did not display Smad4 target genes. Ultimately, hybridisation of cDNA derived from TGF-&#x003b2;-treated 28-8 cells revealed Smad4-dependent TGF-&#x003b2; induction of BigH3, fibronectin and PAI-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). It is noteworthy to mention that all of these target genes encode secreted and extracellular matrix-associated proteins. Northern blotting with RNA prepared from all three clones at different time points after TGF-&#x003b2; induction confirmed strong induction of these three target genes in the high-expressor clones, 28-8 and 28-14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). The low expressor clone, 18-2, displayed significant but less-pronounced increases in mRNA levels of the target genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). To examine if the effect was dose-dependent, we titrated Smad4 levels in clone 28-8. Also in this clone, low levels of Smad4 were sufficient to induce expression of BigH3, fibronectin and PAI-1 in response to TGF-&#x003b2;, and the extent of induction mounted in parallel with doxycycline and corresponding Smad4 levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Identification and validation of Smad4-dependent TGF-&#x003b2; target genes</bold>. a) Smad4-dependent TGF-&#x003b2; target genes in 28-8 cells were identified through hybridisation of Clontech Cancer II arrays.

Here, induction of the three target genes was apparent only at late time points, suggesting that it might work through indirect mechanisms. In fact, cycloheximide treatment of the cells suppressed induction to virtually basal levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>).</p><p>These results show that TGF-&#x003b2; induction of BigH3, fibronectin and PAI-1 correlates with Smad4 expression levels and works via indirect mechanisms requiring protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Smad4 control of secreted TGF-&#x003b2; target genes is not restricted to cervical cancer cells</title><p>In order to assess the scope of our findings we wished to know if Smad4 controls the expression of secreted TGF-&#x003b2; target genes in tumour cells derived from other organs.

Stable Smad4 reexpression in colorectal and pancreatic cancer cells was adequate to mediate tumour suppression <italic>in vivo</italic>, did not inhibit cell growth <italic>in vitro </italic>and was not sufficient to rescue TGF-&#x003b2; antiproliferative responses. To rule out that stable Smad4 expression may select for clones in which TGF-&#x003b2; resistance is caused by additional defects downstream of Smad4, we developed a cell model with conditional Smad4 expression. We obtained clones using a tet-on system in which Smad4 can be reversibly turned off and on to levels ranging between zero and 50-fold of endogenous levels in the control cells. Using this system, we found that reduced tumour growth <italic>in vivo </italic>could be mediated through physiological as well as excessive levels of Smad4. In contrast, reduced cell growth <italic>in vitro </italic>and growth inhibition in response to TGF-&#x003b2; were restricted to cells strongly overexpressing Smad4. The "classical" cell cycle-associated TGF-&#x003b2; target genes were, however, not induced under these conditions, suggesting that growth responses in these cells <italic>in vitro </italic>do not reflect physiological mechanisms in cancer cells but occur only upon excessive Smad4 overexpression.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the only conditional Smad4 expression model published to date was developed by Calonge and Massagu&#x000e9; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These authors established cell clones derived from the SW480 colorectal carcinoma cell line using an ecdysone inducible system. They obtained maximal Smad4 expression levels which were comparable to endogenous levels expressed in HaCaT control cells. Consistent with our previous results using stable transfection of SW480 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], conditional Smad4 expression also did not affect the TGF-&#x003b2; target genes, p21 and c-myc, and was not sufficient to restore TGF-&#x003b2;-induced growth inhibition.</p><p>We conclude from our results that, as has previously been shown for colorectal and pancreatic cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], direct effects of Smad4 on tumour cell proliferation in cervical carcinoma cells are dispensable for Smad4-mediated tumour suppression. These results strengthen the idea that Smad4-dependent tumour suppression is due to more complex mechanisms functioning <italic>in vivo</italic>, which may include altered interactions of tumour cells with stromal cell types and the extracellular matrix. Target genes involved in the Smad4-mediated tumour suppression in colorectal and in pancreatic carcinoma cells, such as E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], laminin-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], VEGF and thrombospondin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], however, did not respond to Smad4-reexpression in C4-II cervical cancer cells.</p><p>Expression profiling on macroarrays did not show altered expression levels of Smad4 target genes without TGF-&#x003b2; treatment of Smad4-expressing C4-II cells. After TGF-&#x003b2; treatment, the Smad4 target genes, fibronectin, PAI-1 and BigH3, were induced in C4-II cells expressing physiological levels of Smad4 and superinduced in Smad4-overexpressing cells. Whereas Smad4-dependent TGF-&#x003b2; induction of these genes is not novel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the underlying pathway appears to differ from that in normal epithelial cells. The linear TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad pathway signals from activated TGF-&#x003b2; receptors via phosphorylation of receptor-Smads. This leads to complex formation with Smad4, translocation of heteromeric Smad complexes into the nucleus and binding to SBE sites in the promoter regions of target genes. This direct pathway does not depend on protein synthesis, and results in rapid transcriptional induction. In Smad4-reexpressing C4-II cells, however, induction of the target genes appeared late and was suppressed to near basal expression levels by the addition of cycloheximide. We conclude that this Smad4-mediated induction requires protein synthesis, and may be executed through Smad4 induction of other transcription factors which in turn induce transcription of Smad4 target genes in an indirect manner. We used transient transfections of promoter-reporter constructs in order to identify putative transcription factor binding sites responsible for such indirect Smad4 effects. However, luciferase reporter activity in transiently transfected C4-II cells with or without doxycycline-induced Smad4 expression and with or without TGF-&#x003b2; did not reflect the transcriptional responses of the endogenous target genes. Unravelling the underlying molecular mechanisms in detail will require more cumbersome approaches. As Smad4-expression in C4-II cells can be tightly controlled, whole genome expression profiling in time-course experiments may indicate direct and indirect Smad4 target genes.</p><p>The three Smad4 target genes identified in C4-II cervical cancer cells encode secreted proteins which are deposited in extracellular matrices in tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is well known, that interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) in general play a crucial role in tumour angiogenesis, invasiveness and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Consequently, the roles of ECM molecules have been addressed in numerous studies. High expression levels of PAI-1, for example, have been correlated with pro- and anti-tumour effects. The reported prognostic relevance of PAI-1 in cervical cancer as well as in other cancer types is conflicting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. An expression analysis of BigH3 in cervical cancers has not yet been published. Interestingly, the expression levels of BigH3 in pancreatic carcinomas were reported to be high, although highly variable, in virtually every sample analysed in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It would be interesting to correlate the Smad4 status of the tumour cells with TGF-&#x003b2; and BigH3 levels in this tumour panel.</p><p>Recent approaches addressing functions of BigH3 in the carcinogenic process have consistently suggested anti-tumour activity, and have unravelled novel mechanisms how this protein could exert tumour suppressive effects. BigH3, also known as keratoepithelin and as TGF-&#x003b2;-induced gene, is a ubiquitous constituent of the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It encodes a 69 kDa protein containing four internal fascilin I-like repeats (fas domains) and an RGD peptide at the C-terminus. BigH3 supports cell attachment and spreading, induces actin stress fiber formation, and binds fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and integrins. Skonier et al. have shown that BigH3 gene transfection into CHO cells led to a marked decrease in the ability of these cells to form tumours in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Also, restoration of BigH3 in human bronchial epithelial cells resulted in a significant reduction in tumour growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. BigH3 induced differentiation in keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and inhibited proliferation and invasion in human neuroblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Interestingly, fastatin, the fourth FAS domain of BigH3, has been shown to induce apoptosis and suppress endothelial tube formation, thus inhibiting tumour growth through suppression of neovascularisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Although no reports concerning BigH3 functions in cervical tissues exist to our knowledge, it is reasonable to speculate that this protein may also exert anti-tumour effects in cervical tumours.</p><p>Smad4 functions as an integrator of cellular responses to multiple external stimuli. Consequently, the outcome of Smad4 reexpression on expression profiles of tumour cells <italic>in vivo </italic>will widely differ from expression patterns <italic>in vitro</italic>. The microenvironment <italic>in vivo </italic>is regulated through complex interactions between tumour and stromal cell types. Growth factors and cytokines other than TGF-&#x003b2; may be expressed either by the tumour cells, by activated fibroblasts, or by inflammatory and immune cells. Treatment with recombinant cytokines to mimic the effect of these stromal cell types <italic>in vivo </italic>in combination with whole genome expression profiling holds promise to discover additional Smad4 target genes in the future. C4-II cells conditionally expressing extensive Smad4 levels in such approaches may serve as superindicators of cytokine-induced Smad4-responsive genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The heterologous reexpression of Smad4 in Smad4-deficient cancer cell lines could reduce tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>.
