We investigated the effect of DSB repair on instability of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence. Linear plasmids were transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> so that each colony represented an individual DSB repair event. Repair of a DSB within the repeat resulted in a dramatic increase in deletions compared with circular templates, but DSB repair outside the repeat tract did not affect instability. Repair-mediated deletions were independent of the orientation and length of the repeat, the location of the break within the repeat or the RecA status of the strain. Repair at the center of the repeat resulted in deletion of approximately half of the repeat tract, and repair at an off-center location produced deletions that were equivalent in length to the shorter of the two repeats flanking the DSB. This is consistent with a single-strand annealing mechanism of DSB repair, and implicates erroneous DSB repair as a mechanism for genetic instability of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence. Our data contrast significantly with DSB repair within (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n</sub> repeats, indicating that repair-mediated instability is dependent on the sequence of the triplet repeat.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is one of over 20 neurodegenerative diseases caused by the expansion of a triplet-repeat sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Whereas all other triplet-repeat diseases are caused by either expanded (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n</sub> or (CCG&#x02013;CGG)<sub>n</sub> sequences, FRDA is caused by an expanded (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence located in the first intron of the <italic>FXN</italic> gene (previously known as <italic>X25</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence is polymorphic; alleles with &#x0003c;33 triplets do not cause disease, whereas alleles with &#x0003e;65 triplets are disease causing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). The expanded (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence inhibits transcription of the <italic>FXN</italic> gene, most likely by forming a stable secondary structure such as a triplex or sticky DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>), which produces a deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The levels of mature <italic>FXN</italic> transcript and frataxin protein in patient cells is inversely correlated with the length of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and therefore, disease severity, including the age of onset and several other clinical features, directly correlate with repeat length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>).</p><p>The (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence within the <italic>FXN</italic> gene is genetically unstable. The length of the repeat tract often changes during intergenerational transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). The expanded repeat almost always contracts (by &#x0223c;20&#x02013;30%) via paternal transmission, but shows an equal tendency for expansion or contraction during maternal transmission. The expanded (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence also displays somatic instability. In the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which is the primary site of pathology in FRDA patients, there is a tendency for the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence to undergo further expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Interestingly, there is an accumulation of these expansions over time, which suggests that these expansions could contribute to the development of the progressive, tissue-specific phenotype in FRDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, in contrast to DRG, all other human tissues display a marked contraction bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In peripheral blood cells and in sperm, the expanded repeat tract may even revert back to the normal size range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Since FRDA is an autosomal recessive disease, the majority of the disease-causing expanded alleles are inherited via asymptomatic heterozygous carriers of expanded (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> alleles. Indeed, <italic>de novo</italic> expansion from premutation alleles (with 34&#x02013;65 triplets) is rare, and disease prevalence is mostly maintained via the existence of a large number of asymptomatic heterozygous carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Given that disease severity correlates with the length of the inherited expanded allele, and the repeat tract has a natural tendency for large contractions in most human tissues, understanding the mechanisms that cause large contractions may help in developing therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing down or preventing the progressive accumulation of large expansions in DRG.</p><p>The mechanisms responsible for triplet-repeat instability are only partially understood. Recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#x02013;23</xref>), DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>) and epigenetic modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) have all been implicated. Our lab, along with others, has demonstrated that DNA replication can also mediate triplet-repeat instability. The orientation of the (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n</sub>, (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<sub>n</sub> and (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> repeat tract relative to the origin of replication in bacteria and yeast influences instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30 B31 B32 B33">28&#x02013;33</xref>). Furthermore, plasmid replication in transiently transfected mammalian cells in culture was a prerequisite for instability of the (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n</sub> and (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> repeats, with both the orientation of the repeat tract and its distance from the origin of replication acting as significant modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence has been shown to stall replication fork progression, and this occurs specifically when (GAA)<sub>n</sub> is the template for lagging strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36 B37 B38 B39">36&#x02013;39</xref>). Stalling of replication forks may result in a double-strand break (DSB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42">40&#x02013;42</xref>). Others have shown that repair of a DSB near or within a (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n</sub> or (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<sub>n</sub> sequence results in orientation-dependent repeat instability and/or the deletion of flanking sequence. Furthermore, the instability they observed following DSB repair significantly increased in the absence of the RecA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45 B46">43&#x02013;46</xref>). We recently found that in the absence of RecA, (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> instability was significantly increased specifically when GAA served as the lagging strand template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).</p><p>Since the role of DSB repair in mediating (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> instability is unknown, we investigated whether repair of a synthetic DSB within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence would influence repeat instability. We discovered that while DSB repair immediately outside of a (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence had no effect on repeat instability, DSB repair within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence dramatically increased instability. Indeed, almost every single repair event resulted in deletion of the repeat tract. We also found that the high level of instability was RecA-independent. Interestingly, the location of the DSB within the repeat tract significantly influenced the size of the deletion, consistent with a single-strand annealing mechanism by which DSB repair causes contractions of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence. The absence of any dependence on the length and orientation of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> repeat, the presence/absence of RecA, and no obvious deletions involving the sequence flanking the triplet repeat, contrasts significantly with observation previously made with the (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n</sub> sequence. Our results provide a potential mechanistic basis for the frequent deletions seen with the expanded (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence, and also highlight the dependence of the mechanism(s) of genetic instability on the sequence of the expanded triplet repeat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>A (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>79</sub> repeat sequence, isolated by PCR from the <italic>FXN</italic> locus of a human subject, was cloned into pUC19 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).

The GAA-15XGAA-35 construct has a (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>15</sub> sequence on one side of the XbaI restriction site (proximal to the origin) and a (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>35</sub> sequence on the other side of the XbaI site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

The constructs in the GAA orientation were digested with HindIII and EcoRI, which are located outside of the repeat tract. The 3&#x02032; recessed ends of the vectors and inserts were end-filled with Klenow polymerase. The vector and insert were separately gel-purified and the vector was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase, and ligations were set-up.

Southern blotting with a &#x003b3;-P<sup>32</sup> end-labeled pUC19 probe (5&#x02032;-GCTGCAAGGCGATTAAGTTGG-3&#x02032;) was used to verify adequacy of isolation of linear DNA from supercoiled DNA.

The MM28, M152, AB1157 and JC10287 strains were made &#x02018;ultra-competent&#x02019; using the Inoue method. Each transformation was performed using 5 ng of circular plasmid DNA or 25 ng of linearized plasmid DNA, followed by plating on LB-agar plates containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin. Since viability of cells transformed with linear constructs was dependent upon recircularization of the plasmid to provide ampicillin resistance, each colony therefore represented a DSB repair event. Transformation of each template was performed in triplicate and 50&#x02013;100 colonies were screened from each transformation. (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> instability was determined by colony PCR of transformants using primers DSB-F (5&#x02032;-ACAGCTATGACCATGATTACG-3&#x02032;) and DSB-R (5&#x02032;-GGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACG-3&#x02032;), which are located within the flanking pUC19 sequence (40 bp upstream and 56 bp downstream from the repeat tract, respectively). Instability was defined as the number of mutation events (repeat tracts of altered length) per successful colony (DSB repair event) screened. Repeat lengths were calculated by estimating sizes of PCR products on 2.5% agarose gels relative to a DNA size standard. Since all mutation events resulted in deletion of the repeat tract, the term instability is synonymous with deletion in these experiments.</p><p>To determine whether the restriction site used to create the DSB was maintained following repair, PCR products representing deletions were digested with the restriction enzyme used to linearize the plasmid prior to transformation (HindIII and EcoRI for GAA-79, XbaI for GAA-70X, and BamHI for GAA-70-spacer).

These sequences were cloned into pUC19 in both orientations relative to the origin of replication (GAA-79, TTC-79, GAA-70X and TTC-70X; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The GAA-79 and TTC-79 plasmids were linearized by restriction digestion with either HindIII or EcoRI to create a DSB just outside of the repeat tract (12 bp 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; from the repeat). The GAA-70X and TTC-70X plasmids were linearized by restriction digestion with XbaI to create a DSB exactly in the center of the repeat tract. Each of the linearized plasmids, as well as their respective circular parental plasmids, was transformed individually into <italic>E. coli</italic> MM28 (RecA<sup>+</sup>). Colony PCR was used to visualize and quantify triplet-repeat instability. The effect of DSB repair was determined by comparing the frequency of instability observed with the transformation of linearized templates, where each colony represents an individual DSB repair event, with the background instability observed with the corresponding circular plasmids that did not undergo DSB repair (see Materials and Methods section). No significant difference in the level of instability was noted between plasmids that underwent DSB repair at either the HindIII or EcoRI sites just outside of the repeat tract and the corresponding circular parental plasmid (GAA-79 and TTC-79), in either the GAA or TTC orientation, indicating that DSB repair outside of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence did not result in increased repeat instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and C). However, repair of a DSB in the center of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence resulted in dramatically increased instability compared to its corresponding parental plasmid (GAA-70X and TTC-70X), in both the GAA and TTC orientations (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and C).

Whereas all 63 products of the HindIII-digested GAA-79 construct, and all but one of the 61 EcoRI digested GAA-79 construct maintained their respective HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites, none of the 76 deletions from the XbaI digested GAA-70X construct had maintained the XbaI site. This indicates that the increased instability observed when DSB repair was made to occur within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence was due to the repair process itself, i.e., resulting from loss of DNA sequence at the break site.

Essentially, most of the DSB repair events within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>30</sub> sequence resulted in deletion of the repeat tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and D).

Two different plasmids were constructed, which contained a (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>50</sub> sequence with an XbaI restriction site located off-center within the repeat tract, such that 15 and 35 repeats were located on either side of the XbaI site. As before, these off-center constructs were made in both orientations, resulting in the four following constructs: GAA-35XGAA-15, GAA-15XGAA-35, TTC-35XTTC-15 and TTC-15XTTC-35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Transformation of each of these four constructs, after linearization with XbaI, was performed in <italic>E. coli</italic> MM28. Similar to DSB repair at the center of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence, nearly all repair events at the off-center location also resulted in deletions of the repeat tract (data not shown). Therefore, the position of the DSB within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence did not affect the overall frequency of instability. However, examination of the size distribution of the deletion products showed that unlike DSB repair at the center of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence, DSB repair at the off-center location resulted in deletion of less than half of the repeat tract. A preferential deletion of &#x0223c;15 repeats, i.e. equivalent to the length of the shorter of the two repeat tracts flanking the DSB, was noted for all four constructs, resulting in a residual repeat length of 61&#x02013;80% of the full-length repeat tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This occurred irrespective of the orientation of the repeat tract, or if the location of the shorter repeat tract was either upstream or downstream of the break site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, it appears that repairing a DSB anywhere within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> results in deletion of the repeat tract; however, the location of the break within the repeat tract significantly modulates the size of the deletion resulting from DSB repair. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Repair of a DSB located off-center within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence preferentially results in deletions that are approximately equivalent to the length of the side with the shorter repeat tract.

These data indicate that the pathways for restart of stalled replication forks can result in stabilization of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence in the GAA orientation. However, another possible consequence of replication stalling is the generation of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42">40&#x02013;42</xref>). Therefore, it was of interest to us to determine what effect repairing DSBs near or within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence might have on repeat instability. Here we show that while DSB repair outside of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence had no effect on the level of instability, repairing a DSB within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence resulted in a dramatic increase in frequency of deletions. Indeed, almost every repair event resulted in a partial deletion of the repeat tract. Additionally, abolition of the restriction sequence at the site of the repair indicated that the repair process itself was responsible for the loss of triplet-repeat sequence.</p><p>Our observations are in sharp contrast with those made by others using the (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n</sub> sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). We noted that virtually all DSB repair events within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence resulted in deletions. Moreover, our results did not depend on the length or orientation of the repeat tract, nor on the RecA status of the strain used. In contrast, others found that DSB repair within the (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n</sub> sequence resulted in deletions that were dependent on the length and orientation of the repeat tract, and moreover that <italic>recA</italic> mutants showed enhanced deletion frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Furthermore, when DSB repair occurred outside of the (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n</sub> sequence, both in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) and in primate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), frequent deletions of the triplet repeat along with flanking non-repeat sequence was noted. However, our data show that DSB repair outside of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence resulted in no additional instability of the repeat tract or the flanking sequence. These data indicate that the mechanism of DSB repair-mediated triplet-repeat instability is highly dependent on the sequence and/or physical properties of the repeat tract.</p><p>In contrast to when DSB repair occurred within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence, the restriction enzyme site used to create the DSB was always maintained when DSB repair occurred outside of the repeat sequence. These observations indicate that the presence of (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> repeat sequence flanking each side of the DSB influences the repair process in such a way as to result in loss of sequence at the termini, whereas the break outside of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> is repaired by ligation of the restriction site, with no additional loss of sequence. When repair occurred at the center of the repeat tract, it preferentially deleted approximately half of the initial repeat length, and small contractions (deletion of &#x0003c;50% of initial length) were more prevalent than large contractions (deletion of &#x0003e;50% of initial length). However, when a DSB was repaired off-center within the repeat tract, there was a shift in the length distribution of deletions, such that a length approximately equivalent to the shorter of the two repeat tracts (or less) was preferentially deleted. These data are consistent with a single-strand annealing mechanism for generating deletions via DSB repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). If a DSB occurs at the center of a (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence and a single-strand exonuclease (ssExo) degrades either 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; on both sides of the break, it would result in complementary single-stranded (GAA)<sub>n</sub> and (TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequences on opposite sides of the break. The single-stranded repeat sequences could then anneal to repair the break, with DNA polymerase filling in any resulting gaps in the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Due to the repetitive nature of the (GAA)<sub>n</sub> and (TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequences, these single-stranded regions could anneal at numerous locations within the repeat tract. If the two sequences were to completely overlap, it would result in deletion of half of the initial repeat tract length, which was the predominant outcome in our experiments. If the two strands were to only partially overlap, it would result in the deletion of less than half of the repeat tract, which according to our data, is significantly preferred over the deletion of more than half of the repeat tract. The same mechanism also explains the observed outcome seen when DSB repair occurred off-center within the repeat tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). The number of repeats deleted during the repair process would be limited by the length of the shorter of the two repeat tracts, since the single-stranded (GAA)<sub>n</sub> and (TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequences on opposite sides of the break could only overlap by as many repeats as there are in the shorter repeat tract, or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). Consistent with this model, we noted that the deletion was most likely to be equivalent to the length of the shorter of the two flanking repeat tracts. Indeed, the fact that the 28 bp spacer at the center of the repeat tract also resulted in deletion of half of the repeat tract, along with loss of the entire spacer following DSB repair, further supports this model. However, if the break were to occur outside of the repeat tract, there would be a single-stranded (GAA)<sub>n</sub> or (TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence on one side of the break, and a single-stranded random (non-complementary) sequence on the other side. Therefore, the only way for the two single-stranded sequences to anneal would be at the site of the break, which offers a complementary restriction enzyme recognition sequence, thereby resulting in no deletion of repeat sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). Again, this is consistent with our observation that repairing a break outside of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> did not result in repeat instability, and most repair products maintained the restriction site used to create the break. Indeed, the same outcomes would also be predicted if, instead of digestion with an ssExo, a flap endonuclease were to cleave partially annealed single strands on either side of the DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D). The same length distributions would be expected as described for the single-strand exonuclease mediated mechanism shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8</xref>A&#x02013;C. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Model of DSB repair within or outside of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence. (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Single-strand annealing model of DSB repair is shown at the center (A) or off-center (B) within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence. If a DSB occurs within the repeat tract, a deletion could result if a single-strand exonuclease were to degrade DNA on either side of the break (only 3&#x02032; &#x02192; 5&#x02032; exonuclease is depicted here). The single-stranded (GAA)<sub>n</sub> and (TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequences (white and dark gray boxes) would anneal, followed by DNA polymerase re-synthesizing the gap, and sealing of the nick by DNA ligase. Note [as seen in (A)] that DSB repair at the center of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence would result in deletion of half of the repeat tract (if the entire repeat tract on each side were digested) or less than half (if less than the entire repeat tract on each were digested), consistent with our data. Furthermore, the DSB repair at the off-center location within the repeat tract [as seen in (B)] would preferentially delete the length of the shorter of the two flanking repeats (if the entire repeat tract on each side were digested), again consistent with our observations. (<bold>C</bold>) When DSB repair occurs outside of the repeat tract, and if the same process of single-strand exonuclease degradation were to occur, the only complementary sequence at which the resulting single-stranded DNA could anneal would be at the restriction enzyme sequence used to create the initial DSB. No loss of repeat sequence, and retention of the restriction site would be predicted, which is consistent with our data. (<bold>D</bold>) Alternatively, rather than the DNA being degraded by a single-strand exonuclease, DNA endonuclease processing of partially annealed strands on either side of the DSB could occur. The resulting single-stranded (GAA)<sub>n</sub> and (TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequences could anneal on opposite sides of the DSB, and an endonuclease could remove the flaps. DNA polymerase and DNA ligase would fill in and seal the nick, resulting in a shorter (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence. The same outcomes would be predicted with the endonuclease-mediated processing if the DSB were located at the center, or off-center, within the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm1066f8"/></fig></p><p>It should be noted that both replication stalling and repeat instability are length- and orientation-dependent when plasmids containing the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence are propagated in <italic>E. coli</italic>. However, paradoxically our data show that DSB repair-mediated instability leads to the same frequency of deletions in both the GAA and TTC orientations, and this is independent of the length of the repeat tract. One way to reconcile these apparently conflicting observations is that, while a DSB in a repeat tract of any length and in any orientation is likely to result in a deletion, in nature DSBs may only be occurring in <italic>E. coli</italic> when the repeat length is in the GAA orientation and of sufficient length. It is plausible that the DSBs are a result of the replication stalling that preferentially occurs in the GAA orientation when plasmids containing repeat tracts of sufficient length are grown in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and this is why deletions are observed preferentially in the GAA orientation. It is also possible that some inherent property of the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence itself may make it more prone to breakage, whether it be a consequence of the repetitive nature of the DNA sequence <italic>per se</italic>, or due to a specific secondary structure adopted by the (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>).</p><p>It is also interesting to note that in tissues of FRDA patients there is a significant trend for large deletions of the expanded (GAA&#x02022;TTC)<sub>n</sub> sequence in the <italic>FXN</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). While all tissues show a significant frequency of contractions, peripheral blood cells are particularly prone to large deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), which in some rare cases even results in complete reversion of the mutation to the non-pathogenic size. Indeed, the instability seen in blood is age dependent, with increasing mutation load as the patients get older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). It is plausible that the proliferative nature of their precursor cells may afford multiple opportunities for DSB formation via replication fork stalling, thereby explaining the particularly large deletions in peripheral blood cells. The only other cells that show particularly large deletions, including occasional reversion to the normal size range are sperms from male FRDA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Again, human spermatozoa are generated following multiple pre-meiotic cellular divisions, thus allowing a similar opportunity to develop fork stalling, DSBs, and contractions. It is also likely, at least in FRDA patients, that the free radical-induced oxidative damage caused via mitochondrial frataxin deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) may further increase the possibility of DSBs. Both replication stalling in continuously proliferating cells and oxidative damage can potentially account for the age-dependent increase in contractions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data in <italic>E. coli</italic> therefore make a convincing case for the exploration of the potential role of DSB repair as a mechanism for somatic instability in mammalian cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This research was made possible by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH/NINDS), Muscular Dystrophy Association, and Friedreich Ataxia Research Alliance to S.I.B.
