These behaviors are contingent on sophisticated sensory systems that maximize fitness in the complex and highly dynamic environments where physical, chemical, and biological parameters change on many different time scales. Modern genetic and molecular studies have largely focused on a limited repertoire of behaviors of a few model organisms in the non-native context of the laboratory. However, even at the level of basic phenomenology, the vast majority of phenotypes in the microbial biosphere remain uncharacterized. A major challenge of the post-genome era is the development of efficient and comprehensive methods for revealing the genetic basis of these behaviors across diverse clades, especially as the emerging field of metagenomics begins to reveal the wide assortment of microbial life on the planet &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Chemotaxis, the capacity to move up and down chemical gradients, is widespread in the bacterial world. An impressive achievement of 20th-century biology was a systems-level understanding of bacterial chemotaxis in terms of the structures, interactions, and organization of the roughly 50 constituent molecular components &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The best-characterized chemotaxis machineries are those of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> and its close relative <named-content content-type="genus-species">Salmonella enterica</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. These species propel themselves by rotating multiple extracellular helical filaments called flagella. When the filament rotates in the counterclockwise (CCW) direction, as viewed from outside the cell, a helical wave travels down the filament away from the cell body. In this CCW mode, multiple rotating flagella come together to form a bundle, propelling the cell forward in a motion called &#x0201c;smooth swimming.&#x0201d; When one or more motors reverse to the clockwise (CW) direction, the bundle comes apart and the cell &#x0201c;tumbles&#x0201d; briefly, reorienting the cell in a new direction; subsequent motor switching to the CCW direction causes the cell to swim forward again. The direction of rotation is influenced by the output of the chemotaxis network, which consists of a signal transduction cascade that allows robust adaptation to local concentrations of ligands over many orders of magnitude &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. When cells detect an increase in the concentration of an attractant, tumbling is suppressed so as to allow cells to migrate towards the source through the statistical strategy of a biased random walk &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. The signaling circuit that mediates this behavior terminates at the flagellar machinery, which is synthesized through a sequential hierarchy of gene activation events &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; initiated by the expression of the master transcriptional regulator FlhDC. These events yield an orderly &#x0201c;just-in-time&#x0201d; expression and assembly of the flagellar components &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, which consist of a basal body complex and a filament. The basal body complex contains a central rod that connects the motor to the filament through a short hook.</p><p>The identification of the molecular components and their organization into the two dominant modules&#x02014;the chemotaxis network and the flagellum/basal body/motor system&#x02014;took the better part of 40 years and the work of dozens of laboratories. These efforts have culminated in a level of understanding nearly unmatched in any other domain of molecular biology. For these reasons, flagellar-mediated motility is an ideal test case for any modern post-genomic approach that attempts to efficiently and comprehensively reveal the genetic basis of a complex bacterial phenotype. In this study, we make improvements on a microarray-based genetic footprinting strategy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, increasing its sensitivity and specificity in revealing the contribution of each and every gene in the genome to a phenotype of interest. We demonstrate the manner in which this strategy can be used to explore the genetic basis of complex bacterial behavior by following the population dynamics of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> insertional mutants in environments where reproductive fitness is coupled to motility. To fully identify the genetic determinants for this phenotype, a library of transposon-mutagenized cells was functionally enriched en masse for impaired swimming and surface-mediated swarming motility. We also selected for resistance to bacteriophage &#x003c7;, which is known to infect and lyse cells only when they are motile. Additionally, we identified the genetic basis of motility suppression by environmental factors. Using DNA microarray hybridization, we monitored the relative abundance of each mutant throughout the selections. The comprehensive nature of our methodology is reflected by the identification of nearly all of the known structural and regulatory components of flagellar-mediated chemotaxis. Strikingly, we also identify dozens of additional loci that contribute to this phenotype. Further characterization of these novel genes revealed that they impair motility through diverse mechanisms such as disrupting signaling through phosphorelay cascades, altering concentrations of the recently appreciated cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) second messenger, and by mechanisms that have yet to be revealed. Subsequent genome-wide epistasis analyses allow us to organize the discovered loci into signaling and regulatory pathways. This systematic framework for genetic characterization can be applied to any microorganism that is amenable to transposon mutagenesis, making it accessible to the vast majority of bacterial systems of importance to basic, industrial, environmental, and clinical research.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mapping Phenotype to Genotype Using Microarray-Based Genetic Footprinting</title><p>Traditional methods of genetic investigation have been extremely successful in providing a deep molecular understanding of many phenotypes in model microorganisms.

Given the reduced target specificity and a genome of approximately 4,300 genes, the mutagenesis of our library is saturating with an average of &#x0223c;100 independent insertions within each open reading frame (ORF).</p><p>In each of our experiments, a population of mutants is challenged for competitive growth under a selection of interest. Each mutant within the population is uniquely defined by the local sequence flanking the transposon insertion site. The series of molecular manipulations detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sg001">Figure S1</xref> allow the amplification of roughly 200 base pairs flanking each transposon insertion site in a population in parallel. Fluorescent labeling and hybridization of the amplicons to a spotted DNA microarray (created as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sd014">Protocol S1</xref>) reveal the relative abundance of each mutant as reflected by the signal intensity of the corresponding ORF on the array. As a consequence of selection, individual insertional mutants can increase or decrease in abundance during the course of an experiment, and these relative changes can be monitored by comparing genome-wide hybridization values before and after selection. In a proof-of-principle analysis of the unselected transposon library, we show that the hybridization intensities corresponding to known essential genes are strongly biased towards the lowest values, consistent with their inability to harbor transposon insertions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Quantitative Analysis of Selection within the Pool of Mutants</title><p>To determine the degree to which each gene contributes to fitness under a particular selection, we quantify the extent of enrichment or depletion of all transposon insertions within a gene after a selection is imposed. We assign the total hybridization signal for each ORF on the array as the sum of contributions from all the mutants that harbor an insertion somewhere within or in close proximity to the ORF. The ORF intensities from five hybridizations of the maximally diverse unselected library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>) are used as a statistical reference to quantify the degree of enrichment or depletion after the library is exposed to a selection of interest. In this way, the five unselected hybridizations define the null variation with respect to which significant differences are quantified. The normalized hybridization intensity value (<italic>x</italic>) of an ORF from a selection experiment is compared to the null distribution for that ORF (mean: &#x0003c;<italic>x</italic><sub>n</sub>&#x0003e;, standard deviation: &#x003c3;), by calculating a <italic>z</italic>-score: <italic>z</italic> &#x0003d; (<italic>x</italic> &#x02212; &#x0003c;<italic>x</italic><sub>n</sub>&#x0003e;)/&#x003c3;. ORFs that harbor deleterious mutations during the selection will have negative <italic>z</italic>-scores (corresponding to depletion), whereas ORFs that harbor relatively favorable mutations during the selection will have positive <italic>z</italic>-scores (corresponding to enrichment). In other words, the <italic>z</italic>-score reflects the number of standard deviations above or below the mean of the unselected replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Genetic Basis of Swimming Motility and Chemotaxis</title><p>Semi-solid tryptone agar provides a robust setting for studying <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> chemotaxis.

To systematically and completely identify the genetic determinants for swimming motility, &#x0223c;10<sup>7</sup> cells of the mutant library were functionally enriched en masse for an impaired ability to swim through soft agar. After an 8-h incubation to allow motile cells to swim away from the site of inoculation, the population enriched for nonmotile mutants was transferred to a fresh plate for further enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030154-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The percentage of nonmotile mutants was determined after each stage of enrichment by a clonal plating assay and, after five stages, 96&#x00025; of the mutants showed an impaired ability to swim (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). The amplification of transposon insertion sites from a small sample of these mutants showed that the nonmotile phenotype is the result of a single gene disruption in each mutant. As expected, the vast majority of these disruptions occurred in previously known flagellar or chemotaxis genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-st003">Table S3</xref>). However, even in this small sample, we found transposon insertions in genes without a previously known role in motility.</p><fig id="pgen-0030154-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Systematic Identification of Genes Involved in Swimming Motility</title><p>(A) Serial enrichment for nonmotile mutants was initiated by inoculating &#x0223c;10<sup>8</sup> mutants along the center of a soft-agar plate and allowing motile cells to chemotax away.

The <italic>z</italic>-scores reveal that the vast majority of ORFs lie within a tight Gaussian-shaped distribution centered around zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030154-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). However, of the 115 ORFs with <italic>z</italic>-scores greater than 12, 49 are known flagellar and chemotaxis genes. Since the microarray contained 52 out of the total of 54 known motility genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, the chance likelihood of observing this level of enrichment was extremely low (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;76</sup>). The three remaining motility genes that were not significantly enriched are two chemoreceptor genes, <italic>trg</italic> and <italic>aer</italic>, and the filament cap chaperone, <italic>fliT</italic>. Based on the hybridization results, insertional mutations in these genes should not measurably impair motility. We confirmed this expectation by showing that deletions of <italic>fliT</italic> and <italic>aer</italic> did not affect motility (data not shown). The neutral behavior of the <italic>fliT</italic> mutation is not surprising since <italic>fliT</italic> null strains were found to make functional flagella in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. enterica</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, it has been reported that <italic>fliT</italic> mutations enhance expression of class 2 flagellar operons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; because FliT acts as a negative regulator of these operons by binding to and inhibiting the activity of FlhDC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

Because of this redundancy, only <italic>aer tsr</italic> double mutants are expected to show a motility phenotype in tryptone plates. Finally, the product of <italic>trg</italic> is a transmembrane methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein that senses ribose and galactose &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Although these sugars are absent from tryptone plates, deletion of <italic>trg</italic> did result in a measurable motility defect (unpublished data). Therefore, of the more than 50 known genes involved, <italic>trg</italic> is the only false negative under the motility conditions we used.</p><p>Remarkably, the selection results revealed many genes with high <italic>z</italic>-scores without a previously known role in motility. We were concerned that some marginally high <italic>z</italic>-scores may be due to &#x0201c;hitchhiking&#x0201d; of spontaneously arising mutations in motility genes on the background of transposon insertions in nonessential genes. To minimize such false positives, we demanded that a candidate motility gene obtain a <italic>z</italic>-score above 12 in at least two of the three replicate selections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sd002">Datasets S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sd003">S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sd004">S4</xref>). The 40 candidate genes that fit these criteria were targeted for deletion, and 20 of them were found to show a significant defect in swimming motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030154-g001">Figure 1</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-st001">Table S1</xref>). We observed that some false positives were indeed due to hitchhiking, but others were due to polar effects of transposon insertions on downstream genes within operons. Additionally, some genes may be deemed false positive because the nature of the mutation caused by transposon insertion cannot be replicated by a clean deletion of the gene. The criteria we used for identifying candidate motility genes favored sensitivity (essentially 100&#x00025;) over specificity. However, the number of false positives can be driven lower by decreasing the cycles of selection, increasing the number of replicates, or by focusing on genes with relatively high <italic>z</italic>-scores. In the sections that follow, we explore the manner in which the validated newly identified genes affect motility.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Identifying Flagellar Components through Bacteriophage &#x003c7; Selection</title><p>As a complementary approach to determining the components necessary for a functioning flagellum, we designed a simple selection to identify mutants resistant to &#x003c7;-phage infection.

Therefore, in the absence of CheZ, CheY is maintained in the phosphorylated state, &#x0201c;locking&#x0201d; flagellar rotation in the CW direction, and hence minimizing infection by &#x003c7;-phage. In addition to these findings, the selection results revealed that cellular structures other than the flagella may be required for infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-st001">Table S1</xref>).

Most of these non-flagellar genes encode components of the cell envelope.

These gene products include transport proteins (SdaC, TatA, TatB, TatC, and WzxE), enzymes (DsbA and Prc), periplasmic glucan synthesis proteins (MdoG and MdoH), members of a signaling pathway (RcsC and RcsD), and a predicted inner membrane protein of unknown function (YrfF).

Interrogation of genes with high <italic>z</italic>-scores in the enrichment for mutants incapable of swarming identified two additional genes that impact surface motility: <italic>hns,</italic> encoding a global transcriptional regulator, and <italic>yfiR,</italic> encoding a predicted periplasmic protein of unknown function. In-frame deletions of these genes abolished swarming; however, while the &#x00394;<italic>hns</italic> mutant showed a severe swimming defect, the swimming motility of the &#x00394;<italic>yfiR</italic> mutant was only mildly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030154-g003">Figures 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030154-g004">4</xref>).

These findings suggested that mutations in LPS and OPG biosynthetic genes may compromise motility. We confirmed this expectation by creating in-frame deletions of nearly all genes involved in LPS and OPG biosynthesis and assaying the mutants for motility. OPG mutants were defective in both swimming and swarming; surprisingly, however, only mutants with large LPS truncations showed significant defects in these behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030154-g003">Figures 3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030154-g004">4</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-0030154-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Motility and <italic>flhDC</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> Expression of Mutants</title><p>Motility was assayed by inoculating soft-agar with individual mutants and measuring the diameter of growth rings after incubation; error bars represent standard deviations of triplicate measurements. &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;; error bars represent standard deviations of three measurements.

Previous evidence links LPS and OPG mutations to the activation of the Rcs phosphorelay system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, and the Rcs system is known to negatively regulate the <italic>flhDC</italic> operon &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. The Rcs pathway consists of a phosphotransfer protein (RcsD) that mediates phosphate transfer from a sensor kinase (RcsC) to a response regulator (RcsB) that binds DNA with an accessory protein (RcsA). Phosphorylated RcsB is known to bind upstream of the <italic>flhDC</italic> operon and to repress its expression. The pathway also includes a recently identified outer membrane lipoprotein (RcsF) that is known to activate the Rcs system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. To determine the role of the Rcs signaling pathway in LPS/OPG mediated repression of motility, we disrupted each of the components of the Rcs system in most of our LPS and OPG mutants. We found that deletion of <italic>rcsB, rcsD,</italic> or <italic>rcsF</italic> was sufficient to rescue motility in both LPS and OPG mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sg006">Figure S6</xref>), providing strong evidence that perturbations in these structures repress motility by signaling through the Rcs pathway. Deletion of <italic>rcsC</italic> rescued motility to a lesser extent. This observation is consistent with the dual functional role of RcsC as both kinase and phosphatase, moving phosphates both to and away from RcsB via RcsD, and that RcsB remains phosphorylated in <italic>rcsC</italic> null mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

To evaluate the necessity of LPS and OPG for phage infection, we needed mutants that were defective in these structures but still synthesized functional flagella and were motile. Therefore, we created double mutants combining an LPS or OPG mutation and a secondary mutation in one of the components of the Rcs signaling pathway. These mutants were used in an infectivity assay in which plaque-forming units (PFUs) are monitored over time to assess sensitivity to phage infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

Systematic analyses of such interactions in yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d; are providing a wealth of knowledge about gene function and pathway organization. An important class of such interactions is suppressor mutations that either partially or fully restore the phenotype deficits of a query mutation. In a genome-wide effort to identify suppressors of swimming defects, additional libraries of transposon insertional mutants were created in genetic backgrounds containing gene deletions of interest.</p><p>Secondary insertional mutations were observed to suppress motility defects in &#x00394;<italic>hns</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>yhjH</italic> genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030154-g006">Figures 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sg008">S8</xref>A).

A sample of suppressor mutants extracted from the extreme edge of the motile front was used for both microarray-based genetic footprinting, and for isolation of individual mutants for subsequent characterization.

Some of these environmental influences may be due to direct physicochemical perturbations to chemotaxis or flagellar function. Alternatively, these signals may provide crucial information about the cell's local environment, influencing chemotactic behavior through upstream regulatory pathways. Consistent with this picture, the promoter of the <italic>flhDC</italic> operon, the master regulator of flagellar gene expression, is one of the most highly regulated loci in the genome and contains many transcription-factor binding sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030154-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;.

As can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030154-sg012">Figure S12</xref>A, this is in fact what we observe since, during the same time interval, some members from the transposon mutant library travel significantly further away from the site of inoculation than do the homogeneous population of wild-type cells. In order to identify the mutations associated with the observed alleviation in suppression of motility under high &#x0005b;NaCl&#x0005d;, we extracted the population of mutants that traveled to the extreme edge of the chemotaxis front.
