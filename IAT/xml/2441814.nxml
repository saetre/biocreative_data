We have analyzed the effect of the Sin mutation at R45 of histone H4 on cell survival following UV irradiation, nucleotide excision repair (NER) and chromatin structure. We find that this mutation renders yeast cells more resistant to UV damage and enhances NER at specific chromatin loci. In the transcriptionally silent <italic>HML</italic>, repressed <italic>GAL10</italic> and the constitutively active <italic>RPB2</italic> loci, H4 R45 mutants exhibit enhanced repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) compared to wild-type (wt). However, the H4 R45 mutation does not increase the transcription of NER genes, disrupt transcriptional silencing of the <italic>HML</italic> locus or alter repression in the <italic>GAL10</italic> locus. We have further shown that the H4 R45C mutation increases the accessibility of nucleosome DNA in chromatin to exogenous nucleases and may expedite nucleosome rearrangements during NER. Taken together, our results indicate that the increased repair observed in Sin mutants is a direct effect of the altered chromatin landscape caused by the mutation, suggesting that such subtle changes in the conserved histone residues can influence the accessibility of DNA repair factors in chromatin.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cellular DNA is continually exposed to threats from various endogenous and exogenous sources of damage that can compromise the functional integrity of the genome. Assaults caused by different types of genotoxic agents exert evolutionary pressure on all organisms, which have developed sophisticated responses to cope and survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). An important form of damage response exhibited by cells is their ability to repair DNA lesions caused by environmental sources such as UV radiation, ionizing radiation and chemical agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Failure to repair such DNA lesions is known to cause mutations that can lead to genomic instability, cell death or life-threatening diseases like cancer in higher eukaryotes.</p><p>Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an important mechanism for removal of a wide variety of bulky DNA lesions, such as <italic>cis-syn</italic> cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6&#x02013;4) photoproducts caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. NER consists of two pathways: global genome repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled repair (TCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). TCR is specifically responsible for repair of the transcribed strand of actively transcribed genes and appears to be triggered by stalled elongating RNA polymerase. GGR is involved in removal of lesions from unexpressed regions of the genome and the nontranscribed strand of actively transcribed genes. In eukaryotic cells, accessibility of lesions in highly condensed 100&#x02013;400 nm chromatin fibers adds further complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and the compact DNA packaging into chromatin is refractory to DNA repair enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This structural hierarchy hinders the access of nuclear factors that detect and subsequently repair lesions in nuclear DNA. However, the chromatin environment is dynamic and early studies showed that chromatin rearrangements occur during NER in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Nucleosomes, the basic structural component of chromatin represents the first level of DNA compaction in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). This fundamental unit consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped in 1.65 superhelical turns around an octamer of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. The histone folds of H3 and H4, as well as H2A and H2B, interlock to form a stable H3&#x02013;H4 tetramer and two H2A&#x02013;2B dimers, giving rise to the canonical core octamer assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Interaction is primarily between amino acids in the &#x003b1;-helices or intervening loop regions of the core histones and the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA. Of the 14 sites where the DNA minor groove contacts the histone octamer, 12 are penetrated by side-chains of an arginine residue located in either a histone fold domain or an N-terminal tail region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Furthermore, at 8 of these 12 sites, a threonine side chain from a neighboring histone forms either direct (H3 T118 with H4 R45) or water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the penetrating arginine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Mutations that alter one of a cluster of amino acid residues lying in the specific DNA-histone contact sites of histones H3 and H4 are known to generate a class of mutants called SWI/SNF-independent (Sin) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These mutants were identified by their ability to carry on transcription in the absence of yeast chromatin remodeling complex SWI&#x02013;SNF. The Sin mutations are found to be clustered in the L1L2 loop regions of the H3&#x02013;H4 tetramer that participates in binding the central two turns of nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and broadly fall into two groups: (i) mutations that target H4 R45, H3 T118 and H3 R116 are located very near the dyad center contact points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and (ii) mutations that target H4 V43 or H3 E105, are located more distant from the dyad center. Previous studies demonstrated that Sin mutations do not alter the histone octamer stoichiometry, but in general render nucleosome DNA more accessible to enzymes such as micrococcal nuclease and Dam methylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). Sin mutant nucleosomes mobilize at lower temperatures and dissociate at lower salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), with an increased ability to reposition on the DNA. Interestingly, nucleosome arrays reconstituted with octamers containing the H4 R45C mutant histone exhibit a defect in magnesium-dependent intramolecular folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>The Arg 45 residue of histone H4 that has been mutated in our study is one of the 10 Arg residues whose side chain protrudes into the minor groove of the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Mutation of H4 R45 to cysteine or histidine results in an &#x02018;empty&#x02019; minor groove, leading to a disruption of the histone&#x02013;DNA interactions. However, this mutation has only a moderate effect on global nucleosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). It is suggested that the H4 R45 mutation leads to an altered nucleosome state that mimics SWI/SNF-dependent nucleosome disruption, a typical consequence of Sin mutations. In the present study, we examined the effect of H4 R45C and R45H Sin mutations on NER of UV damage. Our results show that cells containing these versions of histone H4 have more efficient NER than wild-type (wt) cells, and are more resistant to UV-induced cell death. In agreement with past reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), we find increased accessibility of nucleosomal DNA in the chromatin of these cells. These results indicate that the subtle change in chromatin induced by a single-site mutation in a core histone of yeast cells allows enhanced UV survival and increased DNA repair in specific chromatin regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of H4 R45 Sin histone mutants</title><p>Plasmid shuffle method was used to introduce mutated versions of histone H4 gene.

As mentioned earlier, unlike the H4 R45H mutant strain, we were unable to generate an H4 R45C strain whose sole source of histone H4 was the mutant plasmid. Indeed, we examined over 20 different H4 R45C mutant clones, by sequencing the isolated plasmid, and in each case at least a small amount of <italic>wt</italic> plasmid was present (unpublished data). This result suggests that the H4 R45C mutant strain can not survive with H4 R45C as the sole source of histone H4, and is in agreement with past reports on this mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, Sin mutants are known to be partially dominant to <italic>wt</italic> histone genes and the mutant histones lead to a Sin phenotype even in the presence of <italic>wt</italic> histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Both the H4 R45 mutants used in our experiments exhibit a slower growth rate at 30&#x000b0;C, compared to <italic>wt</italic> cells, and exhibit a slightly more resistant (lower cell death) phenotype to UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, among several other Sin histone mutants (H3 R116H, H3 T118I, H4 V43I) that we tested, only H4 R45 mutants showed resistance to UV irradiation compared to <italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and data not shown). These observations led us to explore DNA repair of UV damage as a possible defence mechanism affected by such a subtle change in chromatin. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>UV sensitivity of wt, H4 R45C and H4 R45H.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C, CPD removal is about 50% more efficient in H4 R45 mutant cells than <italic>wt</italic> after 2 h of repair, and is essentially complete by 3 h after irradiation (compared to only &#x0223c;70% repair in <italic>wt</italic> cells). Similar results were obtained for CPD repair in a 2.2-kb EcoRI&#x02013;EcoRV fragment containing the <italic>GAL10</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A).

Scans of lanes with equivalent digestion conditions, however, revealed no distinguishable differences between the nucleosome repeats of H4 R45C and <italic>wt</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), indicating that similar nucleosome loading occurs in both <italic>wt</italic> and mutant chromatin. Moreover, Southern blot analyses with <italic>HML</italic>, <italic>RPB2</italic> or <italic>GAL10</italic> probes indicate that MNase has increased accessibility to each of these loci in H4 R45C chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and D, data not shown). The H4 R45C mutation, therefore, does not appear to alter nucleosome spacing, yet renders chromatin more accessible to MNase.

For example, studies with <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have revealed that both CPDs and 6-4PPs are removed more rapidly from nucleosome-free regions and linker DNA compared to nucleosome cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In this report, we have shown the effect of Sin mutations R45C and R45H in histone H4 of yeast on cell survival, excision repair following UV damage, chromatin structure and transcription.</p><sec><title>The H4 R45 mutation enhances repair in specific chromatin loci</title><p>Early experiments showed that nucleosome rearrangements occur during NER in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These findings led to the &#x02018;unfolding-refolding&#x02019; model of nucleosome rearrangement during NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), which has been given the designation &#x02018;access, repair, restore&#x02019; (ARR) by Green and Almouzni (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Recent findings show that the heterodimer Rad4-Rad23, interacts with the chromatin remodeling complex Swi/Snf during NER in intact yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), indicating that rearrangement in at least some regions of chromatin is required for efficient NER. It has been reported that Sin histone mutants require less thermal energy for &#x02018;nucleosome sliding&#x02019; along the DNA, which may reflect increased nucleosome mobility and disrupted higher order chromatin structure <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Here we report that, H4 R45 mutant strains are more resistant to UV damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), which is unusual for yeast mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). We examined removal of UV-induced CPDs in three different types of chromatin in yeast: transcriptionally silenced chromatin (<italic>HML</italic> locus) with positioned nucleosomes and bound Sir complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>); transcriptionally repressed (<italic>GAL10</italic> locus) with nucleosomes of varying stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and no bound silencing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>); and transcriptionally active chromatin (<italic>RPB2</italic> locus). We found that in each case NER is more rapid in H4 R45C and H4 R45H cells than in <italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that the H4 R45 mutation increases the repair activity in specific chromatin loci in yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>H4 R45 mutant chromatin provides a better &#x02018;landscape&#x02019; for NER</title><p>It has been hypothesized that mutation at R45 of histone H4 may weaken the central wrap of DNA around the histone octamer, leading to an altered nucleosome structure. Indeed, the H4 R45 mutations studied in this report, are known to (i) render the DNA more accessible to MNase and Dam methylase, (ii) eliminate Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent intramolecular folding of nucleosomal arrays and (iii) have a pronounced effect on thermally driven nucleosome sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Moreover, nucleosome arrays reconstituted with histone octamers containing H4 R45C or R45H mutations generate improved substrates for SWI/SNF remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Therefore, a compelling argument is that chromatin in H4 R45 cells is a better &#x02018;landscape&#x02019; for processing by repair proteins, and this accounts for the enhanced repair we observe in these cells.</p><p>In agreement with this hypothesis, our results show that DNA in bulk chromatin, as well as in <italic>HML, GAL10</italic> and <italic>RPB2</italic> loci, is more accessible to MNase in H4 R45C cells compared to <italic>wt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and data not shown). Furthermore, the MNase digestion patterns indicate that nucleosome spacing in these cells is similar to <italic>wt</italic>. As mentioned previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), this implies that H4 R45 mutant histones form nucleosomes similar to <italic>wt</italic> histones and the mutation does not alter nucleosome loading or spacing; and it is higher order folding of chromatin that is most likely affected in these cells.</p><p>To examine accessibility of nucleosome DNA in H4 R45C cells during NER, we monitored accessibility of the single EcoRV recognition site normally present within a positioned nucleosome in the <italic>HML</italic> locus. As shown previously for the repressed <italic>MFA2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), we observe that in both cell types the accessibility of the EcoRV cutting site increases after UV irradiation. Interestingly, in H4 R45C cells, the maximum fraction of these sites exposed is slightly higher and achieved at an earlier repair time (30 min) than in <italic>wt</italic> cells (1 h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These data further support the notion that the H4 R45 mutant chromatin is more accessible during NER than in <italic>wt</italic>, thereby improving the efficiency of DNA repair in chromatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissecting the effect of H4 R45 mutation on NER and transcription</title><p>It has been reported that the H4 R45 mutation leads to impaired nucleosome-mediated repression of the <italic>PHO5</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Therefore, we wondered if the enhanced repair rate observed in H4 R45 mutants is an indirect effect of enhanced transcription of the three loci tested. However, RT-PCR experiments showed that neither the transcriptional silencing of the <italic>HML</italic> locus nor the repression of the <italic>GAL10</italic> gene is disrupted in H4 R45 mutant cells. On the other hand, expression of the <italic>RPB2</italic> gene was found to be increased (1.3- to 1.7-fold) in the H4 R45 mutant cells compared to <italic>wt</italic>. Therefore, we examined strand-specific repair in this locus, and found that the enhanced repair is the result of more rapid repair of the transcribed strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This demonstrated that TCR is the primary repair pathway for removal of CPD lesions from this locus, and the increased transcription rate leads to more efficient CPD removal in the <italic>RPB2</italic> locus of H4 R45C cells. Interestingly, repair in the nontranscribed strand of <italic>RPB2</italic> in H4 R45C cells occurs at a slower rate than either TCR or GGR in <italic>wt</italic> cells. This correlates with the report by Aboussekhra and Al-Sharif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) that GGR increases in the nontranscribed strand of the <italic>GAL10</italic> gene in <italic>RAD26&#x00394;</italic> cells. Therefore, it is possible that the high rate of TCR in the <italic>RPB2</italic> gene reduces GGR in the same locus. This suppression of GGR may reflect either competition for NER factors, or physical hindrance caused by the transcription and/or repair machinery recruited to the transcribed strand.</p><p>The fact that TCR plays a primary role in CPD removal at the <italic>RPB2</italic> locus is supported by the result that repair drops significantly in H4 R45C cells depleted of <italic>RAD26</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). As <italic>RAD26</italic> deletion had little effect on NER of the <italic>HML</italic> locus in both <italic>wt</italic> and H4 R45C cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C), this result indicates that TCR has little (or no) role in CPD removal from a transcriptionally silent locus, like <italic>HML</italic>. Thus, the increased NER observed seems to be an effect of the H4 R45 mutation on <italic>HML</italic> chromatin structure. Indeed, nucleosomes in the <italic>HML</italic> locus of some Sin mutants are associated with less Sir proteins compared to <italic>wt</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Similarly, in the transcriptionally repressed <italic>GAL10</italic> locus of H4 R45 mutants, where TCR plays no significant role in repair, the increased NER must reflect a property of the mutant nucleosomes at this locus, which facilitates more rapid repair.</p><p>In support of the above notion, genome-wide expression analysis indicates that the enhanced repair observed in H4 R45 mutant cells is not due to increased expression of NER genes. Among the 475 genes that are transcriptionally upregulated in H4 R45H cells, only one NER gene, <italic>RAD2</italic>, was found to have a &#x0003e;2-fold increase in expression. Interestingly, the microarray data indicate that many of the genes upregulated in H4 R45H cells function in the oxidative or osmotic stress response pathway (unpublished data). Thus, all our results indicate that the increased NER efficiency we observe in the different chromatin loci is a direct effect of altered chromatin structure in the H4 R45 mutants.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that single-point mutations in histone H4 (R45C, R45H) of yeast results in increased UV survival, and enhanced NER in specific chromatin loci. The increased NER observed in these mutants primarily reflects an altered chromatin structure, which provides a better substrate for NER complexes than <italic>wt</italic> cells. Among the other Sin mutants we tested for UV sensitivity, H4 V43I is known to have a less pronounced effect on chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), which may explain the decreased UV resistance compared to H4 R45 mutants. Furthermore, it will be interesting to examine the chromatin structure of H3 T118I mutants, which exhibit a severe Sin phenotype similar to H4 R45 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), but show decreased UV resistance compared to H4 R45 mutants. In conclusion, our results present the first report of enhanced NER in chromatin resulting from a single amino acid change in a core histone and demonstrate how subtle changes in the highly conserved histone sequences can have a major impact on vital cellular functions like DNA repair.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Dr John Wyrick, Washington State University, for the WY121 yeast strain, for microarray analyses and for helpful discussions throughout the project.
