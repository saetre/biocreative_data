Despite the essential and diverse roles of the FOXO family members in human cells and their involvement in tumor pathogenesis, the regulation of <italic>FOXO </italic>expression remains poorly understood. We have addressed the mechanisms underlying the high level of expression of the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>gene in a cell line, PER-453, derived from a primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the central nervous system (CNS-PNET).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The status of the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>locus in the PER-453 CNS-PNET cell line was investigated by Southern blotting and DNA sequence analysis of the proximal promoter, 5'-UTR, open reading frame and 3'-UTR.

No mutations within the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>open reading frame or gross rearrangements of the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>locus were detected. However, a single nucleotide change within the proximal promoter and several nucleotide changes within the 3'-UTR were identified.

Members of the family are involved in the regulation of a range of critical processes in mammalian cells, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, and responses to oxidative stress and DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. While some of these effects are due to reduced FOXO activity in the nucleus in response to signalling through the PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], FOXO proteins integrate signals from multiple pathways and regulate gene expression as components of dynamic multi-protein complexes that vary with cell type and context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This functional complexity is reflected both by the broad array of genes regulated by FOXO transcription factors and the diversity of post translational modifications regulating FOXO protein-protein interactions, intracellular location and degradation (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]).</p><p>In light of the pleiotropic nature of FOXO proteins and, in particular, the pivotal role of FOXO proteins as components of both the PI3K/Akt and TGF&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] pathways, both of which are frequently deregulated in cancer, it is not surprising that aberrant FOXO activity has been implicated in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Indeed, evidence is accumulating to suggest that the <italic>FOXO </italic>genes represent a tumour suppressor gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In PTEN null prostate and glioblastoma cancer cell lines, reconstitution of nuclear FOXO1A or FOXO3A expression can suppress proliferation and induce senescence or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Data from the analyses of human primary tumor specimens have implicated the down regulation of FOXO1A expression in the pathogenesis of prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], as well as childhood alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although the molecular mechanisms of FOXO1A mediated tumor suppression are only partially understood it is likely that down regulation or FOXO1A expression potentiates tumorigenesis via deregulation of pathways that are context dependent. For example, reduced FOXO1A expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of glioblastoma through deregulation of TGF&#x003b2; cytostatic signalling in neuroepithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] while aberrant stoichiometry of FOXO1A-androgen receptor interactions may promote AKT-dependent and -independent survival of prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, irrespective of cellular context, a complete understanding of the tumor suppressive properties of FOXO1A depends not only on the dissection of FOXO1A function at the protein level, but also the mechanisms of regulation of expression of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA.</p><p>The available data suggest that <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression levels are generally low in primitive neuroectodermal tumours of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, our microarray expression analyses of CNS-PNET specimens revealed a surprisingly high level of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression in one CNS-PNET cell line relative to five other CNS-PNET cell lines and two normal fetal brain specimens. Although over expression of bona fide tumor suppressor genes such as <italic>p16 </italic>and <italic>p53 </italic>in cancer specimens has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs and the biological significance of this phenomenon are poorly understood. Since <italic>FOXO1A </italic>is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene, and little is known about the regulation of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA expression levels in mammalian cells, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the high expression of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>in the PER-453 CNS-PNET cell line.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and control specimens</title><p>CNS-PNET cell culture conditions, and the origins and characteristics of the pineoblastoma cell lines PER-452, PER-453, and PER-480 have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The medulloblastoma cell lines, PER-547 and PER-568 were established from biopsy specimens obtained from two boys, four and six years of age respectively, treated at Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Western Australia. The DAOY medulloblastoma cell line was obtained from Dr. Phillip Jacobsen, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Western Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. RNA was isolated from brain germinal matrix from a male fetus aborted at 16-weeks and fetal brain RNA (20 weeks gestation) was purchased (Clontech).

Total protein (20 &#x003bc;g) was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS PAGE gel and transferred to Hybond-C super membrane (Amersham). The membrane was blocked in 0.1% TBST/5% skim milk for 1 hr at RT and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with FOXO1A antibody (Cat. No. 9462, Cell Signaling Technology).

To control for fractionation, the membrane was re-blocked in TBST/10% skim milk, incubated with antibodies to ACTB (Pan-Actin Ab-5, Neomarkers) or Histone H1 (AE4, Santa Cruz) at RT for 2 hr, washed and incubated with anti-Mouse HRP (Amersham). The membrane was washed, treated with ECL reagent, and exposed to ECL film (see above).

To control for DNA loading, the blot was stripped and re-probed with a chromosome 14 specific genomic PCR product expected to be present at normal diploid levels in the PER-453 cell line.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were transfected simultaneously with 400 ng of test plasmid and &#x003b2;-galactosidase expressing transfection control plasmid pSV-&#x003b2; gal (Promega), using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 48 hours, luciferase and b-galactosidase activities were assayed using the &#x003b2;-galactosidase enzyme assay system with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Analysis of the microarray data revealed a very high level of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA in the PER-453 cell line relative to the other CNS-PNET cell lines and normal fetal brain specimens (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Verification of the microarray data using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that after normalization to <italic>ACTB </italic>mRNA levels, canonical <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA expression in the PER-453 cell line was 124-fold higher than the average level of the other five CNS-PNET cell lines, 24-fold higher than the level in whole fetal brain, and 3.5-fold higher than the level in fetal brain germinal matrix cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We also assessed <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA expression in the PER-452, PER-453, and PER-547 CNS-CNS-PNET cell lines by Northern blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). A prominent signal at ~5.9 kb, consistent with the size of the wild type <italic>FOXO1A </italic>transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and a lesser signal at ~5.4 kb were visible in the PER-453 lane, while very faint signals of ~5.9 kb and ~5.4 kb were visible on the original autoradiograph for PER-452. <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA was undetectable in the PER-547 cell line consistent with the qRT-PCR results. <italic>ACTB </italic>hybridisation signals indicated that an adequate amount of mRNA was loaded in each lane.</p><p>To assess FOXO1A protein levels in CNS-PNET cell lines PER-452, PER-453, and PER-480, whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). FOXO1A protein was weakly detectable in the PER-452 cell line and was prominent in the PER-453 cell line at approximately 78 kDa. These data are consistent with the qRT-PCR results and the expected molecular weight of the wild type FOXO1A protein. No signal was observed in the PER-480 cell line consistent with undetectable <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA levels in this cell line as measured by qRT-PCR.</p><p>FOXO1A is a transcription factor that is known to shuttle between the nucleus where it is functionally active, and the cytoplasm where it is considered to be functionally inactive, in response to changes in its phosphorylation status. To assess the subcellular localisation of FOXO1A in the PER-453 cell line we investigated nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by immunoblotting. Screening with control antibodies against the predominantly cytoplasmic protein ACTB, and the nuclear histone protein H1, indicated that the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation was successful. Quantitative densitometry revealed that FOXO1A protein levels were approximately 2.85 fold higher in the nuclear fraction than in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic analysis of the FOXO1A locus in the PER-453 cell line</title><p>To investigate the underlying mechanism for the high expression of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>in the PER-453 cell line we carried out a detailed analysis of the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>locus and cDNA sequence. Classical cytogenetic analysis of the PER-453 genome has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and recently high-resolution array-CGH analysis of the PER-453 cell line was completed. All metaphase spreads examined were near diploid and copy number variations or gross chromosomal rearrangements likely to affect the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>gene on chromosome 13 were not detected using either technique. A common mechanism associated with over-expression of specific genes in cancer (generally oncogenes), is gene amplification. Accordingly, we assessed whether over-expression of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>in the PER-453 cell line was associated with increased <italic>FOXO1A </italic>gene copy number that may not have been detected by cytogenetic analysis. Genomic DNAs from the PER-453 cell line and PBLs from two normal individuals were digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and probed with a <italic>FOXO1A </italic>cDNA probe. Hybridization to two <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction fragments of 3320 bp and 613 bp was observed as expected (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Although there was a higher DNA loading in the PER-453 lane relative to the PBL control lanes as judged by the relative signals of the loading control probe, densitometry followed by linear regression analyses revealed that there were no significant differences between the ratios of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>hybridisation signal to control signals (p = 0.29)(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>FOXO1A </italic>gene copy number is not increased in the PER-453 cell line.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analysis of the FOXO1A gene</title><p>We hypothesised that the high <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA expression in PER-453 cells may be the result of aberrant transcriptional regulation due to mutations or rearrangements in sequences upstream of the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>open reading frame or within the 3'-UTR.

Seven putative GC-boxes (GGGCGG) were detected which may represent binding sites for transcriptional regulators such as the specificity protein family members, SP1-SP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We also identified a consensus forkhead-binding element (FHBE) (GTAAACAAA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] in the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>proximal promoter at position -371 to -363 relative to the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>transcription start site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of five single nucleotide changes and two splice variants in the FOXO1A 3'-UTR</title><p>The <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA has a particularly long 3'-UTR of 3356 nt representing nearly 60% of the length of the transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). The extent of the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>3'-UTR suggests that this region may play an important role in the regulation of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>transcript stability or translation. We did not identify any gross rearrangements in the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>3'-UTR from PER-453 by DNA sequence analysis. However, we identified five single nucleotide differences including two previously identified SNPs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). In addition to the canonical cDNA sequence, we identified two <italic>FOXO1A </italic>splice variants designated <italic>FOXO1A-2 </italic>and <italic>FOXO1A-3</italic>, both of which are differentially spliced in a manner consistent with the GT/AG rule from the same splice donor site as the canonical transcript, 14 bp downstream from the stop codon within the 3'-UTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref> and Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

We did not obtain evidence for any other <italic>FOXO1A </italic>alternative splicing events from any of our RT-PCR analyses, which also included amplification of the entire <italic>FOXO1A </italic>cDNA as two overlapping RT-PCR products. These data indicated that the <italic>FOXO1A-2 </italic>and <italic>FOXO1A-</italic>3 cDNAs were derived from transcripts that were identical to the canonical transcript except for the alternative splicing within the 3'-UTR. The lower signal intensity and size of the ~5.4 kb molecular weight band relative to the canonical ~5.9 kb transcript visible on the Northern blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) was consistent both with the expected sizes of the smaller alternative transcripts and the levels of the RT-PCR products generated from the two splice variants relative to the canonical <italic>FOXO1A </italic>RT-PCR product when observed on ethidium bromide stained agarose gels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of FOXO1A wild-type and mutant promoter activity</title><p>Luciferase assays were employed to assess the affect on expression of the single A to G base change identified in one allele of the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>promoter in the PER-453 cell line. Linear regression analysis of the data from two independent experiments carried out in duplicate indicated that the single nucleotide change had no significant affect on promoter activity (p = 0.8).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the essential and diverse roles of the FOXO family members in human cells, the regulation of FOXO expression is poorly understood. FOXO proteins are important components of signalling nodes responsive to external cellular cues, and compromised FOXO function and consequent disruption of these nodes is strongly implicated in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Most studies of the role of FOXO proteins in carcinogenesis have concentrated on the regulation of FOXO activity at the post-translational level, especially with regard to nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling in response to changes in FOXO phosphorylation status. However, FOXO expression levels and the regulation of <italic>FOXO </italic>transcription have received scant attention in any context.</p><p>According to the microarray data the normalised <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression level (probeset 202724_s_at) in the PER-453 cell line was 5.4-fold higher than the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>level of normal fetal brain. Furthermore, it was 4-fold higher than the median expression level of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>in 73 different human tissues (including normal fetal brain) and cell lines that were assessed by others using HG-U133 GeneChips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>FOXO1A </italic>was generally expressed at low levels in the 83 cancer specimens assessed by Su <italic>et al</italic>. These data suggest that the expression level of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>in the PER-453 cell line is exceptionally high relative to the levels in most normal and cancerous tissues. We were unable to assess <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression levels in the primary pineoblastoma from which the PER-453 cell line was derived. However, the primary specimen and cell line displayed very similar immunophenotypes and ultrastructural characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] suggesting that the cell line has not diverged greatly from that of the primary tumor. Although there have been no published studies specifically addressing <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression levels in CNS-PNETs, the vast majority of primary CNS-PNET specimens assayed using the superseded HG-UL95A GeneChip were called "absent" for <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression in the largest published microarray study of 68 CNS-PNET specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], suggesting that <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression is generally low in primary CNS-PNETs.</p><p>Chromosomal translocations involving <italic>FOXO </italic>family members have been described in human leukemias and pediatric alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In each case, FOXO fusion proteins result from translocations generating chimeric transcripts encoding the N-terminal region of the fusion partner (<italic>MLL </italic>for the leukemias, and either <italic>PAX3 </italic>or <italic>PAX7 </italic>for the rhabdomyosarcomas), and the C-terminal portion of the <italic>FOXO </italic>component. Hence, the expression levels of the chimeric transcripts are presumably regulated through the 5' promoter sequences of the various <italic>FOXO </italic>fusion partners in combination with the <italic>FOXO </italic>3'-UTR. These findings raise the possibility that the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>over-expression observed in the PER-453 cell line could be the result of a fusion event. However, our data suggest that this is unlikely. Immunoblotting analysis of the PER-453 cell line using a FOXO1A antibody that recognizes an epitope C-terminal to the usual FOXO1A fusion point revealed a prominent band of approximately ~78 kDa. This is consistent with the expected size of wild type FOXO1A and is significantly smaller than FOXO1A-PAX3/PAX7 (~97 kDa)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], or FOXO-MLL (&#x0003e;200 kDa) fusion proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The lack of coding region mutations or rearrangements, and the predominantly nuclear localization of the FOXO1A protein are consistent with functionally normal FOXO1A protein in PER-453 cells. In addition, our data indicated that <italic>FOXO1A </italic>over-expression in the PER-453 cell line was not associated with gene amplification or a translocation event and we did not detect gross rearrangements of the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>proximal promoter, 5'-UTR, or 3'-UTR. These results suggest that <italic>FOXO1</italic>A over-expression may be the result of altered chromatin structure (e.g. histone hyperacetylation) at the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>locus and/or aberrant regulation by factors acting in trans at the promoter and/or 3'-UTR. The expression levels of several genes flanking the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>locus were similar in each of the CNS-PNET cell lines, suggesting that a generalised chromatin restructuring and/or coordinated deregulation of genes in the region of 13q14.11 is unlikely to explain the aberrant <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression observed in the PER-453 cell line. To date, there have been no detailed structural or functional analyses of the promoters or 3'-UTRs of any member of the FOXO family. Although the extent of the human <italic>FOXO1A </italic>promoter has yet to be formally determined, our data confirm that the proximal promoter is TATA-less and GC rich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Genes with promoters of this kind are often regulated, at least in part, by the trans acting specificity factors SP1-SP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, the identification of a FHBE in the <italic>FOXO1A </italic>promoter raises the possibility that forkhead transcription factors may be involved in the regulation of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>message levels. A more detailed analysis is required to determine whether imbalances in SP and/or forkhead transcription factors are associated with deregulated <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression in the PER-453 cell line.</p><p>The luciferase data suggest that the A to G mutation identified in one allele of the FOXO1A promoter in the PER-453 cell line is not associated with <italic>FOXO1A </italic>over-expression. Although we were unable to test the activities of the luciferase reporter constructs in CNS-PNET cells because of the low transfection efficiency of these cells, we considered that HEK cells represented a reasonable compromise for our study because they are tumorigenic cells derived from human foetal tissue and they express <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA at a level comparable to human foetal brain cells, from which CNS-PNETs are thought to be derived. Overall, our data suggest that the high <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression in the PER-453 cell line is associated with imbalances in transcription factor activity or epigenetic changes that are specific to this cell line.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that the 3'-UTRs of eukaryotic transcripts can play important roles in the regulation of mRNA stability, localisation, and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and aberrant 3'-UTR mediated regulation is involved in oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We have identified two novel <italic>FOXO1A </italic>transcripts in the PER-453 cell line that differ from the canonical transcript through splicing out in their 3'-UTRs. Apart from the report of a low abundance alternative <italic>FOXO1A </italic>transcript isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library and distinct from those described here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], this is the first demonstration of other alternatively spliced <italic>FOXO1A </italic>transcripts in any cell type. It remains to be seen whether these alternative <italic>FOXO1A </italic>transcripts are brain tissue specific or present in other cell types, and whether the alternatively spliced region is involved in the regulation of transcript abundance and tissue specific expression. A detailed analysis of the significance of <italic>FOXO1A-2 </italic>and <italic>FOXO1A-3 </italic>expression in human cells may provide new insights into the mechanisms by which FOXO1A expression levels are finely coordinated in response to diverse stimuli.</p><p>Although some of the specific 3'-UTR sequences and trans-acting factors that are involved in these processes have been determined, the precise mechanisms of 3'-UTR mediated regulation of transcript abundance remain poorly understood. An analysis of the canonical <italic>FOXO1A </italic>3'-UTR sequence for known 3'-UTR regulatory elements by UTRscan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] revealed only a consensus Brd-box (AGCTTA) and K-box (TGTGAT). These repressive elements, first described in the 3'-UTRs of multiple genes of the <italic>enhancer of split </italic>complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, are thought to be involved in miRNA mediated regulation of Notch signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, one of these elements, the K-box, is not present in either of the alternatively spliced <italic>FOXO1A </italic>transcripts that we detected in PER-453 cells. At present, it is unknown whether mammalian Brd-box and K-box elements are functionally similar to their insect counterparts, and it remains to be determined whether these elements play a role in miRNA-mediated regulation of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>expression.</p><p>Although apparently paradoxical, high expression of bona fide tumor suppressor genes, including <italic>p16 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and <italic>p53 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], have been reported in solid tumor specimens. In the latter study, high levels of wild type p53 were detected in CNS-PNETs. These authors suggest that apoptosis that would normally be induced by high p53 levels is counterbalanced by elevated expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in these tumors. It is possible that an analogous situation exists in the PER-453 cell line whereby the tumor suppressive effects of the high level of expression of wild type FOXO1A are overridden by inactivation or deregulation of downstream effector molecules.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The importance of FOXO family members as critical components of signalling nodes implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of tumor types suggests that the modulation of FOXO expression and function may be a useful approach for the treatment of some human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. On that basis, a greater understanding of FOXO transcriptional regulation, as well as FOXO protein shuttling dynamics and post-translational modification, may well provide new avenues for the design of novel therapies targeting FOXO activity in cancer cells.</p><p>The CNS-PNET cell line, PER-453, expresses <italic>FOXO1A </italic>at very high levels relative to most normal and cancer cells from a broad range of tissues. The <italic>FOXO1A </italic>open reading frame is wild type in the PER-453 cell line and the abnormally high <italic>FOXO1A </italic>mRNA expression is not due to mutations affecting the 5'-UTR or proximal promoter. Over expression of <italic>FOXO1A </italic>may be the result of PER-453 specific epimutations or imbalances in regulatory factors acting at the promoter and/or 3'-UTR.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PBD designed the study, analysed and interpreted the data, and wrote the manuscript.
