This model is particularly relevant to cancer cell metastasis to bone since BSP, bound to the &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin through its arginine-glycine-aspartic acid motif, could recruit MMP-2 to the cell surface.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We critically assessed the relationship between BSP and proMMP-2 and its activation using various forms of recombinant and purified BSP and MMP-2.

While BSP-mediated invasiveness has been shown to depend on its integrin-binding RGD sequence, analysis of proMMP-2 activation and the level of membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP in cells grown on a BSP substratum showed that the BSP-&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin interaction does not induce the expression of MT1-MMP.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These studies do not support a role for BSP in promoting metastasis through interactions with pro-MMP-2.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is a highly glycosylated and sulfated phosphoprotein that is expressed largely in mineralizing tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] but is also associated with cancer metastasis. Elevated levels of BSP have been reported in tumors and serum from patients with breast, lung, prostate, or thyroid cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Expression of BSP in cancer has been associated with metastasis of tumor cells to bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] as well as hydroxyapatite crystal formation in tumor tissues and breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that cooperate to modulate homeostasis of the extracellular environment by regulating oncogenic signaling networks and degrading extracellular matrix components, thereby contributing to tumor cell progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. MMP-2 (also known as gelatinase A) is made up of five structural domains including an inhibitory pro-domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Functional activity is regulated by enzymatic removal of the inhibitory pro-domain. A primary mechanism of proMMP-2 activation involves formation of a tri-molecular complex on cell surfaces involving tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. An alternative mechanism for controlling MMP-2 activity has invoked apparent structural changes that arise from specific interactions between BSP and proMMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It was reported that upon binding to BSP the proteolytic activity of proMMP-2 increased significantly, but paradoxically without removal of the inhibitory pro-peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It was suggested that BSP-mediated conformational changes upon partnering with proMMP-2 may facilitate removal of the inhibitory pro-peptide by another protease, which is similar to the binding and activation of proMMP-2 by MT1-MMP. A 26 amino acid domain of BSP appears to be involved in the displacement of MMP-2's propeptide from the active site of MMP2, thereby enhancing protease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Since BSP and MMP-2 are associated with tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the potential modulation of proMMP-2 activity by BSP is particularly relevant to tumor metastasis.

All spectra were corrected for buffer and dilution effects. Under these conditions, fluorescence observed was attributed exclusively to tryptophans from proMMP-2 as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

ProMMP-2 (1.4 nM or 2.8 nM) was added to 12.5 &#x003bc;g/mL substrate in the presence or absence of BSP (4.9 nM or 9.8 nM). Cleavage of the substrate was monitored using a micro-plate based multi-detection reader (485 nm excitation, 520 nm emission filters; FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany).

Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements demonstrated that titration of proMMP-2 with BSP resulted in a proportional quenching of MMP tryptophan emission spectra (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), suggestive of direct protein-protein interactions. Since proMMP-2 contains 15 tryptophan residues, whereas BSP contains none, the quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence signal suggests that proMMP-2 undergoes significant conformational changes, exposing internal tryptophan residues to a more polar environment in the presence of BSP with an apparent K<sub>d </sub>of 0.27 &#x000b1; 0.11 &#x003bc;M. However, control studies using osteopontin and RNase A in the same system also yielded a similar quenching of the proMMP-2 tryptophan emission spectra as well as the derivation of similar K<sub>d </sub>values.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Fluorescence emission spectrum of BSP-treated proMMP-2</bold>. proMMP-2 (333 nM) was incubated with increasing concentrations of native or recombinant BSP, OPN or RNase A (negative controls).

The emission peak in intrinsic fluorescence was observed at ~335 nm, which is in contrast to the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] that reported an emission peak at 360 nm and an interaction between proMMP-2 and BSP with a k<sub>d </sub>in the nanomolar range. When the MMP-binding site within BSP was studied by intrinsic fluorescence using BSP peptides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), each BSP fragment showed quenching of the MMP-2 tryptophan fluorescence signal, similar to the emission spectra obtained using the full-length BSP molecule and the control proteins suggesting non-specific interactions.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Tryptophan fluorescence profile</bold>. proMMP-2 (333 nM) was incubated with nM amounts of native BSP.

In concentrations where BSP is in excess of proMMP-2, there was no evidence for significant removal of the pro-domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) although in positive controls, proMMP-2 that had been activated in concanavalin A-treated cells showed lower molecular mass MMP-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, lanes 9, 10), consistent with cleavage of the pro-peptide and enzyme activation. When zymography bands were further assessed, each BSP-treated proMMP-2 sample resulted in an identical migration pattern as that of untreated enzyme. This is consistent with previous findings indicating that BSP binding does not induce significant cleavage of the pro-peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, BSP-treated proMMP-2 migrates as an intact molecule (<italic>Mr </italic>of ~66 kDa) on zymograms since the pro-peptide remains attached.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Zymography analysis of BSP-treated proMMP-2</bold>.

Using the same substrate, the ability of OPN to activate proMMP-3 was assayed, but activity above control values was also not observed. Since BSP may interact with proMMP-2 so that the inhibitory pro-peptide is removed from the active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], hence exposing the active site, we considered that the presence of BSP would lead to significant cleavage (auto-activation) to the lower molecular weight, active MMP-2.

Serum-free conditioned medium collected from MDA-MB231, rat bone marrow cells, HT1080 or human gingival fibroblasts were used as a source of MMP-2 and added to BSP that was conjugated to an ELISA plate. Since the reported binding between BSP and proMMP-2 was initially identified by a co-purification of proMMP-2 and recombinant BSP expressed in bone marrow cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we hypothesized that given the absence of a direct interaction then complexes with other proteins might be required, similar to the TIMP-2 bridge between the physiological activator MT1-MMP and MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Nonetheless, zymography analysis of BSP-bound (extract) and unbound (supernatant) fractions revealed that latent and active MMP-2 secreted by bone marrow cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), as well as the other cell lines, were recovered entirely in the supernatant, unbound fraction as observed for recombinant proMMP-2.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>MMP-2 from conditioned medium recovery in BSP-unbound fraction</bold>.

To investigate the consequences of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>clustering by BSP, the levels of proMMP-2 activation in MDA-MB231, MCF7, and T47D cells grown on BSP substrata were compared to that of cells grown on plastic. There was a similar level of proMMP-2 activation in cells after attachment to BSP in comparison to cells grown on plastic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Since proMMP-2 activation is directly associated with the level of MT1-MMP activity, these results indicated that cellular binding to BSP via integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>does not modify MT1-MMP activity on the cell surface.

Frequently, multimers of proteases show increased catalytic efficiency and in the plasma membrane, enabling focal proteolysis under cellular control. MMPs have traditionally been associated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis, in particular MMP-2 and its activator MT1-MMP. MMP-2 is uniquely activated on the cell surface by MT-MMPs in a highly regulated process after complex formation of pro- and active MMP-2 with MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Extracellularly, clustering by heparin or ConA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and claudin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], increases MMP-2 activation. Recently, specific interactions between BSP and latent forms of MMP-2 have been reported that resulted in activation of proMMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We assessed here the ability of various forms of BSP to bind and activate proMMP-2. We investigated the possibility that BSP activated proMMP-2 by analysis of gelatinase activity using a fluorescent substrate, but the analysis showed no activation of proMMP-2. Further, when OPN, another SIBLING protein, was assessed in proMMP-3 activation using the same substrate, no activation could be detected. Therefore, BSP does not appear to be involved in the activation of proMMP-2.</p><p>After careful examination of the conditions used for activation in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we noticed that despite a reported K<sub>d </sub>value of 2.9 &#x000b1; 0.9 nM, a 500-fold molar excess of BSP was necessary to demonstrate proMMP activation. We repeated these experiments using the human BSP at this same ratio but again found no activation. Given the potential ability of BSP to promote displacement of pro-peptides from active sites of proMMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we considered that there may be auto-activation of the latent enzyme in the presence of BSP. However, when proMMP-2 was treated with BSP, the proMMP-2 migrated as an intact molecule on zymograms, indicating that BSP does not activate proMMP-2.</p><p>Activation of MMP-2 requires unidentified protein-protein interactions, one of which might involve BSP. Extracellularly, one of the known interactors is native type I collagen, which results in the lateral association of MT1-MMP to accelerate activation of progelatinase A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As a result of our inability to detect BSP-induced activation of proMMP-2, we examined the interaction of these two proteins using binding assays. Since previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] have suggested a 1:1 stoichiometric binding between BSP and proMMP-2 with a K<sub>d </sub>value in the low nanomolar range, such an affinity presumably allows detection of the interaction using less sensitive assays such as affinity adsorption. However, we found no evidence of interaction between BSP and proMMP-2 using these assays.</p><p>To address the possibility of cell-derived adaptor molecules required for the BSP-proMMP-2 interaction, BSP was incubated with conditioned medium collected from breast cancer cells, bone marrow cells or human gingival fibroblasts. As observed for recombinant proMMP-2, latent and active MMP-2 secreted by cancer cells also did not bind to BSP. Notably, BSP is highly heterogeneous as a result of variations in the phosphorylation of serines and O- and N-linked glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Presumably, BSP expressed by diverse cells types is modified differently, and variations in post-translational modifications may determine the activity of these proteins and the binding and activation of proMMP-2. Accordingly we employed recombinant BSP, BSP purified from bone, or recombinant human BSP to assess binding to proMMP-2. As we were unable to detect binding of any of the BSPs to proMMP-2, there is evidently a need to re-assess the potential ability of BSP to bind to and activate proMMP-2 in the context of cancer cell metastasis although we cannot rule out the possibility that much more highly glycosylated BSP than the bovine BSP we used here could conceivably mediate an interaction with proMMP2.</p><p>MMP-2 binds to the surface of cancer cells via the fibronectin type II module repeats of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Despite the lack of an interaction between BSP and proMMP-2, it is possible that an interaction between BSP and the &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin itself may trigger downstream signaling events that affect the expression, processing, and activity of MMP-2. Thus, the requirement of an active RGD sequence in BSP-mediated cancer cell invasion suggests that BSP binding to the &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin may promote clustering of integrin molecules, which could activate downstream signaling events. Notably, ECM proteins can promote raft formation and type I collagen activates MMP-2 through &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-integrins, which increases MT1-MMP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and by direct binding of pericellular native type I collagen with the MT1-MMP hemopexin domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. MT1-MMP enhances focal proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and experimental metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], is associated with MMP-2 activation in lung carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and invasive human breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and is over-expressed in high-grade gliomas, fibrosarcomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and in carcinomas of the lung, stomach, head and neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, in our studies there was no evidence of integrin-mediated enhancement in the level of MT1-MMP transcript level, nor in MT1-MMP activity. Evidently, a more complete understanding of integrin-mediated signaling events will be important for defining the significance of BSP binding to the &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Collectively, using the methods reported here, our studies do not support a role for BSP in promoting pro-MMP-2 activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>QYJH conducted the experiments and the analyses and wrote the first drafts of the manuscript.
