They are surfactant deficient because undifferentiated epithelial cells predominate with few type II alveolar cells. As a result, very preterm infants often require respiratory support in the minutes following birth. Although essential for survival, mechanical ventilation of very preterm infants is closely associated with a high risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD is characterised by a simplification of airways, a cessation of alveolarisation, hypercellularity, variable fibrosis and capillary dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) in preterm infants is associated with many different forms of mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The inflammation that results from VILI is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of BPD. VILI promotes the recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages and induces many pro-inflammatory cytokines, transcription factors and growth factors leading to abnormal lung development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These factors include interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B and interferon-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although these factors are elevated in response to VILI, a detectable increase can take many hours or days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], making it difficult to define the initial injury-related pathways involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Identifying the initial injury pathways is critical as the greatest risk of injury may be during the period immediately after birth when the lungs are partially liquid-filled, are surfactant deficient and are not uniformly aerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether the above factors are reliable markers of lung injury in studies that are of short duration e.g. investigations of the neonatal resuscitation period.</p><p>One of the histological hallmarks of BPD is hypercellularity of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and we have recently demonstrated that VILI rapidly stimulates lung cell proliferation in the immature lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The early response genes connective tissue growth factor (<italic>CTGF</italic>), cysteine-rich 61 (<italic>CYR61</italic>) and early growth response factor 1 (<italic>EGR1</italic>) are known to promote cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and we have recently shown that they are rapidly activated in response to a fetal lung growth stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Previous studies have also demonstrated that these genes are activated in response to lung injury in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], but their role in VILI in the preterm neonate is unknown. Thus, our first aim was to investigate whether these early response genes are activated within 15 min-2 h of an injurious insult to the lungs of preterm lambs, before pathological changes to the lung have occurred. To determine their usefulness as early markers of lung injury, we compared their change in expression with changes in the expression of the inflammation genes <italic>IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8 </italic>and <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;</italic><sub>1</sub>, TNF-&#x003b1; protein levels and NF-&#x003ba;B activity, which have previously been associated with VILI in neonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our second aim was to determine if the mRNA levels of these genes could differentiate between ventilation strategies likely to induce only a mild degree of VILI. To address that aim we determined the mRNA levels of <italic>CTGF, CYR61, EGR1, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and IL-8 </italic>in preterm lambs resuscitated from birth using tidal volumes of 5 or 10 mL/kg. Based on the known roles of CTGF, CYR61 and EGR1, it is possible that their aberrant expression contributes to abnormal lung development in very preterm infants destined to develop BPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal experiments</title><sec><title>Delivery and ventilation of lambs</title><p>All experimental procedures on animals were approved by the Monash University Animal Ethics Committee.

The fluorescence was recorded after each 72&#x000b0;C step. Dissociation curves were performed to ensure that a single PCR product had been amplified for each primer pair. Each sample was measured in triplicate and a control sample, containing no template, was included in each run. A threshold value (C<sub>T </sub>value) for each sample was determined. Minor differences in the amount of cDNA template added to each reaction were adjusted by subtracting the C<sub>T </sub>value for 18S from the C<sub>T </sub>value for the gene of interest (&#x00394;C<sub>T</sub>). To enable comparisons between assays, a calibrator sample (in quadruplicate) was run in each assay.

Sections were then washed in PBS (CYR61 2 &#x000d7; 5 min; EGR1 3 &#x000d7; 5 min) and incubated (CYR61 5 min; EGR1 30 min) in hydrogen peroxide (3%) to block endogenous peroxidase activity.

The sections were then incubated with the primary antibodies (CYR61 Cat# sc-13100; EGR1 Cat# sc-189, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California, USA) diluted in DAKO antibody diluent (CYR61, diluted 1:150; EGR1 diluted 1:200) for either 90 min at room temperature (CYR61) or overnight at 4&#x000b0;C (EGR1).

The sections were again washed in PBS (0.1% Tween 20) for 5 mins (&#x000d7;3) before the secondary antibody was detected using the Vectastain ABC detection kit (Vector laboratories). The sections were washed, dehydrated and permanently mounted. Sections that lacked the primary antibodies or the secondary antibody were also included.</p><p>Sections were viewed under a light microscope and images were captured at a magnification of 1000&#x000d7; using a digital camera. Analysis was performed on images using ImagePro Plus (Media Cybernetics, MD) on 5 fields of view per section using 3 randomly chosen sections (from different regions of the lungs). For each field of view, the area of tissue positively stained for EGR1 or CYR61 was measured and expressed as a percentage of the total area of tissue. The percentage of stained tissue for each lamb was then averaged for each experimental group. Analysis was performed on the alveolar region of the lung, taking care to avoid areas containing major airways or blood vessels.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; SEM with the level of statistical significance set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.

However, the specific mechanisms by which mechanical ventilation causes lung injury in very preterm infants are largely unknown, as are the pathways resulting in the abnormal lung development that characterise BPD. We have recently demonstrated that VILI in the immature lung induces a rapid increase in distal lung cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] which is consistent with the fibroblast proliferation seen in infants with BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] We have also identified a number of early response genes (<italic>CTGF, EGR1 </italic>and <italic>CYR61</italic>) that regulate cell proliferation and are thought to play a role in normal lung development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As these genes are also involved in adult lung injury and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we investigated their activation following VILI in preterm lambs. We found that <italic>CTGF, EGR1 </italic>and <italic>CYR61 </italic>expression is rapidly increased in a time-dependent manner in response to VILI in very preterm lambs and that <italic>CTGF, CYR61, IL-6 </italic>and <italic>IL-8 </italic>are differentially expressed during high and low tidal volume ventilation strategies. Thus, it is possible that the abnormal lung development that follows VILI, is explained at least in part by the abnormally high expression of these genes. Furthermore, the reduction in pneumothoraces and sub-pleural air-leaks, the histological evidence of lung injury and our gene expression findings indicate that volume-controlled mechanical ventilation (with PEEP) from birth, using a low tidal volume (5 mL/kg) was less injurious than using a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg.</p><p>A primary aim of this study was to determine the degree and rapidity of increase in expression of <italic>CTGF, CYR61 </italic>and <italic>EGR1 </italic>following injurious ventilation, in comparison to that of inflammatory factors that have previously been associated with VILI in neonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

In contrast, the increases in <italic>IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 </italic>and <italic>IL-8 </italic>after injurious ventilation support the findings of other studies that have also found these inflammatory cytokines are increased at 2&#x02013;3 h after injurious ventilation from birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

The CCN family are secreted matricellular proteins that form interactions between the extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules, leading to diverse cellular responses including cell proliferation, extracellular matrix production, angiogenesis, adhesion, migration, apoptosis and growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>CTGF induces lung fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and the expression of collagen and other extracellular molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. <italic>CTGF </italic>has increased expression (0.3 fold) in fetal sheep lungs undergoing accelerated lung growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and <italic>CTGF </italic>knockout mice die at birth of respiratory failure due to defects in the rib cage and pulmonary hypoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Although these data indicate that CTGF is important for normal lung growth, abnormally elevated levels of <italic>CTGF </italic>expression are also implicated in the pathogenesis of adult human lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the adult mouse, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and hyperoxia-induced lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], also exhibit elevated <italic>CTGF </italic>mRNA levels. As fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, hypercellularity and pulmonary fibrosis are commonly associated with VILI in very preterm infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and fetal sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], it is possible that abnormally high CTGF expression following VILI (~25 fold in the current study) may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD.</p><p>CYR61 is structurally and functionally similar to CTGF and also acts as an early response gene. CYR61 acts synergistically with other growth factors to potentiate their mitogenic effects on endothelial, epithelial and fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] as well as to promote collagen and cartilage production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Depending on the cellular milieu, the primary role of CYR61 is thought to be the regulation of angiogenesis by promoting the proliferation of endothelial cells and the production of angiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Interestingly, CYR61 also up-regulates the expression of inflammatory genes, including <italic>IL-1&#x003b2;</italic>, as well as modulators of the extracellular matrix such as proteases and their inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Similar to <italic>CTGF, CYR61 </italic>expression is also increased (~0.3 fold) in fetal sheep lungs undergoing accelerated growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and abnormally high levels of <italic>CYR61 </italic>have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] in humans as well as lung injury in adult rodents induced by hyperoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] or volutrauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Based on its known roles, the large and rapid increase in CYR61 expression (~50 fold in the current study) may contribute to the abnormal lung pathology caused by VILI via several mechanisms. It may contribute to the hypercellularity and fibrosis by directly stimulating the proliferation of fibroblasts and epithelial cells and may upset the normal balance of angiogenic factors, contributing to dysmorphic capillary growth. It may also contribute to the sustained inflammation and abnormal tissue repair that can occur in response to VILI and is an antecedent of BPD in very preterm infants. Our results indicate that increased <italic>CYR61 </italic>expression may play a key role in initiating the cascade of events caused by VILI, as CYR61 protein levels in lung tissue were increased 6-fold within two hours of VILI.</p><p>EGR1 is a transcription factor that is rapidly expressed by diverse stimuli that induce growth, differentiation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. EGR1 up-regulates the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, growth factors, cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1; and TGF&#x003b2; and other transcription factors including itself and matrix proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. <italic>EGR1 </italic>is up-regulated in the fetal sheep during accelerated lung growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and in hemi-pneumonectomy induced compensatory lung growth in adult mice suggesting that it may play a role in regulating normal lung growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, <italic>EGR1 </italic>expression is also increased by volutrauma in the adult rat lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and it plays a pivotal role in the response to pulmonary ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the adult mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In humans it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and vascular pathologies where it can cause vascular lesions, suppress the growth of damaged endothelial cells and modulate vascular tone [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]]. These roles for EGR1, suggest the high levels of its expression induced by VILI (~125 fold in the current study), may contribute to abnormal lung development by its ability to induce cell proliferation, impair vascular development, produce matrix proteins and induce cytokines that promote inflammation.</p><p>Regardless of whether CTGF, CYR61 and EGR1 are critical mediators of abnormal lung development caused by VILI, they are likely to be early markers of lung injury. All three genes were very rapidly elevated in response to the injurious ventilation strategy. More importantly, when taken together, the expression levels of <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>IL-8</italic>, <italic>CTGF </italic>and <italic>CYR61 </italic>appeared to differentiate between ventilation strategies causing different degrees of lung injury. Expression levels of all four genes were lowest in lambs mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 5 mL/kg and were higher in lambs mechanically ventilated with 10 mL/kg that exhibited gross and histological evidence of lung injury. In contrast, <italic>EGR1 </italic>and <italic>IL-1&#x003b2; </italic>appeared not to be sufficiently sensitive to detect any differences between the ventilation strategies. Although the 135 minute ventilation period did not allow time for changes in lung structure to manifest histologically, other evidence indicated that VG10 lambs incurred more lung injury than VG5 lambs. This evidence included the presence of hyaline membranes, detached epithelial cells, red blood cells in the distal lung parenchyma, the presence of blood stained tracheal aspirates, the production of pneumothoraces and subpleural air leaks, and the high PIP required to achieve the tidal volume of 10 mL/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current international guidelines for neonatal resuscitation (ILCOR) provide little guidance on the most appropriate resuscitation techniques that minimise lung injury in the immediate newborn period when the lungs are partially liquid-filled and not uniformly aerated. Our data indicate that VILI during the immediate newborn period can rapidly (within 15 mins) initiate changes in gene expression which are abnormal and likely to potentiate inflammation and to promote abnormal lung development. Furthermore, our studies indicate that resuscitation and mechanical ventilation at birth with relatively high tidal volumes is potentially more injurious than with relatively low tidal volumes. We also conclude that CTGF, CYR61, EGR1, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and IL-8 are likely to be useful biomarkers of VILI in the newborn, particularly in studies of short duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MW identified <italic>EGR1, CTGF </italic>and <italic>CYR61 </italic>as likely candidate genes, oversaw the molecular and histological component of the analyses and prepared the manuscript.
