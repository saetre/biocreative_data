In addition to transcriptional regulations, upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and open reading frames (uORFs) profoundly affect the translation of the primary ORF and thus the protein levels in several genes. The 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of mouse MOR mRNA contains three uORFs preceding the MOR main initiation codon. In MOR-fused EGFP or MOR promoter/luciferase reporter constructs, mutating each uAUG individually or in combinations increased MOR transient heterologous expression in neuroblastoma NMB and HEK293 cells significantly. Translation of such constructs increased up to 3-fold without altering the mRNA levels if either the third uAUG or both the second and third AUGs were mutated. Additionally, these uAUG-mediated translational inhibitions were independent of their peptide as confirmed by internal mutation analyses in each uORF. Translational studies indicated that protein syntheses were initiated at these uAUG initiation sites, with the third uAUG initiating the highest translation level. These results support the hypothesis that uORFs in mouse MOR mRNA act as negative regulators through a ribosome leaky scanning mechanism. Such leaky scanning resulted in the suppression of mouse MOR under normal conditions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Opioid receptors (&#x000b5;, &#x003b4; and &#x003ba;) mediate the diverse functions of endogenous opioid peptides and the opioid alkaloids such as morphine, including analgesia, reward, autonomic reflexes, and endocrine/immune regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). The mu opioid receptor (MOR) is considered to be the main site of action for morphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Many studies, including those with receptor knockout mice, have indicated that the responses to opiate agonists are dependent on the receptor level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). MOR is first detected in rat brain at embryonic day 14 (E14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) followed by a slight decline during the first week of postnatal development, then increasing to peak levels 2 weeks later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The overall mechanisms involved in such spatial and temporal regulations of MOR have not yet been elucidated.</p><p>Generally, transcriptional control is mediated by transcription factors, RNA polymerase and a series of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements located in the gene sequences. Such promoters, enhancers, silencers and locus-control elements are organized in a modular structure and regulate the production of pre-mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Opioid receptor expression can be regulated by multiple mechanisms, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Our laboratory and others have demonstrated that MOR promoter activity is regulated by many enhancer elements and their related transcriptional factors such as SOX, SP1, AP2, NF-&#x003ba;B, PU.1, and NRSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Post-transcriptional regulation occurs at the level of mRNA or protein. Such regulation could be due to mRNA stability, differences in translation efficiency or mRNA transport, and covalent modification of receptor molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). Our recent studies indicated that the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of MOR mRNA could affect the overall transcript's activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Thus, posttranscriptional regulation of the MOR gene could have an important role in the spatial and temporal expression of the receptor proteins.</p><p>Recently, it has become increasingly clear that the 5&#x02032;-UTR of eukaryotic mRNA is a key site of multiple forms of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, especially those containing at least one AUG codon (uAUG) upstream of the main open reading frame (ORF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19">16&#x02013;19</xref>). It is postulated that, in eukaryotic cells, most translation proceeds according to the ribosome scanning model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>), and initiates predominantly by a cap-binding/scanning mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The scanning model predicts that an uAUG codon will interfere with translation of a downstream main ORF. However, the scanning complex may bypass such uAUG codons by &#x02018;leaky scanning&#x02019; if the surrounding nucleotide context is suboptimal or very close to the 5&#x02032; cap region of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The 43S pre-initiation complex binds to the 5&#x02032;-cap region and then migrates progressively 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; until it recognizes an AUG start codon. The resulting complex is joined by the large subunit to form a complete ribosome, and polypeptide synthesis begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Ribosomes reaching the main AUG of these mRNAs do so mainly via context-dependent leaky scanning and/or reinitiation mechanisms, although it is widely believed that these are inefficient mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The context-dependent leaky scanning mechanism accounts for the observation that some 40S subunits will fail to initiate at AUG codons with a less than optimal context and continue scanning along the 5&#x02032;-UTR. The most efficient context for initiation of protein translation is known as the Kozak sequence (GCC<bold>R</bold>CCAUG<bold>G</bold>), which was identified initially as a consensus sequence in vertebrate mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The reinitiation mechanism describes the ability of 40S subunits to continue to scan and initiate at a downstream main AUG codon after translating a small independent uORF. Reinitiation is considered to be a rare event. Although the incidence of this mechanism may be much greater, only a few mRNAs with uORFs have been examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). These uAUGs or uORFs are features of at least a few percent of the mRNAs in yeast, plants and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), and can be important players in negative translational control. However, in some cases, the upstream regulatory sequences stimulated translation of the major ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>Within the 5&#x02032;-UTR region of the mouse MOR gene, between the basal proximal promoter at nucleotides &#x02212;445 to &#x02212;240 and the AUG of the main ORF, three uORFs with variable lengths are identified. Whether these uORFs can regulate the translation of the MOR transcripts was examined in this study. The uAUG-directed initiation and uORF-peptide-dependent regulations of the MOR transcript's translation were examined by mutational analyses of the uAUGs and internal sequences. We demonstrate that the translation of the MOR transcript is negatively regulated by these uORFs, and that such down-regulation is mediated via ribosome leaky scanning mechanism. The initiation of peptide syntheses at these uAUGs of the MOR transcript provides a novel mechanism for the regulation of expression of the mouse MOR gene product.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>All constructs were generated by PCR using Turbo Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), with forward and reverse primers containing appropriate restriction sites at their 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends or appropriate mutations at desired sequence sites. Amplified fragments were cloned into the pGL3-promoter reporter construct (Promega), using the corresponding restriction sites as described below. The wild-type uAUG(+) construct was generated by inserting the &#x02212;301 to +1 PCR fragment of the 5&#x02032;-UTR of mouse MOR (generated by using HindIII-ended forward primer and NcoI-ended reverse primer) in between the HindIII and NcoI restriction sites of pGL3-promoter reporter construct. Individual uORF in the mouse MOR 5&#x02032;-UTR (&#x02212;301 to +1) were inactivated by introducing point mutations into the start codons using an oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendation.

For the construct in which all three uAUGs in between the HindIII and NcoI sites were mutated [uAUG(&#x02212;)], the U within each AUG sequence was substituted by C in the forward primer and with G in the reverse primer.</p><p>The uORF/luciferase (LUC) in-frame fusion constructs were generated by inserting a PCR fragment amplified from the uAUG(+) construct using the HindIII-ended forward and NcoI-ended reverse primers, 5&#x02032;-CCAAGCTTGGATCCCTCACAGCCCATGCTCCC-3&#x02032; (forward) and 5&#x02032;-AACCATGGAGTGGAACCAGAGAAGAGCGGCAG-3&#x02032; (reverse), where the stop codon of the 5&#x02032;-UTR is replaced by the NcoI site. This cloning leads to a fusion between the stop codon of the mouse MOR uORF and the ATG codon of the LUC coding sequence.

MOR coding regions (exon 1 to exon 4) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were fused in-frame. First, mouse exon regions were produced by PCR using the following primers: 5&#x02032;-CAGCAAGCATTCAGAACCATGGACAGCAGCGCCGGCCCAGGGA-3&#x02032; (forward) and 5&#x02032;-TAGGCGCCAGGTACCGAGGGCAATGGAGCAGTTTCT-3&#x02032; (reverse), corresponding to &#x02212;18 to +1218&#x02009;bp of the mouse MOR. This PCR product was cloned to the Topo-TA vector. The mouse MOR UTR region (&#x02212;301 to +1) was subsequently fused to the mouse MOR exon regions by ligation (5&#x02032;-HindIII, 3&#x02032;-PstI). Finally, these fused constructs were cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector by ligation (5&#x02032;-HindIII, 3&#x02032;-KpnI).

This 5&#x02032;-UTR was within the longest major MOR transcripts observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (designated start codon to +1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Computational sequence analysis of the mouse MOR 5&#x02032;-region revealed the presence of three uAUGs (uAUG#1, uAUG#2 and uAUG#3) that were in the same open reading frame and shared the same stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Translation of the first, second and third uAUGs may give rise to uORFs containing 50, 37 and 34 amino acids, respectively, all of which terminate at &#x02212;128&#x02009;bp upstream of the mouse MOR initiation codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). In vertebrate mRNAs, initiation sites usually conform to all or part of the sequence GCC<bold>R</bold>CC<underline>AUG</underline><bold>G</bold>, known as the Kozak sequence rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The most conserved nucleotides were the <bold>R</bold> (A or G) at &#x02212;3 and the <bold>G</bold> at +4 (the A of the AUG codon was designated as +1). Strong consensus sequences contain both of these important nucleotides, whereas an adequate sequence contains only one of them, and weak sequences contain none of them. The AUG codons initiating the main ORF of a transcript have strong or adequate sequence contexts in 95&#x02013;97% of the cases. This percentage was lower for the uAUGs (43&#x02013;63%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In the case of the mouse MOR transcript, uAUG#1 is weak (no match compared the Kozak sequence in &#x02212;3 and +4), while uAUG#2 (&#x02212;3 position matched) and uAUG#3 (&#x02212;3 position matched) have adequate sequences. The mouse MOR main ORF has a strong consensus sequence similar to that of the luciferase main ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). To evaluate whether the translation mediated by the mouse MOR 5&#x02032;-UTR was cap-dependent or -independent, we translated capped and uncapped transcripts in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL) in the presence of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine. The presence of the m<sup>7</sup>G cap increased mouse MOR translation 2- to 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>E and F), indicating that under these conditions translation initiation mainly occurred through a cap-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, a significant increase in protein synthesis was observed after elimination of the initiation codon, independent of whether capped or uncapped transcripts were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F). Therefore, the uORF can inhibit MOR translation <italic>in vitro</italic>. </p></sec><sec><title>Repression of mouse MOR translation by the uORF in the MOR 5&#x02032;-UTR</title><p>As technical difficulties prevent visualization of the translational products of these uORFs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we instead examined the initiation of peptide synthesis at individual uAUGs by <italic>in vitro</italic> translation studies. Several constructs under the control of the SP6 promoter were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In this experiment, LUC synthesis should occur if ribosomes initiate translation at the uAUG codons of the uORF and/or the LUC main initiation site with the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). The autoradiography results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) show that both the uORF-LUC fusion and LUC proteins were expressed at different levels. As expected, the uORF-LUC fusion protein had a molecular weight slightly higher than the control LUC protein. These data demonstrate that the uORF is efficiently translated. The most effective initiation site was uAUG#3, and the least effective initiation site was uAUG#1. The above results revealed that each of the uORFs were successfully initiated and translated, but these effects were not reflected in any differences in the transcription levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). These <italic>in vitro</italic> translation results were similar to those observed with LUC activities in NMB cells transfected with similar constructs. To understand how the translation of the first initiation codon can affect subsequent initiation events, we characterized the relative efficiency of all the initiation codons. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C shows the relative strength of each initiation context represented in arbitrary units relative to the LUC ATG context (i.e., a Strong Kozak sequence, designated 1.00), which has one of the closest matches to the strong context. The results show that translation is most effectively initiated at uAUG#3 and most weakly at uAUG#1. </p><p>FACS is a type of flow cytometry, a method for sorting a suspension of biological cells based on specific light scattering and fluorescent characteristics of each cell. We prepared GFP-fused mouse MOR constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) and confirmed that uORFs mediated mouse MOR expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, removal of all three uAUGs in cells transfected with pmMUEG #3 resulted in increased fluorescence levels up to 3.5-fold compared to pmMUEG #1 (wild-type). In cells transfected with pmMUEG #2 (only mutated at uAUG#3), the fluorescence level increased up to 1.7-fold compared to pmMUEG #1. These data suggest that uORFs of the mouse MOR can be repressed downstream of MOR expression with the most effective repression activity containing uAUG#3. Additionally, these three uAUGs could synergistically repress the downstream of MOR gene expression. </p><p>Because mouse uORFs could repress downstream MOR gene expression, we performed opioid radioligand binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). The binding activity of MOR was monitored by measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]diprenorphine-specific binding with or without CTOP, a selective antagonist for MOR. After transfection of the constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) into NMB cells, pmMUEG #3-transfected cells showed binding activity up to three times higher than that observed in cells transfected with the other uAUG-mutated constructs. The repression effect exhibited in the cells transfected with the uAUG#3-mutated construct confirmed the results found in the flow cytometry studies. These results suggest that uORFs can negatively regulate MOR expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of MOR translation by uORF initiation</title><p>To determine whether these uORFs affect the expression of the downstream main ORF, we constructed a series of plasmids [derived from uAUG(+); see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A] containing corresponding point mutations for each uAUG (i.e. ATG changed to ACG). These wild-type and mutant constructs were transiently transfected in NMB cells that expressed MOR endogenously. After transfection, cellular extracts were prepared and assayed for translational (luciferase assay, LUC/&#x000df;-gal relative activity) and transcriptional (real-time RT-PCR, LUC/LacZ mRNA) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The levels of transcripts were very similar among all constructs, indicating that the point mutations did not alter transcription levels. In contrast, LUC activity was differentially affected by the mutations of these uAUGs. Particularly, mutations within the third uAUG or second/third uAUG (uAUG#3 or uAUG#2, 3) caused a 1.6- and 2.9-fold increase in LUC activity, respectively. Mutations of the uAUG#1 or uAUG#2 had no significant effect. When all the uAUGs were mutated [uAUG(&#x02212;)], the luciferase activity was not significantly different from that observed with the uAUG#2, 3 mutated constructs. These results suggest that the repression of the LUC activity is due to the presence of the MOR 5&#x02032;-UTR occurring at a translational level, and that the second/third uAUGs are involved in this repressive effect synergistically. </p><p>Repression by uORFs in some eukaryotic genes is dependent on the peptide-coding sequence of their uORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). To assess the importance of these uORF peptides in the translation of the downstream ORF, the uORF sequences were mutated by introducing a stop codon within the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Introducing the stop codon after uAUG#3 either alone (uAUG#3 +S) or in combination with a stop codon inserted after uAUG#2 (uAUG#2, 3 +S) increased LUC activity by about 1.5- and 1.7-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Again, these increases in LUC activity were not caused by alterations in transcriptional activity. In order to examine the full repression activity of individual uORFs, constructs with uAUG mutations combined with a stop codon mutation within each uORF were generated (M + S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). The third uAUG plus stop construct mutation (uAUG#3 M + S) increased LUC activity more than the uAUG#3 +S construct but did not affect the mRNA content. The uAUG#2, 3 M + S and uAUG(&#x02212;) M + S constructs also increased LUC activity to a greater degree than that observed with the uAUG#3 M + S construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). It is therefore possible that the MOR uORFs negatively regulate expression independent of their peptide-coding sequences. </p><p>To confirm our hypothesis of context-dependent leaky scanning, we designed 5&#x02032;-UTR constructs fused with luciferase as a reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). These constructs contain the original context, or an improved uAUG context based on the Kozak sequence rule. The strengths of the AUG context sequences ranged from &#x02018;strong&#x02019; to &#x02018;weak&#x02019; and in descending order were A<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> + G<sup>+4</sup> &#x0003e; G<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> + G<sup>+4</sup> &#x0003e; A<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> + A<sup>+4</sup> &#x0003e; G<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> + A<sup>+4</sup> &#x0003e; U<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>+&#x02009;G<sup>+4</sup> &#x0003e; U<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> + A<sup>+4</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We modified the context of the first uAUG (weak) to an improved (IMP) sequence (<bold>A</bold>CC<underline>AUG</underline><bold>G</bold>; strong). After transfection of these constructs into NMB cells, expression was analyzed by luciferase assays. The IMP construct decreased reporter activity about five-fold relative to that of the wild-type construct [uAUG (+)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Furthermore, introduction of the stronger uAUG context around the first uAUG, combined with mutation within the second/third uAUG (#2, 3_IMP) decreased reporter activity 24-fold, relative to the activity of uAUG#2, 3 constructs. The levels of transcripts were very similar among all constructs, indicating that these mutations did not alter transcription levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lower panel). These data suggest that a stronger AUG context at the first uAUG position could recruit ribosome complexes more efficiently to initiate translation, and represses the main AUG initiation site via a context-dependent leaky scanning mechanism. Taken together, these data suggest that the original weak context of the first uAUG (#1 uAUG) has a lower potential for initiation of translation and inhibition of the main AUG initiation site compared to those of the second and third uAUG (#2 and #3 uAUG). </p></sec><sec><title>Ribosome leaky scanning regulates mouse MOR gene expression</title><p>Toeprinting assays have been known to reveal the effects of initiation context and regulated-ribosome stalling on the association of ribosomes with mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). We therefore examined two mRNAs: the uAUG(+) construct contains the uORFs in their wild-type initiation context, while the uAUG(&#x02212;) construct was mutated in all three uAUG sites. Toeprints corresponding to ribosomes at each of the MOR uORF start codons were observed, except for uAUG#1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Toeprints corresponding to ribosomes at the start codon of uAUG#2 and uAUG#3 were also observed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by radiolabeled mToe primer. The uAUG#2 and uAUG#3 initiation-codon toeprint maps showed 16 nucleotides downstream of the AUG codons, indicating ribosomes with the initiation codon in their P-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). As shown in the preceding experiments, both the uAUG#2 and uAUG#3 sequences were sufficient by the Kozak sequence rule, but stronger inhibition was observed in uAUG#3. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> shows similar results: the uAUG#3 toeprint was stronger than the uAUG#2, while the uAUG#1 toeprint was not detected in uAUG(+) transcripts. However, in transcripts where all three uAUGs were mutated [uAUG(&#x02212;)], no toeprints were detected. These data indicate that ribosomes scanned linearly from the 5&#x02032;-end of the mRNA to initiate translation at each of these start codons rather than being loaded internally. Minor bands were also seen; these minor products might represent either authentic truncated mRNAs or false priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). </p><p>By adding the translational elongation inhibitor cycloheximide to rabbit reticulocyte lysates under steady-state conditions, toeprints corresponding to ribosomes at each of the uORF start codons were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). As controls, toeprinting was performed on reaction mixtures lacking either RNA or extract. Without added RNA, negligible cDNA synthesis from the radiolabeled primer was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, lane 8). When RNA is added without extract, the major cDNA product is the full-length cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, lane 7). Additional common premature termination products occurred in all of the lanes. Many of these were also observed in primer extension analyses of RNA in the absence of extract but not in primer extension analyses of extract in the absence of exogenously added mRNA. We compared toeprints when cycloheximide was added to extract prior to adding RNA template (T0) to those obtained when cycloheximide was added after translation of the RNA was underway (T5). Cycloheximide at T0 should show where ribosomes first initiate translation, since the cycloheximide interferes with elongation, not initiation. When cycloheximide was added to rabbit reticulocyte lysates programmed with mouse MOR-LUC mRNA, ribosomes were observed at both the uORF and LUC initiation codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, when cycloheximide was added early (T0), significant leaky scanning past the MOR uORF initiation codon was observed. Samples containing the uAUG#2 and uAUG#3 codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, lane 3) exhibit toeprints for those sequences as well as for the LUC start codon. In contrast, samples deleted of all the uAUGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, lane 4) exhibited only the LUC start codon, and at higher levels than in the wild-type construct. When cycloheximide was added later (T5), toeprints were observed for both the uAUGs and LUC start codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). If the uORF mechanism functions by reinitiation, scanning ribosomes would load only at the uORF start codon at T0 state while later (T5) ribosomes would load at both uORF and LUC start codon. However, if the uORF mechanism functions by leaky scanning, ribosomes at both the uORF and LUC start codons would load at both T0 and T5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The results obtained here support the notion that ribosomes reach the downstream start codon in the MOR mRNA by the leaky scanning mechanism, rather than by reinitiation. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The distribution of opioid receptors and the expression patterns of their mRNAs have been extensively examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Opioid receptor proteins are also regulated by variations in the mRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These mRNA variants differ mainly in the 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-UTR regions. As such, regulation of opioid receptor expression involves not only transcriptional control at the DNA level, but also posttranscriptional control at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). We have characterized a novel regulatory mechanism of mouse MOR expression mediated by uAUG/uORF in this study. The 301-bp extension of the mouse MOR 5&#x02032;-UTR region includes the major MOR mRNA transcription sequence (derived from the proximal MOR promoter), and contains three uORFs. These uORFs use the same termination codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In most well-characterized examples of regulatory uORFs, mutation of the uAUG codon alters protein expression without affecting mRNA abundance. However, uORFs do not always inhibit translation; cases have been described in which uORFs stimulated expression of downstream ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). If removal of uAUGs alters mRNA levels, then the AUG nucleotides may alter transcription or RNA stability, independent of translation of the uORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We found that the presence of the uORF region suppressed translation without changing MOR transcription levels. This was due to three uAUGs present in the region from nucleotides &#x02212;301 to +1&#x02009;bp in the MOR 5&#x02032;-UTR. As uORF mechanisms usually function in a cap-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), we investigated this well-characterized regulatory mechanism by using capped and uncapped transcripts for <italic>in vitro</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E and F). We determined that mouse MOR containing uORFs do indeed function in a cap-dependent manner.</p><p>The initiation efficiencies of each uAUG are important features of the codons in MOR 5&#x02032;-UTR leaky scanning models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The relative strengths of the initiation codons were tested by <italic>in vitro</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The uAUG#1 had a very weak initiation context, while uAUG#2 had a slightly stronger initiation context. The uAUG#3 had the strongest initiation context. This likely facilitates higher levels of leaky scanning, enabling peptide synthesis from the uAUG#3 initiation codon on the MOR 5&#x02032;-UTR. When the sequence was mutated at all three uAUGs [uAUG(&#x02212;)], only peptide products initiated from the main uAUG were produced. These results indicate that all three uAUGs can effectively be initiated and produce peptides, and that uORFs can negatively regulate downstream MOR ORF initiation.</p><p>We also performed FACS analyses and receptor binding assays to examine cell surface expression of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The results confirmed that these uORFs mediated down-regulation of MOR expression. Indeed, the presence of the uORFs decreased expression by up to 3.5-fold relative to samples lacking the uORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We further confirmed the context-dependent initiation activity of each uAUG by mutation. Translation initiation strength was most efficient in the third uAUG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). If the uAUGs reside in a non-optimal context, the scanning ribosomal complex may bypass possible starting AUGs by leaky scanning. Transient transfection results suggest that the inhibition of the main AUG imposed by one of the uORF (uAUG#3) was greater than that produced by the other uORFs (uAUG#1 or uAUG#2).</p><p>Moreover, some peptides produced by translation of uORFs have been reported to interact with the ribosome, further diminishing the efficiency of protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). In contrast, regulation of yeast GCN4 translation by nutrient levels was independent of the peptide sequences encoded by its uORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Our current study showed that introduction of stop codon constructs (+S), thereby changing the sequence of peptide encoded by the uORF, exhibited changes similar to those seen in the translation of the downstream cistron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Furthermore, mutating the uAUGs while also introducing the stop codon (M + S) caused a marked increase in the translation of the downstream cistron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). These data show that regulation of the MOR uORF is independent of the peptide sequence of the uORF. Thus, the inhibitory effect of the uORF during MOR translation is a protein-independent mechanism. Although the mechanisms involved in explaining the inhibitory effects of the uORF peptide on translation are not understood, several models could be proposed. For example, the peptide of the uORF could be synthesized and have the ability to inhibit translation only at high concentrations in the local microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, differences in LUC levels were detected between constructs with different uAUG contexts. This indicates that ribosomes initiating at the main AUG must have scanned the uAUGs, especially when these uAUGs contain strong or adequate contexts. Leaky scanning is an extension of the scanning model and suggests that an AUG might be bypassed by scanning ribosomes if it resides in a suboptimal context. This mechanism could only occur by context-dependent leaky scanning.</p><p>It is known that uAUGs can inhibit translation in several ways. When they are recognized by translational machinery, a futile cycle can occur, such that only the ribosomes skipping the uAUG (leaky scanning) can reach the main ORF. Accordingly, the level of inhibition is directly related to the context for translation initiation: the better an uAUG is recognized, the greater the resulting inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Even in conditions of optimal uAUG recognition, a small percentage of ribosomes, after translation of the uORF, can continue scanning for start sites (reinitiation), eventually reaching the AUG of the main ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>).</p><p>Despite efficient translation of the uORF, the main cistron remains translated. Several mechanisms can explain the translation of the downstream cistron by internal ribosome entry, ribosome reinitiation and leaky scanning. The stronger suppression of uAUGs with respect to uORFs can be partially explained by the fact that initiation at the main ORF may occur only by leaky scanning in uAUG-containing transcripts, whereas both leaky scanning and ribosome reinitiation may allow initiation at the AUG of main uORF-containing transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> shows that the uAUG toeprint binds exactly to each AUG site, confirming the prior experiments. These toeprints show the same Kozak sequence rule. In the case of reinitiation, they must first initiate translation at an uAUG codon. Therefore, when cycloheximide is added to arrest translation elongation before ribosomes can initiate translation, ribosomes should collect at the uAUG codon but not at the downstream AUG. However, in the case of leaky scanning, they will load at the downstream start codon without prior translation of an uORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Therefore, whether Cyh is added to the translation reaction prior to initiation or under steady-state conditions, ribosomes will stall at both the uAUG and main AUG codons.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide evidence that mouse MOR expression is inhibited at the translational level by the presence of uORFs. Mainly, the uAUG#3 in the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the MOR mRNA functions efficiently as a translation initiation site. However, all three uAUGs synergistically regulate translation of the main AUG. The MOR uORF uses a mechanism independent of peptide sequence, and translational repression of MOR uORF is not dependent on the intercistronic region. Furthermore, leaky scanning is involved in inhibition of physiological AUG-initiated MOR translation, resulting in weak expression of MOR under normal conditions. These uORFs have the potential to exert a major impact on MOR gene expression, and some, but not all, serve as important regulatory elements under normal conditions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Research Grants DA000564, DA001583, DA011806, K05-DA070554, DA011190, DA013926, and by the A&#x00026;F Stark Fund of the Minnesota Medical Foundation.

Control samples of RNA in reaction mixtures without extract (-EXT) or reaction mixtures containing extract without mRNA (-RNA) are indicated. The positions of the cDNA extension products corresponding to the mRNA 5&#x02032; end, uORF initiation (open triangles, asterisks) and LUC initiation codon (filled triangle) by radiolabeled mToe2 primer are indicated. During leaky scanning, ribosomes scan and load at either the upstream or downstream start codons. Adding cycloheximide at T0 traps ribosomes at the positions where they first load on the mRNA. Adding it during steady-state translation (T5) traps ribosomes where they are loaded, following the primary initiation event and subsequent reinitiation events.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm034f8"/></fig></sec></back></article>
