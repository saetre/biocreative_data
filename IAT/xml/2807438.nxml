Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) could serve as a critical signaling molecule regulating tumor development. This study has examined pharmacological modulation of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) entry through store-operated channels (SOC) on cellular expression and production of immune-cell mobilizing chemokines in ATP-stimulated C6 glioma cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Calcium spectrofluorometry was carried out to measure mobilization of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i following ATP stimulation of rat C6 glioma cells. Pretreatment with two inhibitors of SOC, SKF96365 or gadolinium, was used to examine for effects on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. RT-PCR was performed to determine effects of purinergic stimulation on C6 cell expression of metabotropic P2Y receptors (P2YR) and the chemokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). ELISA was carried out to measure production of MCP-1 and IL-8 with ATP stimulation of glioma cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Application of ATP (at 100 &#x003bc;M) to C6 glioma induced an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i with the response exhibiting two components of decay. In the presence of the SOC inhibitors, SKF96365 or gadolinium, or with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution, ATP responses lacked a slow phase suggesting the secondary component was due to SOC-mediated influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. RT-PCR confirmed expression of purinergic P2Y-subtype receptors in C6 cells which would serve as a precursor to activation of SOC. In addition, ATP-stimulated C6 cells showed enhanced expression of the chemokines, MCP-1 and IL-8, with SKF96365 or gadolinium effective in reducing chemokine expression. Gadolinium treatment of ATP-stimulated C6 cells was also found to inhibit the production of MCP-1 and IL-8.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>entry, mediated by activation of SOC in C6 glioma, as a mechanism leading to increased cellular expression and release of chemokines. Elevated levels of MCP-1 and IL-8 are predicted to enhance the mobility of tumor cells and promote recruitment of microglia into developing tumors thereby supporting tumor growth.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Gliomas are a common form of human brain tumor but remain essentially incurable due to their innate characteristic of extreme invasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The development and progression of gliomas include reciprocal interactions between glioma cells with resident immune responding microglia and tumor-associated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In particular, evidence suggests that tumor cells may produce mobilizing factors for microglia/macrophages and that chemokine responses of microglia could aid in establishing immunosuppressive environments facilitating tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Among the most prominent glioma chemokine factors are monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) which could induce recruitment of microglia/macrophage to help support tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, MCP-1 has been shown to directly induce angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] while both chemokines also act as autocrine factors to drive the invasive phenotypes of the gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>A spectrum of stimulatory signals is likely present in developing gliomas which activate microglial chemotactic responses and promote an overall immunosuppressive microenvironment. In particular, purinergic signaling pathways in glioma may be highly relevant in enhancement of chemotactic factors to recruit microglia to help sustain tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Glioma cells both release and respond to ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] with catabolism of ATP extremely low in glioma cells, compared to astrocytes, due to a marked reduction in expression and activity of enzymes that degrade ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Importantly, depletion of ATP has been reported to reduce the size and invasive characteristics of tumors in an animal glioma model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Evidence suggests that mobilization of intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i), mediated by activation of the purinergic subtype receptor, P2X<sub>7</sub>R by the ligand 2',3'-(benzoyl-4-benzoyl)-ATP (BzATP), serves as a link between ATP stimulation of glioma and cellular expression of chemokine and cytokine factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, roles of other purinergic family members were also suggested since antagonism of P2X<sub>7</sub>R had no effect to inhibit factor expression and only partially suppressed calcium responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In particular, it was speculated that subtype P2YR could also be activated by BzATP thereby increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i by a rapid release from endoplasmic stores followed by a subsequent sustained influx of the ion through store-operated channels (SOC). These findings suggested the relevance of study using the endogenous compound ATP as an activator of C6 cells to determine effects of pharmacological modulation of SOC-mediated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>entry on cellular production of chemokines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>All chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St.Louise, MO) unless otherwise stated.

The medium was then supplemented with 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml fungizone (Invitrogen: GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) and 0.02 mg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen: GIBCO).

Cells were then washed with PSS solution containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). In some experiments, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS was used; this solution had the same composition as PSS with the exception that EGTA was added (at 1 mM) with no CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber mounted on an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and fluorescence was measured through a 40&#x000d7; quartz objective lens. Alternating wavelengths (340/380 nm) of ultraviolet light were applied at 6-s intervals for excitation and fluorescence signals were measured at 510 nm of emission light. Signals were acquired from a digital camera (DVC-1310, DVC Co. Austin, TX) and were processed using an imaging system (Empix, Mississauga, ON, Canada) to determine ratios of the 340 and 380 nm intensities which were used as quantitative measures of fluorescence levels in this work.</p></sec><sec><title>Semiquantitative RT-PCR</title><p>C6 glioma cells (8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well) were plated in serum-free media and the experiment was carried out the following day with addition of ATP (100 &#x003bc;M) in the absence or presence of SKF96365 (25 &#x003bc;M) or gadolinium (1 &#x003bc;M) for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen: GIBCO) and then processed for the first strand complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis using Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen: GIBCO). The cDNA products were then amplified by PCR using a GeneAmp thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Specific sense and antisense primers with the expected product sizes are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 6 min followed by a 25- to 35- cycle amplification program consisting of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 45 s, annealing at 55-60&#x000b0;C for 1 min and extention at 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min. A final extention was carried out at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. For P2YR expression study, the PCR cycle was set at 35 cycles for all subtype receptors. Amplification of the constitutively expressed enzyme D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a reaction standard. The amplified PCR products were identified using 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (final concentration 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) and visualized under ultraviolet light.

Our findings lead to the novel suggestion that ATP binding to a metabotropic P2YR, coupled to activation of SOC, as an underlying mechanism for chemokine production in tumor cells. As discussed below, these findings are distinct from previous work reporting increased levels of these chemokines mediated by activation of the ionotropic P2X<sub>7</sub>R with the ligand, BzATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Calcium-sensitive spectrofluorometry showed ATP-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i consisted of two components of response decay with the rapid and slow phases representing respective store release and plasmalemmal entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Unstimulated C6 glioma showed a prominent band intensity for P2Y<sub>2</sub>R with a relatively lower basal expression for the other P2YR. The expression for any of the subtype P2YR was not altered with exposure of C6 cells to ATP (4 h treatment). Interestingly, longer-term exposure (48 h) of C6 glioma to ATP had no appreciable effect to alter mRNA expression for any of the P2YR (data not shown). Although our results show prominent expression of P2Y<sub>2</sub>R in glioma, future studies on protein levels and use of specific purinergic agonists and antagonists will have utility in linking specific P2YR with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent responses. It is noteworthy that P2Y subtype receptors exhibit differential activation with purines with P2Y<sub>1</sub>R and P2Y<sub>6</sub>R more sensitive to ADP while P2Y<sub>2</sub>R and P2Y<sub>4</sub>R are more sensitive to ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>ATP stimulation of C6 glioma (4 h exposure) enhanced expression of the potent microglial-mobilizing chemokines, MCP-1 and IL-8. Expression of both chemokines were significantly reduced with SKF96365 or gadolinium included with the ATP stimulation. ELISA assay demonstrated that production of both chemokines was relatively low for ATP stimulation of C6 cells for durations less than 24 h but was enhanced with longer-term (48 h) exposure. In the latter case, levels of MCP-1 and IL-8 were significantly diminished with gadolinium included in the ATP treatment. It is noteworthy that the stimulatory effects of ATP on MCP-1 and IL-8 production were markedly lower compared to other agents releasing chemokines from astrocytic cell types. These agents include the P2X<sub>7</sub>R agonist, BzATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The increased chemokine expression and production was not directly attributable to changes in receptor expression since none of the P2YR showed changes in band intensity with ATP treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It is possible that the high basal levels of subtype P2Y<sub>2</sub>R expression in control would preclude RT-PCR analysis showing any increases in this subtype receptor after exposure of C6 cells to ATP. Gadolinium treatment was demonstrated to significantly reduce levels of MCP-1 and IL-8 in ATP-stimulated C6 cells. However, the inclusion of gadolinium with ATP did not diminish chemokine productions to control levels. Although P2X<sub>7</sub>R could contribute, this possibility is unlikely since ATP levels near 1 mM are generally required for activation of this receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Our results do not exclude involvement of other P2XR since it is known that subtype receptors from the P2X family mediate influx of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>into stimulated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Together with previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], C6 glioma cells are shown to express at least two different purinergic-dependent Ca<sup>2+ </sup>entry pathways which modulate cellular releases of the chemokines, MCP-1 and IL-8. Activation of SOC subsequent to ATP binding to a P2YR or activation of P2X<sub>7</sub>R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] with BzATP (ATP was not studied as an agonist) is coupled to C6 chemokine production. The overall results suggest that in C6 glioma, two different calcium influx pathways converge with the same functional endpoint of enhanced chemokine release. The effects of SOC inhibitors on rapid Ca<sup>2+ </sup>responses and on longer-term cell functional responses indicates the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent transcription factors in mediating tumor cell production of chemokines. One possibility is that release of chemokines such as MCP-1 and IL-8 from C6 are modulated by SOC activation with physiological ATP concentrations whereas the purinergic P2X<sub>7</sub>R pathway only contributes under extremely elevated levels of ATP.</p><p>Our findings suggest that pharmacological antagonism of SOC could serve as a rationale strategy to inhibit tumor growth. The SOC-dependent secretion of MCP-1 and IL-8 from C6 glioma would increase tumor cell mobility and also act as mobilization and proliferation signals to direct resident microglia into expanding tumors. It has been pointed out that recruitment of microglia could aid in supporting an immunosuppressive tumor environment to counter effects of T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, recent findings also indicate that under certain conditions activated microglia/macrophages are capable of killing glioma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, it seems likely that microglia/macrophages could play both pro- or anti-neoplastic roles depending on the signaling factors present in the tumor microenvironment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>entry, mediated by activation of SOC in C6 glioma, as a mechanism linked to the cellular expression and release of chemokines. Increased levels of MCP-1 and IL-8 are predicted to enhance the mobility of tumor cells and promote recruitment of microglia into developing tumors thereby supporting tumor growth. Pharmacological inhibition of SOC in astroglioma is suggested as a novel treatment strategy to inhibit tumor progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NJ designed research, performed research, analyzed data, and wrote the manuscript.
