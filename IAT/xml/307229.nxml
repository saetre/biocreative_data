Such mutants, which we have named hydroxyurea sensitive (hys), defined four linkage groups and we characterized the hys2 mutation in this study. The hys2-1 mutant displays temperature sensitive growth and a constellation of phenotypes indicating defective DNA metabolism. At the restrictive temperature, hys2-1 cells arrest as large budded cells with a single nucleus at the neck of the bud and a short spindle. The hys2-1 mutant exhibits increased rates of chromosome loss and recombination. Additionally, hys2-1 appears to accumulate incompletely replicated DNA that can be detected by a pulse field electrophoresis assay. Finally, deletion of RAD9 in a hys2-1 strain decreases the percentage of arrested cells, suggesting that an intact RAD9-checkpoint is required for the cell cycle arrest in hys2-1 cells. HYS2 encodes a 55 kDa protein that is essential for viability at all temperatures. Taken together, these data suggest that Hys2 plays a role in DNA replication.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0144-a" xlink:role="3496"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0145-a" xlink:role="3497"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0147-a" xlink:role="3499"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3493"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3494"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3495"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3496"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3497"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3498"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3499"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3500"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
