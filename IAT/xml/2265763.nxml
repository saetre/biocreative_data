In the US, 1 in 3 adults is now obese; in the mid-1970s it was only 1 in 7. Similarly, the proportion of overweight children has risen from 1 in 20 to 1 in 5. An adult is considered to be overweight if their body mass index (BMI)&#x02014;their weight in kilograms divided by their height in meters squared&#x02014;is between 25 and 30, and obese if it is more than 30. For children, the healthy BMI depends on their age and gender. Compared to people with a healthy weight (a BMI between 18.5 and 25), overweight or obese individuals have an increased lifetime risk of developing diabetes and other adverse health conditions, sometimes becoming ill while they are still young. People become unhealthily fat when they consume food and drink that contains more energy than they need for their daily activities. It should, therefore, be possible to avoid becoming obese by having a healthy diet and exercising regularly.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Some researchers think that &#x0201c;developmental overnutrition&#x0201d; may have caused the recent increase in waistline measurements. In other words, if a mother is overweight during pregnancy, high sugar and fat levels in her body might permanently affect her growing baby's appetite control and metabolism, and so her offspring might be at risk of becoming obese in later life. If this hypothesis is true, each generation will tend to be fatter than the previous one and it will be very hard to halt the obesity epidemic simply by encouraging people to eat less and exercise more. In this study, the researchers have used two approaches to test the developmental overnutrition hypothesis. First, they have asked whether offspring fat mass is more strongly related to maternal BMI than to paternal BMI; it should be if the hypothesis is true. Second, they have asked whether a genetic indicator of maternal fatness&#x02014;the &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; variant of the <italic>FTO</italic> gene&#x02014;is related to offspring fat mass. A statistical association between maternal <italic>FTO</italic> genotype (genetic make-up) and offspring fat mass would support the developmental nutrition hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>In 1991&#x02013;1992, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) enrolled about 14,000 pregnant women and now examines their offspring at regular intervals. The researchers first used statistical methods to look for associations between the self-reported prepregnancy BMI of the parents of about 4,000 children and the children's fat mass at ages 9&#x02013;11 years measured using a technique called dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Both maternal and paternal BMI were positively associated with offspring fat mass (that is, fatter parents had fatter children) but the effect of maternal BMI was greater than the effect of paternal BMI. When the researchers examined maternal <italic>FTO</italic> genotypes and offspring fat mass (after allowing for the offspring's <italic>FTO</italic> genotype, which would directly affect their fat mass), there was no statistical evidence to suggest that differences in offspring fat mass were related to the maternal <italic>FTO</italic> genotype.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Although the findings from first approach provide some support for the development overnutrition hypothesis, the effect of maternal BMI on offspring fat mass is too weak to explain the recent obesity epidemic. Developmental overnutrition could, however, be responsible for the much slower increase in obesity that began a century ago. The findings from the second approach provide no support for the developmental overnutrition hypothesis, although these results have wide error margins and need confirming in a larger study. The researchers also note that the effects of developmental overnutrition on offspring fat mass, although weak at age 9&#x02013;11, might become more important at later ages. Nevertheless, for now, it seems unlikely that developmental overnutrition has been a major driver of the recent obesity epidemic. Interventions that aim to improve people's diet and to increase their physical activity levels could therefore slow or even halt the epidemic.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050033">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050033</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>See a related <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050065">Perspective article</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus encyclopedia has a page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007297.htm">obesity</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/index.htm">all aspects of obesity</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service's health Web site (NHS Direct) provides information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=265&#x00026;sectionId=1">obesity</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iotf.org/">International Obesity Taskforce</ext-link> provides information about preventing obesity and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iotf.org/childhoodobesity.asp">childhood obesity</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthissues/obesity/">UK Foods Standards Agency</ext-link>, the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mypyramid.gov/">United States Department of Agriculture</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shapingamericashealth.org/">Shaping America's Health</ext-link> all provide useful advice about healthy eating for adults and children</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alspac.bristol.ac.uk/">ALSPAC</ext-link> Web site provides information about the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and its results so far</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Lawlor DA, Timpson NJ, Harbord RM, Leary S, Ness A, et al.

We extend this earlier work here by comparing the associations of maternal and paternal BMI with fat mass assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan in the ALSPAC cohort and by using a genetic variant as an instrumental variable for maternal adiposity.</p><p>Common genetic variants that are robustly associated with a modifiable (non-genetic) risk factor can be used to determine the causal effect of this modifiable risk factor on disease risk &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is essential in this approach to adjust for offspring genotype because the association we are interested in is whether greater maternal adiposity during developmental periods is associated with programming of obesity in her offspring (rather than the association of maternal genotype with offspring adiposity per se). Maternal genotype in this approach is simply used as an unconfounded and unbiased instrument for her adiposity. It would not, however, be a valid instrument if we did not adjust for offspring genotype, since an obvious explanation for an association of maternal genotype with offspring genotype would be that the offspring has inherited their mothers' adiposity-related genotype, and that the association is not due to developmental overnutrition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050033-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Maternal parity and the child's sex were obtained from the obstetric records. Mothers were asked about their smoking throughout pregnancy, and these data were used to generate a categorical variable: never smoked prior to or during pregnancy; smoked before or in early pregnancy only (reported not smoking in second and third trimesters); and smoked throughout pregnancy (reported smoking in second and/or third trimester).

The association of maternal BMI with offspring fat mass was stronger than the association of paternal BMI with offspring fat mass, even in sensitivity analyses that take account of plausible levels of non-paternity. These findings suggest that at least a part of the maternal BMI&#x02013;offspring fat mass association is related to factors that are specific to the mother. A plausible maternal specific effect is overnutrition during key developmental periods (intrauterine and during breast-feeding), and hence the findings of this part of the study are supportive of the developmental overnutrition hypothesis.</p><p>The maternal&#x02013;paternal difference is small. Assuming no non-paternity in this sample, and that the parental differences are completely explained by development overnutrition, our findings would suggest that the offspring of mothers who have a pregnancy BMI greater by 1 SD than other mothers will have on average 0.11 SD greater fat mass at ages 9 to 11 y as a result of developmental overnutrition. If we accept that there might be non-paternity of up to 10&#x00025;, then this reduces to 0.08 SD. Effects of this magnitude would account for only a very small proportion of the obesity epidemic. For example, among United Kingdom children aged 11&#x02013;16 y, BMI increased by 0.47 SD in males and 0.53 SD in females between 1987 and 1997 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, five times the difference we note here between maternal&#x02013;offspring and paternal&#x02013;offspring associations. Effects of this magnitude across many generations could result in a slow and steady increase in population levels of obesity, something that might have been occurring from the early part of the 20th century &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the recent obesity epidemic has taken the shape of a major increase in mean BMI and obesity prevalence over a period of 10&#x02013;15 y (as described above). This time period would be the equivalent of one generation, and therefore the weak specific maternal effect is unlikely to have made a major impact on the obesity epidemic.</p><p>Analyses that used maternal <italic>FTO</italic> genotype as an instrumental variable for maternal BMI and adjusted for offspring genotype did not show an association of maternal BMI with offspring fat mass. Maternal <italic>FTO</italic> (with control for offspring <italic>FTO</italic>) is an unconfounded proxy for maternal adiposity across all of her lifespan, including when she was pregnant and breast-feeding her offspring &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, these findings do not provide strong evidence in favour of the developmental overnutrition hypothesis. Despite the point estimate from these analyses being very close to the null value, the confidence intervals were wide, and statistically these findings were consistent with those of the maternal&#x02013;paternal comparison. Taken together, the findings from our parental comparisons analyses and <italic>FTO</italic> instrumental variable analyses would be consistent with a relatively weak specific effect of greater maternal BMI during pregnancy on offspring adiposity at ages 9&#x02013;11 y.</p><p>The instrumental variable analysis uses the proportion of the variation in maternal BMI that is explained by <italic>FTO</italic> to provide an estimate of causal effect that is not biased by confounding. However, the advantage of this approach being less biased than a conventional multivariable regression analysis comes at the cost of reduced precision (i.e., wide confidence intervals). The imprecision in our instrumental variable analyses highlights the importance of large sample sizes in order to obtain precise estimates of effects in studies that use genotype as an instrumental variable for modifiable non-genetic exposures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. To our knowledge, no other study of larger magnitude than ours has both maternal and offspring genotype and objectively measured fat mass in offspring, and we feel combining both the approach of parental&#x02013;offspring association comparisons and the use of a genetic variant known to be associated with adiposity as an instrumental variable for maternal adiposity is a strength of this paper.</p><p>Our genetic results are unlikely to be biased by missing data. This is because substantial empirical evidence demonstrates that selection bias (i.e., associations in those who volunteer to be in a study and/or who remain during follow-up being different from those who do not enter or remain in a study, and hence different from the population that one is making inference about) is very unlikely to affect genetic associations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050033-st002">Table S2</xref>), which shows that genotype distribution does not vary by whether offspring have follow-up DXA scan outcomes or not. For example, in the recently published genome-wide association study from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, all allele frequencies from a control group made up of British blood donors (a group who are known to vary considerably from the general population in terms of non-genetic factors such as socioeconomic position and lifestyle) were the same as those from a control group taken from the British 1958 birth cohort, a general population sample &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Sensitivity analyses that explored the potential bias due to missing data in either sets of analyses suggest that this is minimal (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050033-sd001">Text S1</xref>).</p><p>The developmental overnutrition hypothesis refers to the effect of delivery to the developing fetus (or infant during the early postnatal period) of higher concentrations of glucose and free fatty acids. Levels of these nutrients are likely to be greater in women with greater adiposity, and therefore there is a concern that women with greater amounts of adipose tissue will program their offspring to be more obese &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. However, our findings cannot be used to draw inferences about the specific role of maternal levels of glucose and free fatty acids during the intrauterine period and whilst she is breast-feeding on later offspring adiposity and metabolic health. Maternal gestational diabetes is associated with later offspring obesity and diabetes risk &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b025">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, and there is some evidence of a graded association across maternal distributions of fasting and postload glucose during pregnancy with offspring obesity risk at ages 5&#x02013;7 y &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the question of whether there is a graded causal association between greater delivery of glucose and free fatty acids during development on later obesity requires further exploration using robust study designs.</p><p>The public health importance of the developmental overnutrition hypothesis is that, if it is true, the obesity epidemic could accelerate across generations and continue to do so for some time, even with effective obesity prevention programmes. This is because the female offspring of mothers with greater adiposity during their pregnancy would be programmed to greater adiposity and would enter their own pregnancies with greater adiposity and continue the cycle. In this study, we have examined associations between two generations (mothers and their offspring) only and shown that specific maternal effects appear weak and unlikely to have made a major contribution to the recent obesity epidemic (see above). If a specific maternal effect on offspring adiposity of &#x0223c;0.1 SD per maternal SD adiposity were replicated across many generations, this effect could make a contribution to a slow and steady increase in obesity over many decades. Of importance, it is unclear at what time in the life course developmental overnutrition will have its maximum effect. In other examples of developmental origins epidemiology, there is evidence that associations amplify with increasing age. For example, a recent large study demonstrated amplification of the association between birth weight and blood pressure with increasing age &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. We have only been able to measure offspring outcomes at mean age 9&#x02013;11 y here, but have plans to continue to measure fat and lean mass as the offspring enter adulthood. If any specific maternal affect increases with the increasing age of her offspring, such that it was particularly strong when the female offspring were themselves in their reproductive years, then developmental overnutrition could have made an important contribution to the obesity epidemic. This suggestion requires further study in older offspring. Finally, our findings cannot exclude an association between greater maternal weight gain during pregnancy and increased adiposity in later life in her offspring.</p><p>A stronger effect of greater maternal adiposity than paternal adiposity on offspring fat mass could reflect the greater role of mothers in childhood nutrition and feeding habits, rather than a developmental origins effect. Whilst this is a possibility, surprisingly few studies have examined differences in maternal&#x02013;offspring and paternal&#x02013;offspring behaviours. In a study using data form the Norwegian National Health Survey, both maternal and paternal dietary fat intake were strongly associated with offspring dietary fat intake, but the magnitude of association was the same for mothers and fathers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. By contrast, the mother's level of exercise had a much weaker effect on offspring's exercise levels (whatever the sex of the offspring) than did the father's exercise levels in that study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, in a recent study of Australian families, the fathers' exercise levels had a stronger effect on both their sons' and daughters' exercise levels and objective measures of cardio-respiratory fitness than did the mothers' exercise levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, there does not appear to be strong evidence in the literature that mothers have a stronger effect on offspring diet and physical activity (behaviours that would affect offspring fat mass) than do fathers.</p><p>At this stage, the exact mechanisms by which <italic>FTO</italic> results in increased BMI are not known. Consequently, we cannot discount it having an effect via dietary and physical activity behaviours. If the effect of <italic>FTO</italic> on adiposity was via increased dietary intake or lower physical activity levels, and maternal behaviours such as diet and activity were more strongly influential on such behaviours in offspring, then we would anticipate an association of maternal <italic>FTO</italic>, adjusted for offspring <italic>FTO</italic>, with offspring fat mass (one mediated via maternal behaviour rather than developmental overnutrition), but we do not see such an association in this study.</p><p>One could conceive that even with a gene that predisposes to greater adiposity, social pressures to be thinner might mean that any effect is compensated for by lifestyle modification, which would then prevent its use as an instrumental variable for adiposity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. This possibility is easily tested by demonstrating a robust association between the genetic variant (or other instrumental variable) and the intermediate of interest &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In the case of <italic>FTO,</italic> its robust association with BMI and fat mass, including in this study, has been demonstrated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, in separate work we have demonstrated that <italic>FTO</italic> is associated with insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, and hyptertension to the extent that one would predict from observational studies of the association of BMI with these outcomes and of randomised trials of weight change interventions with these outcomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. If <italic>FTO</italic> were not a valid instrument of adiposity, one would not expect such accurate prediction of the causal effect of adiposity on outcomes that are widely accepted as being causally related to greater adiposity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Since the mechanisms by which <italic>FTO</italic> is related to greater adiposity are currently unknown, it is possible that pleiotropy could explain our null instrumental variables finding. To do so, maternal <italic>FTO</italic> would have to affect other pathways in such a way that these pathways counterbalance the hypothesised positive effect of maternal BMI on offspring fat mass. Maternal imprinting could also theoretically bias <italic>FTO</italic> as a valid instrumental variable for maternal adiposity. However, since none of the known imprinted human genes are on Chromosome 16 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050033-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, where <italic>FTO</italic> is located, this is very unlikely. Population stratification is unlikely in this sample because the participants, on the basis of self-reported place of birth and parental and grandparental places of birth, are largely ancestrally homogeneous (of European origin).</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that any specific effect of maternal greater BMI during offspring development on offspring fat mass at ages 9&#x02013;11 y is at most weak and unlikely to be a major driver of the recent obesity epidemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material
