The 5&#x02032; untranslated region (5&#x02032;UTR) of human L1 (L1Hs) houses a poorly understood internal promoter. Here we report that mutations at a putative runt-domain transcription factor (RUNX) site (&#x0002b;83 to &#x0002b;101) in the 5&#x02032;UTR decreased L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition in cell culture-based assays. Exogenous expression of RUNX3, but not the other two RUNX family members, RUNX1 and RUNX2, increased L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition, which were otherwise decreased by siRNAs targeting RUNX3 and a dominant negative RUNX. Further more, the specific interaction between RUNX3 and its binding site was demonstrated by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using an anti-RUNX3 antibody. Interestingly, RUNX3 may also regulate the antisense promoter activity of L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTR via another putative RUNX site (&#x0002b;526 to &#x0002b;508), as revealed by site-directed mutations and exogenous expression of RUNX factors. Our results indicate an important role for RUNX3 in L1Hs retrotransposition as well as transcription from its 5&#x02032;UTR in both sense and antisense directions, and they should contribute to our understanding of the mechanism underlying L1Hs retrotransposition and its impact on the expression of adjacent cellular genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>LINE-1s (<underline>l</underline>ong <underline>i</underline>nterspersed <underline>n</underline>uclear <underline>e</underline>lements-1) or L1s are highly abundant retrotransposons comprising 17&#x00025; of the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c2">2</xref>). Although most human L1s (L1Hs) are retrotransposition-defective due to 5&#x02032; truncation, internal rearrangement or mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c3">3</xref>), 80&#x02013;100 L1Hs are potentially retrotransposition-competent in the diploid genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c4">4</xref>). A full-length L1Hs is &#x0223c;6 kb and contains a 5&#x02032; untranslated region (5&#x02032;UTR), two non-overlapping open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) and a 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c6">6</xref>). The original retrotransposon is transcribed into RNA and exported to the cytoplasm, where ORF1 and ORF2 proteins are translated and a ribonucleoprotein particle that includes L1 RNA, ORF1p and possibly ORF2p is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c8">8</xref>). ORF1 encodes a 40 kDa protein with RNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c9">9</xref>); ORF2 encodes a protein with endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c10">10</xref>) and reverse transcriptase (RT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c11">11</xref>) activities. Both ORF1p and ORF2p are required for retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c12">12</xref>). L1s integrate into the genome by target primed reverse transcription using the free 3&#x02032;-OH at the endonuclease cut site as a primer and the L1 RNA as a template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c13">13</xref>). The integrated L1 is generally flanked by perfect 7&#x02013;20 bp target site duplications. L1 retrotransposons continuously shape the human genome by insertion, non-homologous recombination, transduction of 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c15">15</xref>) and mobilization of other transposable elements, such as <italic>Alu</italic> elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c16">16</xref>), processed pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c17">17</xref>) and SVA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c5">5</xref>).</p><p>The 5&#x02032;UTR of L1Hs houses an internal promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c19">19</xref>). Transcription of L1Hs is initiated at the &#x0002b;1 nt and is proposed as the rate-limiting step in the process of L1Hs retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c20">20</xref>). Deletion analysis revealed that the first 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c18">18</xref>) or 155 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c19">19</xref>) contains <italic>cis</italic>-elements critical for L1Hs transcription, which are likely regulated by transcription factors because the 5&#x02032;UTR contains binding sites for certain cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c21">21</xref>). For example, a perfect Yin Yang-1 (YY-1) core binding sequence lies between &#x0002b;13 and &#x0002b;21, and several groups have demonstrated binding of YY-1 to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c22">22</xref>). YY-1 may serve to position the transcription initiation complex rather than to regulate the transcription level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c23">23</xref>). Also, SOX family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c24">24</xref>) and steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c25">25</xref>) have been found to influence L1Hs promoter activity. Finally, L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition are repressed by methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c26">26</xref>). Most interestingly, an antisense promoter (ASP) has been identified at &#x0002b;400 to &#x0002b;600 that drives transcription of adjacent cellular genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c28">28</xref>). However, the regulation of L1Hs transcription, especially its relationship with retrotransposition, is still poorly understood.</p><p>The RUNX (runt-domain transcription factor) family contains heterodimeric transcription factors composed of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c29">29</xref>). The &#x003b1; subunit is a homolog of the product of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> segmentation gene, <italic>runt</italic>, and contains a conserved 128-amino acid region, the runt homology domain, which is required for DNA binding and heterodimerization with the &#x003b2; subunit. The &#x003b2; subunit fails to bind DNA on its own but increases the affinity of the RUNX factors for DNA binding. Only one mammalian gene encoding the &#x003b2; subunit is known; however, three mammalian &#x003b1; subunit genes have been identified: RUNX1&#x0002f;&#x0002f;PEBP2&#x003b1;B&#x0002f;CBFA2&#x0002f;AML1, RUNX2&#x0002f;PEBP2&#x003b1;A&#x0002f;CBFA1&#x0002f;AML3 and RUNX3&#x0002f;PEBP2&#x003b1;C&#x0002f;CBFA3&#x0002f;AML2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c30">30</xref>). Following the nomenclature recommendation, RUNX terminology is used here. The RUNX factors act on tissue-specific genes whose promoter or enhancer contains the consensus runt-domain core binding sequence TGT&#x0002f;CGGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c31">31</xref>). RUNX1 is essential for definitive hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c34">34</xref>). RUNX2 is essential for osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c35">35</xref>). RUNX3 regulates growth of gastric epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c36">36</xref>), development and survival of TrkC dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c37">37</xref>), as well as axonal projection and path finding of subtypes of DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c39">39</xref>); it is also required for establishment of epigenetic silencing in cytotoxic lineage thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c40">40</xref>) and T cell development during thymopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c41">41</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that mutations of a putative RUNX site dramatically decrease L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition. Exogenous expression of RUNX3, but not RUNX1 or RUNX2, significantly increases L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition, which are otherwise decreased by a dominant negative form of RUNX or siRNAs targeting RUNX3. In addition, we find that RUNX3 may also regulate the ASP activity of L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTR. Our study therefore indicates an important role for RUNX3 in L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa and human osteosarcoma cell line 143B (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in high glucose Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum, 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 100 U&#x0002f;ml penicillin and 0.1 mg&#x0002f;ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a humidified, 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>Mammalian expression plasmids containing the cDNA of human RUNX1 (pEF-Bos-PEBP2&#x003b1;B1), RUNX2 (pEF-Bos-PEBP2&#x003b1;A), RUNX3 (pEF-Bos-PEBP2&#x003b1;C1), the fusion gene of AML1&#x0002f;RUNX1 and Eight-Twenty One oncoprotein (ETO) (pEF-Bos-AML1&#x0002f;ETO) and the control vector pEF-Bos were generously provided by Dr Yoshiaki Ito (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c42">42</xref>).</p><p>To construct luciferase reporter plasmids, 5&#x02032;UTRs of the wild-type L1<sub>RP</sub>, L1.3 or the mutated L1 elements were amplified using Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and inserted upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), in either sense or antisense direction.

To construct the backbone for random mutagenesis of the first half of 5&#x02032;UTR, a PacI site was created at &#x0002b;465 to &#x0002b;472 of L1<sub>RP</sub> to produce pL1<sub>RP</sub>-<italic>PacI</italic>-EGFP(puro) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f1">1</xref>A). Because undesired mutation(s) might also be introduced during the mutagenic process and exert a functional effect, retrotransposition activities of different clones of pL1<sub>RP</sub>-PacI-EGFP(puro) were tested and compared with that of pL1<sub>RP</sub>-EGFP(puro). The assay to test retrotransposition activity is based on an EGFP cassette inserted in the antisense direction in the 3&#x02032;UTR of L1 element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c43">43</xref>). The EGFP gene is driven by the CMV immediate early promoter, followed by the TK poly(A) signal. The EGFP gene is disrupted by a &#x003b3;-globin intron oriented in the sense direction relative to L1 such that it can only be spliced out of L1 RNA but not EGFP RNA. Therefore, only retrotransposition of the tagged L1 element can generate a functional EGFP gene. EGFP-positive cells are then detected by FACS and the percent of fluorescent cells represents the retrotransposition activity of the tagged L1 element. In this study, the pL1<sub>RP</sub>-PacI-EGFP(puro) clone with the closest retrotransposition activity to pL1<sub>RP</sub>-EGFP(puro) was used as the backbone for random mutagenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f1">1</xref>B, left). Similarly, we constructed the backbone for random mutagenesis of the second half of L1<sub>RP</sub> 5&#x02032;UTR by creating an NaeI site at &#x0002b;869 to &#x0002b;874 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f1">1</xref>A and B, right). To facilitate data interpretation, the random mutation frequency was controlled at one to two mutations per 500 bp. Sequencing revealed that most L1 elements obtained from random mutagenesis contained 1&#x02013;2 nt substitutions.</p><p>Among the 50 5&#x02032;UTR-mutated L1 elements tested to date, we found a single-nucleotide mutation (100T&#x0002f;C) that significantly reduced retrotransposition activity to 8&#x00025; of wild-type L1<sub>RP</sub> (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f1">1</xref>C, upper).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutations at the first but not the second or third RUNX site inhibit L1Hs retrotransposition</title><p>Since this single-nucleotide mutation so greatly reduced retrotransposition activity, we hypothesized that it may reside in a critical <italic>cis</italic>-element recognized by a transcription factor. Therefore, we explored potential transcription factor binding sites in L1<sub>RP</sub> 5&#x02032;UTR <italic>in silico</italic> and obtained 94 matches. The 100T&#x0002f;C mutation fell within a potential binding site (&#x0002b;83 to &#x0002b;101) for RUNX factors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f1">1</xref>D). In addition, two other RUNX sites were identified in the L1<sub>RP</sub> 5&#x02032;UTR, one at &#x0002b;389 to &#x0002b;407 and the other at &#x0002b;526 to &#x0002b;508. Interestingly, the first two RUNX sites were on the sense strand, whereas the third was on the antisense strand. We further aligned the 5&#x02032;UTRs of 20 L1Hs with known retrotransposition activity. The three RUNX sites were completely conserved in all 20 elements (data not shown). When we re-examined the remaining randomly mutated L1 clones, a second clone was found to contain a single-nucleotide mutation (84G&#x0002f;A) residing within the first RUNX site. This mutation decreased retrotransposition activity to 85&#x00025; of wild-type L1<sub>RP</sub> (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.029, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f1">1</xref>C, bottom).</p><p>To further study the potential RUNX sites, we created additional nucleotide mutations at those sites. Altogether, single-nucleotide mutations, 89T&#x0002f;A, 96G&#x0002f;T and 97A&#x0002f;T, as well as 3-nt mutations, 94&#x02013;96CTG&#x0002f;AGT and 98&#x02013;100GGT&#x0002f;TTC, were made at the first RUNX site; 403A&#x0002f;T and 406T&#x0002f;C mutations were made at the second site; and 509T&#x0002f;C and 512T&#x0002f;A mutations were made at the third site. We found that all mutations at the first RUNX site reduced L1Hs retrotransposition activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f2">2</xref>A). However, mutations at the second and third RUNX sites had no significant effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f2">2</xref>B and C), which was not very surprising since both sites were outside the first 100 bp of 5&#x02032;UTR and the core sequence of the second site differed from the consensus sequence by 1 nt.</p></sec><sec><title>The first RUNX site in the 5&#x02032;UTR is critical for L1Hs transcription</title><p>Because members of the RUNX family are transcription regulators and transcription has been proposed as the rate-limiting step in L1Hs retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c20">20</xref>), we examined the promoter activities of wild-type and mutated L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTRs by luciferase reporter assays. We found that the promoter activities of the mutated L1Hs elements agreed well with their corresponding retrotransposition activities, i.e. mutations at the first RUNX site reduced the promoter activity of the L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTR whereas mutations at the second and third RUNX sites had no effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f3">3</xref>A). Similar results were observed in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f3">3</xref>B) except that promoter activities of all the tested 5&#x02032;UTRs were lower than their counterparts tested in 143B cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Exogenous expression of RUNX3 increases L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition</title><p>To provide additional evidence that the RUNX factor(s) indeed regulated L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition and to identify the responsible RUNX factor(s), eukaryotic expression plasmids containing RUNX factors were co-transfected into 143B cells in both the luciferase and retrotransposition assays. We found that the dominant negative form of RUNX (dn-RUNX), a fusion protein of RUNX1 and ETO from a translocation, t(8:21)(22q;22q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c50">50</xref>), significantly decreased the promoter activity of L1<sub>RP</sub> 5&#x02032;UTR by 56&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f4">4</xref>A). Although following transfection all three RUNX factors were expressed at comparable levels as revealed by real-time quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR (data not shown), only RUNX3 significantly increased the promoter activity of L1<sub>RP</sub> 5&#x02032;UTR by 2.1-fold (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001); and this effect could be almost completely abolished by the 100T&#x0002f;C mutation at the first RUNX site. To investigate the effects of RUNX factors <italic>in vivo</italic>, the L1Hs retrotransposition activity was tested in the presence of exogenous expression of different RUNX factors. In agreement with the results of the luciferase reporter assay, dn-RUNX significantly decreased L1 retrotransposition by 70&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f4">4</xref>B). RUNX3 increased the L1Hs retrotransposition activity by 15&#x00025;. However, L1Hs retrotransposition remained nearly abolished by the 100T&#x0002f;C mutation in the presence of RUNX3, suggesting the specific interaction between RUNX3 and this site. Surprisingly, RUNX1 and RUNX2 decreased L1Hs retrotransposition activity. When we repeated this retrotransposition experiment in HeLa cells, we obtained very similar results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f4">4</xref>C). However, the effects of RUNX3 and dn-RUNX were greatly magnified; RUNX3 increased retrotransposition activity by 70&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.025) and dn-RUNX decreased it by 87&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.010). On the other hand, RUNX1 and RUNX2 had no significant effect.</p></sec><sec><title>RNAi of RUNX3 decreases L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition</title><p>To further confirm that RUNX3 did play an important role in L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition, we employed vector-based RNAi of RUNX3 using two siRNA sequences targeting different locations of RUNX3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f5">5</xref>A). In 143B cells, both RNAi constructs decreased RUNX3 mRNA level by &#x0223c;50&#x00025; as revealed by real-time quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.035 and &#x0003c;0.001, respectively, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f5">5</xref>B).

We then carried out a super-shift EMSA using rabbit anti-human RUNX3 antibody, and thereby demonstrated a specific interaction of RUNX3 with this site. A super-shifted band was observed when anti-RUNX3 antibody was present (lane 7), but this band was absent when normal rabbit IgG was used (lane 8).</p></sec><sec><title>RUNX3 regulates the ASP activity of L1Hs</title><p>An ASP activity that drives transcription of polII genes 5&#x02032; of L1Hs has been reported within &#x0002b;400 to &#x0002b;600 of the L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c28">28</xref>). Since the third potential RUNX site fell within this region, we investigated whether it regulated transcription activated by the ASP. Wild-type or L1<sub>RP</sub> 5&#x02032;UTRs mutated at the third RUNX site were inserted upstream of the luciferase gene in the antisense direction and the luciferase reporter assay was performed. Interestingly, the single-nucleotide mutations, 509T&#x0002f;C and 512T&#x0002f;A, which failed to have an effect in the sense direction, reduced ASP activity of the L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTR (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.061 and 0.002, respectively, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f7">7</xref>A).

This latter effect of RUNX3 could be reduced by mutations at this site (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.049 and 0.045, respectively). Again, RUNX1 and RUNX2 had no effect on the ASP activity.</p></sec><sec><title>RUNX3 mRNA is expressed in many human tissues and certain cell lines</title><p>Since the above data indicated that RUNX3 was an important regulator of L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition, we studied its expression pattern in cell lines and human tissues. To examine whether full-length RUNX3 mRNA was indeed produced in 143B and HeLa cells, we performed RT&#x02013;PCR as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c36">36</xref>) with primer pairs covering the N- and C-terminal regions of RUNX3, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f8">8</xref>A). Due to the high-GC content in the N-terminal region of RUNX3, we used a nested PCR strategy to amplify the product efficiently. We found that full-length RUNX3 mRNA was present in both 143B and HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f8">8</xref>B). To better quantify RUNX3 expression, we performed real-time quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR using a pair of primers specific for human RUNX3, and found that RUNX3 was expressed at a much greater level in 143B cells than in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f8">8</xref>C), which may partially account for the higher L1Hs retrotransposition efficiency in 143B cells. RUNX3 was also expressed in all the human tissues tested (prostate, small intestine, colon, testis, ovary, thymus, spleen and peripheral lymphocyte), with the highest level in lymphoid tissues including peripheral lymphocyte, spleen and thymus. The RUNX3 level was also relatively high in testis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here we report several lines of evidence indicating that the transcription factor, RUNX3, plays an important role in L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition. Mutations at the first RUNX site on the L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTR significantly decreased protein interaction, transcription and retrotransposition. More importantly, exogenous expression of RUNX3 increased L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition, which were otherwise significantly decreased by RNAi targets against RUNX3 or dominant negative RUNX.</p><p>We used a luciferase reporter assay to demonstrate the regulatory role of RUNX3 in L1Hs transcription. In addition, we found that: (i) the promoter activity of L1<sub>RP</sub> 5&#x02032;UTR was comparable with that of the SV40 promoter contained in pGL3-Control plasmid (Promega, data not shown), indicating that L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTR harbors a very strong promoter activity; (ii) the promoter activity of L1<sub>RP</sub> 5&#x02032;UTR was greater than that of L1.3 in both 143B and HeLa cells, which may partly explain the different retrotransposition activity of these two L1Hs elements; and (iii) transcription and retrotransposition of individual L1Hs were greater in 143B than in HeLa cells, which may partly result from the differential activation of the L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTR in these two cell lines.</p><p>In the retrotransposition assay, exogenous expression of RUNX3 increased the L1Hs retrotransposition activity in 143B cells, but only by 15&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.104, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f4">4</xref>B). This modest increase was probably due to a saturation effect of the endogenous RUNX3 that was highly expressed in this cell line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f8">8</xref>C). In fact, a significant effect of exogenous RUNX3 expression was observed in HeLa cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.025, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f4">4</xref>C), which express RUNX3 at much lower levels. It is also noteworthy that RUNX3 has only moderate transactivator activity on its own and stronger transactivation may require cooperation of other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c51">51</xref>). It is interesting to note that only one member of the RUNX family, RUNX3, played a regulatory role on L1Hs transcription and retrotransposition, and it is the most ancient of the three genes and represents the evolutionary founder of the mammalian RUNX family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c52">52</xref>). However, exogenous expression of RUNX1 and RUNX2 also decreased L1Hs retrotransposition in 143B cells, although not in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f4">4</xref>B and C). Therefore, a suppressive role for RUNX1 and&#x0002f;or RUNX2 in a step after L1Hs transcription cannot be excluded. Indeed, study of the specific role of each RUNX factor in a cellular background lacking the other RUNX factors would be useful.</p><p>Using real-time quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR, we found that 143B cells expressed a much higher level of RUNX3 than HeLa cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg663f8">8</xref>C), which may partially explain why 143B cells were particularly supportive of L1Hs retrotransposition. Although RUNX3 was expressed in all the tissues tested in our study, its expression has been reported to be mainly confined to hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c44">44</xref>); therefore, detection of RUNX3 in tissues such as colon and small intestine may be due to lymphocyte contamination. It is noteworthy that there was comparatively high RUNX3 expression in testis, and L1Hs retrotransposition has only been reported in transformed cells and germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c5">5</xref>). However, RUNX3 expression was unexpectedly low in adult ovary. Since L1Hs is actively transcribed in mouse ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c53">53</xref>) and retrotransposition likely occurs in female germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c54">54</xref>), RUNX3 expression needs to be analyzed in fetal ovary. Recently, L1Hs has been successfully used to create a transgenic mouse model to study retrotransposition <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c53">53</xref>). Since RUNX factors are very well conserved in eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c29">29</xref>), murine RUNX3 may facilitate retrotransposition of L1Hs in mouse germ cells. However, there are no obvious RUNX sites in the 5&#x02032;UTR of the most active mouse L1 subfamily, T<sub>F</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c55">55</xref>) (data not shown). This suggests that the role of RUNX3 in L1 retrotransposition may be limited to certain species, such as humans.</p><p>Although the third RUNX site had no effect on L1Hs transcription in the sense direction, it resided in the region that possesses ASP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c27">27</xref>). Therefore, we explored its potential regulation on the ASP activity of L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTR. We found that the ASP activity of L1<sub>RP</sub> 5&#x02032;UTR was 5&#x02013;10-fold greater than background (cells transfected with promoterless pGL3-Basic vector, data not shown), which was consistent with Speek&#x02019;s report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c27">27</xref>); however, the L1<sub>RP</sub> ASP activity was only approximately 1&#x0002f;10&#x02013;1&#x0002f;20 that of the sense promoter activity (data not shown). Binding of transcription factors to the ASP region has been proposed as a mechanism to regulate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c27">27</xref>). Here, we report for the first time a transcription factor, RUNX3, that can regulate the ASP activity of L1Hs 5&#x02032;UTR, and possibly the subsequent expression of adjacent cellular genes in the human genome.</p><p>We employed a random mutagenesis strategy to identify important <italic>cis</italic>-elements for L1Hs retrotransposition. Most of our clones contained one to two mutations dispersed randomly in the mutagenized region, indicating that the method was efficient and successful. Among 50 randomly mutated clones tested to date, 31 had decreased retrotransposition activity by over 10&#x00025; compared with L1<sub>RP</sub> (data not shown), suggesting that the 5&#x02032;UTR indeed played an important role in L1Hs retrotransposition. Therefore, our study demonstrated the viability of a random mutagenesis strategy to study L1 retrotransposons, not only on the 5&#x02032;UTR but also on other regions. In fact, random mutagenesis can provide a large number of L1 elements with readily identified mutations critical for L1 retrotransposition, which are extremely valuable to elucidate the mechanism underlying L1 retrotransposition. Furthermore, random mutagenesis mimics L1 evolution without natural selection, i.e. very active L1 elements that are usually lost due to a deleterious effect on the host are not eliminated in this <italic>in vitro</italic> system. Interestingly, we have found two clones out of 50 analyzed that contained single-nucleotide mutation and retrotransposed at &#x0223c;120&#x00025; of the frequency of L1<sub>RP</sub>. Therefore, random mutagenesis may provide a powerful tool for directed evolution of L1, e.g. to create &#x02018;hyperactive&#x02019; retrotransposons for practical applications.</p><p>In summary, our present study has demonstrated an important role for RUNX3 in L1Hs retrotransposition as well as transcription in both sense and antisense directions. Although many mobile elements have been widely used as genetic tools and even gene therapy delivery vehicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg663c57">57</xref>), the practical applications of L1Hs have been largely impeded by its relatively low and germ line-specific retrotransposition activity. Therefore, the present study should not only contribute to our understanding of the mechanism underlying L1Hs retrotransposition and its impact on the human genome, but may also, through the use of RUNX3 as a retrotransposition activator, facilitate the practical applications of L1Hs, e.g. in insertional mutagenesis and gene therapy.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg663f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Potentially important RUNX sites in the 5&#x02032;UTR for L1Hs retrotransposition.
