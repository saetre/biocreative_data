Prostaglandins biosynthesis depends on the sequential action of upstream cyclooxygenases (COX) and terminal synthases but no PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> synthases (PGFS) were functionally identified in mammalian cells. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the most efficient mammalian PGFS belong to aldo-keto reductase 1B (AKR1B) family. The adrenal gland is a major site of AKR1B expression in both human (AKR1B1) and mouse (AKR1B3, AKR1B7). Thus, we examined the PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> biosynthetic pathway and its functional impact on both cortical and medullary zones. Both compartments produced PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> but expressed different biosynthetic isozymes. In chromaffin cells, PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> secretion appeared constitutive and correlated to continuous expression of COX1 and AKR1B3. In steroidogenic cells, PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> secretion was stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and correlated to ACTH-responsiveness of both COX2 and AKR1B7/B1. The pivotal role of AKR1B7 in ACTH-induced PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> release and functional coupling with COX2 was demonstrated using over- and down-expression in cell lines. PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> receptor was only detected in chromaffin cells, making <italic>medulla</italic> the primary target of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> action. By comparing PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>-responsiveness of isolated cells and whole adrenal cultures, we demonstrated that PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> repressed glucocorticoid secretion by an indirect mechanism involving a decrease in catecholamine release which in turn decreased adrenal steroidogenesis. PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> may be regarded as a negative autocrine/paracrine regulator within a novel intra-adrenal feedback loop. The coordinated cell-specific regulation of COX2 and AKR1B7 ensures the generation of this stress-induced corticostatic signal.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The aldose reductases (AKR1Bs) belong to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily that contains more than 114 proteins expressed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Interestingly, Madore and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-Madore1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> proposed that the bovine 20&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase also known as AKR1B5 had a prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> synthase (PGFS) activity in the endometrium. Furthermore, we have established by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, that this property can be extended to other but not all AKR1B enzymes since AKR1B1, AKR1B3 and AKR1B7 were shown to catalyze the reduction of prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub> (PGH<sub>2</sub>) into PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> whereas AKR1B8 and AKR1B10 recombinant proteins were devoid of such activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-Kabututu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, based on their kinetic parameters, recombinant AKR1B1, AKR1B3 and AKR1B7 display better PGFS activities than the putative PGFS that were previously characterized in mammals.</p><p>Prostaglandins are paracrine/autocrine cell mediators sharing a common precursor, PGH<sub>2</sub>, which is synthesized from free arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenases type 1 (COX1) or type 2 (COX2). COX1 is regarded as a constitutively expressed enzyme. COX2 on the other hand is undetectable in most tissues in basal conditions but can be induced by various mitogenic agents and inflammatory stimuli (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-Ramsay1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>). These different regulations imply that COX1- and COX2-dependent PG productions will be primarily required for housekeeping functions and rapid adaptation to various stimuli, respectively. However, the identity and regulation of downstream enzymes involved in the selective production of each isotype of prostaglandins remain largely unknown. PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> is the main initiator of labour and regression of corpus luteum (luteolysis) in most mammals (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-McCracken1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>). Two of the hallmarks features of luteolysis are the decrease in progesterone synthesis and programmed luteal cell death. PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>-induced inhibition of progesterone biosynthesis is mediated by the PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> receptor (FP receptor) present in luteal cells. Although it has a primary role in reproductive function, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> is produced in living cells and its role in other steroidogenic tissues remain largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-Ueno1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-Fortier1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. AKR1Bs with PGFS activity are highly expressed and for some of them specifically regulated in the adrenal cortex. We thus decided to explore the capacity of the adrenal to produce PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> and to investigate the effect that this production has on the endocrine functions of the gland.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Hormonal regulation and differential expression of AKR1Bs and COX enzymes in adrenal tissue</title><p>We first investigated the effect of modulations of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis on the capacity of mouse adrenal glands to synthesise and respond to PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>. For this, whole adrenal protein extracts were submitted to western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007309-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). As expected, the level of StAR protein (an ACTH-regulated marker of steroidogenic activity) was decreased under dexamethasone-mediated HPA axis blockade (low plasma ACTH) and progressively restored 17 h after the injection of exogenous ACTH. As previously described, the levels of the ACTH-responsive aldose reductase-like AKR1B7 followed the same pattern, confirming the efficiency of the hormonal treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-Ragazzon1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, AKR1B3 and AKR1B8 proteins were unresponsive to any of the treatments and exhibited constitutive expressions. Interestingly, the rate-limiting enzymes of the prostaglandins synthesis pathway, COX1 and COX2, were both expressed in the adrenals but showed very different hormonal sensitivity. COX1 was constitutively expressed. By contrast, COX2 was undetectable in basal condition. It was strongly stimulated, 2 h after ACTH injection. This stimulation was transient, as shown by the reduction of COX2 accumulation 17 h after ACTH administration. In contrast, the PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> receptor FP was constitutively expressed in the adrenal. These data suggest that mouse adrenal glands have the capacity to synthesize PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> in either a constitutive or an ACTH-dependent manner.

As expected, COX2 was only associated with heavy and low membranes fractions in both hormonal conditions and was absent from nuclear extracts or soluble cytosolic fractions. Importantly, the PGF synthases AKR1B7 and AKR1B3 which were previously considered as cytosolic enzymes, colocalized with COX2 in the heavy membranes fraction and to a lesser extent in the light membranes fractions. Whereas AKR1B3 was constitutively present in these two fractions, AKR1B7 was only observed in the presence of forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007309-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

Our present work provides new insight in the understanding of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> biosynthesis and the role of this prostaglandin in the function of the adrenal gland. Indeed, we establish for the first time that PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> acts as a negative regulator of adrenal endocrine functions and that the coordinate cell-specific regulation of both cyclooxygenases (COX1 and COX2) and aldo-keto reductases of the AKR1B subfamily (AKR1B7, AKR1B1, AKR1B3) could play a pivotal role in the generation of this signal.</p><p>Using <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches and murine cell culture models, we have demonstrated that both cortical (steroidogenic cells) and medullary (chromaffin cells) compartments of the adrenal gland secreted PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> although the isoforms of COX and AKR1B involved in this biosynthetic pathway differed by their location and sensitivity to hormones. In good agreement with these differential expression patterns, PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> secretion was found to be modulated by ACTH in steroidogenic cells and to be constitutive in chromaffin cells. Indeed, steroidogenic cells only expressed COX2 and two isoforms of the murine aldose reductases with patent PGF synthase activity <italic>i.e.</italic> AKR1B3 and AKR1B7. Among these enzymes, only COX2 and AKR1B7 were up-regulated by cAMP/ACTH. In particular, we found that ACTH induced a rapid (2h) and transient (persisting until 6&#x02013;7 h and returning to near control level after 17 h) increase in COX2 protein. By contrast, chromaffin cells essentially expressed COX1 and AKR1B3 enzymes in a constitutive manner. Consistent with these observations, we have demonstrated that the cAMP/ACTH induction of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> release by steroidogenic cortical Y1 cells, was strictly dependent on the expression of AKR1B7 and resulted from a functional cellular coupling with COX2. These experiments provide evidence that AKR1B7 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> PGF synthase <italic>in vivo</italic>. In human, AKR1B1 was previously shown to be functionally related to the murine AKR1B7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-LefrancoisMartinez2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we showed that in the normal human adrenal gland, AKR1B1 and COX2 were co-localized in the steroidogenic cortical cells. Therefore, it seems likely that the human adrenal cortex could also have the potential to produce PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> in response to ACTH. However, we observed an unexpected sustained expression of COX2 on sections of the human adrenal cortex. Although this might reflect constitutive COX2 expression in the human adrenal cortex, it seems more likely that this high level of COX2 expression reflects the high stress level of hospitalized patients. In this respect and in agreement with our results, stress induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide injection in rat was shown to trigger a rapid COX2 mRNA expression in the adrenal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-Ichitani1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although both steroidogenic and chromaffin cells of the murine adrenal gland secreted PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, we showed that FP receptor expression was restricted to chromaffin cells.

This suggested that both autocrine (within chromaffin cells) and paracrine (between steroidogenic and chromaffin cells) mechanisms were relaying PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> effects. Our experimental observations confirm this hypothesis. First, PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> had no effect on steroidogenesis when applied either to isolated murine adrenocortical cell lines or to rat primary cultures (data not shown) as could be expected for cells devoid of FP receptor. Second, by contrast, PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> repressed both basal and glucocorticoid-induced catecholamine precursor release (dopamine) from a murine chromaffin cell line. Third, PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> was shown to repress corticosterone release in a dose dependent manner when applied to isolated rat adrenals in perifusion experiments. Based on these experimental data, we propose that PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> is involved in an intraadrenal regulatory loop that controls corticosterone release. The cortico-medullary interactions mediated by PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> could be involved in both a paracrine feedback to limit stress response or in a local control of basal steroidogenesis. The proposed mechanisms are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007309-g006">Fig. 6</xref> and would occur as follows: 1/A stress-induced ACTH surge triggers a transient induction of COX2 that couples with AKR1B7 in order to synthesize PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> in the steroidogenic compartment. Increased amounts of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> inhibit glucocorticoid secretion through an indirect mechanism. This would involve at least repression of catecholamines release by chromaffin cells.

However, because of the two very different kinetic constants, PGF synthase or isocaproaldehyde reductase activities are likely to be recruited under different circumstances: the low affinity for isocaproaldehyde (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;320 &#x000b5;M) combined to the highly cAMP/ACTH-dependent expression of AKR1B7 ensures an efficient reduction of isocaproaldehyde under chronic stimulation of steroidogenesis (high flow of substrate) with a limited risk of saturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-LefrancoisMartinez1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>; on the other hand the high affinity for PGH<sub>2</sub> (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4 &#x000b5;M) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007309-Kabututu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> combined with the acute cAMP/ACTH-dependent expression of COX2, allows a rapid response to stress.

PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>-mediated inhibition of glucocorticoid production is indirect and could require the downregulation of catecholamine production. This would then result in downregulation of adrenal steroidogenesis. Alternatively, PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> could up-regulate the expression of inhibitory peptides that remain to be identified. We provide evidence that this PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> signal could originate from the differential expression and regulation of COX enzymes and aldo-keto reductases of the AKR1B family.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Experimental animals and hormonal manipulations</title><p>Animal studies were conducted in agreement with standards described by the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as well as with the local laws and regulations applicable to animal manipulations in France.
