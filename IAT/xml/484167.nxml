The repair of this lesion is not completely understood and several activities are thought to be involved in processing of 3&#x02032;-PG ends. In this study we examined activities in human whole cell extracts (WCE) responsible for removal of 3&#x02032;-PG. Using a radiolabelled oligonucleotide containing a single nucleotide gap with internal 5&#x02032;-phosphate and 3&#x02032;-PG ends, we demonstrate that the major 3&#x02032;-PG activity in human WCE is Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependent and that this activity co-purifies with AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) over phosphocellulose and gel filtration chromatography. Furthermore, immunodepletion of APE1 from active gel filtration fractions using APE1 specific antibodies reveals that the major activity against 3&#x02032;-PG in human WCE is APE1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Oxidative DNA damage can be induced by ionizing radiation, by reactive oxygen species and by some antitumour agents such as bleomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c2">2</xref>). Oxidative damage to the sugar moiety of DNA results in DNA fragmentation and the subsequent generation of DNA breaks with damaged ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c4">4</xref>). These terminal 3&#x02032;-blocking groups, mostly 3&#x02032;-phosphate or 3&#x02032;-PG, must be removed and the single nucleotide gap created is repaired by proteins of base excision repair (BER). Repair involves one nucleotide incorporation and ligation by a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase, respectively.</p><p>Previous works suggest that the major human AP endonuclease (APE1) is also involved in removal of 3&#x02032;-phosphoglycolate (3&#x02032;-PG) in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c8">8</xref>). APE1 belongs to a large family of nucleases homologous to exonuclease III that mediate the removal of 3&#x02032;-PG in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c9">9</xref>). These enzymes act by cleaving the phosphodiester bond immediately 5&#x02032; to the phosphoglycolate residue creating a 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl end. APE1 has been cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c11">11</xref>) and recombinant APE1 was shown to be able to remove 3&#x02032;-PG from strand breaks generated by &#x003b3;-radiation and radiomimetic chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c13">13</xref>). However, analysis of 3&#x02032;-PG activities in human cell extracts revealed a more complex picture. Demple's group described two distinct human DNA diesterases that hydrolyse 3&#x02032; end blocking deoxyribose fragments from oxidized DNA, while Winters <italic>et al</italic>. purified three chromatographically distinct human enzyme activities from HeLa cells using bleomycin treated DNA as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c14">14</xref>). Moreover, while Mitra's group, using bleomycin treated DNA as a substrate, demonstrated that APE1 is the limiting activity for repair of 3&#x02032;-blocking damage at DNA single-strand breaks, Winters <italic>et al</italic>., as adjudged by inhibition of APE1 with neutralizing APE1 antibodies, concluded that removal of 3&#x02032;-PG is not dependent upon APE1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c16">16</xref>). The picture becomes even more obscure with the finding that tyrosyl&#x02013;DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) is also able to remove 3&#x02032;-PG. Yeast Tdp1 was originally isolated as an activity that hydrolyses the phosphodiester bond linking tyrosine to a 3&#x02032; DNA end, formed as intermediates in DNA relaxation by topoisomerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c17">17</xref>). The human homologue (hTdp1) was subsequently cloned and was shown to have 3&#x02032;-PG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c18">18</xref>).</p><p>Consequently, further studies are required to clarify the major activity in human cell extracts involved in repair of 3&#x02032;-PG. In this study we used an oligonucleotide substrate containing a single-strand break with a 1 nt gap flanked by 5&#x02032;-phosphate and 3&#x02032;-PG ends and fractionated cell extract to address this question.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from MWG-Biotech and gel purified on a 20% polyacrylamide gel.

The oligonucleotide was 5&#x02032; end labelled and compared, by 20% denaturing PAGE, to the corresponding parent 16mer oligonucleotide and a 17mer oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f1">1</xref>A). The 3&#x02032;-PG oligonucleotide has a distinct mobility shift, running slower than the parent oligonucleotide but faster than the corresponding 17mer. The 3&#x02032;-PG oligonucleotide was used to construct a duplex oligonucleotide substrate, complete with a hairpin loop to protect the DNA ends from nuclease digestion, and containing a 5&#x02032;-phosphate within the gap (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f1">1</xref>B). This substrate was further characterized by the ability of purified recombinant human APE1 to remove 3&#x02032;-PG and to activate the 3&#x02032; end for DNA polymerase synthesis. In agreement with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c10">10</xref>) we have shown that purified recombinant APE1 is able to remove 3&#x02032;-PG in a dose-dependent manner, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f1">1</xref>C) and that this activity is magnesium dependent, as in the presence of EDTA no cleavage of 3&#x02032;-PG can be observed (data not shown). The activity of APE1 on the 3&#x02032;-PG-containing substrate also primes the DNA for synthesis by Pol &#x003b2;, as primer extension is observed only on the addition of both proteins, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f1">1</xref>D, compare lanes 2 and 4) further confirming the structure of the substrate used.</p></sec><sec><title>Fractionation of 3&#x02032;-PG activity from human WCE</title><p>We then tested human WCE for the ability to remove 3&#x02032;-PG and subsequently undergo full repair of an oligonucleotide substrate. Using WCE we were able to demonstrate repair of an oligonucleotide containing an internal gap with 3&#x02032;-PG and 5&#x02032;-phosphate ends, with &#x0223c;30% of the substrate repaired within 8 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f2">2</xref>A). This is in comparison to the rapid repair of a nick substrate with a 3&#x02032;-OH and a 5&#x02032;-phosphate end, which is fully repaired within 4 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f2">2</xref>B). In WCE, removal of 3&#x02032;-PG is followed by rapid addition of the first nucleotide by Pol &#x003b2; and ligation by DNA ligase. Correspondingly, intermediate repair products (16mer) arising as a result of 3&#x02032;-PG removal activity do not accumulate during repair in WCE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f2">2</xref>A). To visualize 3&#x02032;-PG activity we blocked repair synthesis by removal of dNTPs from the reaction mixtures. Under these conditions we were able to detect removal of 3&#x02032;-PG in WCE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f2">2</xref>C). The 3&#x02032;-PG activity in WCE is magnesium dependent as the cleavage of 3&#x02032;-PG cannot be observed in the presence of EDTA (data not shown).</p><p>We proceeded to further characterize the 3&#x02032;-PG activity from human WCE using phosphocellulose chromatography, eluting proteins off into two fractions using low (0.15 M KCl, PC-FI) and high salt (1 M KCl, PC-FII) elution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c23">23</xref>). These fractions were tested for their ability to remove 3&#x02032;-PG. The majority of the 3&#x02032;-PG activity observed in human WCE is retained in the high-salt wash fraction PC-FII only (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f3">3</xref>A), which has also been found to contain the majority of BER proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c23">23</xref>). No other residual activity for the removal of 3&#x02032;-PG was observed in the low-salt wash fraction PC-FI. The proteins within fraction PC-FII, which contained the major 3&#x02032;-PG activity, were further separated according to their size by gel filtration chromatography. The fractions were subsequently tested for their ability to remove 3&#x02032;-PG and it was revealed that the activity was present predominantly within fractions 19&#x02013;22, where proteins with a molecular weight of &#x0223c;40&#x02013;60 kDa are eluted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f3">3</xref>B). Western blot analysis of these fractions revealed that elution of APE1 and Tdp1 occurred within fractions 18&#x02013;23 and 16&#x02013;20, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f3">3</xref>C). We thus conclude that the 3&#x02032;-PG activity co-purifies with APE1 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-precipitation of APE1 and 3&#x02032;-PG activity</title><p>Gel filtration fractions containing the peak of 3&#x02032;-PG activity (fractions 19&#x02013;22) were chosen to immunodeplete APE1 using antibodies raised against APE1. Analysis by western blot reveals that although the levels of APE1 are slightly reduced by mock immunodepletion compared to the original fractions, using APE1 antibodies the fractions were completely depleted of the APE1 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f4">4</xref>A). Furthermore, the levels of another similar sized protein, Pol &#x003b2;, were unaffected by the immunodepletion procedure. The original fractions, alongside the mock immunodepleted and immunodepleted fractions, were subsequently tested for their ability to remove 3&#x02032;-PG. The mock immunodepletion protocol does not affect 3&#x02032;-PG activity in fractions 20 and 21 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f4">4</xref>B, lanes 4 and 5) compared to the original fractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f4">4</xref>B, lanes 2 and 3). However, using antibodies specific to APE1, the activity against 3&#x02032;-PG is completely ablated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f4">4</xref>B, lanes 6 and 7). Taken together, these results indicate that the major 3&#x02032;-PG activity observed in human cells is APE1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Ionizing radiation induces the generation of DNA strand breaks containing 3&#x02032;-PG ends that must be removed prior to repair by a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c4">4</xref>). Conflicting reports suggest that APE1, Tdp1 or other, as yet unidentified, proteins are involved in removal of 3&#x02032;-PG in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c18">18</xref>). One of the reasons for the controversial results on the enzymatic activity responsible for removal of 3&#x02032;-PG may be the variations in substrates and experimental conditions used for measuring 3&#x02032;-PG activity. A wide spectrum of substrates (from chemically synthesized oligonucleotide duplexes containing 3&#x02032;-PG to bleomycin-treated plasmid DNA) and different reaction conditions have been employed by different groups. To resolve the existing controversy in the literature on the processing of 3&#x02032;-PG, we used a double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate containing a strand break with 3&#x02032;-PG and 5&#x02032;-phosphate groups to identify the main protein involved in 3&#x02032;-PG removal in human cell extracts. This substrate models 3&#x02032;-PG-containing strand breaks arising after radiation-induced DNA damage. The oligonucleotide duplex substrate was carefully characterized by mass spectroscopy, ability to block DNA repair synthesis and by APE1 activation of the 3&#x02032; end for repair synthesis by purified human Pol &#x003b2;. All results unequivocally supported the presence of the phosphoglycolate group at the 3&#x02032; end of the substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh676f1">1</xref>; and data not shown). However in our hands, electrophoretic mobility of the 16mer oligonucleotide containing phosphoglycolate (16-PG) was between 16mer and 17mer that disagreed with previously published data, suggesting that mobility of the 3&#x02032;-PG-containing oligonucleotide was slightly slower compared to the same length oligonucleotides without 3&#x02032;-PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c18">18</xref>). This may be due to differences in oligonucleotide composition and length, as well as different electrophoresis conditions used.</p><p>We next characterized 3&#x02032;-PG activity in WCE and found that repair of the 3&#x02032;-PG-containing substrate is Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent. We further purified this Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent 3&#x02032;-PG activity and found that this activity is the major 3&#x02032;-PG activity and that no other activity was isolated on separation ofproteins from WCE by phosphocellulose and gel filtra-tion chromatography. This is in contrast to previous datasuggesting that at least two other 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase activities can be isolated, although these repair proteins are reported to be very unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh676c14">14</xref>). As demonstrated by western blot analysis, the 3&#x02032;-PG activity co-purifies with APE1. It was further confirmed to be the major 3&#x02032;-PG activity by immunodepletion of APE1 from purified fractions.</p><p>Taken together, our data demonstrates that APE1 is the major 3&#x02032;-PG activity in human cell extracts.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh676f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Characterization of the 3&#x02032;-PG-containing oligonucleotide substrate.
