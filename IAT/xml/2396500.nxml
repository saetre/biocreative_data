The UV-induced lesions on DNA affect both transcription and replication and can also have mutagenic consequences. Here we investigated the regulation and the function of the recently described CUL4-DDB1-DDB2 E3 ligase in the maintenance of genome integrity upon UV-stress using the model plant Arabidopsis. Physiological, biochemical, and genetic evidences indicate that this protein complex is involved in global genome repair (GGR) of UV-induced DNA lesions. Moreover, we provide evidences for crosstalks between GGR, the plant-specific photo reactivation pathway and the RAD1-RAD10 endonucleases upon UV exposure. Finally, we report that DDB2 degradation upon UV stress depends not only on CUL4, but also on the checkpoint protein kinase Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR). Interestingly, we found that DDB1A shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an ATR-dependent manner, highlighting an upstream level of control and a novel mechanism of regulation of this E3 ligase.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Recent research revealed strong links between Cullin4 (CUL4)&#x02013;based cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) and chromatin biology, including DNA replication and DNA repair. During Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), CUL4 together with DDB1 (DNA Damage Binding protein 1) ubiquitylate an increasingly large number of substrates, including components of the NER machinery as well as various histone proteins. In contrast to mammals, plants have an efficient DNA repair pathway, mediated by photolyases that reverse UV lesions in presence of visible light, without DNA excision. Thus, it is believed that in aerial plant tissues this DNA repair pathway is predominant. In the present work we used the model plant Arabidopsis to investigate the role of CUL4-DDB1A<sup>DDB2</sup> in global genome repair at the level of a whole organism. Using a genetic approach, we highlighted the existence of cooperative roles of different DNA repair processes that all together contribute to maintain genome integrity upon exposure to UV. Moreover, we report that DDB2 turnover not only depends on CUL4-DDB1A, but also on the ATR checkpoint protein kinase. Strikingly, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis DDB1A shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after UV stress in an ATR-dependent manner, illustrating a novel level of regulation of this class of CRL.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants are subjected to many different environmental stresses due to their sessile life styles. As obligate prototroph they need to take benefit of the sunlight containing ultra-violets (UV) for photosynthesis but concomitantly, have to prevent UV irradiation from inducing irreversible damage especially on DNA. Genetic changes that occur in somatic plant cells can potentially be passed to the progeny through meiosis since plants lack a permanent germ line and produce gametes from somatic lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Puchta1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to avoid dramatic genetic alterations efficient DNA repair pathways must be activated in addition to physiological adaptation like biosynthesis of UV absorbing compounds. UVs predominantly induce photochemical lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4)-photoproducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Sancar1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. These bulky DNA lesions are repaired by a simple and error free mechanism: photo reactivation, which is present in prokaryotes and most eukaryotes, with the exception of mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Britt1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the <italic>UVR2</italic> gene encodes a photolyase (PHR1) that acts only on CPDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Ahmad1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Jiang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas the <italic>UVR3</italic> gene encodes a photolyase specific for 6-4 photoproducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Nakajima1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to this direct repair process, most organisms also have a sophisticated general repair mechanism, such as the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Shuck1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The NER process contributes to global genome repair and consists of 5 steps: recognition of the DNA damage, opening of the pre-incision complex, dual incision of the lesion, DNA synthesis followed by the ligation of the newly synthesised DNA strand. Two proteins, DDB1 and DDB2 (DNA Damage Binding protein 1 and 2), were initially isolated as part of a heterodimeric protein complex that recognises UV-induced DNA lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Chu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Although still under debate, these proteins seem to play an early function during NER. Recent finding have shown that DDB1 and DDB2, at least in mammals, form an E3 ubiquitin ligase together with Cullin 4 (CUL4) and RBX1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Groisman1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, CUL4 binds RBX1 to recruit a specific E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and also binds DDB1, an adaptor protein, which itself associates with the predicted substrate receptor DDB2. However, the ubiquitylation events triggered by this E3 ligase during NER seem complex and are not yet fully understood. Thus in mammals, both the <italic>Xeroderma pigmentosum</italic> complementation group C (XPC) and the receptor protein itself, DDB2, are ubiquitylated after UV irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Nag1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-RapicOtrin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Sugasawa1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-ElMahdy1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However the fate of these proteins are different; whereas polyubiquitylated XPC is not degraded and exhibits enhanced binding activity to damaged DNA, polyubiquitylated DDB2 is destroyed by the proteasome. Thus it is believed that DDB2 facilitates and/or stabilizes the binding of XPC to UV-induced photoproducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Luijsterburg1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, but its turnover is crucial to allow the NER process to occur efficiently. Therefore recognition of UV lesions at the initial step of NER is critical and should be tightly controlled to allow efficient and rapid DNA repair. Hence mutations in human <italic>DDB2</italic> gene cause genetic complementation group XPE phenotype characterized by hypersensitivity to sunlight and a predisposition to skin cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Nichols1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, recent data also indicate a role of CUL4-DDB1-DDB2 E3 ligase in histone H3 and H4 ubiquitylation during UV stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Wang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This work points to an interesting model in which histone ubiquitylation around the lesions may cause the eviction of nucleosomes and thus expose the damaged DNA to the repair machinery. A function of CUL4A-DDB1<sup>DDB2</sup> was also proposed for histone H2A monoubiquitylation during UV irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Kapetanaki1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, DDB2 may also act in NER in a chromatin-independent and less direct manner, by controlling the stability of P53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Stoyanova1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In spite of these advances, the control and the dynamics of the CUL4-DDB1-DDB2 complex during the recognition step of photoproducts is still not well understood. Moreover, the cooperation between the different DNA repair pathways in the repair of highly mutagenic UV-induced DNA lesions remains poorly characterized and much of our current knowledge comes from data obtained with different cell types and not at the level of a complex organism. In the present work we used the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> which has to deal with the benefit of UV light and the harmful effects of photoproducts on DNA during development. Here we provide evidences for a CUL4-DDB1A<sup>DDB2</sup> protein complex <italic>in planta</italic> and for its function in the global genome repair pathway (GGR). Using a genetic approach, we demonstrate a synergism between GGR, the plant specific photo reactivation pathway and the RAD1-RAD10 endonucleases upon UV exposure. These results support the existence of different interconnections between DNA repair processes that all together contribute to maintain genome integrity. Moreover, we report that DDB2's turnover depends on the CUL4-DDB1A E3 ligase and the ATR kinase. Strikingly, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis DDB1A shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an ATR-dependent manner, highlighting an upstream control and a novel level of regulation for this CUL4-based E3 ligase.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Molecular Characterisation of Arabidopsis <italic>DDB1A</italic> and <italic>DDB2</italic> Insertion Lines</title><p>In order to define the role of Arabidopsis CUL4, DDB1A and DDB2 in DNA repair, a genetic approach was conducted.

We used this hypomorphic mutant, which exhibits a strong reduction of <italic>CUL4</italic> expression, instead of a null mutant that is lethal in Arabidopsis (unpublished).

This would suggest that crosstalk exists between cell cycle checkpoint and NER.</p><p>ATR plays a central role in cell-cycle regulation, transmitting DNA damage signals to downstream effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Shiloh1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore the link between ATR signalling and DDB2 stability was investigated. Arabidopsis is a material of choice to study the role of ATR in DNA damage signalling because ATR deficient plants are viable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Culligan1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> whereas lack of ATR expression is lethal in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Brown1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Using an Arabidopsis <italic>atr</italic> mutant plant, we showed that in such a genetic background DDB2 was stabilised upon UV exposure, indicating a direct or indirect role for this signalling pathway in the control of the first step of the NER process. In addition, DDB1A shuttling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon UV exposure is also ATR-dependent, suggesting that this mechanism might control DDB2 turnover via the assembly of the CUL4-DDB1A E3 ligase in the nucleus. Our results highlight the fact that ATR signalling controls another effector of the excision repair machinery in addition to XPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Wu1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, a protein that is not conserved in plants. A similar shuttling upon UV exposure was already described for the Arabidopsis CEN2, another component of the GGR pathway and for the large subunit of the tobacco ribonucleotide reductase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Liang1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Lincker1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The control of DDB1A nuclear translocation by the ATR kinase and subsequently DDB2 turnover illustrates a novel and specific level of regulation of Cullin-based E3 ligase complex activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Crosstalk of Different DNA Repair Pathways to Maintain Genome Integrity upon UV Stress</title><p>Plants have to take benefit of sunlight for photosynthesis, but at the same time, have also to face UV damages on DNA. Thus to maintain genome integrity, efficient DNA repair processes are needed. In contrast to mammals, plants have a specific DNA repair pathway, the direct DNA repair that is mediated by photolyases. In this pathway, UV-induced pyrimidine dimmers are reversed without DNA excision in the presence of visible light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Britt1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In Arabidopsis two photolyases, PHR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Ahmad1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Jiang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and UVR3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Nakajima1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> are specific for each type of UV induced DNA lesions, the CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts, respectively. It is believed that in green tissues and in presence of light the direct repair is the predominant pathway, whereas in absence of light the NER also called dark repair, is preferentially used. Using a genetic approach we found a synergistic genetic interaction between <italic>CUL4, DDB1A, DDB2</italic> and the photolyase <italic>PHRI</italic> regarding UV sensitivity. This strongly suggests that both pathways contribute together to efficiently repair UV lesions in green tissues and does not restrict the CUL4-DDB1A-DDB2 pathway to DNA repair in non-light exposed tissues (e.g., in roots). Moreover, based on our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000093-g004">Figure 4</xref>), the restriction of the NER pathway to proliferating cells as previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Kimura2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> also seems unlikely. In addition CUL4, DDB1A and DDB2 are expressed in various Arabidopsis cell types including post-mitotic cells of mature leaves (unpublished data).</p><p>Interestingly, we also identified a synergistic genetic interaction between the components of the NER and RAD1-RAD10. Although the RAD1-RAD10 heterodimer is mainly known to be involved in the removal of bulky DNA lesions during the NER process, it was shown that these enzymes also contribute to the removal of non-homologous overhangs during HR in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Dubest1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Dubest2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

The synergistic genetic interactions observed with the Arabidopsis <italic>rad1</italic> and <italic>rad10</italic> mutations stress the point that HR, in addition to NER, is activated to maintain genome integrity upon UV exposure.</p><p>It is noteworthy that UV radiations induce primarily CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts but also DSBs that need to be efficiently repaired. Moreover, Arabidopsis <italic>PHRI</italic> mutants or plants defective in NER, such as the <italic>Atcen2</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Molinier1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> exhibit not only hypersensitivity to UV but also enhanced somatic homologous recombination frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Ries1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together our data indicate that at least three different repair pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000093-g007">Figure 7</xref>), direct repair, NER and HR, cooperatively contribute to maintain genome integrity in different tissues upon exposure to UV. Hence, combined disruption of these pathways becomes dramatic for plant development and survival under UV stress conditions.</p><fig id="pgen-1000093-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000093.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of DNA repair pathways in plant cells and control of DDB2 stability upon UV exposure.</title><p>As a consequence of UV irradiation, different types of DNA damage are produced such as cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), (6-4) photoproducts (6-4) Pps, Inter/Intra Cross Link (ICL), 8-oxoG or even DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In order to repair these lesions different repair processes including Direct Repair, Homologous Recombination (HR) and Global Genome Repair (GGR) are activated. The GGR pathway involves the CUL4-DDB1A ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. Based on our data, we propose the following model: Under normal growth conditions DDB1A localises predominantly to the cytoplasm, whereas CUL4 and DDB2 are both located into the nucleus. Upon UV irradiation, DDB2 recognises bulky DNA lesions and DDB1A shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an ATR-dependent manner (direct or indirect). This allows DDB2 degradation by the 26S proteasome and most likely permits subsequent steps of the excision repair process to occur efficiently.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000093.g007"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Material and Growth Conditions</title><p>Arabidopsis mutant plants have been identified using the web assisted program: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress">http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress</ext-link>. <italic>ddb1a-1</italic> (SALK 055584), <italic>ddb1a-2</italic> (SALK 038757), <italic>cen2-2</italic> (SM-3-20758), <italic>atr-2</italic> (SALK 032841), <italic>rad10</italic> (SALK 077000), <italic>rad1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000093-Liu2">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>phrI</italic> (WiscDsLox 466C12) are in Columbia ecotype whereas <italic>ddb2-2</italic> (RATM53-3351-1) is in Nossen ecotype.
