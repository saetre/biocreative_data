E-cadherin is the critical component of the adherens junctions, the intercellular structure needed for the correct formation of compact epithelial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">P&#x000e9;rez-Moreno et al., 2003</xref>). Loss of E-cadherin expression is a requisite for cell deadhesion and migration during the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and is common in carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takeichi, 1993</xref>).

The interference of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> with the Wnt&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin pathway relies on the rapid induction of vitamin D receptor (VDR)&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin complexes that titrate out &#x003b2;-catenin, thus hampering formation of the transcriptional competent &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;T cell factor (TCF) complexes that regulate genes involved in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">P&#x000e1;lmer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shah et al., 2006</xref>). Linked to E-cadherin induction, &#x003b2;-catenin later relocates from the nucleus to the adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">P&#x000e1;lmer et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, the mechanisms leading to the induction of <italic>CDH1</italic>/E-cadherin and the drastic reorganization of the cytoskeleton by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> remain unknown.</p><p>1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> binds to and activates a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors, the VDR, which is present in &#x0003e;30 cell types and acts as a ligand-modulated transcription factor regulating gene expression (genomic action). The current model for gene activation by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-VDR predicts that unliganded VDR bound to regulatory sequences (vitamin D response elements) in target genes represses their transcription by recruiting corepressors and histone deacetylases. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> induces a conformational change in VDR that results in the replacement of corepressors by coactivators and an increased histone acetylase activity, which decondenses chromatin, thus allowing gene activation by the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sutton and MacDonald, 2003</xref>). 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> drastically alters the gene expression profile of many cell types: in human SW480-ADH colon carcinoma cells it regulates &#x0003e;200 genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, invasiveness, and metastatic potential and also in basic cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">P&#x000e1;lmer et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, rapid, transcription-independent (nongenomic) actions of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on cytosolic kinases, phosphatases, phospholipases, or membrane ion channels have been described, although their role and relevance for the anticancer action of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and their relation to the genomic effects are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Losel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Norman et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here we demonstrate that transcriptional activation by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> of E-cadherin and <italic>CYP24</italic>, which is its most responsive target gene that encodes the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> 24-hydroxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vaisanen et al., 2005</xref>), is mediated by a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent transient activation of the small GTPase RhoA and its immediate effector Rho-associated coiled kinase (ROCK). Thereafter, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> activates the p38MAPK and its target the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1). Activity of these kinases is required for induction of <italic>CDH1</italic>/E-cadherin transcription and the acquisition of an adhesive epithelial phenotype and for the inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;TCF transcriptional activity. Our results indicate that the gene regulatory activity of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and its antiproliferative and prodifferentiation effects depend on the early, nongenomic increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) and the subsequent activation of RhoA&#x02013;ROCK and p38MAPK-MSK1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> induces Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx and activates RhoA</title><p>As the Rho family of GTPases are key regulators of cytoskeleton dynamics and cell adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004</xref>), we examined their role in the phenotypic changes induced by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in SW480-ADH cells. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> caused a transient activation of RhoA, as measured by the increase in the level of RhoAGTP, but not of Rac or Cdc42, without affecting the RNA (unpublished data) or protein expression of any of these GTPases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Other hormones acting through nuclear receptors such as estrogen, retinoic acid, or dexamethasone had no effect on RhoA activity (unpublished data). 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> transiently increased the phosphorylation of cofilin, a downstream ROCK effector involved in cytoskeleton reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maekawa et al., 1999</xref>), but not of protein-related kinase 2 (PRK2; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> activates the RhoA&#x02013;ROCK pathway.</bold> (A) SW480-ADH cells were treated with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> for the indicated times and RhoA activity was determined by GST pulldown.

The resting [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> was relatively high in SW480-ADH cells. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> induced a marked increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> as registered in individual cells by fluorescence imaging, which was sustained as long as 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Removal of external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> abolished this increase, whereas its readdition induced a small Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> overshoot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This finding indicates that the effect was caused the maintenance of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry rather than the transient release of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from intracellular stores. In SW480-R cells, derived from the same parental line as SW480-ADH but expressing very little VDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">P&#x000e1;lmer et al., 2001</xref>), 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> induced a much lower, delayed [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> rise that was difficult to distinguish from the gradual increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in vehicle-treated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The slight increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in SW480-R cell cultures was caused by only a few cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Moreover, VDR knockdown by means of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) abolished the increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). These results indicate that VDR mediates Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx. However, although the presence of small amounts of VDR in caveolae has been postulated in some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huhtakangas et al., 2004</xref>), we did not detect VDR at the plasma membrane by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, incubation with an anti-VDR antibody did not affect the increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (unpublished data). Remarkably, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> also increased [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in the nontumoral rat intestine IEC18 cell line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). We explored a possible association between the effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> and RhoA. Incubation in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-free medium abolished the activation of RhoA by its reported activator lysophosphatidic acid and also by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, indicating that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx was required for RhoA activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Nimodipine, an antagonist of the L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, but not LaCl<sub>3</sub>, which blocks store-operated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, prevented the increase of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Both Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx and RhoA activation are nongenomic 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> effects, as they were not affected by preincubation with the general transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or the RNA polymerase II inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>; and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803020/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803020/DC1</ext-link>).

C3 exoenzyme altered the morphology of untreated cells and blocked the induction of an adhesive phenotype by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). To confirm the involvement of RhoA in 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> activity we generated SW480-ADH cells stably expressing the dominant-negative mutant N19-RhoA (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803020/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803020/DC1</ext-link>). Expression of HA-tagged N19-RhoA did not affect posttranscriptional up-regulation of VDR by its ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wiese et al., 1992</xref>; Fig. S2). Likewise, it did not change the predominant nuclear localization of VDR (unpublished data).

The induction of epithelioid islands by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was impaired in N19-RhoA cell cultures and it was also reduced by treatment with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

Y27632 partially disrupted the strong adhesive phenotype of cells stably expressing an exogenous E-cadherin gene (SW480-ADH-E-cadherin) irrespective of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> addition, whereas it did not alter the morphology of E-cadherin and VDR-negative SW480-R cells that do not respond to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In contrast, neither the C3 exoenzyme nor Y27632 altered the level of E-cadherin expression in SW480-ADH-E-cadherin cells (Fig. S2). This finding implicates ROCK in E-cadherin&#x02013;dependent intercellular adhesion.

How these rapid and transcription-independent events are triggered is unclear, as we did not detect VDR at the plasma membrane and an anti-VDR antibody failed to block Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. These negative results do not rule out the presence of small amounts of VDR at the plasma membrane, as occurs with estrogen or progesterone nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Losel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Norman et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the lack of effect on VDR knockdown by means of shRNA and in VDR-deficient SW480-R cells is consistent with the requirement of functional VDR in osteoblasts for the modulation of ion channel responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zanello and Norman, 2004</xref>). VDR may not be the only receptor for 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nemere et al., 2004</xref>). However, the evidence from studies using cultured cells and genetically modified mice suggests that most 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> actions are mediated by VDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erben et al., 2002</xref>). We conclude that the initial Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx is mediated by cytosolic VDR, although low membrane VDR levels as well as the binding of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> to a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel or an associated membrane protein cannot be ruled out. The conformational change induced by ligand binding in cytosolic VDR may trigger the initial signal, perhaps indirectly by releasing putative associated factors. The cytosolic fraction of VDR has recently been localized in the vicinity of the plasma membrane in leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gocek et al., 2007</xref>), which would tend to support this hypothesis. Our findings imply a dual action of VDR, as a signaling molecule at the plasma membrane&#x02013;cytosol and as a transcription factor within the nucleus.</p><p>The use of antagonists indicates that L-type voltage-gated calcium channels mediate the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx induced by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, as it has been recently reported in the case of the vitamin D analogue elocalcitol in human and rat bladder smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morelli et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of the &#x003b1;1c isoform of this channel is elevated in colon cancer as compared with adjacent normal mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2000</xref>), which is compatible with an effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in this neoplasia.</p><p>The role of RhoA in the induction of <italic>CDH1</italic>/E-cadherin and other target genes and the profound phenotypic change induced by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> are consistent with its key function regulating the cytoskeleton, endocytosis, cell polarity, migration, gene transcription, proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004</xref>). The inhibitory effects of N19-RhoA and Y27632 on the induction and redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> indicate that RhoA activation is crucial for the acquisition of polarity and the adhesive phenotype, respectively, which are characteristics of differentiated epithelial cells. Rho GTPases and E-cadherin function control each other: stable localization of E-cadherin at the adherens junctions requires Rho activity, whereas RhoA is inhibited by E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braga et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noren et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braga and Yap, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reynolds, 2007</xref>).

The rapid activation of RhoA may be a response to the increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>, whereas the down-regulation may be a consequence of the later accumulation of E-cadherin and p120-catenin at the plasma membrane, as E-cadherin activates and p120-catenin recruits the Rho inhibitor p190RhoGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noren et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wildenberg et al., 2006</xref>).

MSK1 may phosphorylate VDR and/or its coregulators or components of any of the multiprotein complexes (DRIP-TRAP and Mediator) involved in transcriptional control by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-VDR. Perhaps a more plausible role of MSK1 may be the regulation of downstream transcription factors: MSK1 may recruit coactivators or promote interactions with chromatin-modifying or -remodeling complexes through its ability to phosphorylate transcription factors such as CREB or ATF1 or the histone H3 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2005</xref>).

The protein concentration was measured using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). WB of cell lysates or immunoprecipitates was performed by electrophoresis in SDS gels and by protein transfer to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary and secondary horseradish peroxidase&#x02013;conjugated antibodies, and the antibody binding was visualized using the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare).

Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with PBS containing 1% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature before incubating the cells with the primary antibodies diluted in PBS for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After four washes in PBS, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories). F-actin was stained with Texas red&#x02013;labeled phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at room temperature followed by four washes in PBS. The secondary antibodies used include the following: FITC-conjugated goat anti&#x02013;mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and FITC-conjugated goat anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG (heavy light chains; Vector Laboratories). Images of immunolabeled samples were obtained at 20&#x000b0;C with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using plan apochromat immersion oil 63x NA 1.4 objective lens and argon ion (488 nm) and HeNe (543 nm) lasers. Images were acquired sequentially by direct register using LSM software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) without manipulation; for double labeling experiments, images of the same confocal plane were generated and superimposed.
