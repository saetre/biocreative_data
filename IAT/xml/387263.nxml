Analysis of the sequenced microbial genomes suggests that genes are evolving at many different rates. We have attempted to derive a new classification of genes into three broad categories: lineage-specific genes that evolve rapidly and appear unique to individual species or strains; highly conserved genes that frequently perform housekeeping functions; and partially variable genes that contain highly variable regions, at least 70 amino acids long, interspersed among well-conserved regions. The latter we term segmentally variable genes (SVGs), and we suggest that they are especially interesting targets for biochemical studies. Among these genes are ones necessary to deal with the environment, including genes involved in host&#x02013;pathogen interactions, defense mechanisms, and intracellular responses to internal and environmental changes. For the most part, the detailed function of these variable regions remains unknown. We propose that they are likely to perform important binding functions responsible for protein&#x02013;protein, protein&#x02013;nucleic acid, or protein&#x02013;small molecule interactions. Discerning their function and identifying their binding partners may offer biologists new insights into the basic mechanisms of adaptation, context-dependent evolution, and the interaction between microbes and their environment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Segmentally variable genes show a mosaic pattern of one or more rapidly evolving, variable regions.

This adaptive ability has been refined during millennia of evolution and has resulted in genes that evolve at very different rates. Some, such as housekeeping genes that code for the essential biochemical functions of the organism, are now evolving rather slowly. Others that have to defend against potentially lethal attack by viruses or toxins and adapt to varying environmental conditions, often evolve more rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Murphy1">Murphy 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Moxon1">Moxon and Thaler 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Jordan1">Jordan et al. 2002</xref>). Pathogenic microbes, for example, face stringent tests of their adaptive potential because of the escalating efficiency of the host-defense mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Moxon1">Moxon and Thaler 1997</xref>). In the arms race between pathogens and their hosts, both sides try to improve their overall fitness by deploying sophisticated strategies to generate genetic variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Elena1">Elena and Lenski 2003</xref>). Sequence divergence during rapid evolution can take many forms. Some genes change throughout their entire sequences, resulting in apparently lineage-specific genes that lack clear similar sequences in current versions of GenBank. Others show a mosaic pattern of one or more variable regions interspersed within conserved regions. This latter group is the subject of this paper and we refer to them as segmentally variable genes (SVGs). For the purpose of the current analysis, we define such variable regions as having a minimum length of 70 amino acids, which would permit them to fold into independent domains. This distinguishes them from most nonfunctional interdomain segments, which are usually shorter and whose principal function depends on length rather than specific sequence content.</p><p>An example of an SVG family is provided by the cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Posfai2">Posfai et al. 1989</xref>). These enzymes typically form parts of restriction-modification systems, which are key components of an important bacterial defense mechanism to protect against phage attack and other unwanted infiltration of foreign DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Cheng2">Cheng 1995</xref>). These methyltransferases catalyze the addition of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the 5-position of cytosine and contain a highly variable region of more than 90 amino acids that is responsible for specific DNA sequence recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Posfai2">Posfai et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Cheng2">Cheng 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Lange1">Lange et al. 1996</xref>). A detailed examination of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the variable region suggests that it folds into an independent domain, which has been shown to bind to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Cheng3">Cheng et al. 1993</xref>). The flanking sequences are highly conserved because they are responsible for the chemistry of methylation, which is common to all members of the family. Variability in this family has arisen because there is a need for great variation in the DNA sequences being recognized so that the specific pattern of methylation becomes a marker to distinguish innate DNA from foreign DNA.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there has been no systematic attempt to identify, catalog, and classify similar SVGs in the sequenced microbial genomes. Nor has any attempt been made to find potentially common functions among genes displaying this property. Since it is known that many genes involved in defense mechanisms, such as the DNA methyltransferases and the antigens exposed on the surface of bacteria, show such variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Roche1">Roche et al. 2001</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that one might identify host-defense genes based on this property. Thus, the regional variability might reflect the influence of diversifying selection pressure that could come from constant interaction with other fast-evolving molecules in the environment. Could such genes be the predominant members of the SVG families? Or do other genes, such as those involved in basic energy metabolism and synthesis, show similar variability? In this paper we provide an initial systematic analysis. We describe our findings about the distribution of SVGs and the potential function achieved by segmental variability.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Classification of Genes into Three Broad Groups</title><p>We carried out a classification of the genes in 43 fully sequenced microbial genomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref> for a full name list). A Web site (<ext-link xlink:href="http://geneva.bu.edu)" ext-link-type="uri">http://geneva.bu.edu)</ext-link> is also provided with results for several selected genomes, including <italic>Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Neisseria meningitidis,</italic> and several others. Each gene is accompanied with schematic diagrams from Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Bateman1">Bateman et al. 2002</xref>), BLOCKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Henikoff1">Henikoff et al. 1999</xref>), PRINTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Attwood1">Attwood et al. 2003</xref>), and the nongapped BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Altschul1">Altschul et al. 1990</xref>) analyses.</p><p>For each genome, the full proteome is compared with the nonredundant GenBank sequence set using nongapped BLAST (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">see Materials and Methods</xref> for the parameters used). Based on the degree of conservation or divergence among similar genes in different species, we classify them into three broad groups. Lineage-specific genes are defined as genes with no significantly similar hits from other species in the current GenBank (<italic>E</italic>-value cutoff, 1<italic>E</italic>-5). SVGs are defined as genes containing at least one highly variable region, containing more than 70 amino acids, interspersed among well-conserved regions. In any single SVG family, the length of the variable region can differ only within a certain range (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">see Materials and Methods</xref> for more details). In this paper, regions are considered to be variable if no sequence similarity can be detected against possible homologous genes, where the overall homology is determined by the conserved portions. The rest of the genes in the genome are considered as fully conserved genes. Naturally, this initial soft classification is somewhat dependent on specific thresholds and will be biased by the current state of GenBank and the quality of the annotation.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g002">Figure 2</xref> we show a scatter plot of the three classes of genes in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. pylori</named-content> genome in two-dimensional (2D) space, where the x-axis shows the length of the variable region and the y-axis shows the number of possible homologs of each gene. Lineage-specific genes (filled square in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g002">Figure 2</xref>) by definition naturally cluster on the x-axis. Most of the genes in this group are still annotated as unknown. A few genes with annotated functions in this group, such as the outer-membrane protein family in <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. pylori</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Tomb1">Tomb et al. 1997</xref>), only appear in this organism and contribute to its unique biology. A second group contains fully conserved genes (filled triangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g002">Figure 2</xref>) with only short variable regions. It is in this class that most &#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; genes fall. Examples include the subunits of ATP synthetase F1 (atpD, atpA, atpG) and ribosomal proteins such as rps4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g002">Figure 2</xref>), etc. The third group contains the SVGs (filled diamond in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A few examples in this group are labeled with their names in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g002">Figure 2</xref> and will be discussed later. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020081-t001">Table 1</xref> we list the number of genes in each category for a representative set of microbial genomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref> for a full list).</p><p>SVGs are subdivided into different types depending on whether they have one, two, or more variable regions. The number of genes with a single variable region is much larger than the number of genes with multiple ones. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A we show the variation profile of an SVG containing one variable region. The variation profile is displayed together with conserved subsequences identified using the Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Bateman1">Bateman et al. 2002</xref>), BLOCKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Henikoff1">Henikoff et al. 1999</xref>), and PRINTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Attwood1">Attwood et al. 2003</xref>) databases. This gene is the cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferase, M.HpyAVIB, from <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. pylori</named-content>. The variability lies in its DNA recognition domain (approximately 140 amino acids), which in this case recognizes the DNA sequence CCTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Lin1">Lin et al. 2001</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g001">Figure 1</xref>B we give an example with two variable regions. It is the virulence-associated protein homolog VacB from <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. pylori</named-content>, which has variable regions at both its N-terminus (approximately 200 amino acids) and C-terminus (approximately 100 amino acids). <italic>VacB</italic> has been shown to encode a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exoribonuclease and is necessary for expression of virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Cheng4">Cheng and Deutscher 2002</xref>). The conserved central region (approximately 400 amino acids (Pfam domain: RNB) defines a group of homologs distributed in a number of microbial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Zuo1">Zuo and Deutscher 2001</xref>). Note that the C-terminal region is variable, and its <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> homolog contains RNA-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Zuo1">Zuo and Deutscher 2001</xref>). Although the detailed physiological roles of VacB remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Cheng4">Cheng and Deutscher 2002</xref>), the variable regions may contribute to the determination of substrate specificity of VacB in the RNA quality-control process that eliminates defective ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules in different species.</p><p>The number of SVGs increases as genome sizes vary, from 0.5 MB<italic>(Mycoplasma genitalium</italic>) to 8.6 MB<italic>(Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020081-t001">Table 1</xref>). For most microorganisms included, the proportion of SVGs varies in the range of 10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025;. The number of lineage-specific genes, on the other hand, does not appear to correlate with the genome size. Instead, it is influenced by the content of the database. For instance, a &#x0201c;minimal&#x0201d; genome, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. genitalium</named-content>, has a relatively high content of SVGs (20&#x00025;) and a low percentage of lineage-specific genes (0.2&#x00025;). However, when a closely related species, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. pneumoniae</named-content>, is excluded from the database, its proportion of lineage-specific genes rises to 14&#x00025;, while the proportion of SVGs remains unchanged. In general, the genomic proportion of SVGs is less affected by the database content.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Case Studies of SVGs and Functional Implication of Variability</title><p>In the following sections, we have selected several SVG families to demonstrate the functional implication of segmental variability.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Outer-membrane signal transduction genes/sensor histidine kinases</title><p>In prokaryotes, two-component signal-transducing systems are common and consist of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator. Most HKs are membrane-bound, homodimeric proteins with an N-terminal periplasmic sensing domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase domain. HKs usually possess a highly variable sensing domain (usually over 150 amino acids), while the cytoplasmic kinase domain is quite conserved. By diversifying the sensing domain, microorganisms can develop different two-component modules to respond to different signals and interact with small molecules from the exterior. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g003">Figure 3</xref> displays the distance matrix calculated from the sensing domains and the kinase domains from a group of highly similar HK genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g003">Figure 3</xref>, sensing domains are much more diverse than the kinase domains. Moreover, the two regions show distinct clustering patterns, of which only the one for the conserved kinase domains is close to the phylogenetic relationship inferred from 16S rRNA sequences (data not shown). Significant homologies in the sensing regions can only be found in closely related species (e.g., <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ralstonia solanacearum</named-content> &#x0005b;Rs&#x0005d; and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ralstonia metallidurans</named-content> &#x0005b;Rm&#x0005d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g003">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting rapid divergence after speciation. Other sensor genes involved in cell motility<italic>,</italic> e.g., genes encoding methyl-accepting chemotactic protein (MCP) (see <italic>tlpA, tlpC</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g002">Figure 2</xref>), are also highly variable in their N-terminal domains. In several bacteria<italic>,</italic> e.g., <named-content content-type="genus-species">Vibrio cholerae</named-content>, there is a greater number of segmentally variable MCP genes (approximately 40) than in other genomes (see the gene list of <named-content content-type="genus-species">V. cholerae</named-content> at <ext-link xlink:href="http://geneva.bu.edu)" ext-link-type="uri">http://geneva.bu.edu)</ext-link>, which must correspond to its expanded ability to detect different chemical signals and find favorable environments. Although a few conserved motifs have been detected in the sensing region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Galperin2">Galperin et al. 2001</xref>), the exact sensing signals for most prokaryotic HKs are unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Transporter genes and outer-membrane proteins</title><p>The biggest family of SVGs is cell envelope-related, including the ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), outer-membrane proteins, and virulence-related gene products. For membrane proteins, since part of their sequences are exposed to the outside of the cell and interact directly with the environment, one might hypothesize that the variable portions have evolved rapidly to deal with the changing environmental conditions.</p><p>ABC transporters are essential for microorganisms because they import nutrients into the cell and export noxious substances and toxins out of the cell. A typical ABC transporter gene in a prokaryote genome has a conserved ATPase domain (approximately 150 amino acids) and a large (over 300 amino acids) variable integral membrane domain. Two examples from this group are the multidrug-resistance genes <italic>hetA</italic> and <italic>spaB</italic> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g002">Figure 2</xref>. It is known that substrates interact with the specific binding sites inside the membrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Holland1">Holland and Blight 1999</xref>), which suggests that the variability in the membrane domain may have to do with substrate selectivity or with different transport kinetics. Moreover, outer-membrane transporters are binding targets for bacteriophages and bacterial toxins. For example, the vitamin B12 transporter BtuB (614 amino acids) is the receptor for bacteriophage BF23 and E-colicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Bradbeer1">Bradbeer et al. 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Mohanty1">Mohanty et al. 2003</xref>). The crystal structure of BtuB in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> has been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Chimento1">Chimento et al. 2003</xref>). The variable region in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> BtuB overlaps with the 22-strand &#x003b2;-barrel (position 150&#x02013;360), while the N-terminal hatch domain (position 6&#x02013;132) and the extreme C-terminal TonB-box domain (position 550&#x02013;614) are conserved among many homologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The extracellular loops between contiguous strands in the &#x003b2;-barrel are displayed outside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Chimento1">Chimento et al. 2003</xref>) and possibly serve as receptor sites for bacteriophages and toxins. The variability in these loops may be driven by attempts to defend against bacteriophages and interaction with different bacterial toxins.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>DNA/RNA-processing enzymes</title><p>DNA/RNA processing enzymes form another large family of SVGs. Characteristic examples are the restriction and modification enzymes, where the DNA methylases have a variable region designed for DNA sequence recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Cheng2">Cheng 1995</xref>) and the restriction enzymes are almost completely variable. Here we discuss two other genes: DNA gyrase B (<italic>gyrB</italic>) and DNA topoisomerase A (<italic>topA</italic>), whose competing actions control the degree of DNA supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Tse-Dinh1">Tse-Dinh et al. 1997</xref>). Schematic alignments anchored by the conserved motifs from the BLOCKS database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Henikoff1">Henikoff et al. 1999</xref>) for both enzymes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g004">Figure 4</xref>. The variable region in GyrB is an additional approximately 160 amino acids long segment that is only present in the gram-negative eubacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Experiments probing the role of this region in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> GyrB have demonstrated its involvement in DNA binding, although the detailed function is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Chatterji1">Chatterji et al. 2000</xref>). We suspect that variability in this inserted domain may determine the specificity of the interaction between GyrB and DNA or suggest interaction with other molecules. It is intriguing to see that other gyrases lacking this region are also functional.</p><p>For TopA, the N-terminal region of approximately 600 amino acids shows extensive sequence similarity while the C-terminal region (over 100 amino acids) is variable both in sequence content and in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The conserved N-terminal region of TopA has the catalytic function of relaxing negatively supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Feinberg1">Feinberg et al. 1999</xref>). The variable C-terminus of TopA sometimes contains multiple copies of zinc-binding motifs, although there are a few exceptions, e.g., TopA in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Interestingly, there are two copies of TopA in <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. pylori</named-content> 26695; one has three zinc-binding motifs in C-terminal region and the other does not. The zinc-binding motifs in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> TopA are shown to be involved in the interaction with the &#x003b2;&#x02032; subunit of RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Cheng1">Cheng et al. 2003</xref>) and in DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Ahumada1">Ahumada and Tse-Dinh 1998</xref>). Since RNA polymerase &#x003b2;&#x02032; subunit is a fully conserved gene, the overall sequence variation in the C-terminal region of TopA seems more likely to relate to DNA binding. TopA plays an important role in adaptation to environmental challenges, such as heat shock conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Tse-Dinh1">Tse-Dinh et al. 1997</xref>). Deletion experiments show that in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> the C-terminal region is important for the in vivo function of TopA during the osmotic stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Cheng1">Cheng et al. 2003</xref>). All together, these facts suggest a versatile role that the C-terminal region of TopA might play in those processes.</p><p>Variable regions are sometimes found in DNA processing enzymes with essential and conserved functions. One example is DNA polymerase I, which has a variable region between the conserved C-terminal 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; polymerase domain and the N-terminal 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease domain. In some polymerases, this region encodes a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity for proofreading replication errors, and conserved motifs can be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Derbyshire1">Derbyshire et al. 1995</xref>). However, other polymerases in the same family that lack such proofreading activity show much sequence divergence in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Derbyshire1">Derbyshire et al. 1995</xref>). The exact reason why sequence variability is observed in these polymerases is unknown.</p><p>Another interesting family is the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Ibba1">Ibba and S&#x000f6;ll 2000</xref>). This family of genes is well known for its precision in substrate selection. The molecules known to interact with AARS include tRNA, amino acids, and ATP. Since the same amino acids and ATP molecules are found in all organisms, variability inside the AARS sequences must relate to the recognition and interaction with the tRNAs. Correspondingly, each AARS usually contains a conserved domain for catalysis and acceptor helix interaction and a nonconserved domain that interacts with the variable distal parts of its substrate tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Schimmel1">Schimmel et al. 1993</xref>). For instance, in bacterial-type prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS), the N-terminal catalytic domain (approximately 200 amino acids) and the C-terminal anticodon-binding domain (approximately 150 amino acids) are highly conserved, while a less conserved region of about 180 amino acids is inserted between them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). This variable domain shows similarity to the YbaK domain, which is thought to be involved in oligonucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Zhang1">Zhang et al. 2000</xref>). Sporadic conserved residues in this region of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ProRS are known to be involved in the posttransfer editing for mischarged Ala-tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Wong1">Wong et al. 2002</xref>). ProRS is also known to possess an inherent ability to mischarge cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Ahel1">Ahel et al. 2002</xref>). Partial deletion of this variable region of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> ProRS results in a lower rate of proline acylation to cysteine acylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Ahel1">Ahel et al. 2002</xref>), suggesting a possible role of substrate discrimination in this region. Thus, the variability in this inserted domain of ProRS appears to contribute to substrate recognition and the editing function of the enzyme. Intriguingly, ProRS in <italic>Methanococcus jannaschii,</italic> which does not have this inserted region, also possesses editing abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Beuning1">Beuning and Musier-Forsyth 2001</xref>). As a result, there is a possibility that this region may have another unknown function, e.g., interaction with other undetected molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><title>Carbohydrate active enzymes</title><p>Variable regions exist in carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, such as glycosyltransferases (GTs) and glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which respectively catalyze the biosynthesis of diverse glycoconjugates and their selective cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Bourne1">Bourne and Henrissat 2001</xref>). Many pathogens express outer-membrane glycosylated oligosaccharides, which closely interact with the host environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Saxon1">Saxon and Bertozzi 2001</xref>). For example, they even mimic host cell surface glycoconjugates to evade immune recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Persson1">Persson et al. 2001</xref>). Both GTs and GHs have been classified into subfamilies based on sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Bourne1">Bourne and Henrissat 2001</xref>). Structural studies on bacterial GTs from different subfamilies always reveal two-domain molecules, such as LgtC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Persson1">Persson et al. 2001</xref>), GtfB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Mulichak1">Mulichak et al. 2001</xref>), MurG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Hu1">Hu et al. 2003</xref>), and SpsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Charnock1">Charnock and Davies 1999</xref>), with one domain responsible for donor molecule (usually nucleotide-diphospho-sugar) binding and the other domain involved in acceptor sugar molecule binding. These genes exhibit great variability in the acceptor-binding domains and conservation in the donor-binding domains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref> for the example of GtfB), which agrees with the relatively limited types of donor species (usually UDP/TDP-sugar) and their conserved binding modes, but a diversity of acceptor molecules (LgtC: lactose; GtfB: vancomycin aglycone; MurG: <italic>N</italic>-acetyl muramyl pentapeptide; SpsA: unknown). Owing to the lack of homology in the acceptor binding domains, the substrate specificities encoded by these regions for most GTs are still unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2b5"><title>Transcriptional regulators</title><p>Prokaryotic transcriptional regulators form another large group of SVGs. Transcription regulators are usually two-domain proteins with one binding to DNA and one binding to ligand. The DNA-binding domains, which usually interact with DNA via helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix, zinc-finger, or other modes, are more conserved than ligand-binding domains. Based on the characteristic conserved DNA-binding domains, transcriptional regulators can be classified into many different families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Nguyen1">Nguyen and Saier 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Rigali1">Rigali et al. 2002</xref>). Even within each family, the ligand-binding domains are variable. For instance, the C-terminal regions involved in effector molecule binding and oligomerization (E-b/O) inside the GntR transcriptional regulator family are highly variable both in sequence content and in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Rigali1">Rigali et al. 2002</xref>). The variability in the effector molecule-binding domains enables the transcriptional regulators to sense the presence of diverse ligands and signal the regulation of the downstream genes or operons accordingly. As in most previous cases, these variable regions remain functionally uncharacterized.</p></sec><sec id="s2b6"><title>Hypothetical genes</title><p>In addition to genes with functional annotations, our method identifies a number of SVGs with unknown or hypothetical annotations in each genome (<named-content content-type="genus-species">H. pylori</named-content>: 17 genes; <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content>: 32 genes; <named-content content-type="genus-species">V. cholerae</named-content>: 69 genes, etc.; see <ext-link xlink:href="http://geneva.bu.edu" ext-link-type="uri">http://geneva.bu.edu</ext-link> for the full list). In contrast to lineage-specific hypothetical genes, these hypothetical genes contain conserved domains, which suggest their functional importance. Although most of the conserved domains in these hypothetical genes have currently unknown function, there are a few exceptions. Among them are the prokaryotic mechanosensitive channel proteins, which respond to external osmotic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Pivetti1">Pivetti et al. 2003</xref>). Examples include the 343 amino acid long <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> B1330 and 371 amino acid long <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content> YhdY, both of which are currently annotated as &#x0201c;hypothetical.&#x0201d; However, they both have the characteristic domain of mechanosensitive proteins (Pfam domain: MS&#x0005f;channel). The central regions (approximately 150 amino acids) of these genes are conserved while both the N-terminal region (approximately 100 amino acids) and the C-terminal region (approximately 100 amino acids) are variable (see alignment in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>). The conserved central region encodes three transmembrane segments, and the molecules are predicted to have their N-terminus outside and C-terminus inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Miller1">Miller et al. 2003</xref>). Although the C-terminus is variable, the deletion experiments show that it is indispensable for stability and activity of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Miller1">Miller et al. 2003</xref>). It is tempting to hypothesize that the interacting partners for both N- and C-termini might vary in different organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Functional Classification of SVGs</title><p>We are interested in probing the functional distribution of SVGs within a single genome.

Among them, only categories (i) and (ii) are overrepresented in all three genomes. Most functional categories involved in the basic metabolic processes are not significantly overrepresented or even underrepresented. The number of overrepresented categories and the order of significance differ from one genome to another, reflecting differences in genome content and presumably the relative importance of the different specific adaptations.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g006">Figure 6</xref> we show the relative abundance of a set of SVG families in several microorganisms based on shared keywords in the annotations.

We thus asked the following questions: (1) What is the distribution of paralogous genes in the set of SVGs in a single genome? (2) Is there a significant association between gene duplication and SVGs?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, we show the distribution of paralogous genes among SVGs in several genomes. We consider paralogous genes to be similar genes in the same genome with a BLAST <italic>E</italic>-value less than 1<italic>E</italic>-5.

For all genomes examined, there is a strong association between gene duplication and SVGs, suggesting an SVG is more likely to have originated from a duplicated gene.</p><p>Here we give an interesting example where one paralogous copy of a gene is segmentally variable and the other copy is fully conserved. In <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. pylori</named-content> strain 26695, gene products of <italic>HP1299</italic> (253 amino acids) and <italic>HP1037</italic> (357 amino acids) both have a conserved domain (approximately 250 amino acids; Pfam: Peptidase&#x0005f;M24) that is characteristic of the methionyl aminopeptidase (<italic>map</italic>) family (metalloprotease family M24) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Rawlings1">Rawlings and Barrett 1995</xref>). <italic>HP1299</italic> is fully conserved in a number of microbes and is homologous to the <italic>E. coli map</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>), while the product of <italic>HP1037</italic> has an extra N-terminal region (approximately 100 amino acids) that is variable among its similar genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg006">Figure S6</xref>). Additionally, <italic>HP1037</italic> is annotated as a conserved hypothetical gene. The five residues found in the <italic>E. coli map</italic> that are involved in cobalt (Co<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) binding (Asp-97, Asp-108, His-177, Glu-204, Glu-235; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Rawlings1">Rawlings and Barrett 1995</xref>), are conserved in both genes by examining the multiple alignment.

Some work has gone into cataloging the groups of lineage-specific proteins that show no similarity to other proteins in GenBank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Galperin1">Galperin and Koonin 1999</xref>), but there the route to assigning function usually needs experimental approaches requiring biochemistry or genetics or more rarely by determining the crystal structure of the gene product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Zhang1">Zhang et al. 2000</xref>). Unfortunately, current bioinformatics methods are only occasionally helpful in suggesting where to begin such studies.</p><p>In this paper we have initiated an effort to identify SVGs, which contain both well-conserved regions and highly variable regions. By looking carefully at a few specific examples where functional information is available from experimental data, we find that the variable region often seems to play a key role in mediating interactions with other molecules, both large and small. Sometimes the variable portions are involved in biological processes with a component of interaction between the cell and agents from the external environment. For instance, the DNA methyltransferases are part of a defense system that recognizes and clears invading foreign DNA; membrane-bound sensory HKs and mechanosensitive ion channels, etc., monitor changes of living conditions. Sometimes the variable portions are involved in intracellular processes that appear to have lineage-specific features. Thus, the variable regions inside DNA GyrB and several types of AARSs probably determine the specificity of substrate recognition. The detailed factors that introduce the molecular variability may go well beyond our explanations here and likely vary from case to case. Some variable regions may have diverged a long time ago and are now kept constant, while others may keep changing. In all of these cases, SVGs are exceptionally worthy targets of further experimental investigation, and such investigations can be greatly aided by the presence of the conserved regions that may suggest a preliminary function to be tested.</p><p>Why might certain genes contain these variable regions? Could they be simply relics left over during evolution and now serve no purpose? Are they just &#x0201c;pseudo-segments&#x0201d; with no function? There are several lines of evidence that support the hypothesis that when variable regions have been retained, they indeed serve a function. First, several studies have shown that deletions are, on average, more frequent than insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Halliday1">Halliday and Glickman 1991</xref>). As a result, if a region is evolving under weak functional constraints, it tends to get smaller over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Lipman1">Lipman et al. 2002</xref>). Second, in a special case, one can imagine that when a variable region occurs at the C-terminus of a protein and is not being selected, it is likely to suffer random mutations including nonsense mutations or insertions/deletions that cause a shift in reading frame. Thus, we searched GenBank release 136.0 for examples of genes that matched the conserved region of an SVG, but in which the C-terminus was missing or much shorter. The DNA sequences downstream of such hits were examined for similarity to the variable region in the query gene. Of the 83 SVGs with a C-terminal variable region in <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. pylori</named-content>, none of them had hits with a disrupting stop codon in the variable region; 20 of them have hits with genes showing insertions/deletions that cause frame shifts in the variable region. However, the real number is likely to be much fewer, since, based on previous work, many of them may be the results of sequencing errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Posfai1">Posfai and Roberts 1992</xref>).</p><p>In other cases, we find that some proteins have lost the variable segment in a subset of genomes. For instance, in ProRSs, the variable segment is absent in archaea; in GyrB, the variable segment is absent in the Gram-positive bacteria. Clearly in those cases the organisms can get by without the variable domain, although they may have a compensating function in a different gene. But this again does not imply that the variable region has no function in those genes that have retained it.</p><p>SVGs are distinct from sequences with shuffled domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Doolittle1">Doolittle 1995</xref>) in that the variable region is bounded by the same sets of conserved portions, while domain shuffling usually manifests itself in a different sequential order of conserved domains. We also hypothesize that the variable regions in SVGs are not the result of multiple domain fusion events, each resulting in an insertion of a different sequence into the protein. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the fused domains are often conserved across multiple organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Marcotte1">Marcotte et al. 1999</xref>). Additionally, our procedure requires that the variable regions are of similar length within a family of proteins, which are also restricted to conserved length distributions. This filter suggests a mutational mechanism that originated from an ancient protein. Indeed, it is possible that originally the variable region was a result of a single or possibly relatively few ancient fusion events, but this paper does not focus on the evolutionary origin of SVGs.</p><p>Another prediction from our observations is that the variable regions are excellent candidates to bind substrates or partner macromolecules. They may be extremely helpful in discovering the networks of protein&#x02013;protein or protein&#x02013;nucleic acid interactions within a cell. Bioinformatics may even be able to help in this endeavor by finding genes that seem to have coevolving variable regions as a result of such interactions. Experimental data from techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid system or microarrays may provide evidence for interactions that can involve two variable regions.</p><p>Much additional bioinformatics work will be needed to explore fully the potential of this method in hypothesizing function. For instance, the size limits we have arbitrarily imposed on the variable region should be tested systematically. In our relatively simple formulation presented here, the length of the variable region and the number of proteins in the same family that do not have an alignment to the variable region are the primary factors in determining its statistical significance. Methods using other sequence analysis tools, such as multiple alignment and sequence profiles, may provide alternative ways to identify segmental pattern of variability. A fundamental problem is to differentiate random evolutionary drift from positive selection correlated to functional requirements. Although one might expect that the N- and C-termini may be more variable than the regions in the middle, our data suggest that variable regions in SVGs are not preferentially located in either end (data not shown). We have also examined the amino acid composition, codon usage, and GC content in the variable regions and the conserved regions of the same SVG. While there is no significant deviation of amino acid composition and GC content between the two regions in general, codon usage appears to be biased in the variable regions (data not shown).</p><p>SVGs usually account for 10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; of the total genes in a microbial genome. Currently, we think of the class of lineage-specific genes as being the key factor that distinguishes one strain or species from another. The class of SVGs that we have defined in this paper must now be added to this collection of lineage-specific genes by virtue of the unique segments that constitute their variable regions. They also appear to provide functional elements that help to differentiate among strains and species. This point is well illustrated by considering the restriction-modification systems. Here, the DNA methyltransferases, which have a variable region responsible for DNA recognition, are members of the SVG class. With the help of their companion restriction endonucleases, which typically appear as lineage-specific genes, they serve to keep foreign, unmodified DNA sequences from entering the genome. In this case, the synergy of function provided by members of the two classes highlights the key role that both sets of genes must play in defining the individuality of a strain or species.</p><p>Our analysis to date is limited to prokaryotes and archaea where SVGs are transcribed and translated as contiguous genomic segments. In eukaryotes, alternative RNA splicing introduces substantial additional complexity into the interpretation of gene structure and protein product, thereby rendering impossible the simple analysis we have applied here. It is tempting to consider alternative splicing as a highly evolved control mechanism to introduce the variability we find in the SVGs and thereby achieve the functional diversity necessary for cell survival under different conditions. In eukaryotes, alternatively spliced exons can be introduced in response to the functional demands of different cell types by merely juggling protein coding regions in the genome, thereby creating an SVG structure. If this view is correct, then it reinforces and highlights the importance of these SVGs to the workings of the cell.</p><p>In this paper we have provided an initial glimpse of SVGs, which appear to provide an important genetic layer in the adaptation of cells to novel environments and hazardous pathogens. We have focused attention on the biological significance of these genes, especially those that have highly diverged segments. We are currently trying to develop a more refined classification of these genes so as to explore the functional significance of the variability. We would like to know whether extreme variability is required for diverse function or whether more modest variation is sufficient. Such questions require that we can first distinguish positive selection acting on these variable regions from neutral evolution leading to gene decay and eventual loss. Since the variable regions we report are often not amenable to current tools available for alignment, we are exploring new methods that will help us to assess whether positive selection is driving the evolution of these genes.</p><p>In summary, we have identified an extremely useful way of classifying genes that leads to the identification of those with a high priority for both experimental and computational research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><p>Our method for detecting SVGs includes several steps: (1) identification of similar genes followed by query-anchored multiple alignment using nongapped BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Altschul1">Altschul et al. 1990</xref>); (2) taxonomy clustering of similar genes to avoid bias; (3) detection of segmental variability.</p><sec id="s4a1"><title>Identification of similar genes</title><p>Given a gene, we start by searching for all its similar genes in the nonredundant database (GenBank release 136.0, 15 June 2003) using nongapped BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Altschul1">Altschul et al. 1990</xref>). We use the nongapped BLAST because the gapless high scoring pairs (HSPs) reported are rather conservative. The gapped BLAST, however, tends to extend HSPs over variable regions, which has been observed in several examples (e.g., DNA-recognition domain in cytosine-specific methyltransferase; data not shown). Two criteria are used to define close similarity. First, the <italic>E</italic>-value is less than 1<italic>E</italic>-10. Here we use a strict <italic>E</italic>-value threshold to avoid possible functional divergence among the homologs. Accordingly, we use the BLOSUM80 scoring matrix in the BLASTP search, although the result does not change dramatically if BLOSUM62 is used. Second, the overall length of the hit sequence does not differ significantly from the query sequence. We define the gap content (GapC) between two sequences:</p><p><disp-formula id="pbio-0020081-e001"><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020081.e001.jpg" position="float" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>L,l</italic> are the lengths of the protein sequences of two genes. It is a measure of the smallest percentage of gaps needed to be introduced into the pairwise alignment.

By doing taxonomy clustering, we are able to collect a less biased sample of similar genes from different species.</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Detection of segmental variability</title><p>Query-anchored multiple alignment after taxonomy clustering is performed by aligning the HSPs reported by nongapped BLAST (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref> and <ext-link xlink:href="http://geneva.bu.edu)" ext-link-type="uri">http://geneva.bu.edu)</ext-link>. Two unaligned regions in two sequences are considered as the variable regions if they are bounded by similar HSPs at both ends (or one end, if the unaligned region is at the terminus of the gene). To avoid the possibility of a large segment containing insertions or deletions, we again require that GapC be less than 0.2 between these two unaligned regions.</p><p>For each amino acid position in the query gene, we can count the number of times <italic>(m)</italic> it is inside an HSP region and the number of times <italic>(n)</italic> it is inside a variable region. A high ratio of <italic>n</italic> over <italic>m</italic> &#x0002b; <italic>n</italic> suggests that this position is inside the variable region most of the time. We estimate the statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>-value) of the variability for each position by a binomial distribution:</p><p><disp-formula id="pbio-0020081-e002"><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020081.e002.jpg" position="float" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>q</italic> is the probability of an amino acid position being inside a HSP region. We estimate <italic>q</italic> by averaging the proportion of HSP in each hit sequence among all hits. If the <italic>p</italic>-value calculated using the above formula is less than the significance level, which we set at 0.05, we then consider this position as a variable position; otherwise, it is a conserved position. A consecutive run of variable positions forms a variable region. The next question is how long the variable region should be to be considered meaningful, as opposed to functionally unimportant regions such as linker regions, which are usually short. From our experience, there is no clear decision boundary between the length of the region and its functional importance. Any choice of cutoffs would have to balance between false positives and false negatives. However, previous studies on the length distribution of protein domains has shown that the most likely length of a protein domain is around 70 amino acids, and regions shorter than this are less likely to form a functional domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Wheelan1">Wheelan et al. 2000</xref>). Based on this, we chose 70 amino acids as the length threshold for a variable region to be considered functionally important. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg007">Figure S7</xref>, we show the length distribution of the variable regions in all genes of <italic>H. pylori.</italic></p><p>A direct way of visualizing the variability of a protein sequence is by calculating the ratio of <italic>n</italic> over (<italic>m</italic> &#x0002b; <italic>n</italic>) for each position and plotting it. We call such plots variability profiles. Sample variability profiles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g001">Figure 1</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, two obvious peaks are present: one from position 20 to 70, the other from position 160 to 300. The latter (approximately 140 amino acids) forms a separate DNA recognition domain, while the former (approximately 50 amino acids) has no known function. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g001">Figure 1</xref> we also show conserved subsequences from the Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Bateman1">Bateman et al. 2002</xref>), BLOCKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Henikoff1">Henikoff et al. 1999</xref>), and PRINTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020081-Attwood1">Attwood et al. 2003</xref>) databases. The BLOCKS and PRINTS databases are relatively conservative in defining motifs. However, the Pfam domain seems to include the variable region within the conserved region, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Data Deposit</title><p>We provide a static collection of segmentally variable genes at our Web site, <ext-link xlink:href="http://geneva.bu.edu" ext-link-type="uri">http://geneva.bu.edu</ext-link>.

RJR also hypothesized the notion of three classes of genes. Originally, the genes studied in the paper were described as mosaic genes; however, owing to a conflict with a previously defined structural class of proteins, the name was changed to segmentally variable genes (SVGs), although the authors still feel that the term mosaic genes captures the concept proposed. SK and YZ proposed the term &#x0201c;the adaptation layer of the microbial proteome.&#x0201d; All the authors participated in the high-level design of the computational analysis software; however, the specific variant described in this paper was primarily designed by YZ. This design is still evolving and will be described in follow-up publications. YZ implemented the computational pipeline that supported the computational analysis described in this paper. All the authors participated in the analysis and the interpretation of the results. The Web server was implemented by YZ. All the authors participated in the write-up and numerous revisions of the text.</p></fn><fn id="n3" fn-type="edited-by"><p>Academic Editor: Ford Doolittle, Dalhousie University</p></fn></fn-group></back></article>
