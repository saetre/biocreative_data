Such biological actions of IL-6 are characterised by both the activation and the inhibition of gene transcription. Unfortunately, in contrast to gene activation, the mechanism by which IL-6 suppresses transcription remains largely unclear. We have, therefore, investigated this aspect using the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-&#x003b1; (C/EBP&#x003b1;) gene promoter as a model. We show by transient transfection assays of various promoter&#x02013;luciferase DNA constructs into hepatoma cells that a C/EBP recognition sequence in the proximal promoter region is essential for the IL-6-mediated repression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that C/EBP&#x003b1; was the major protein that bound to this site and, consistent with its expression pattern, the binding was reduced when the cells were exposed to IL-6. Co-transfection assays revealed for the first time that the ability of C/EBP&#x003b1;, but not C/EBP&#x003b2; or Sp1, to transactivate the promoter was decreased dramatically when the cells were incubated with IL-6. These studies, therefore, identify a novel mechanism for IL-6-mediated repression of gene transcription that involves a reduction in C/EBP&#x003b1;-mediated activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that mediates a variety of functions in different tissues/cell types, including growth and differentiation of haematopoietic cells, proliferation of hepatocytes, mesangial cells and keratinocytes, regulation of acute-phase protein synthesis in the liver and osteoclast development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c4">4</xref>). The cytokine can also act in a negative manner by inhibiting the proliferation or differentiation of some cell types and acting protectively in certain diseases by counteracting the manifestation of specific inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c6">6</xref>). The levels of IL-6 are elevated in several pathophysiological conditions (e.g. acute-phase response, certain neurological conditions and pathogenic infections, multiple myelomas) and the cytokine has been implicated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c3">3</xref>).</p><p>The actions of IL-6 are characterised by the transcriptional activation and suppression of numerous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c10">10</xref>). The signal transduction pathways and the transcription factors that are involved in the IL-6-mediated induction of the expression of such genes have been deciphered in detail in the last few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c3">3</xref>). Thus, the cytokine activates gene transcription predominantly through the JAK&#x02013;STAT (Janus kinase&#x02013;signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c3">3</xref>). The activation of STATs in such cases is transient and several mechanisms have been identified for their inactivation, including dephosphorylation, proteasome degradation and feedback inhibition through the induction of suppressor-of-cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c3">3</xref>). Activation of such SOCS proteins has also been implicated in the inhibition of IL-6 signalling by certain extracellular mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Despite the recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the IL-6-mediated activation of gene transcription, very little is known about the intracellular signalling pathways and the transcription factors through which this cytokine directly suppresses gene expression. Further studies on this aspect are required in light of the potential importance of such regulation. For example, IL-6 inhibits the transcription of several genes during the acute phase response in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c8">8</xref>). Apart from gene-specific biological actions, such regulation is necessary to allow for an increased synthesis of positive acute-phase proteins without changing the overall rate of protein synthesis in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c8">8</xref>). In addition, the transcription of key genes that promote growth is decreased during the IL-6-mediated inhibition of cellular proliferation or activation of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c3">3</xref>). Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory action of IL-6 in certain conditions involves the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c6">6</xref>). It is, therefore, essential that further studies are carried out on the mechanisms by which IL-6 inhibits the expression of genes, particularly those that code for key transcription factors. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-&#x003b1; (C/EBP&#x003b1;) falls in this category.</p><p>C/EBP&#x003b1; belongs to a family of transcription factors that all contain a highly conserved basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain at the C-terminus, which is required for DNA binding and subunit dimerisation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref> for a recent review). In contrast, the N-termini of these proteins, which carry the regulatory and <italic>trans</italic>-activation domains, are quite divergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>). Six distinct C/EBP isoforms have been identified to date (C/EBP&#x003b1; to &#x003b6;) with the majority of these able to recognise similar DNA sequences, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, activate gene transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> and form heterodimers in intrafamilial combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>). Additionally, in the case of C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2;, polypeptides of different sizes and <italic>trans</italic>-activating capabilities can be produced either by alternative use of translational initiation codons or by limited proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>). For example, two polypeptides of 42 (p42) and 30 kDa (p30) can be produced from the C/EBP&#x003b1; mRNA, with the latter having a lower <italic>trans</italic>-activation potential than the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>). In the case of C/EBP&#x003b2;, at least four isoforms can be produced: full-length (FL) C/EBP&#x003b2; (38 kDa), 35 kDa LAP (liver-enriched transcriptional activating protein), 20 kDa LIP (liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein) and a smaller 16 kDa isoform. Because the low molecular weight isoform, LIP, lacks most of the <italic>trans</italic>-activation domain but contains an intact DNA binding and dimerisation domain, it has been proposed to function as a dominant negative regulator of FL or LAP forms of C/EBP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c15">15</xref>).</p><p>The function of C/EBP&#x003b1; has recently been investigated in detail using a number of approaches and has revealed key roles for the factor in the control of growth, differentiation and metabolism along with the responses mediated by cytokines, particularly in hepatocytes, adipocytes and myelomonocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>). On the other hand, studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of C/EBP&#x003b1; gene transcription have been limited to the action of thyroid hormone, inhibition by the proto-oncogene c-myc and autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c23">23</xref>). Thus, the action of thyroid hormone is mediated via a responsive element present at position &#x02013;602 to &#x02013;589 of the rat C/EBP&#x003b1; promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c16">16</xref>). The c-myc protein inhibits C/EBP&#x003b1; gene transcription through interaction with the core promoter region, although a discrepancy exists on the precise sequences that are required for the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c18">18</xref>). In relation to autoregulation, the mouse and the rat genes were first shown to be auto-activated through a C/EBP recognition sequence present in the proximal promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c21">21</xref>). In contrast, the promoter region of human C/EBP&#x003b1; lacks any C/EBP recognition sequence and autoregulation was shown to be mediated indirectly via a C/EBP&#x003b1;-mediated stimulation of upstream stimulatory factor (USF) binding to the proximal promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c22">22</xref>). More recently, we have characterised the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> C/EBP&#x003b1; (xC/EBP&#x003b1;) gene promoter and shown that, similar to the mouse and the rat counterpart, it is subject to direct autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c23">23</xref>).</p><p>In relation to the inhibition of C/EBP&#x003b1; gene transcription, it was shown recently that the levels of the LIP form of C/EBP&#x003b2; are elevated in the liver of mice following injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which causes the release of numerous cytokines from a number of cell types, and after partial hepatectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c24">24</xref>). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that this was accompanied by increased binding of the isoform to the C/EBP consensus site in the mouse C/EBP&#x003b1; promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c24">24</xref>). Because a reduction of C/EBP&#x003b1; mRNA levels occurs in both these biological situations, it was proposed that this increased binding of the repressor LIP may represent a potential mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c24">24</xref>). Unfortunately, no data were provided in this study on the functional importance of the C/EBP site by demonstrating, for example, that mutations in this sequence abolish the response and/or that the site can confer the response to a heterologous promoter. This point is particularly important given that Baer and Johnson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c25">25</xref>) have recently shown that truncated C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms can be generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> proteolysis during the isolation of tissue/cellular extracts, thereby suggesting that any findings on gene regulation based on LIP have to be interpreted with caution and need to be confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> by functional analysis. It is, therefore, important that further studies are carried out on understanding the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of C/EBP&#x003b1; gene expression.</p><p>In the present study, we show that the xC/EBP&#x003b1; promoter activity was also inhibited by IL-6, thereby indicating that the cytokine responsiveness was conserved between mammalian and amphibian promoters. In addition, we show that a C/EBP recognition sequence in the proximal promoter region was absolutely essential for the response and that the site interacted with C/EBP&#x003b1; but not other members of the family. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ability of C/EBP&#x003b1;, but not C/EBP&#x003b2; or Sp1 (specificity protein 1), to transactivate the promoter was inhibited by IL-6. These studies, therefore, provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which IL-6 inhibits gene transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The human hepatoma Hep3B cell line was from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures whereas recombinant IL-6 was from Peprotech.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f1">1</xref>A, addition of IL-6 to the cells resulted in an immediate and marked decrease in C/EBP&#x003b1; mRNA expression. In addition, there was a time-dependent decrease in the steady-state levels of both the p42 and p30 polypeptides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f1">1</xref>B). Such a decrease was specific to C/EBP&#x003b1; and not seen when western blot analysis was carried out with representative samples from the same experiment and probed with an antiserum against C/EBP&#x003b2;, which predominantly recognises the p38 polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c27">27</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f1">1</xref>C). Thus, the previously noted IL-6-mediated reduction of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c33">33</xref>) was also seen in Hep3B cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The activity of the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> C/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter in hepatocytes is decreased by IL-6</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; is decreased in the liver and a number of other tissues during the acute phase response, which is mainly mediated via IL-6, and that this effect occurs at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c35">35</xref>). In addition, IL-6 has been shown to inhibit C/EBP&#x003b1; gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c33">33</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f1">1</xref>). However, the action of this cytokine on the activity of the corresponding promoter has, as yet, not been determined. We have previously characterised the <italic>X.laevis</italic> C/EBP&#x003b1; (xC/EBP&#x003b1;) gene promoter in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c23">23</xref>). We, therefore, first evaluated its regulation by IL-6 using a luciferase-based construct containing the largest promoter fragment (&#x02013;1131/&#x0002b;41) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f2">2</xref>A) via transient transfection assays in Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c23">23</xref>). These cells have been used extensively for the analysis of promoter elements that are involved in both the constitutive and regulated expression of genes in hepatocytes from different species, including the C/EBP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c31">31</xref>). Indeed, we have shown previously that the activity of the C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b4; gene promoters in these cells is increased following exposure to IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c37">37</xref>). In contrast to these findings, the activity of the &#x02013;1131/&#x0002b;41 xC/EBP&#x003b1; promoter&#x02013;luciferase DNA construct was found to be reduced by &#x0223c;64&#x00025; when Hep3B cells were incubated with IL-6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f2">2</xref>B). This profile was, therefore, consistent with that seen at the level of gene expression and demonstrates that the &#x02013;1131/&#x0002b;41 region of the xC/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter contains sufficient information for the IL-6 response.</p><p>As part of our other studies, we have produced a number of DNA constructs containing specific deletions or mutations of the xC/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c23">23</xref>). We, therefore, decided to use these DNA constructs to rapidly delineate the minimal regulatory sequence(s) required for the action of IL-6. Thus, three further DNA constructs, containing 5&#x02032; truncations of the xC/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter in the pGL2-Basic vector (&#x02013;321/&#x0002b;41, &#x02013;204/&#x0002b;41 and &#x02013;121/&#x0002b;41) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f2">2</xref>A), were transfected into the Hep3B cell line and the reporter gene activity in cells that were either left untreated or exposed to IL-6 was determined. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f2">2</xref>B, an IL-6-dependent reduction in reporter gene activity of 64&#x02013;67&#x00025; was obtained with DNA constructs containing the &#x02013;321/&#x0002b;41 and the &#x02013;204/&#x0002b;41 region. In contrast, a further deletion to &#x02013;121 resulted in a loss of the IL-6-mediated suppression in promoter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f2">2</xref>B). These results, therefore, indicate that the minimal IL-6 suppressive elements (IL-6SEs) reside between the &#x02013;204 and the &#x02013;121 region of the promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>The C/EBP site in the promoter is responsible for the IL-6 response</title><p>The &#x02013;204 to the &#x02013;121 region of the xC/EBP&#x003b1; promoter contains a binding site for the C/EBPs, and we have previously shown that this site is essential for auto-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c23">23</xref>). As autoregulation is a critical control mechanism in the activation of the C/EBPs, including C/EBP&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>), we hypothesised that the C/EBP site in the xC/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter may also play a crucial role in the action of IL-6. If this were the case then mutation of the C/EBP site should prevent the IL-6-mediated reduction in reporter gene activity and multiple copies of this site, but not for any other transcription factors present downstream of position &#x02013;121, should be able to confer the IL-6 response to a heterologous promoter. We thus mutated the C/EBP site in the &#x02013;321/&#x0002b;41 context and carried out transient transfection assays in Hep3B cells. As expected from the requirement of the C/EBP site for autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c23">23</xref>), the mutation reduced the basal activity (i.e. in the absence of IL-6) by &#x0223c;77&#x00025; (data not shown). In addition, the IL-6-mediated decrease in the activity seen with the &#x02013;321/&#x0002b;41 promoter region was abolished (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f3">3</xref>A). In order to further confirm the importance of the C/EBP recognition sequence, DNA constructs containing four copies of the C/EBP site (&#x02013;171/&#x02013;163) and the Sp1 site (control: &#x02013;43/&#x02013;34) linked to the minimal SV40 promoter (designated as pC/EBPx4 and pSp1x4, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c23">23</xref>) were transfected into Hep3B cells and the reporter gene activity in untreated cells and those exposed to IL-6 was determined. The values obtained using the pGL2-Promoter vector were subtracted from those with the pC/EBPx4 and pSp1x4 constructs. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f3">3</xref>, exposure of the cells to IL-6 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the reporter gene activity of the pC/EBPx4 construct by &#x0223c;62&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f2">2</xref>B). In contrast, only a marginal reduction in reporter gene activity was seen with the pSp1x4 construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f3">3</xref>). These experiments, therefore, show that the C/EBP site in the xC/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter plays a crucial role in the IL-6 response.</p></sec><sec><title>The binding of proteins to the C/EBP recognition sequence is affected by IL-6</title><p>Having established that the C/EBP recognition sequence in the xC/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter is crucial for the IL-6 response, we next investigated the interaction of DNA binding proteins with this site by EMSA. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the Sp1 and NF-1 sites in the xC/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter were also included for comparative purposes. The radiolabelled oligonucleotides were incubated with whole cell extracts from Hep3B cells that were either left untreated or stimulated with IL-6 for various timed periods. With the C/EBP binding site oligonucleotide, two major DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were seen reproducibly in independent experiments (designated as C1 and C2 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f4">4</xref>A). The signal intensity from both complexes was high when extracts from untreated Hep3B cells were used and decreased dramatically when those from cells stimulated with IL-6 for 1 h were employed. The signal from complex C2 then remained about equal throughout the 24 h incubation period with IL-6. On the other hand, the signal from complex C1 remained constant until the 6 h point and then increased marginally. A similar profile was seen when nuclear extracts were used instead of whole cell extracts (data not shown). Such a decrease in DNA binding was specific to IL-6 since it was not seen when extracts from untreated Hep3B cells at the various time points were used for EMSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f4">4</xref>B). In addition, the IL-6 action was specific to the C/EBP site and not seen with an Sp1 or NF-1 binding site oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f4">4</xref>C and D, respectively).</p><p>The specificity of the DNA&#x02013;protein interactions seen in all the EMSA experiments was confirmed by competition assays. First, the binding of proteins to the C/EBP site with extracts from untreated cells was competed out by an excess of the corresponding sequence (self) or the C/EBP recognition sequence from the promoter of the C-reactive protein (CRP) or the &#x003b2;-casein genes but not by an NF-1 or Sp1 binding site oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f5">5</xref>A). Only a partial inhibition was obtained with the C/EBP recognition sequence from the CRP gene promoter because of its lower affinity for the C/EBPs compared to the site from the &#x003b2;-casein gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c29">29</xref>). Secondly, the interaction of proteins with the Sp1 binding site oligonucleotide could be competed out with an excess of the corresponding sequence and a consensus Sp1 binding site oligonucleotide, but not by an oligonucleotide containing the C/EBP recognition sequence from the &#x003b2;-casein gene promoter or the NF-1 binding site (data not shown). Finally, the binding to the NF-1 binding site oligonucleotide could be competed out by the corresponding sequence but not by that containing the Sp1 recognition sequence (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The binding of proteins to the C/EBP recognition sequence in the mouse C/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter is also decreased following exposure of the cells to IL-6</title><p>The mouse C/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter also contains a C/EBP recognition sequence that is essential for autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c20">20</xref>). We therefore wondered whether the IL-6-dependent reduction in the binding of proteins to the C/EBP recognition sequence in the xC/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter could also be seen with the site from the mouse promoter. This possibility was investigated using extracts from Hep3B cells that were either left untreated or exposed to IL-6 for representative time points. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f5">5</xref>B, two major DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were obtained when extracts from untreated cells were used. The signals from both these complexes were reduced markedly when extracts from cells incubated with IL-6 for 1 h were used and then either remained constant or increased marginally.</p></sec><sec><title>C/EBP&#x003b1; is the predominant protein that interacts with the C/EBP recognition sequence</title><p>We next decided to employ supershift assays to identify the nature of the proteins that were responsible for the formation of the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes with the C/EBP binding site oligonucleotide, the intensity of which decreases within 1 h of incubation of the cells with IL-6 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f4">4</xref>A). For these assays, extracts were used from untreated cells and antisera against C/EBP-&#x003b1;, -&#x003b2; (two different sources), -&#x003b4; and -&#x003b6;. Antiserum against C/EBP&#x003b6; was included because it can act as a repressor of gene transcription mediated by the activating forms of the C/EBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>). In addition, the non-immune serum and antiserum against Sp1 were included as controls. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f5">5</xref>C, an inhibition of the formation of the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes and the appearance of a slower migrating antibody&#x02013;DNA&#x02013;protein supershift complex was only obtained with antisera against C/EBP&#x003b1;. These results therefore indicate that the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were composed predominantly of C/EBP&#x003b1;, and rule out a potential involvement of the inhibitory LIP isoform of C/EBP&#x003b2; or the repressor C/EBP&#x003b6; in the IL-6 response.</p></sec><sec><title>The ability of C/EBP&#x003b1; to activate the transcription of its own gene is inhibited by IL-6</title><p>Given that the action of IL-6 was unlikely to be mediated through the inhibitory forms of C/EBP isoforms, we wondered whether the ability of C/EBP&#x003b1; to activate its own promoter was affected by IL-6. This was investigated by co-transfection experiments using a CMV-based pCS2&#x0002b; vector expressing the <italic>Xenopus</italic> C/EBP&#x003b1; (xC/EBP&#x003b1;) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c23">23</xref>) and the luciferase-based plasmid containing the &#x02013;321/&#x0002b;41 region of the xC/EBP&#x003b1; gene promoter. Similar experiments with the pCS2&#x0002b; vector expressing the LAP form of C/EBP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c23">23</xref>) and CMV-based expression plasmid specifying for Sp1 were included for comparative purposes. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f6">6</xref>A, co-transfection of xC/EBP&#x003b1; produced an &#x0223c;7.5-fold increase in promoter activity. Exposure of the cells to IL-6 resulted in a dramatic reduction in this activity, which was only &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of the activity obtained with the expression plasmid in the absence of the cytokine. Such a dramatic reduction of promoter activity in the presence of IL-6 was specific to C/EBP&#x003b1;. In the case of the LAP form of C/EBP&#x003b2;, a 4-fold induction in the promoter activity was seen, which remained unchanged in the presence of IL-6. Finally, although the Sp1 expression plasmid produced a 3-fold increase in promoter activity, no significant changes were seen in the presence of IL-6.</p><p>In order to investigate whether the IL-6-mediated reduction in the ability of C/EBP&#x003b1; to <italic>trans</italic>-activate could also be seen with multiple copies of the C/EBP site linked to the heterologous SV40 promoter, the experiment was repeated using the pC/EBPx4 construct. A similar experiment using the pSp1x4 construct and the Sp1 expression plasmid was also included for comparative purposes. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f6">6</xref>B, co-transfection of both C/EBP isoforms produced an increase in reporter gene activity. For C/EBP&#x003b1; this activity was reduced in the presence of IL-6. In contrast, the activation seen by the expression plasmid coding for the LAP form of xC/EBP&#x003b2; was augmented by IL-6. Finally, no significant IL-6-dependent changes in the action of the Sp1 expression plasmid was seen when the experiment was carried out using the pSp1x4 DNA construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f6">6</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The expression of the C/EBP&#x003b1; gene has been shown to be inhibited during several pathophysiological conditions, including the acute-phase response, liver regeneration, diabetes mellitus and hepatocellular carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c40">40</xref>). These diseases are characterised by perturbations in the local and circulating levels of several cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c41">41</xref>) including IL-6, a major inhibitor of C/EBP&#x003b1; gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c35">35</xref>). However, no studies have yet been carried out that have investigated the mechanisms by which IL-6 suppresses the expression of this gene. This statement is also generally applicable to the majority of genes whose expression is inhibited by this cytokine. We have identified here a novel mechanism for the action of this cytokine on C/EBP&#x003b1; gene transcription that involves an inhibition of autoregulation via a reduction in the ability of the factor to activate the proximal promoter region.</p><p>As far as the suppression of gene transcription by the C/EBPs is concerned, two isoforms have been found to play a prominent role: the LIP form of C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>). For example, during adipocyte differentiation, C/EBP&#x003b6; has been shown to interact with, and thereby repress, the action of other C/EBP isoforms by heterodimerisation, thereby delaying the activation of C/EBP&#x003b1; during adipogenesis until the mitotic clonal expansion is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c42">42</xref>). In addition, during the LPS-induced acute-phase response in the liver and following partial hepatectomy, the expression of LIP has been found to be induced and this is associated with its increased binding to the C/EBP consensus site found within the mouse C/EBP&#x003b1; promoter <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c24">24</xref>). It has been postulated, therefore, that this might in turn be responsible for the inhibition of C/EBP&#x003b1; promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c24">24</xref>). In contrast to this study, EMSA using extracts from IL-6-treated Hep3B cells during periods when the expression of the C/EBP&#x003b1; gene was decreasing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f1">1</xref>) showed that there was a cytokine-dependent reduction in the binding of factors to the site and that C/EBP&#x003b1; was the major isoform that was engaged in DNA&#x02013;protein interactions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f5">5</xref>). A major limitation of the previous study, which implicated LIP in the suppression of mouse C/EBP&#x003b1; gene transcription during the LPS-induced acute phase response and partial hepatectomy, was that it relied mainly on DNA&#x02013;protein interaction studies, and thereby lacked functional data on the importance of the C/EBP recognition sequences in the responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c24">24</xref>). Thus, studies were not carried out to investigate whether mutations of the C/EBP site curtail the responses and/or if multimers of the site confer the responses to a heterologous promoter. This point is particularly important because it has been shown that the production of LIP can be an artefact of the conditions of cell culture or preparation of extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c25">25</xref>). It has been suggested, therefore, that the presence of LIP in cell extracts must be interpreted with caution and the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of these isoforms should be re-evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c25">25</xref>). An additional limitation of models based on LIP is that most systems where increased expression of LIP has been noted (e.g. LPS-induced acute-phase response) are also characterised by the activation and/or induced expression of FL C/EBP&#x003b2;, and this has been implicated in the transcriptional activation of numerous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c35">35</xref>). It is difficult, therefore, to explain why LIP does not affect the expression of these genes.</p><p>Transcription factors can be regulated at multiple levels, including changes in expression, nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, DNA binding activity and ability to <italic>trans</italic>-activate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c43">43</xref>). Although C/EBP isoforms can also be regulated at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>), regulation of their ability to <italic>trans</italic>-activate promoters has so far been shown for only C/EBP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c47">47</xref>). For example, the ability of C/EBP&#x003b2; to <italic>trans</italic>-activate has been shown to be stimulated by agents that activate calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase C and MAP kinases via phosphorylation of Ser276, Ser105 and The235, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c46">46</xref>). More importantly, IL-6 has been shown to induce the activation potential of C/EBP&#x003b2; probably via activation of MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c47">47</xref>). Consistent with this finding, the ability of C/EBP&#x003b2; to activate the pC/EBPx4 construct in this study was also found to increase in response to IL-6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg861f6">6</xref>B). However, we have also been able to show for the first time that the ability of C/EBP&#x003b1; to <italic>trans</italic>-activate specific promoters is also regulated by IL-6, and this is responsible for the reduction of its own transcription by the cytokine. The precise mechanism by which this is achieved remains to be determined but could be triggered by phosphorylation of the protein, as for C/EBP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c46">46</xref>), limited availability of co-activators shared by factors whose expression is induced by IL-6 (e.g. C/EBP&#x003b4;, JunB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c48">48</xref>) or cytokine-mediated interactions with specific co-repressors.</p><p>IL-6 is known to affect the action of three members of the C/EBP family: increasing the expression of C/EBP-&#x003b2; and -&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c35">35</xref>), inducing the <italic>trans</italic>-activation potential of C/EBP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c47">47</xref>) and reducing the expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; and its ability to <italic>trans</italic>-activate specific promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c33">33</xref> and this study). An important question that emerges is how IL-6 differentially regulates the expression of genes whose promoter regions contain C/EBP recognition sequences. There are several potential ways in which such specificity could be achieved. For example, although no differences have yet been noted in the binding site preference of these three C/EBP isoforms <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>), it is possible that selectivity may occur <italic>in vivo</italic>, and there may be an additional modulation of this along with the affinity of binding by specific regulatory proteins. It is also possible that the action of the C/EBPs on gene promoters containing the cognate recognition sequence is modulated by factors that bind to other sites. This point is particularly important for genes that are activated by IL-6 since the promoter regions of virtually all such genes contain binding sites for STAT-3, which is primarily responsible for the induction of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c2">2</xref>). As the activation of STAT-3 by IL-6 is transient, it is likely that C/EBP-&#x003b2; and -&#x003b4; may be involved in ensuring prolonged activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg861c14">14</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a novel mechanism for the IL-6-dependent inhibition of cellular gene transcription, which involves a cytokine-mediated reduction in the ability of the protein to activate the proximal promoter region. Future studies will investigate the mechanisms by which such an action of IL-6 is achieved.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg861f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The steady-state levels of C/EBP&#x003b1; mRNA and polypeptides are reduced in Hep3B cells following exposure to IL-6.
