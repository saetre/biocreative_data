Phagocytic cells are critical for host defense against infection by capturing invading pathogens and killing them inside the bactericidal milieu of lysosomes as well as in processing and presenting the pathogen derived antigens. Based on the ability to infect and cause diseases, mycobacteria can be classified into species that cause TB in humans or in animals, including Mtb and <italic>M. bovis</italic>, and species that are generally non-pathogenic, such as MS and <italic>M. vaccae</italic>. The survival of pathogenic mycobacteria within macrophages involves the inhibition of several host cell processes which allow them unlike non-pathogenic species to survive inside host cells. Host processes manipulated by pathogenic mycobacteria include fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes, acidification of phagosomes and resistance to killing by oxygenated metabolites. Antigen presentation, apoptosis and the stimulation of bactericidal responses due to the activation of pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling are also inhibited. The phagocytosis of pathogen is associated with an increase in cellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and subsequent activation of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>dependent events leading to destruction of invading bacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Pathogenic mycobacteria inhibit the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>flux which is usually associated with phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+ </sup>is required for the activation of certain isoforms of PKC and the calmodulin kinase pathways, which are both potential upstream activators of MAP kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Modulation of host cellular pathways may be influenced by signal transduction molecules expressed by pathogenic bacteria. The Mtb genome encodes 11 eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Various signal-transduction pathways utilize protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in regulating different cellular activities such as adaptation and differentiation, immune response and cell division. Several studies have shown that macrophages infected with pathogenic mycobacteria show reduced activation of MAP kinases as compared with non-pathogenic mycobacteria resulting in the decreased production of NOS<sub>2 </sub>and TNF-&#x003b1; in infected macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted the role of protein kinases in the biology and pathogenesis of mycobacteria. PknG, a cytosolic protein of Mtb, increases intracellular survival by inhibiting the fusion of mycobacterial phagosome with lysosome. Deletion of this gene in BCG results in the lysosomal localization of mycobacteria. Likewise MS expressing recombinant PknG is able to prevent the fusion of phagosome with lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The members of the PKC-family of proteins are classified in three groups, based on the mechanisms regulating their activation in response to different stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. PKC has been implicated in various macrophage functions like phagocytosis, maturation of phagosome, immunity to infection, apoptosis and the productions of cytokines/chemokines/immune effector molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. PKC-&#x003b1; regulates phagocytosis and the biogenesis of phagolysosome by promoting the interaction of phagosome with late endososme and lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. PKC-&#x003b1; also plays important role in the killing of intracellular pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], however its role in mycobacterial pathogenesis has never been described. In our earlier study, we have shown that macrophages infected with Rv show decreased expression of PKC-&#x003b1; as compared to macrophages infected with MS, suggesting that difference in the intracellular survival of pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria may be related to their ability to downregulate PKC-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In present study, to understand the role of PKC-&#x003b1; in survival or killing of mycobacteria within macrophages, we selectively knocked-down PKC-&#x003b1; of macrophages and examined their ability to kill intracellular bacilli. We are first to report the (1) decrease in phagocytosis of mycobacteria by PKC-&#x003b1; deficient macrophages (2) knockdown of PKC-&#x003b1; results in increased survival of mycobacteria within macrophages (3) PknG from Mtb selectively downregulates PKC-&#x003b1; during infection (4) Expression of PknG in MS reduces the phagocytosis by macrophages and (5) the downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1; is mainly due to the proteolytic degradation by PknG.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Downregulation of macrophage specific PKC-&#x003b1; by mycobacteria</title><p>Previous studies suggest that Rv, Ra and BCG are less efficiently taken up by macrophages as compared to MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and have the ability to survive and multiply within macrophages. Infection of Rv but not MS inhibits macrophage PKC-&#x003b1;. The novel (PKC-&#x003b4; and PKC-&#x003b8;) and conventional (PKC-&#x003b6;) isoforms are not down regulated by Rv infection of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To know whether infection of macrophages with BCG and Ra also results in the downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1;, we infected macrophages with mycobacteria and observed that infection of THP-1 cells with BCG and Ra also decreased the expression (2.5 and 5.7 fold respectively) as well as the phosphorylation of PKC-&#x003b1; by 2.5 and 5 fold respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

There seems to be an inverse relationship between PknG and PKC-&#x003b1; in terms of regulation of events involved in phagosomal maturation and intracellular survival of mycobacteria. This led us to think about some relationship between PknG and PKC-&#x003b1; in determining the intracellular survival of mycobacteria. To check the expression of PknG in mycobacteria, we cloned, expressed, purified protein [see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>] and raised antiserum. Immunoblotting of mycobacterial lysates using anti-PknG serum shows that PknG is expressed in Rv, Ra and BCG but not in MS [see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1(C)</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of recombinant MS expressing PknG</title><p>To underline the specific role of PknG in controlling PKC-&#x003b1;, the gene was expressed in MS.

However, BCG and Ra are able to inhibit the maturation of phagosome which is consistent with their ability to downregulate PKC-&#x003b1;. PknG is expressed by Rv, BCG, and Ra (bacilli are able to downregulate PKC-&#x003b1;) but PknG is not expressed in MS (does not downregulate PKC-&#x003b1;). This led us to speculate that PknG might contribute to the downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1; by mycobacteria and resulting in the increased intracellular survival. To test this hypothesis, we infected THP-1 cells with MS-G and studied the level of macrophage PKC-&#x003b1;. We found that THP-1 cells infected with MS-G show 2.2 and 2.5 fold decreased level of PKC-&#x003b1; when compared to control cells and cells infected with MS respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

Whether downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1; require mere presence of PknG during infection or PknG regulate some cellular process which results in downregulation PKC-&#x003b1;. Cellular process/target which is responsible for downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1; may be of mycobacterial or host origin. To explore whether PknG alone or with mycobacteria is required for the downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1;, <italic>pknG </italic>was cloned in pIRES2-EGFP vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) and pIRES2-EGFP-<italic>pknG </italic>was transfected into THP-1 cells. Expression of PknG in transfected cells was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Expression of PknG in THP-1 cells resulted in the decreased level of PKC-&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) suggesting that mere expression of PknG in macrophages without mycobacteria downregulates PKC-&#x003b1;. This also suggest that downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1; involves modulation of some host process. In order to dissect, whether this effect of PknG is a direct interaction or pathway mediated, we performed kinase activity of PknG. PknG undergoes autophosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, lane 1, 92 kDa band) and phosphorylates it's self cleavage product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, lane 1, 32 kDa band) but does not phosphorylate PKC-&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, lane 2) or histone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, lane 4). PKC-&#x003b1; phosphorylates histones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, lane 3, 25 kDa band) which confirms that PKC-&#x003b1; used in assay was active. To test if there is any possibility that PknG dephosphorylates PKC-&#x003b1;, the immunoprecipitated PKC-&#x003b1; (contain adequate amount of phosphorylated form PKC-&#x003b1; too) was treated with purified PknG. To our surprise, levels of PKC-&#x003b1; and phosphorylated PKC-&#x003b1; were reduced upon treatment with PknG suggesting degradation of PKC-&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). This also suggests that the observed reduced level of phosphorylated form in earlier experiments was due to decrease in total PKC-&#x003b1; protein. However, PknG treatment did not affected PKC-&#x003b4; (which is used as control in the experiment) confirming the specificity of PknG for PKC-&#x003b1; rather than general protease activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). For better understanding of the direct effect of PknG on PKC&#x003b1;, we incubated macrophage lysate with purified PknG and observed degradation of PKC-&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). To further look for the degradation of PKC-&#x003b1; in a time dependent manner, we treated purified PKC-&#x003b1; with PknG. The immunoblotting with PKC-&#x003b1; antibody showed that PknG cleaves PKC-&#x003b1; proteolytically and the resulting product was detectable with anti-PKC-&#x003b1; antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Mechanism of downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1; by PknG</bold>.

PKC regulates IgG mediated phagocytosis by human macrophages and is reported to translocate to the membrane before significant ingestion takes place. PKC inhibitors decreased phagocytosis in a dose dependent manner. Phagosomal localization of PKC also increases during phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. PKC-&#x003b1; promote Fc-&#x003b3; receptor mediated phagocytosis and signal transduction and inhibition of PKC-&#x003b1; results in inhibition of phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. During phagocytosis, MARCKS, PKC-&#x003b1; and Myosin 1 are recruited along with F-actin and talin in the cortical cytoplasm adjacent to forming phagocytic cups. After completion of particle ingestion, myosin I, F-actin, and talin dissociate from phagosomes. By contrast, MARCKS and PKC-&#x003b1; remain associated with the phagosome membrane until after acquisition of the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. Phagocytosis results in rapid and sustained phosphorylation of MARCKS, suggesting PKC-&#x003b1; dependent phosphorylation is an early signal required for zymosan phagocytosis and that MARCKS and PKC-&#x003b1; have roles in phagosome maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. PKC-&#x003b1; has also been shown to promote phagosomal maturation by regulating the association of LAMP-1 and flottilin-1 on phagosomal membrane and inhibition of PKC-&#x003b1; results in the impairment of phagosomal maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. When tubercular and non-tubercular bacilli interact with macrophages, PKC isoforms are regulated in different manner. We were first to report that Rv and MS activate and phosphorylate novel PKC isoforms. PKC-&#x003b1; (a conventional isoform) was downregulated by Rv but not by MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It was reported that macrophages derived from BCG resistant and BCG sensitive mice differ in their PKC activity and that macrophages from BCG resistant mice show increased PKC activity as compared to macrophages from BCG sensitive mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In present study our main objective has been to decipher the role of PKC-&#x003b1; in mycobacterial survival/killing. Knockdown of PKC-&#x003b1; resulted in the decreased phagocytosis of BCG and MS by macrophages while their intracellular survival was increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, 3B</xref>). Inhibition of PKC-&#x003b4; did not affect phagocytosis or survival of MS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These data show important role of PKC-&#x003b1; in phagocytosis as well as in killing of mycobacteria and suggest that downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1; during infection is a strategy utilized by pathogenic mycobacteria which help them to avoid the lysosomal machinery and survive inside host cells. This idea is further supported by the observation that BCG, Ra, and Rv (bacilli can multiply within macrophages) can downregulate PKC-&#x003b1; while MS does not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Previous studies with other organisms have also emphasized the role of PKC-&#x003b1; in phagocytosis and killing of pathogens. Encapsulated <italic>Streptococcus suis </italic>can survive and multiply inside macrophages while non-encapsulated <italic>S. suis </italic>does not. Infection of J774A.1 macrophages with the non-encapsulated mutant of <italic>S. suis </italic>results in the enhanced activation of PKC-&#x003b1;, whereas the encapsulated strain showed reduced activation of PKC-&#x003b1; resulting in the reduced phagocytosis of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Inhibition of PKC-&#x003b1; by <italic>Leishmania donovani </italic>lipophosphoglycan results in the decreased phagocytosis by murine macrophages as well as impaired recruitment of LAMP-1 on the phagosomal membrane resulting in the arrest of phagosomal maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Survival of <italic>L. donovani </italic>promastigotes also involves inhibition of PKC-&#x003b1;. Intracellular survival of a <italic>L. donovani </italic>mutant defective in lipophosphoglycan repeating units synthesis, which normally is rapidly degraded in phagolysosomes, was enhanced in DN PKC-&#x003b1;-over-expressing RAW 264.7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study has identified two Mtb strains (<italic>i.e</italic>. HN885 and HN1554) among a bank of clinical isolates showing defect in phagocytosis when compared to strain Erdman. Despite reduced phagocytosis, ingested bacilli replicated at a faster rate than strain Erdman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These observations suggest that clinical spectrum of pathogenic mycobacteria also include strains capable of avoiding phagocytosis. Saprophytic and opportunistic pathogenic mycobacteria are more readily ingested than are the members of the Mtb family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Inhibition of PKC-&#x003b1; by BCG, RA and Rv but not by MS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) suggests that difference in the uptake and intracellular survival of pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria is related at least in part, to their ability to downregulate PKC-&#x003b1;. Interestingly, mammalian PKC-&#x003b1; has similarity with mycobacterial PknG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. PknG has been shown to promote intracellular survival of mycobacteria by inhibiting the process of phagosomal maturation. PknG is secreted into the cytosol of infected macrophage suggesting the possibility that it may access host cell molecules. There is impaired recruitment of LAMP-1 on phagosomes containing live mycobacteria expressing PknG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Phagosomes containing live pathogenic mycobacteria actively retain Coronin 1, which is generally released prior to fusion with lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In a further study, Coronin 1 was shown to be required for activation of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>dependent phosphatase calcineurin, thereby blocking the lysososmal delivery of mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. PKC-&#x003b1; has been shown to phosphorylate p57 (human homologue of coronin family actin-binding protein) and PKC mediated phosphorylation of p57 is required for its dissociation from phagosomes as well as for recruitment of LAMP-1 to the phagosomes, an event necessary for the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. PknG is expressed in BCG, Ra and Rv but not in MS [see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1(C)</xref>] as referred earlier too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], led us to speculate that PknG enhances survival of mycobacteria by inhibiting PKC-&#x003b1;. When macrophages were infected with MS-G, expression of PKC-&#x003b1; was decreased as compared to uninfected and MS infected macrophages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, 4B, 4D, 4E, 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>) confirming that PknG directs the downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1; by mycobacteria which supports our hypothesis that PknG mediated enhanced intracellular survival of mycobacteria involves inhibition of PKC-&#x003b1;. During Rv infection, the levels of <italic>pknG </italic>transcripts were increased by 32 fold as compared to extracellular mycobacteria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) which reiterates their ability to affect mycobacterial survival. In normal macrophages phagocytosis of MS-G was reduced in comparison to MS, which was similar with the reduced phagocytosis of MS by PKC-&#x003b1; deficient macrophages as compared to normal macrophages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Phagocytosis of MS-G was further reduced in PKC-&#x003b1; deficient macrophages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) suggesting that, once MS starts expressing PknG the behavior of MS-G, in terms of phagocytosis look similar in pattern with BCG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Moreover, survival of MS-G in normal macrophages mimics the survival of MS in PKC-&#x003b1; deficient macrophages which was higher than the survival of MS in normal macrophages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). MS-G survives equally in normal and in PKC-&#x003b1; deficient macrophages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These observations further support the view that intracellular survival of mycobacteria involves the inhibition of PKC-&#x003b1; by mycobacterial PknG. Expression of PKC-&#x003b1; was decreased in macrophages expressing PknG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) confirming that PknG mediated inhibition of PKC-&#x003b1; involves alteration with host cell pathway rather than mycobacterial pathway. PknG may modulate the host cell processes by phosphorylation of host cell molecule. In a study, level of PKC-&#x003b1; was shown to be decreased by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation resulting in the degradation of PKC-&#x003b1; suggesting that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is also linked with the degradation of PKC-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus PknG may contribute to the downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1; by directly phosphorylating it. PknG neither phosphorylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>) nor dephosphorylated PKC-&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>) neglecting the possibility of involvement of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mediated pathway in downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1;. Surprisingly, incubation of PKC-&#x003b1; but not PKC-&#x003b4; with PknG resulted in the degradation of PKC-&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). Besides auto-phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], PknG is reported to catalyse self cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] which suggests the possibility of proteolytic degradation of PKC-&#x003b1; by PknG. PKC-&#x003b4; was unaffected by PknG confirming the specificity of PknG for PKC-&#x003b1;. Incubation of macrophage lysate with PknG also resulted in specific degradation of PKC-&#x003b1; which further supports that PknG mediated downregulation of PKC-&#x003b1; may be direct and possibly does not require host or mycobacterial mediators (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). When immunoprecipitated PKC-&#x003b1; was incubated with PknG, PKC-&#x003b1; was specifically degraded by PknG treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>) and this degradation may be due to the cleavage of PKC-&#x003b1; by PknG treatment as evident by detection of a low molecular weight protein by anti-PKC-&#x003b1; antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>). However, this cleavage product of PKC-&#x003b1; was not evident in earlier experiments when macrophages were infected with mycobacteria. We speculated that this could be either due to the lower level/less accumulation of PknG (and degradation product) in macrophages as compared to exogenous addition or may be the further degradation of cleaved products within the cell. Therefore when the proteins were incubated in higher amounts the cleavage product could be seen. Thus we concluded that the presence of PknG in macrophages either with mycobacteria or as a protein, precisely control PKC-&#x003b1;. Moreover, when pathogenic mycobacteria reside in macrophages it raises the level of PknG [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>] which strengthens the understanding that more inactivation of PKC-&#x003b1; may be possible. Hence, this study is first to report that PknG downregulates PKC-&#x003b1; and their association discriminates the fates of pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacteria in macrophages. Recently, <italic>L. donovani </italic>GP63 has been shown to proteolytically cleave many host proteins resulting in the inactivation of MAPKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] suggesting that cleavage of host proteins is a defense strategy utilized by intracellular pathogens.</p><p>During tuberculosis, host defense may be determined, in part, by the capacity of macrophages to bind and ingest Mtb. Phagocytosis by macrophages represents the early step of the mycobacterial infection. It is governed both by the nature of the host receptors used and the ligands exposed on the bacteria as well as the environment where host cells encounter mycobacteria [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]]. Final outcome of the infection is determined by cumulative effect of all these factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Expression of PknG in BCG, Ra and Rv but not in MS represents an interesting example of evolution where pathogen has developed strategies for modulation of host molecule to avoid uptake and killing by the entities designed for their killing.

Our data clearly and for the first time reveal that pathogenic mycobacteria downregulates PKC&#x003b1; predominantly to avoid phagocytosis and killing by macrophages.
