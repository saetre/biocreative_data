Endonuclease activity on double-stranded circular DNA could not be detected under these conditions. Nicked circular DNA was first gapped by the enzyme's exonucleolytic activity, creating a single-stranded region. This gapped substrate was then endonucleolytically cleaved and rapidly degraded. We show that a gapped and not a nicked substrate is required for this activity as previously suggested (Moyer, R. W. and Roth, C. T. 1977, J. Virol. 24, 177-193). The single-strand endonuclease activity could be selectively suppressed by using low concentrations of Mg2+ as co-factor (less than 1 mM), thus allowing nicked double-stranded circular DNA to be gapped to a single-stranded circular species. We also report on sequence similarities between the T5 exonuclease and several prokaryotic DNA polymerases.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00095-0091-a" xlink:role="4128"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00095-0092-a" xlink:role="4129"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00095-0092-b" xlink:role="4129"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00095-0093-a" xlink:role="4130"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00095-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4127"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00095-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4128"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00095-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4129"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00095-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4130"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00095-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4131"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00095-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4132"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
