The same proteins also regulate polarized cell intercalation during gastrulation and neurulation in vertebrate embryos and polarization of inner ear cells in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sokol, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kibar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jessen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Torban et al., 2004</xref>). In many cases, the PCP pathway has been proposed to modulate the cytoskeleton and influence cell morphology rather than cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wolff and Rubin, 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, some PCP components are essential for asymmetric cell division (ACD) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory organ precursors (SOPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gho and Schweisguth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellaiche et al., 2004</xref>). Specifically, the transmembrane protein Stbm promotes the anterior cortical localization of partner of inscuteable (Pins), an activator of G protein signaling, which is required for proper orientation of the mitotic spindle and SOP daughter cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellaiche et al., 2004</xref>). Although SOP divisions represent a highly specialized system, these observations suggest that the PCP pathway might influence cell fate determination during asymmetric division of other progenitor cells, as defined by unequal inheritance of fates between daughter cells and asymmetric distribution of specific proteins that may control this process. Given the potential importance of ACD in cell fate determination in the vertebrate brain, we investigated the possible involvement of PCP signals in regulating mammalian neurogenesis.</p><p>The development of the complex cytoarchitecture of the mammalian brain is thought to depend on the balance between symmetric and asymmetric divisions of neural progenitors (NPs) occupying the ventricular zone (VZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kosodo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gotz and Huttner, 2005</xref>). Vertical cleavage planes that are perpendicular to the ventricular surface usually result in symmetric divisions, whereas horizontally shifted cleavage planes may lead to asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haydar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kosodo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gotz and Huttner, 2005</xref>). The latter were hypothesized to play a role in the specification of neuronal fates through unequal inheritance of localized determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Betschinger and Knoblich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gotz and Huttner, 2005</xref>). A disruption in the number of asymmetric divisions may deplete the progenitor population, leading to reduced brain size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bond et al., 2002</xref>) and precocious neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sanada and Tsai, 2005</xref>). Therefore, factors regulating mitotic spindle orientation are expected to maintain the pool of NPs and regulate the sequential differentiation of cortical neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qian et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shen et al., 2006</xref>).

This gene encodes a mammalian homologue of Stbm, a specific component of the PCP pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wolff and Rubin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>). We constructed a mutated Stbm/Vangl2 cDNA carrying the <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> mutation that converts a serine to asparagine (S464N). The corresponding StbmS464N protein delocalized from the plasma membrane and failed to inhibit convergent extension movements in <italic>Xenopus</italic><italic>laevis</italic> embryos, supporting the proposed loss of function phenotype of <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807073/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Furthermore, although Vangl2 protein was broadly expressed in neuroepithelium of wild-type embryos, it was undetectable in <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> mice (Fig. S1, A&#x02013;D), which is consistent with a previously reported loss of protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Torban et al., 2007</xref>). Embryonic day (E) 15.5 cerebral cortices from <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> mice were relatively similar to those of <italic>Lp/</italic>+ and +/+ mice in both gross morphology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807073/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>) and a number of progenitors (RC2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>) and revealed only a slight reduction in the neuronal layer (&#x003b2;III-tubulin or TuJ1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>).

The total number of DAPI-positive nuclei in the marginal layer was largely unaffected, indicating that the increase is not caused by compaction of cells in the mutant cortex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).

Consistent with this hypothesis, E18.5 cerebral cortices stained with hematoxylin/eosin and the TuJ1 antibody revealed a significant reduction in the overall size of the neocortex and a decrease of the neuronal population in <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> embryos as compared with <italic>Lp/</italic>+ and wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). In the E18.5 <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> brain, we observed a reduction in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)&#x02013;positive astrocytes and RC2-positive and Nestin-positive radial glia progenitors in <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> cortices as compared with <italic>Lp/</italic>+ and wild-type cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C, D, F, and G</xref>; and not depicted).

Progressive reduction of the dividing progenitor population was further demonstrated after BrdU pulse labeling. When compared with heterozygous littermates, <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> cortices showed a similar number of dividing progenitors at E14.5 but a significant reduction by E17.5 (Fig. S2, A&#x02013;F). The observed decrease in NP cells was not a result of increased apoptosis in <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> cortices, as we did not see a significant change in the number of cells with activated caspase 3 at both E14.5 and E17.5 (Fig. S2, G&#x02013;J; and not depicted).

NP cultures were derived from the developing cerebellum (E18.5) or cerebral cortex (E14.5) of <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> embryos as well as from <italic>Lp/</italic>+ and +/+ littermates. When maintained as undifferentiated neurospheres in the presence of basic FGF (bFGF) and EGF, all precursors showed similar expression levels of progenitor markers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807073/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>), including <italic>Nestin</italic> and <italic>Mash1</italic> and the radial glia markers <italic>BLBP</italic> and <italic>Glast</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conti et al., 2005</xref>). All cell lines further showed a low expression level of <italic>Dlx2</italic>, a marker of transiently amplifying neuronal progenitors (Fig. S3), and did not express the neuronal marker TuJ1 or the astrocytic marker GFAP (not depicted). Furthermore, in the presence of bFGF and EGF, the NP lines grew as neurospheres at similar rates independent of the genotype, indicating that self-renewal was not affected by the mutation (Fig. S3 B). After withdrawal of bFGF and EGF from the medium, culturing under adherent conditions resulted in neuronal differentiation, with TuJ1-expressing neurons appearing after 2 d. A greater number of TuJ1-expressing neurons was observed for <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> NP cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;C</xref>). To determine the potential of these cultures to subsequently generate glial lineages, the culture medium was complemented with 2% FCS after 3 d of differentiation, and the number of astrocytes was determined after an additional 4 d in culture. <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> progenitors from both the cortex and the cerebellum produced significantly fewer astrocytes than <italic>Lp/+</italic> or wild-type progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D&#x02013;F</xref>). These findings are consistent with the precocious differentiation observed in the <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> brain and suggest that <italic>Vangl2</italic> suppresses progenitor differentiation and promotes cell fate diversity.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Precocious differentiation of <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> NPs in vitro.</bold> Progenitors derived from the E18.5 cerebellum (Cm) or E14.5 cortex (Cx) were obtained from <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> mice and compared with NPs obtained from <italic>Lp/+</italic> and/or +/+ littermates.

Although our data are consistent with the idea that the PCP pathway regulates asymmetric divisions of vertebrate NP cells, the direct evidence supporting this hypothesis has been lacking. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> SOPs, Stbm activity was shown to maintain the asymmetric localization of Pins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellaiche et al., 2004</xref>), a regulator of G protein signaling, which is required for mitotic spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Betschinger and Knoblich, 2004</xref>). A knockdown of a mouse homologue of Pins caused precocious differentiation of NPs both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sanada and Tsai, 2005</xref>), indicating its importance for proper spindle positioning in neural fate decisions. Furthermore, Leu-Gly-Asn&#x02013;enriched protein (LGN), one of the two functionally conserved mammalian homologues of Pins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>), is asymmetrically distributed in dividing NPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuja et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we decided to evaluate whether the PCP pathway influences mitotic spindle orientation in vertebrate NPs by monitoring subcellular localization of LGN during neuronal differentiation.</p><p>LGN localization was evaluated in cultures of dividing NPs isolated from wild-type, heterozygous, and mutant mouse embryonic brains after 24 h of differentiation in the bFGF/B27 medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A&#x02013;F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qian et al., 2000</xref>). Under these conditions, <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> NPs had a reduced number of mitoses after 3 d of culture as compared with <italic>Lp/</italic>+ NPs (Fig. S3, C&#x02013;E) but revealed increased TuJ1 expression consistent with enhanced neuronal differentiation (Fig. S3, F and C). Cultures were additionally treated with nocodazole to synchronize mitotic NPs for analysis of endogenous LGN asymmetry during each phase of the cell cycle. This permitted enrichment of mitotic progenitors without any apparent disruption in LGN distribution. Asymmetric LGN was detectable in a subcortical crescent in over a third of wild-type cells at prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A&#x02013;C</xref>) and prometaphase/metaphase, when it was found adjacent to the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D&#x02013;F</xref>; and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). By anaphase, few asymmetries were visible (6.9% &#x000b1; 3.3% of wild type), as LGN localized primarily to the cell center or midbody (<italic>n</italic> = 123; unpublished data). This indicates that spindle orientation is likely determined early within the cell cycle before separation of daughter chromosomes at anaphase. In two independent <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> cultures, the frequency of cells with asymmetrically distributed LGN was significantly decreased at both prophase and prometaphase/metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C and F</xref>; and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>).

NuMa is thought to determine spindle orientation between metaphase and anaphase by anchoring astral microtubules to the cell membrane. To maximize detection of asymmetric divisions that produce a progenitor cell and a neuron, we examined developing cortices at E14.5 near the peak in occurrence of this type of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haydar et al., 2003</xref>). Mitotic progenitors were identified in cortical sections by costaining for phosphohistone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;G</xref>) and the centrosomal marker &#x003b3;-tubulin. VZ progenitors showed increasing NuMa localization to the spindle poles during mitosis, with an asymmetric association apparent as early as prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). By late cytokinesis, centrosomes migrate to opposing poles in the close proximity to the cell membrane. At this point, NuMa staining may encompass both spindle and cortical domains consistent with its role in astral microtubule anchoring to the cell membrane. At metaphase/anaphase, the frequency of NuMa asymmetry at the spindle poles was significantly reduced in <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> mice (25.0%) as compared with heterozygotes (47.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C&#x02013;G</xref>).

Cleavage orientation was defined by the angle between the line segregating daughter chromosomes and the ventricular surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</xref>). In prior studies, cleavage planes approaching 90&#x000b0; (vertical; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>) usually led to symmetric fates, whereas orientations closer to 0&#x000b0; (horizontal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 J</xref>) were more likely to be asymmetric, producing both a neuron and progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</xref>).

The total number of divisions, indicated by BrdU incorporation (Fig. S2), remained unaffected at E14.5, which is consistent with Vangl2 regulating ACD of VZ progenitors rather than influencing cell proliferation in general. Additionally, E14.5 <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> cortices showed no significant changes in the apical distribution of ZO1, nonphosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin, and atypical PKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>; not depicted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gotz and Huttner, 2005</xref>). By late corticogenesis, BrdU incorporation and apical markers became significantly reduced in <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> mice (Fig. S2 and not depicted), which is consistent with a premature depletion of late-stage VZ progenitors.

Similar to what is observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> SOP cells, Vangl2 may orient the mitotic spindle in a manner that promotes ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellaiche et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, asymmetric cleavages within mouse cortical VZ progenitors must bypass apically positioned determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kosodo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), indicating the importance of mitotic spindle regulation in vertebrate neural fate decisions. This spindle control appears to depend on a conserved LGN&#x02013;NuMa&#x02013;G&#x003b1;i complex, where subcortical LGN may anchor spindle poles to the cell membrane through coordinate interaction with both aster microtubule-associated NuMa and membrane-associated G&#x003b1;i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>). In murine VZ cortical progenitors, this complex may capture mitotic spindle poles symmetrically to promote similar daughter fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Konno et al., 2008</xref>) or asymmetrically for cleavage planes that promote different daughter cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sanada and Tsai, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with a role in ACD, inhibition of G protein activity decreased asymmetric VZ cleavage planes and increased precocious neuronal differentiation in the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sanada and Tsai, 2005</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> embryos, the reduced asymmetry in distribution of LGN in vitro or NuMa in vivo was associated with precocious neuronal differentiation and depletion of the progenitor population. We propose that <italic>Lp/Lp</italic> NPs undergo an increased frequency of symmetric neurogenic divisions that normally occur during late stages of cortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haydar et al., 2003</xref>). These results support a conserved role for Vangl2 in promoting ACD to preserve the pool of progenitors needed to complete multiple rounds of neurogenesis. Although it is likely that this function of Vangl2 is accomplished through its interactions with Dlg, LGN, and NuMa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellaiche et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>), this role may be permissive rather than instructive, as Vangl2 protein does not appear to be localized in embryonic brain cells at E12.5 (Fig. S1 B). Further studies are needed to identify direct molecular targets and upstream modulators of Vangl2 to understand the complex regulation of cell renewal and differentiation in the developing cortex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mouse embryos</title><p><italic>Lp/Lp</italic> mice of the <italic>Lp/Lp</italic>/Le stock were provided by D.
