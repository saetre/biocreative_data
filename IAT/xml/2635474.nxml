Impulsivity includes a number of processes such as the inability to delay gratification, the inability to withhold a motor response, or acting before all of the relevant information is available. These processes are mediated by neural systems that include dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, glutamate and cannabinoids. We examine, for the first time, the role of opioid systems in impulsivity by testing whether inactivation of the mu- (<italic>Oprm1</italic>) or delta- (<italic>Oprd1</italic>) opioid receptor gene alters motor impulsivity in mice. Wild-type and knockout mice were examined on either a pure C57BL6/J (BL6) or a hybrid 50&#x00025; C57Bl/6J&#x02013;50&#x00025; 129Sv/pas (HYB) background. Mice were trained to respond for sucrose in a signaled nose poke task that provides independent measures of associative learning (responses to the reward-paired cue) and motor impulsivity (premature responses). <italic>Oprm1</italic> knockout mice displayed a remarkable decrease in motor impulsivity. This was observed on the two genetic backgrounds and did not result from impaired associative learning, as responses to the cue signaling reward did not differ across genotypes. Furthermore, mutant mice were insensitive to the effects of ethanol, which increased disinhibition and decreased conditioned responding in wild-type mice. In sharp contrast, mice lacking the <italic>Oprd1</italic> gene were more impulsive than controls. Again, mutant animals showed no deficit in associative learning. Ethanol completely disrupted performance in these animals. Together, our results suggest that mu-opioid receptors enhance, whereas delta-opioid receptors inhibit, motor impulsivity. This reveals an unanticipated contribution of endogenous opioid receptor activity to disinhibition. In a broader context, these data suggest that alterations in mu- or delta-opioid receptor function may contribute to impulse control disorders.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Impulsivity is a behavioral trait that varies across the general population.

Moreover, in humans, polymorphisms in serotonin (5-HT) and DA transporters or receptors is associated with ADHD and addiction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Kreek1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Animal research has confirmed an important role for both DA and 5-HT in impulsivity, and also implicated norepinephrine, glutamate, and cannabinoid systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Pattij1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. To date, no one has investigated the role of opioid systems in impulsivity using animal models.</p><p>Opioid receptors have been studied extensively in relationship to drug abuse. The opioid system consists of endogenous neuropeptides that produce effects by acting at mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors. Deletion of the mu-opioid receptor gene (<italic>Oprm1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) in mice reduces or eliminates the rewarding properties of opioids as well as non-opioid drugs such as ethanol, cocaine, nicotine and cannabinoids. The consistency of behavioral effects across different classes of abused drugs led to the hypothesis that mu-opioid receptors represent a gateway to drug addiction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Contet1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike mu-opioid receptor knockout mutants, mice lacking the delta opioid receptor gene (<italic>Oprd1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) show intact cannabinoid-induced reward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Ghozland1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and increased self-administration of ethanol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Roberts1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These mice exhibit increased depressive-like behaviors and higher basal anxiety levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Filliol1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, the latter of which is reversed following ethanol intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Roberts1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Delta opioid receptors, therefore, influence emotional responses and this, in turn, impacts on drug taking behaviors.</p><p>Drug addiction is a complex state which results from gradual adaptations of the brain to repeated drug exposure. The rewarding properties of drugs promote initial drug use when drugs are consumed voluntarily but, as the disorder develops, addicts lose control of their behavior and drug intake becomes independent of drug reward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Everitt1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Robinson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Impulsivity is a critical feature of this state in that addicts are unable to inhibit their drug-taking responses even if the subsequent rewarding effects of the drug are minimal. The question then arises, whether mu- and delta-opioid receptors, in addition to their roles in reward and emotional processing, also regulate impulsivity. Mu and delta knockout animals exhibit marked opposing phenotypes in a number of tasks (locomotor activity, dark-light box, elevated plus maze, forced swim); in contrast, kappa receptor knockout mice are comparable to wild-type controls in these tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Filliol1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, as a first step in studying the role of opioid receptors to motor impulsivity, we elected to examine mu and delta mutant lines. To this aim, we tested whether deletion of the <italic>Oprm1</italic> or the <italic>Oprd1</italic> gene alters motor impulsivity in mice. We used a signaled nose poke task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Bowers1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> that provides independent measures of impulsivity (the inability to withhold a prepotent response) and conditioned reward (approach responses to a light previously paired with a sucrose reward). Mice are required to withhold responding for a liquid sucrose reward until a visual cue is presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004410-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Impulsivity in this task is comparable to premature responding in the 5-choice serial reaction time task or disinhibition in the go/no-go task, two standard measures of impulsivity in rodents. Compared to these other tests, however, the signaled nose poke task is acquired rapidly and optimal performance does not rely as heavily on attentional (5-choice) or discriminative (go/no-go) abilities. Importantly, performance in the signaled nose poke task seldom reaches asymptotic levels, allowing both increases and decreases in impulsivity to be easily detected. Given the role of endogeneous opioids in the neuropharmacological effects of ethanol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-SanchisSegura1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, and the common assumption that ethanol intoxication is associated with impulsive behavior in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Critchlow1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, we performed one additional test in which we evaluated whether ethanol alters performance of wild-type or knockout mice in the signaled nose poke task.</p><fig id="pone-0004410-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004410.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The progression of each trial during phase 4 of the signaled nose poke task.</title><p>Each trial started with a 20 s ITI; responses during this period had no consequence.

These included the cue signaling reward availability (5 s visual stimulus rather than a 3 s auditory stimulus) and the reward (5 s presentation of liquid sucrose rather than the delivery of a single sucrose pellet). The sessions were increased from 30 to 40 min to accommodate these changes.</p><p>One day prior to magazine training, and following 21 h of water deprivation, a sucrose solution (25&#x00025; w/v) was presented in the home cage for one hour. Beginning the next day, all mice underwent magazine training (2 sessions) consisting of 30 presentations of liquid sucrose, presented at random intervals approximately every 30 seconds. During sucrose presentation, the houselight was turned off and the magazine light was turned on. Magazine entries were recorded and used as an indicator that mice had learned the location of the sucrose reward. The liquid dipper remained elevated for 5 s after a magazine entry to a maximum of 20 s per sucrose presentation.</p><p>Subsequent training was conducted in 4 phases with one training session per day. In Phase 1, mice were reinforced for nose poking on a fixed-ratio (FR1) schedule of reinforcement on either the right or left side (assignment of reinforced hole counterbalanced across groups). The discriminative stimulus (i.e., the visual cue) was turned on throughout these sessions, except during presentation of the reinforcer (5&#x02013;20 s elevation of the sucrose dipper). Training continued until 25 reinforcers were presented in one session. In Phase 2, response requirements were increased to an FR3 schedule and the elevation of the sucrose dipper was limited to 5 s. Training continued until 25 reinforcers were presented in one session. In Phase 3, the discriminative stimulus was reduced to 5 s and presented 50 times with a fixed inter-trial-interval (ITI) of 30 s; only those responses occurring on the reinforced side during the cue were reinforced (FR1) by a 5 s elevation of the sucrose dipper. Training progressed to Phase 4 when animals made 10 reinforced nose pokes (i.e., during the cue) in one session. Animals that did not reach the training criterion in Phases 1, 2, or 3 after 20 sessions were removed from the experiment, and data from these sessions was not included in the statistical analyses. In Phase 4, the ITI was set at 20 s, followed by a pre-cue interval of 1&#x02013;8 s. Phase 4 testing continued for 10 sessions. Nose pokes in the presence of the discriminative stimulus immediately turned off the visual cue and elevated the sucrose dipper (5 s). In one final session, the duration of the cue presentation was increased to a maximum of 30 s per trial. Thus, mice had up to 30 s to detect and respond to the visual cue before the next ITI was initiated.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Ethanol administration</title><p>Following the completion of Phase 4 testing, mice were retested in the signaled nose poke task following an injection of ethanol (0, 0.75, 1.25, 1.75 g/kg i.p.; 20&#x00025; w/v in isotonic saline).

Post-hoc analyses were conducted using Tukey's test. Whenever there were violations of sphericity, P-values from the Greenhouse-Geisser correction to the within-group degrees of freedom were reported for all ANOVA tests. During Magazine training, the total number of magazine entries, magazine entries during sucrose presentation and the &#x00025; of total magazine entries that occurred during sucrose presentations were analyzed. The dependent variable in Phases 1&#x02013;3 was days to criterion. In Phase 4 and during Ethanol testing, the conditioned responses (CR; reinforcers/cue presentations) and efficiency ratio (reinforcers/nose pokes) were dependent variables. Appetitive learning is reflected in the CR measure whereas impulsivity is reflected in the efficiency ratio. Data from the ethanol sessions were analyzed with genotype and background as between-subjects factors and dose as a repeated factor. There was no effect of repeated testing on efficiency ratios or CR so data were collapsed across this factor. In all sessions, the number of responses on the non-reinforced side, the number of magazine entries during reward and non-reward periods, the latency to enter the magazine following elevation of the sucrose dipper, were recorded. Sucrose preference data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA (genotype x background).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Training</title><p>Mice from the six groups progressed through the training phases of the signaled nose poke task at the same rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004410-t001">Table 1</xref>).

In addition, conditioned responses to the reward-paired cue were similar across genotype and strain suggesting that differences in associative learning did not impact on task performance. To evaluate possible differences in attentional processes, we increased the duration of the visual cue from 5 to 30 s during a final test session. This manipulation did not affect efficiency ratios or conditioned responses in any group (data not shown). The mean latency to respond to the visual cue in this final session was 2.28 s and less than 2&#x00025; of the cue presentations reached the maximum 30 s duration; there were no genotype or background differences on either measure. Thus, it is unlikely that the decreased impulsivity in <italic>Oprm1 <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice or the increased impulsivity in <italic>Oprd1 <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice reflects alterations in attentional processes.

Future studies, using a similar approach, will determine whether kappa receptor activity also influences motor impulsivity.</p><p>The increased ability to withhold a motor response in <italic>Oprm1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice occurred when reward-related learning remained intact. The latter observation seems to contrast other reports of reward reduction in these animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Contet1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies, however, examined the effect of mu-opioid receptor gene deletion on the hedonic properties of abused drugs whereas our study tested nosepoking responses to a food reward which is not altered in mu-opioid receptor knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Papaleo1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, the fact that mu-receptors modulate motor impulsivity independently from conditioned reward in the signaled nose poke tasks is consistent with the notion that reward and impulsivity are mediated by different neural systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Everitt1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Changes in drug reward and impulsivity, therefore, are separate processes that interact to influence the development of addiction: combined with previous evidence, our findings highlight the fact that mu-opioid receptors play a key role in both processes. These receptors, therefore, not only mediate initial drug reward but may also be implicated in further behavioral changes, such as loss of control, that occur in chronic drug abusers.</p><p>Our findings that mice lacking mu-opioid receptors are less impulsive has direct relevance to heroin addiction. At least a small population of heroin addicts exhibit greater binding potential of mu-opioid receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Sharpe1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that these individuals should display the opposite behavior to that of our knockout mice (i.e., increased impulsivity).

First, these data add to increasing evidence that mu and delta opioids receptors have opposing roles in many behavioral responses. These include anxiety and depressive-like behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Filliol1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, ethanol self-administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Roberts2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and a conditioned place preference to cannabinoids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Ghozland1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The two receptors also differentially regulate mesolimbic DA tone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Chefer1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, clinical research and practice have probed the function of mu opioid receptors using morphine-derived compounds for decades. In contrast, delta opioid receptor pharmacology is less well developed and many aspects of delta receptor function remain unexplored. Our findings suggest that, in addition to their anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, delta receptor agonists are of potential interest for impulse control disorders. With regards to drug abuse, delta opioid receptors may minimize changes in emotional state and impulsivity, both of which develop under chronic drug abuse and contribute to relapse.</p><p>Consistent with previous evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Patel1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Isles1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, strain differences in impulsivity emerged in that BL6 mice were more impulsive than the HYB groups. The fact that basal motor impulsivity was distinct in the two wildtype strains emphasizes the importance of examining knockout mice on both background. Strain conferred a performance advantage in all groups, with the exception of <italic>Oprm1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, probably because these animals were already responding at optimal levels. Indeed the performance of <italic>Oprm1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice was so efficient that they made, on average, fewer than 5 pre-CS responses during the 10<sup>th</sup> training session. Compared to other studies using the same task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Bowers1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Keller1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, our animals performed exceptionally well with efficiency ratios of wild-type animals ranging from .31 to .5 at the end of training. In addition to strain differences, we used a visual rather than an auditory cue and liquid rather than pellet sucrose reward. Either or all of these factors may have increased the performance of wild-type mice and make it even more surprising that we observed such a dramatic enhancement in mice lacking the <italic>Oprm1</italic> gene.</p><p>We also provide compelling evidence that <italic>Oprm</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are insensitive to the acute effects of ethanol in a signaled nose poke task. This fits with evidence that mice lacking the <italic>Oprm1</italic> gene show reduced responses to ethanol in other behavioural tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Ghozland2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> which may be mediated by the reduction in ethanol-stimulated DA release in the ventral striatum in <italic>Oprm1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Job1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. We also found that strain differences, which were apparent during impulsivity testing, disappeared under the influence of ethanol. This probably reflects increased experience with the task rather than a drug-induced dampening of strain differences because BL6 and HYB wild-type mice showed the same level of performance following vehicle injections. Thus, although strain may influence impulsivity measures, the effect is not nearly as robust as the <italic>Oprm1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Oprm1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> difference that was apparent in both drugged and drug-free tests.</p><p>Higher activity under the influence of ethanol probably accounts for the increased responses during both pre-CS and ITI periods, producing lower efficiency ratios in both wild-type and <italic>Oprd1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The reduction in conditioned responses could reflect a cognitive deficit that is manifested as an inability to detect and/or respond to the visual stimulus. Even if this is true, mice were not completely disoriented because responses on the non-reinforced side did not change with ethanol administration (mean responses per session &#x0003c;10 for all groups). In light of these dramatic effects of ethanol in wild-type and <italic>Oprd</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the most striking finding is that the drug was completely ineffective in altering the behavior of mice lacking the <italic>Oprm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> gene.</p><p>Mechanisms by which mu- and delta-opioid receptors regulate motor impulsivity remain to be elucidated: there are several potential neural substrates for opioid-controlled disinhibition. The decreased impulsivity we observed in <italic>Oprm1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could be mediated through an interaction with the subthalamic nucleus (STN), dopamine (DA) D2 receptors in the ventral striatum (VS), and/or excitatory projections from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the striatum. Lesions of either the PFC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Kovacs1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> or STN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Uslaner1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> increase impulsivity suggesting that deletion of the <italic>Oprm1</italic> gene may increase activity in either structure. With regards to the STN, this hypothesis is plausible as activation of mu-opioid receptors inhibits excitatory inputs to the STN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Shen1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>: the absence of mu-opioid receptors would be associated with increased excitation of STN neurons. The possibility that mice lacking mu-opioid receptors exhibit increased activity in PFC-striatal circuits is less convincing because activation of mu-opioid receptors in the PFC inhibits GABA interneurons that synapse on PFC projections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Witkowski1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Removal of opioid-induced inhibition of GABA neurons would decrease activity in PFC projections. On the other hand, a small population of mu-opioid receptors is located on PFC projection neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> so deletion of the <italic>Oprm1</italic> gene could increase PFC activity by directly removing this inhibitory input. Finally, decreased availability of DA D2-like receptors in the VS is associated with high levels of trait impulsivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Dalley1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that knockout mice may exhibit increased signaling in DA D2 pathways. This idea fits with evidence that mice lacking the <italic>Oprm1</italic> gene show increased DA D2 receptor binding in the striatum and increased activity levels when the receptor is stimulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Tien1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Much less is known about delta receptor function in these brain areas, or about D2/delta receptor interactions. In addition, the effect of selective opioid receptor ligands in the STN, PFC or VS on impulsive responding has not been tested directly. The deletion of the <italic>Oprm1</italic> and <italic>Oprd1</italic> genes may, together, alter inhibitory mechanisms through one or more of these neural systems.</p><p>An important remaining question is whether deletion of the <italic>Oprm1</italic> or <italic>Oprd1</italic> genes affect other measures of impulsivity, such as delay-discounting or reflection impulsivity. The latter is particularly interesting because it represents a cognitive marker for substance dependence that does not recover with prolonged abstinence and is associated with multiple drugs of abuse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004410-Clark1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

Finally, beyond addiction, the role of the <italic>Oprm1</italic> and <italic>Oprd1</italic> genes in impulsivity has implications for understanding and treating attention deficit hyperactivity
