The significance of this selective detyrosination of MTs is not understood. In this study, we report that tubulin detyrosination in fibroblasts inhibits MT disassembly. This inhibition is relieved by overexpression of the depolymerizing motor mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK). Conversely, suppression of MCAK expression prevents disassembly of normal tyrosinated MTs in fibroblasts. Detyrosination of MTs suppresses the activity of MCAK in vitro, apparently as the result of a decreased affinity of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)&#x02013;inorganic phosphate- and ADP-bound forms of MCAK for the MT lattice. Detyrosination also impairs MT disassembly in neurons and inhibits the activity of the neuronal depolymerizing motor KIF2A in vitro. These results indicate that MT depolymerizing motors are directly inhibited by the detyrosination of tubulin, resulting in the stabilization of cellular MTs. Detyrosination of transiently stabilized MTs may give rise to persistent subpopulations of disassembly-resistant polymers to sustain subcellular cytoskeletal differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tubulin is subject to posttranslational modifications that principally affect the C terminus of its &#x003b1; subunit. In one of these modifications, the C-terminal Tyr residue of &#x003b1;-tubulin is cyclically removed from the peptide chain by a carboxypeptidase and then subsequently religated to the chain by tubulin Tyr ligase (TTL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hammond et al., 2008</xref>). This cycle generates pools of tyrosinated and detyrosinated microtubules (MTs) in cells. As a rule, dynamic MTs are tyrosinated, whereas stable polymers are detyrosinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schulze et al., 1987</xref>). Detyrosination does not, per se, stabilize MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khawaja et al., 1988</xref>). However, MT stabilization in cells induces MT detyrosination, which is thus considered as a consequence, not a cause, of MT stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Webster et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, important functions of tubulin tyrosination have been discovered. Thus, TTL loss and the resulting tubulin detyrosination confer selective advantage to cancer cells during tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mialhe et al., 2001</xref>). TTL suppression in mice, which induces massive tubulin detyrosination, leads to lethal disorganization of neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2005">Erck et al., 2005</xref>). Cells derived from TTL-deficient (TTL knockout [KO]) mice display morphogenetic and polarity anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peris et al., 2006</xref>). Tyrosination has turned out to be crucial for tubulin interaction with cytoskeletal-associated protein (CAP)&#x02013;Gly plus end&#x02013;tracking proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badin-Larcon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2008">Steinmetz and Akhmanova, 2008</xref>), suggesting that the phenotypes observed after TTL suppression may arise from mislocalization of CAP-Gly proteins at detyrosinated MT plus ends. However, a mechanistic explanation for the long-recognized correlation between MT stability and tubulin tyrosination remains elusive. This prompted us to reexamine the relationship of tubulin tyrosination with MT dynamics using TTL KO cells in which MTs are extensively detyrosinated. We found that the tyrosination status of the MT had a profound effect on the MT-depolymerization activity of kinesin-13 family members.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We initially observed decreased MT sensitivity to the depolymerizing drug nocodazole in TTL KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared with wild type (WT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), suggesting that MTs are stabilized in TTL KO MEFs. We have previously shown that the interaction of MTs with stabilizing factors such as structural microtubule-associated proteins or plus end&#x02013;binding proteins is either unaffected or inhibited by tubulin detyrosination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saoudi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peris et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that in TTL KO cells, detyrosinated MTs might be a poor substrate for MT destabilizing factors such as the kinesin-13 protein mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK), which is an important depolymerizing motor in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Newton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mennella et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Manning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ohi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hedrick et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, MCAK overexpression should rescue the loss of dynamic MTs in TTL KO cells. Conversely, suppression of MCAK expression should prevent disassembly of normal tyrosinated MTs in fibroblasts. To test these possibilities, individual MT dynamics were monitored in WT or TTL KO MEFs. Cells were either untreated or transfected with MCAK cDNA or with MCAK siRNAs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902142/DC1">Fig. S1 D</ext-link> shows MCAK depletion by siRNAs). MT behavior was scored close to the membrane in lamellipodial extensions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Impaired MT dynamics in TTL KO MEFs.</bold> (A) Analysis of nocodazole effects on WT or TTL KO MEFs.

(B) Video microscopy examination of MTs in WT or TTL KO MEFs expressing m-cherry &#x003b1;-tubulin and GFP-EB3 close to the leading edge of lamellipodial extensions. Colored, closed arrowheads indicate localization of the MT tip at different time points. Open arrowheads of the corresponding color indicate the initial MT tip localization. Most WT MTs underwent extensive depolymerization after membrane contact (white and yellow arrowheads). Some MTs followed the leading edge for a short period of time before depolymerization (pink arrowheads). Most TTL KO MTs continued to grow after membrane touch, running along the plasma membrane or even growing inward (white arrowheads). Occasionally, MTs seemed to push the membrane forward before disassembly, rescue, and regrowth (yellow arrowheads). Similar phenotypes were observed when MT ends were labeled with other TIPs or in experiments run with fluorescent tubulin alone (not depicted). (C) Measurement of the time spent by MTs exploring the area near the leading edge (persistence time). Experiments were run under control conditions or after cell transfection with either MCAK cDNA or MCAK siRNAs. At least 42 MTs were examined in each condition. With MCAK siRNAs, persistence times generally exceeded 100 s and overran the observation time (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902142/DC1">Videos 5 and 6</ext-link>).

In contrast, many MTs continued to grow tangential to the leading edge after touching the membrane in TTL KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902142/DC1">Videos 1 and 2</ext-link>). The time spent by MTs close to the membrane (persistence time) was markedly increased in TTL KO MEFs as compared with WT MEFs. In TTL KO MEFs, MT persistence dropped dramatically after MCAK overexpression and became similar to that observed in WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902142/DC1">Videos 3 and 4</ext-link>). MCAK depletion dramatically increased MT persistence time, which overran the observation time in &#x0003e;80% of the cases, in both genotypes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902142/DC1">Videos 5 and 6</ext-link>).</p><p>We compared MT dynamic instability in WT and TTL KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902142/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). MTs in TTL KO MEFs displayed a higher frequency of rescues (threefold), an increase of the time spent growing (twofold), and a reduction of the time spent shrinking (twofold). In TTL KO cells, MCAK overexpression resulted in a decrease in the frequency of rescues (twofold) and a decrease in the time spent growing with a corresponding increase in the time spent pausing. MCAK depletion by siRNA increased the rescue frequency in WT cells (threefold) and increased the time spent pausing at the expense of the time spent shrinking in both genotypes. Interestingly, the two genotypes no longer exhibited significant differences in MT dynamics in the presence of MCAK siRNA.</p><p>These results indicate a reduction of MT disassembly and abnormal MT persistence after membrane contact in TTL KO cells. MCAK overexpression partially rescued MT dynamic parameters in TTL KO MEFs, and MCAK suppression erased the inherent differences between the genotypes. These data are compatible with a simple model in which MCAK activity is impaired on detyrosinated MTs. Although no sizeable differences in MCAK expression were observed in TTL KO cells as compared with WT (Fig. S1, A&#x02013;C), it is a formal possibility that MCAK activity could be affected indirectly.</p><p>To circumvent this, we assayed recombinant MCAK activity directly on the exposed MTs of the two MEF genotypes after cell lysis in a large volume of Triton X-100&#x02013;based buffer to remove the cytosol. During lysis and further processing, MTs were stabilized with 2 &#x000b5;M taxol to prevent spontaneous depolymerization. During the time course of experiments, in the absence of added exogenous MCAK, no detectable depolymerization of MTs occurred, indicating negligible endogenous MCAK activity in lysed cells (unpublished data). WT MEFs contained tyrosinated MTs, and TTL KO MEFs exhibited extensively detyrosinated MTs and variable amounts of tyrosinated tubulin originating from tubulin synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peris et al., 2006</xref>). Fully detyrosinated MTs could be generated by treating WT lysed fibroblasts with carboxypeptidase A (CPA; WT + CPA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). WT and WT + CPA lysed MEFs contained similar quantities of MT polymer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Lysed TTL KO fibroblasts also exhibited similar levels of MT polymer to that of WT fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). After incubation with recombinant MCAK, WT MTs displayed extensive depolymerization. In contrast, CPA-treated WT MTs or MTs in TTL KO lysed fibroblasts were minimally affected by the addition of recombinant MCAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). MT depolymerization was greater when TTL KO or WT + CPA MT arrays were incubated with a neck + motor domain mutant of MCAK instead of full-length MCAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), but the extent of depolymerization was still less than that observed with WT MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). MT exposure to the motor domain alone, which is devoid of sizeable depolymerizing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Maney et al., 2001</xref>), did not induce any detectable depolymerization of any MT array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). These results strongly indicate a direct relationship between MT detyrosination and MCAK inhibition, which is evident even in the presence of the residual amounts of Tyr tubulin typically seen in TTL KO cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Depolymerizing activity of MCAK on tyrosinated or detyrosinated MTs in lysed cells.</bold> (A) MT tyrosination/detyrosination levels in lysed cells.

To control for this possibility, we assayed MCAK activity on MTs assembled with purified tyrosinated or detyrosinated tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). MCAK activity on detyrosinated MTs was diminished compared with tyrosinated MTs, further supporting a direct relationship between MT tyrosination and MCAK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). We then used MT-binding assays to identify the point in the tubulin removal cycle that is affected by tubulin tyrosination. MCAK's apparent affinity for MTs is influenced by its nucleotide state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>). Assays were run using the following nucleotides or nucleotide analogues: the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogue AMP-PNP (p[NH]ppA, adenosine 5&#x02032;-[&#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-imido]triphosphate), which mimics the ATP collision state; ADP-AlFx (ADP + aluminium + sodium fluoride), which mimics the ATP transition state; ADP-vanadate, which mimics ADP&#x02013;inorganic phosphate (Pi); and ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). By fluorescence microscopy, MCAK proteins yielded a punctuated decoration of MTs, with some aggregates in the background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moore and Wordeman, 2004</xref>). In quantitative experiments, the AMP-PNP&#x02013;bound forms of GFP-MCAK or of the GFP neck + motor domain of MCAK associated to similar extents with tyrosinated or detyrosinated MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). In contrast, the ADP-AlFx&#x02013;, ADP-vanadate&#x02013;, and ADP-bound forms of full-length MCAK exhibited a diminished association with detyrosinated MTs compared with tyrosinated polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The difference was maximal with the ADP-vanadate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Similar results were observed with the neck + motor domain of MCAK, although differences were smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).

Axonal MT disassembly is largely dependent on the activity of KIF2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Homma et al., 2003</xref>), a neuronal kinesin-13 in the same family as MCAK. KIF2A KO neurons display morphogenetic anomalies affecting axonal length and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Homma et al., 2003</xref>). In an analysis of TTL KO neurons morphology, we observed an increase in both the axon length and the total length of axon collaterals.

These anomalies resemble those observed in KIF2A KO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Homma et al., 2003</xref>).

This suggests that neither domain is centrally involved in MCAK interactions with the tubulin C terminus. Both of these domains are implicated in MCAK's ability to track on MT ends, which has been shown to be unaffected by tubulin detyrosination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moore et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peris et al., 2006</xref>). Based on our data, MT detyrosination negatively affects MCAK's tubulin removal activity directly. Thus, tubulin detyrosination, and its negative effect on kinesin-13 family motors, is the most likely explanation for the impairment of MT disassembly observed in TTL KO cells. A contribution of other modifications of the tubulin C terminus such as polyglutamylation, which could be affected by detyrosination and resulting MT stabilization, cannot be completely ruled out, but polyglutamylation is minimal in cycling cells.</p><p>Our results suggest a direct role for tubulin detyrosination in MCAK inhibition and invalidate an indirect effect through CAP-Gly + tip-interacting protein (TIP) delocalization in TTL KO cells. Indeed, although MT detyrosination impairs CAP-Gly + TIP localization at plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peris et al., 2006</xref>), this delocalization of CAP-Gly + TIP from MT ends induces a decrease in the rescue frequency and premature MT catastrophes close to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Komarova et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, we observed the opposite MT dynamic parameters in TTL KO cells. Thus, we cannot attribute the increased MT stability to the absence of CAP-Gly + TIP at MT plus ends.</p><p>The ADP-Pi&#x02013; or ADP-bound forms of MCAK associate less efficiently with detyrosinated than with tyrosinated MTs, suggesting that the lattice dwell time for MCAK between cycles of hydrolysis is lower on detyrosinated than on tyrosinated MTs. This would substantially decrease the number of tubulin dimers removed per motor before detaching from the MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wagenbach et al., 2008</xref>). It would also limit the ability of MCAK to find MT ends by diffusive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>). In current models, the ADP-Pi or ADP forms of MCAK are retained in the vicinity of the MT lattice through weak electrostatic interaction with the charged E-hook of the &#x003b1;-tubulin C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>). Our data demonstrate an important regulatory role for the C-terminal Tyr of &#x003b1;-tubulin in the autoregulation of MT stability.</p><p>Impaired MT disassembly has been previously observed in KIF2A-deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Homma et al., 2003</xref>) or upon MCAK inhibition in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mennella et al., 2005</xref>). Obviously, kinesin-13 inhibition provides a highly plausible explanation for the impaired MT disassembly observed in different TTL KO cell types in this study. Additionally, MCAK appears to be important for MT disassembly upon encountering the cell edge, and may be crucial for end-on attachments to specific membrane complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Geiger et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morrison, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Impaired activity of depolymerizing motors may be central to several anomalies observed in TTL KO cells or mice. There is extensive overlap between the phenotypes observed in TTL KO or KIF2A KO neurons or mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Homma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2005">Erck et al., 2005</xref>). Anomalies and adaptations in depolymerizing motor activity may also be important for the facilitating effect of TTL loss on tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mialhe et al., 2001</xref>). MCAK activity has been observed to be altered in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hedrick et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, both CAP-Gly plus end&#x02013;binding proteins and depolymerizing motors have been identified as factors whose alteration favors genomic instability in aneuploid cells and thus malignant cell invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Storchova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pellman, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Factors able to promote the differentiation of cellular MTs into distinct stability subclasses have been the subject of sustained interest in cell biology. Decades ago, tubulin tyrosination, which distinguished with striking clarity between stable and dynamic MTs, seemed to be an ideal mechanism responsible for selective MT stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schulze et al., 1987</xref>). This attractive view was discarded when it appeared that tyrosination does not, per se, alter MT dynamic properties. Based on our results, tubulin detyrosination could actually generate persistent stable MT subsets by rendering transiently stabilized MTs resistant to motor-driven depolymerization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>The antibodies used were detyrosinated tubulin (L4), tyrosinated tubulin (clone YL1/2), &#x003b1;-tubulin (clone &#x003b1;3a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peris et al., 2006</xref>), polyclonal anti-GFP (Invitrogen), and polyclonal anti-MCAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Hippocampal neurons and MEFs (three different embryos for each genotype) were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2005">Erck et al., 2005</xref>).
