These findings raise the question whether the neonatal human small intestine also expresses the enzymes that enable the synthesis of arginine from proline and/or glutamine. <italic>Carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CPS), ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), arginase-1 (ARG1), arginase-2 (ARG2), and nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) were visualized by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry in 89 small-intestinal specimens</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Between 23 weeks of gestation and 3 years after birth, CPS- and ASS-protein content in enterocytes was high and then declined to reach adult levels at 5 years. OAT levels declined more gradually, whereas ARG-1 was not expressed. ARG-2 expression increased neonatally to adult levels. Neurons in the enteric plexus strongly expressed ASS, OAT, NOS1 and ARG2, while varicose nerve fibers in the circular layer of the muscularis propria stained for ASS and NOS1 only. The endothelium of small arterioles expressed ASS and NOS3, while their smooth-muscle layer expressed OAT and ARG2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The human small intestine acquires the potential to produce arginine well before fetuses become viable outside the uterus. The perinatal human intestine therefore resembles that of rodents and pigs. Enteral ASS behaves as a typical suckling enzyme because its expression all but disappears in the putative weaning period of human infants.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Arginine is a precursor for the synthesis of proteins, creatine, agmatine, and nitric oxide (NO). It further plays an essential role in ammonia and bicarbonate detoxification, and stimulates the secretion of growth hormone, prolactin, insulin, and glucagon. Arginine is also a 'conditionally essential' amino acid, meaning that endogenous arginine production covers metabolic requirements in healthy, unstressed individuals, but becomes an essential amino acid under conditions of increased need, e.g. growth or tissue repair, or in catabolic states such as sepsis and starvation.</p><p>In the adult, endogenous arginine biosynthesis is an inter-organ 'affair': the net production of citrulline occurs almost exclusively in the enterocytes of the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], also in man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], but absorption of citrulline from the circulation and subsequent biosynthesis of arginine can take place in many tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Of these, the cortex of the kidney provides approximately 20% of whole-body requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In perinatal mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], however, all enzymes necessary for arginine biosynthesis from proline and glutamine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) are expressed in the enterocytes of the small intestine, while ARG1, the main cytosolic arginine-catabolizing enzyme, is not detectable prior to weaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In agreement, the small intestine plays a prominent role in net arginine production in suckling piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In rodents, intestinal expression of the enzymes that synthesize arginine from citrulline, ASS and argininosuccinate lyase, ceases completely after weaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In pigs, on the other hand, net synthesis of arginine declines more gradually and is still present at 7 weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It has been speculated that enteric arginine synthesis is necessary to cover neonatal requirements, because mammalian milk is a relatively poor source of arginine, whereas its precursors proline and glutamine are abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Arginine synthesis from proline or glutamine in the mammalian neonatal gut</bold>.

Although hypoargininemia in premature human neonates has been associated with failing intestinal arginine biosynthesis as found in suckling rodents and piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], no evidence to support this association exists thus far. To confirm or reject the hypothesis that the perinatal human gastrointestinal tract resembles that of rodents or pigs with respect to arginine production, we studied the developmental changes in the expression of CPS, OAT and ASS, three key enzymes with a high control of de novo intestinal synthesis of citrulline and arginine, and ARG1 and ARG2, the main arginine-catabolizing enzymes in full-thickness and mucosal biopsies of the human small intestine. The findings demonstrate that the epithelium of the fetal and neonatal small intestine abundantly expresses CPS (as we reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]), OAT and ASS, whereas cytosolic ARG1 is not detectable. These data show that the perinatal human intestine resembles that of rodents and, in particular, pigs with respect to its capacity to produce arginine. We also show that the expression of the controlling enzyme, ASS, all but disappears between 3 and 5 years of age, that is, the putative weaning age of human infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Finally, we show that the enteric ganglia and arteriolar endothelium co-express ASS and the constitutive NO-synthases NOS1 and NOS3, respectively, which both use arginine as substrate for NO synthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue</title><p>A total of 89 samples were included in the study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples originated from the archives of the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, and the Department of Pathology, AMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Full-thickness duodenal, jejunal and ileal samples were from infants, who presented with gastroschisis, atresia, meconium ileus or Meckel's diverticulum, whereas the samples from adults were from patients who underwent surgery for tumors. Duodenal mucosal biopsies were collected from patients who underwent endoscopy for various gastrointestinal complaints. Furthermore, full-thickness intestinal samples of 9 fetuses between 14 and 40 gestational weeks were examined. For each sample, age, gender and diagnosis were available, but in all other respects, the samples had been anonymized to avoid patient identification. Under this condition, residual tissue could be used for the research reported here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Section thickness does not affect immunohistological staining intensity, since antibodies only bind to the surface of the sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As an additional cautionary measure to avoid staining differences due to differences in fixation, we used neuronal staining as an internal reference. Sections were deparaffinized, hydrated in graded ethanols, and heated in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) to 98&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes followed by 90 minutes cool-down to room-temperature to retrieve antigens. After this treatment, endogenous alkaline phosphatases are denatured and no longer active. Remaining activity of endogenous peroxidases (catalase) was inactivated where appropriate by exposing the sections for 30 min to 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in PBS. After blocking with TENG-T (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% gelatin, 0.05% Tween-20) plus 10% goat serum, sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with the first antibody, washed in 0.5 M Na-acetate and incubated with an alkaline phosphatase- or peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 60 to 90 minutes. Sections were developed with NBT/BCIP (alkaline phosphatase; Roche) or DAB (peroxidase; Sigma). An incubation without primary antibody served as negative control for all incubations [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. This protocol allows semi-quantitative assessment on sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The following rabbit primary antibodies were used: ASS (1:10,000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]; ARG1 and ARG2 (1:500, sc-20150 and 1:400, sc-20151, respectively, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California); CPS (1:500) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; OAT (1:1,500) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Antibody binding was visualized with alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Sigma A-3687). NOS1 and NOS3 were detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies (NOS1 1:400, IgG2a clone #16; NOS3 1:200, IgG1 clone #3, BD Transduction Laboratories) and visualized with an alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200, Sigma A3562) and a peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200, Sigma A3682), respectively. Single NOS1 positive cells in the lamina propria were further characterized by staining for the presence of CD68 (monocytes/macrophages 1:200, Dako M0876), CD3 (T-lymphocytes 1:600, Dako A0452), CD20 (B-cells 1:500, Dako M0755 clone L26), CD1A (dendritic cells 1:10, Neomarkers MS-1856-P1), and CD138 (plasma cells 1:100, Dako M7228 clone MI15).</p></sec><sec><title>Western Blotting</title><p>Villus epithelium was scraped off fresh duodenal resection material and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After separation of samples on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotting to PVDF membranes, proteins were visualized with antisera to ARG1 (1:200); ARG2 (1:500); NOS1 (1:2500); NOS3 (1:2500); &#x003b1;-SMA, (1:1000). The appropriate secondary horse-radish peroxidase-coupled antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:10,000. The signal was amplified using the chemiluminescent Super Signal West Pico reagent (Pierce, Perbio Science, The Netherlands) and pictures were taken with a LAS3000 imaging system (Fujifilm). &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin was used to determine the contribution of the submucosa to the scrapings.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of samples</title><p>Sections were scored for staining intensity in random sequence by 3 investigators with the readers of the slides blinded. Villi and crypts were scored separately. The intensity of ASS, OAT and ARG2 staining in enterocytes was expressed on a scale of 0&#x02013;3 (0: absent; 1: weak; 2: intermediate; and 3: strong expression) relative to their expression in the ganglia of the myenteric plexus, which always contained both strongly and weakly positive neurons for ASS, OAT, and ARG2. Expression in the strongly staining neurons was set at 3. Samples without ganglia (mucosal biopsies from the duodenum) were compared to simultaneously stained samples that did contain ganglia to assign an intensity score from 0 to 3. Because CPS expression in the small intestine is restricted to enterocytes, all samples were stained simultaneously and then compared to each other using the same scale of 0&#x02013;3 as described above. There was never more than one scoring unit difference between the 3 investigators.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>We used box-plots to visualize distribution and developmental changes of enzyme expression in enterocytes. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on rank-transformed data showed age-group and structure (crypt or villus) differences as well as age and structure interactions per enzyme. Sex (male or female) was not a factor associated with differences in enzyme expression. To pin-point which age-groups and crypts or villi differed, non-parametric one-way ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis) tests were performed between age-groups per structure. Multiple comparison (Mann-Whitney) tests between structures per age-group were performed, when the null hypothesis was rejected. P values were considered significant if &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The earliest sample studied was a small intestine of a 14-week-old fetus, whereas the oldest sample was from a 79 year-old patient.

Specimens were from the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum, with the majority of samples originating from the duodenum and ileum (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). From 4 patients (age groups 5 and 6; 3&#x02013;7 years), parallel samples of duodenum and ileum were available. In these samples, no differences in staining intensities of the enzymes investigated were observed between the proximal and distal small intestine or between males and females. For these 2 reasons, we felt justified to pool the samples of one age group. Of necessity, the studied specimens included both mucosal biopsies and full-thickness specimens, were all obtained to diagnose gastrointestinal conditions, and were contributed by different institutions. Because the gastrointestinal conditions were diverse in nature and the observed changes in enzyme levels concordant, our conclusions reflect developmental biology rather than pathology. Based on the staining patterns in these samples, we describe the developmental changes in the expression of arginine-synthesizing enzymes CPS, ASS and OAT, and the arginine-metabolizing enzymes ARG1, ARG2, NOS1 and NOS3 in the enterocytes of the small intestine.</p><sec><title>Expression of CPS, ASS, OAT, ARG, NOS1 and NOS3 in enterocytes</title><sec><title>Carbamoylphosphate synthetase (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; [see also Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>])</title><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Developmental changes in expression of CPS, ASS, OAT and ARG2 in enterocytes of the small intestine</bold>.

We deduced this conclusion from an enzyme-histochemical analysis of 79 specimens less than 8 years old.</p><sec><title>The human small intestine expresses key enzymes of arginine synthesis at midgestation</title><p>Although the developmental appearance of CPS, OAT, and ASS in the enterocytes of the piglet and rodent small intestine has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], such information was only incompletely available for the human small intestine. CPS expression in the human small intestine starts as early as the 8<sup>th </sup>week of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Accordingly, CPS was expressed in the enterocytes of all our samples. To our knowledge, OAT expression in human enterocytes has not yet been reported, but its developmental profile resembles that of CPS, ornithine carbamoyltransferase and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase in fetal piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In agreement, OAT was, like CPS, expressed in the enterocytes of all our samples. ASS, finally, is expressed in Caco2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], but its expression in normal human small intestinal enterocytes has not yet been reported. ASS differed from CPS and OAT in that its expression declined profoundly between 3 and 5 years of age (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The time course in ASS expression in the postnatal human gut resembles that in piglets, which declines towards weaning and then rises again [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In rodents, on the other hand, ASS expression disappears completely at weaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Concurrent with the developmental decline in ASS expression, its homogeneous cytosolic distribution changed to one that is restricted to the basal side of the enterocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E, F</xref>). Asymmetric localization of proteins in enterocytes has been previously described as a consequence of mRNA sorting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], but a change in enzyme localization during late postnatal development has, to our knowledge, not yet been demonstrated.</p><p>The crypt-villus gradient of postnatal CPS and ASS expression in the suckling human intestine resembles that in piglets (our unpublished observations), but markedly differs from that in rodents. In both rats and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], ASS expression is confined to the enterocytes occupying the apical half of the villi, whereas CPS is expressed in all enterocytes. This expression pattern suggested to us that the basal enterocytes synthesized citrulline, whereas the apical enterocytes synthesized arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A possible explanation for this spatial separation of cells capable to produce citrulline only and cells also capable of arginine production is that the small-intestinal enterocytes are the only cells in the body that can synthesize citrulline and that this citrulline is necessary as substrate for arginine synthesis elsewhere, e.g. the kidney and the endothelium. Apparently, such a zonation of arginine metabolism is not necessary in newborn pigs and humans.</p><p>The net production of ornithine by the small intestine is a prerequisite for citrulline and arginine biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The severe deficiency of circulating ornithine and arginine that develops in neonates lacking OAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] demonstrates that, in the neonatal intestine, OAT indeed serves to produce ornithine. Citrulline is exported from the mitochondria in exchange for ornithine via the ornithine carrier ORNT. Accordingly, the ORNT1 isoform is expressed at elevated levels in the small intestine of the mouse during the suckling period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, the relatively high expression of ARG2, the mitochondrial isoform of arginase, in the neonatal and adult human small intestine could potentially nullify the cytosolic synthesis of arginine (in the mouse small intestine, ARG2 becomes only expressed at weaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). Extensive degradation of cytosolic arginine due to import into the mitochondria is, nevertheless, unlikely, because the affinity of arginine for the ORNT carrier is ~10-fold lower than that of ornithine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Together, our findings indicate that the human fetal intestine has acquired the potential to produce arginine at 23 weeks of gestation and probably as early as 14 weeks, that is, well before fetuses become viable outside the uterus. Furthermore, NOS1, NOS3 and their downstream target soluble guanylate cyclase (not shown) were expressed at term levels in fetuses of ~23 weeks of pregnancy. This indicates that at this time in gestation the fetus not only has the potential to synthesize arginine, but also to use it for NO and cyclic GMP production. Hypoargininemia, nevertheless, often develops in preterm infants, in particular if they are maintained on total parenteral nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and appears to predispose them to the respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and necrotizing enterocolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The hyperammonemia that frequently accompanies hypoargininemia in preterms responds to intravenous arginine supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which indicates that endogenous arginine biosynthesis is deficient. The strong association with parenteral nutrition points to the intestines and indicates that the intestines only produce arginine if substrate is supplied from the intestinal lumen, as was shown for the newborn piglet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Intestinal neurons and arterioles express key enzymes of arginine synthesis</title><p>The neurons of the myenteric plexus abundantly express OAT, ASS, and NOS1. Since the neurons do not express CPS and, therefore, cannot synthesize citrulline from ornithine, OAT most likely functions to produce glutamate, while ASS probably functions to (re-)synthesize arginine from citrulline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It is conceivable that these neurons require under certain conditions additional arginine (synthesized by enterocytes) above their endogenous production. Such metabolic cooperation has been demonstrated for the intestinal sphincters: neurons in these sphincters can resynthesize arginine from citrulline, but become dependent on external arginine during prolonged activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The expression pattern of soluble guanylate cyclase (not shown) demonstrated that there are many target cells for the NO produced by the neurons of the myenteric plexus. In this respect, the inner, circular layer of the muscularis propria differed markedly from the outer, longitudinal layer both by the far more abundant distribution of ASS- and NOS1-positive nerve fibres and its much stronger expression of soluble guanylate cyclase (not shown). The much stronger immunoreactivity for NOS1 of the nerve fibers in the circular muscle has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Although nerve cell content and density of the NOS-positive ganglia of the myenteric plexus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] markedly declines in the peri- and postnatal period, this structural difference between both layers of the muscularis propria is maintained throughout development.</p><p>The constantly fed state of the neonatal small intestine causes absorptive hyperemia, that is, a high intestinal blood flow and a low intestinal vessel resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. NO production in the vessel wall is the main determinant of this vascular relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], in particular during the suckling period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Since neonatal hypoargininemia is closely associated with the risk to develop necrotizing enterocolitis, a disease of the intestinal vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], we speculate that arginine biosynthesis in both the enterocytes and the endothelial cells of the small vessels of the intestinal submucosa is necessary to support this hyperemic state and to protect the neonatal intestine from ischemia. Unfortunately, only one intervention trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] without a conclusive outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] has tested the predicted beneficial effect of arginine supplementation to preterm neonates thus far. Although arteries of the 1<sup>st </sup>to 2<sup>nd </sup>order (out of 4 size categories) are considered to be the major sites of resistance and blood flow regulation of the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], we did not observe ASS and NOS3 expression in the endothelium of 1<sup>st </sup>order (largest) arteries. Furthermore, the downstream target of NO, soluble guanylate cyclase, was found in the smooth-muscle layer of arterioles only (not shown), suggesting that these 2<sup>nd </sup>order vessels materially contribute to the peripheral vascular resistance in the gut. A recent study showed a deficiency in NO production but not in NOS3 expression as judged by immunohistochemistry of intestinal arterioles of patients with NEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], supporting our hypothesis that NOS substrate deficiency plays a role in intestinal ischemia. In addition to NO production, other factors are involved in neonatal vascular dysfunction, such as the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; and endothelin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], but their effects are mediated at least in part via a blunting of NOS3-mediated NO production.</p></sec><sec><title>The decline of arginine-synthesizing enzymes in enterocytes and "weaning"</title><p>The age-dependent postnatal decline in the expression of ASS in the enterocytes of the human small intestine is most pronounced between 3 and 5 years of age. The time course in ASS expression in the developing human gut resembles that in piglets, where activity is highest during the suckling period, declines to low levels around weaning (under natural conditions occurring at 12&#x02013;15 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]) and then rises again [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In rodents, on the other hand, ASS expression disappears completely at weaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In humans, approximately 6 months of age is considered to be an optimal time point for weaning, but the natural weaning age for humans may be as late as 2.5&#x02013;3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The prominent reduction of ASS expression that we observed after three years of age, therefore, coincides with this assumed natural weaning age.</p><p>There is a remarkable similarity in the developmental timing of the decline in expression of ASS and lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (hereafter called lactase), another small-intestinal enzyme that is closely associated with breast-feeding. In rodents, lactase expression declines to undetectable levels at weaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], whereas in piglets, the decline occurs more gradually during the first 8&#x02013;16 weeks of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. In lactase-nonpersistent humans, lactase activity begins to decline between 2 and 3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. The temporal coincidence of the intestinal capacity to digest lactose and to produce arginine does support a relation to milk as the main source of food and underscores the notion that mammalian milk does not contain enough arginine to support rapid postnatal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], so that intestinal arginine synthesis is necessary. Although we did find low levels of ASS in adult intestine, it was recently reported that the human intestine (age range 37&#x02013;69 years) does not produce arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. This finding does not exclude a role for local arginine synthesis in e.g. neurons and endothelial cells that is directly coupled to NO production within the same cell.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data show that CPS, ASS, and OAT expression is strong in the enterocytes of fetuses, neonates, infants and toddlers.
