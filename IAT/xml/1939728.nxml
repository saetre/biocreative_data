In response to pathogen infection, neutrophils quickly migrate into peripheral tissues where they amplify the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-WitkoSarsat1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. While participating in the inflammatory process, neutrophils kill pathogens using several microbicidal mechanisms, including phagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-WitkoSarsat1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Underhill1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The inflammatory response is accompanied by an expansion of the peripheral neutrophil pool that results from increased neutrophil survival and enhanced neutrophil production, a process known as emergency granulopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Edwards1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Dibbert1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Basu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The current model of hematopoiesis proposes that early in their differentiation, long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lose their capacity for self-renewal, differentiating first into short-term HSCs and subsequently to multipotent progenitors (MPPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Kondo1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. MPPs generate common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) that are able to differentiate into the erythromyeloid lineages, and common lymphoid progenitors that produce B, T, and natural killer cells. CMPs may form two more restricted cell types, the granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and the megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors. Neutrophils develop from GMPs through the myeloblast, the promyelocyte, the myelocyte, and the metamyelocyte stages.</p><p>G-CSF is recognized as the primary extracellular regulator of both basal and emergency granulopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Ulich1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The importance of G-CSF to in vivo granulopoiesis was demonstrated in mice carrying a homozygous null mutation for G-CSF or G-CSF receptor. These mice had 12&#x02013;30&#x00025; of normal circulating neutrophils and a corresponding decrease in granulocytic precursors in their bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Lieschke1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Multiple actions of G-CSF have been described that may contribute to the neutrophilic response. First, G-CSF stimulates proliferation and terminal differentiation of granulocytic precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Souza1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, it reduces the average transit time through the granulocytic compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Souza1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Lord1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, it regulates neutrophil trafficking from the bone marrow to the blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Semerad1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Fourth, it stimulates a broad range of mature neutrophil functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Barreda1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, G-CSF prolongs neutrophil survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Colotta1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Most biological functions of G-CSF are mediated through STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Tian1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Tian2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

STAT3 and SOCS3 (viz. a suppressor of cytokine signalling, the expression of which is induced by STAT3) are negative regulators of granulopoiesis. Indeed, mice lacking any of these proteins in their hematopoietic compartment develop neutrophilia, and their bone marrow cells are hyperresponsive to G-CSF stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Lee1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Croker1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Several lines of evidence suggest that STAT5 is implicated in neutrophil development.

Thus, although the proliferative response of mutant bone marrow cells to G-CSF is reduced, the increased neutrophil production observed in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is recapitulated ex vivo by stimulating the cells with appropriate G-CSF concentrations.

Western blotting revealed the presence of STAT5b, but not STAT5a, in cytoplasmic extracts from wild-type LSECs at steady-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). 1 h after TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; stimulation, STAT5b was no longer detectable in the cytoplasm of LSECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). As STAT5b was not present in nuclear extracts at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), we concluded that STAT5b was degraded rather than translocated to the nucleus. After 3 h, STAT5b was resynthesized, but after 6 h of activation, STAT5b was found to be degraded again. Absence of STAT5b nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity was confirmed by EMSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), and the ability of the anti-STAT5b antibody to recognize phosphorylated STAT5b was checked by performing immunoblots with nuclear extracts from GM-CSF-treated murine neutrophils (data not shown), in which STAT5b is known to be rapidly phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-AlShami1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, ELISAs showed that G-CSF production by LSECs was increased at 3 and at 6 h poststimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). STAT5b was already degraded at 1 h poststimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). However, G-CSF production was only detected after 3 h, when STAT5b was resynthetized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g005">Figures 5D and 5F</xref>). This apparent discrepancy may be explained by the fact that there is a delay i) between STAT5b degradation and G-CSF release (this delay corresponds to the time required for G-CSF transcription, translation and secretion) and ii) between STAT5b resynthesis and complete inhibition of G-CSF expression (this delay correspond to the time needed for the elimination of residual G-CSF transcripts). It has been reported that cytoplasmic STAT5 may be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Goh1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine whether inflammatory stimulation leads to proteasomal degradation of cytoplasmic STAT5b in liver endothelium, LSECs were isolated and treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 30 min prior to stimulation with TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared 1, 3, and 6 hr later and analyzed for STAT5b expression by immunoblot. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g005">Figure 5G</xref> shows that MG132 completely prevented the disappearance of cytoplasmic STAT5b in stimulated LSECs, unambiguously demonstrating that in these cells, cytoplasmic STAT5b is degraded by the proteasome. Moreover, real-time quantitative RT-PCR revealed that STAT5b mRNA levels were not altered in TNF-&#x003b1;- and IL-1&#x003b2;-stimulated LSECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g005">Figure 5H</xref>), indicating that transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms do not account for the decrease in cytoplasmic STAT5b protein levels observed in LSECs upon inflammatory stimulation. Altogether, these data demonstrate that STAT5b is rapidly degraded by the proteasome in LECs following inflammatory stimulation, and that STAT5b degradation precedes enhancement of G-CSF production by these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Neutrophil homeostasis cannot be maintained in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice upon inflammatory stimulation</title><p>We next compared the inflammatory response in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with that in wild-type mice.

These results are consistent with a model in which increased G-CSF production by LECs in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice triggers STAT5-independent compensatory mechanisms in various progenitors. These mechanisms mask the intrinsic defect in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> progenitor survival and direct the commitment of progenitors to the granulocytic lineage. The main action of G-CSF is not through induction of competing antiapoptotic programs. Indeed, only moderate increase in progenitor apoptosis was observed in the absence of elevated G-CSF concentrations (viz. in KO&#x02192;WT mice). It is thus probable that G-CSF exerts its effects by enhancing progenitor proliferation. This hypothesis is supported by two independent observations. First, both the lin<sup>dim</sup>Sca-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and the lin<sup>dim</sup>Sca-1<sup>neg/lo</sup> subsets exhibit a 2-fold increase in the percentage of cells with DNA content more than 2n in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Snow1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells stimulated in vitro with G-CSF at a concentration equivalent to that measured in the serum of STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (500 pg/ml) displayed a 1.7-fold and a 2.5-fold increase in proliferation, respectively, compared with wild-type cells and mutant cells stimulated with G-CSF at a physiological concentration (20 pg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Further experiments are required to determine whether G-CSF is the sole factor responsible for the neutrophilia in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>Neutrophil homeostasis was not maintained in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice following intravenous injection of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;. Indeed, although a rise in blood neutrophil counts was observed at 6h postinjection, neutrophil numbers dropped significantly after 24 and 48 h. Maintenance of the neutrophil pool size during the inflammatory response requires enhanced neutrophil production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Basu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. G-CSF is the primary regulator of emergency granulopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Chatta1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Serum G-CSF levels increased from &#x0223c;500 to 7,000 pg/ml in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice injected with pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the total number of bone marrow CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Gr-1<sup>hi</sup> cells declined concurrently to less than one third of basal values, indicating that neutrophil release from bone marrow cannot be compensated by efficient emergency granulopoiesis in these mice. It is possible that the survival defect in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow progenitors prevented the enhancement of neutrophil production that is normally induced by increasing G-CSF concentrations. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that proliferation of STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells plateaued at approximately 500 pg/ml G-CSF, which is the concentration measured in the serum of STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000727-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In wild-type mice, inflammatory stimulation induced G-CSF production by LECs and other cell types (principally macrophages), and thus sustained neutrophil mobilization and expansion. We conclude that STAT5-mediated antiapoptosis in myeloid progenitors is required for efficient emergency granulopoiesis.</p><p>Blood neutrophils from STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were fully differentiated. Moreover, STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils displayed a respiratory oxidative burst, increased expression of surface markers following stimulation, and the ability to migrate, to produce high quantities of TNF-&#x003b1;, and to phagocytose and kill bacteria. STAT5 is therefore dispensable for neutrophil differentiation and function.</p><p>Of all the cells of the immune system, the neutrophil has the shortest half-life, estimated to be between 6 and 18 h. This short half-life arises from the fact that bloodstream neutrophils rapidly undergo spontaneous apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Edwards1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The apoptosis rate was slightly but significantly greater in peripheral blood neutrophils from STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice than in those from wild-type littermates, indicating that at steady state, STAT5 contributes to homeostatic regulation of peripheral blood neutrophil numbers by inducing antiapoptotic mechanisms not only in progenitors but also in circulating neutrophils.</p><p>Delayed neutrophil apoptosis has been associated with several infectious and inflammatory diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Simon1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. This enhancement of neutrophil survival presumably allows them to function more effectively at sites of inflammation. The suppression of neutrophil apoptosis in vivo is mainly due to overexpression of survival factors, two most important of which are G-CSF and GM-CSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Dibbert1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Coxon1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils, unlike wild-type neutrophils, were refractory to G-CSF and GM-CSF-induced antiapoptosis in vitro. Moreover, survival of circulating neutrophils was not enhanced in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice following inflammatory stimulation, indicating that STAT5 is a critical mediator of delayed neutrophil apoptosis in vivo. In chronic inflammatory diseases, accumulation of long-lived neutrophils at the site of inflammation is deleterious rather than beneficial. We postulate that selective inhibition of STAT5 could have therapeutic value in the control of these disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Functions of STAT5b in LSECs</title><p>The most striking finding of our work is that LECs and, to a lesser extent, auricle and aorta endothelial cells of STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice autonomously secrete G-CSF. This situation is recapitulated in wild-type mice upon inflammatory stimulation. Indeed, rapid degradation of STAT5b, which is the sole STAT5 isoform present in LECs, precedes G-CSF expression and secretion by LECs in wild-type mice injected with TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;. To examine direct effects of inflammatory stimulation on STAT5b protein expression, isolated wild-type LSECs were treated ex vivo with TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;. Again, STAT5b was rapidly degraded following pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation. Taken together, these data show that STAT5b negatively regulates granulopoiesis at steady-state by directly or indirectly repressing G-CSF expression in liver endothelium, and that cytokine-induced removal of this STAT5b-imposed brake triggers G-CSF production and secretion. To address the question of whether enhancement of G-CSF production that results from STAT5b degradation in LECs may contribute to induction of emergency granulopoiesis, we have generated WT&#x02192;KO mice. In these mice, bone marrow-derived cells were normal, whereas LECs were deficient for STAT5 and thus produced large amounts of G-CSF. Total numbers and survival of CMPs, GMPs, and bone marrow and peripheral blood neutrophils were significantly increased in WT&#x02192;KO mice relative to WT&#x02192;WT control mice, demonstrating that loss of STAT5 expression in LECs is sufficient to provoke emergency granulopoiesis and eventually neutrophilia. We conclude that in LECs, STAT5b is a stress sensor, the degradation of which allows conversion of systemic inflammatory signals into signals that promote granulopoiesis. Of note, although chimeric WT&#x02192;KO mice had normal numbers of blood lymphocytes, they developed neutrophilia and their LECs produced high amounts of G-CSF, indicating that increased G-CSF production and granulopoiesis in STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice does not reflect a compensatory mechanism for a decreased absolute lymphocyte count.</p><p>In the present study, we have demonstrated that G-CSF expression in LECs is repressed by cytoplasmic rather than by nuclear STAT5b. It is known that STAT5 can function to not only stimulate but also inhibit gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Darnell1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, and a number of mechanisms have been described by which STAT5 acts as a repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Stocklin1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Luo1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, consistent with our observations, the STAT5b VVVI mutant, which remains primarily cytoplasmic and does not accumulate significantly in the nucleus even after prolactin stimulation, is capable of inhibiting STAT1-mediated activation of the interferon regulatory factor-1 promoter at an extranuclear level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Luo1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. An intriguing question is how cytoplasmic STAT5b can repress G-CSF expression in LECs. Regulation of G-CSF gene expression is achieved at the level of transcription as well as post-transcriptionally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Barreda1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, a possible mechanism may be that STAT5b competes for a cytoplasmic factor required for G-CSF gene transcription in the nucleus. Alternatively, cytoplasmic STAT5b may interfere with RNA-binding proteins or RNAse activity, thereby increasing G-CSF transcript instability. Further studies are needed to address these questions. Enhancement of G-CSF mRNA and protein expression in pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulated LECs follows rapid degradation of cytoplasmic STAT5b. It has been reported that the adapter molecule c-Cbl negatively regulates STAT5-mediated transcription by inducing ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of cytoplasmic STAT5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Goh1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, our results show that in LECs, pro-inflammatory cytokines activate intracellular pathways leading to proteosomal degradation of STAT5b.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Li&#x000e8;ge.

In experiments aimed at determining whether STAT5b was degraded by the proteasome, LSECs were treated with 20 &#x000b5;M MG132 (AG Scientific Inc.).</p></sec><sec id="s4p"><title>Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays</title><p>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift experiments were performed as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000727-Pajak1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The sequence of the STAT5 probe (viz. the 21 bp GAS-like element from the promoter of the bovine &#x003b2;-casein) used in this work was as follows: 5&#x02032;-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAAATC-3&#x02032;. To confirm specificity, competition assays were performed with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type probes and with mutated probes (data not shown). Binding of the non inducible transcription factor Oct-1 was used as an internal standard. In some experiments, nuclear extracts from MAC-T cells (bovine mammary epithelial cells; NEXIA Biotechnologies Inc.) stimulated with purified bovine prolactin were used as positive controls for STAT5 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4q"><title>Cytokine Assays</title><p>G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, SCF, and TNF-&#x003b1; protein levels in serum and/or in culture supernatants were determined by ELISA (R&#x00026;D or Endogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4r"><title>Bone Marrow Transplantation</title><p>5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> wild-type or STAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells were injected intravenously into lethally irradiated (1000 rad) control or mutant mice (8-week-old mice were used).
