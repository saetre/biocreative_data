This stress response comes at the expense of scavenging for scarce resources, causing a trade-off between stress tolerance and nutrient acquisition. This trade-off favors non-functional <italic>rpoS</italic> alleles in nutrient-poor environments. We used experimental evolution to explore how natural selection modifies the regulatory network of strains lacking RpoS when they evolve in an osmotically stressful environment. We found that strains lacking RpoS adapt less variably, in terms of both fitness increase and changes in patterns of transcription, than strains with functional RpoS. This phenotypic uniformity was caused by the same adaptive mutation in every independent population: the insertion of IS<italic>10</italic> into the promoter of the <italic>otsBA</italic> operon. OtsA and OtsB are required to synthesize the osmoprotectant trehalose, and transcription of <italic>otsBA</italic> requires RpoS in the wild-type genetic background. The evolved IS<italic>10</italic> insertion rewires expression of <italic>otsBA</italic> from RpoS-dependent to RpoS-independent, allowing for partial restoration of wild-type response to osmotic stress. Our results show that the regulatory networks of bacteria can evolve new structures in ways that are both rapid and repeatable.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, like all bacteria, expresses distinct sets of genes in response to different environmental challenges. One protein, RpoS, is a central part of the cellular response that brings about these changes in gene expression. Despite the importance of this protein in response to some kinds of stresses, strains that lack a functional RpoS protein are found at appreciable frequency in nature. We sought to understand how these strains evolve to compensate for the lack of RpoS function. We evolved <italic>E. coli</italic> with and without RpoS in a stressful environment in the lab, and found that strains without RpoS evolved in a uniform and repeatable manner. This was true in terms of how much their fitness increased or in terms of how genes were expressed to compensate for the lack of RpoS. These patterns had a simple cause. A mobile genetic element moved position in the genome, allowing for the transcription of a pair of key genes. The same element moved to the same place in each of our replicate experiments, causing the repeatable change in fitness and gene expression. We conclude that <italic>E. coli</italic> can rapidly compensate for the lack of RpoS by evolving novel mechanisms to control patterns of gene expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial adaptation to environmental stress involves, in part, a modification of transcription patterns, with downstream impacts on physiological function.

While <italic>rpoS</italic> strains could adapt by recovering or increasing their RpoS function, the mutations that abolished RpoS function may be very unlikely or impossible to reverse. An alternative mechanism involves the selection of mutations that modify the regulatory network to compensate for the loss of RpoS. These compensatory mutations would then increase the fitness of the bacterium in this new, more stressful environment. We sought to understand this type of adaptation by observing the patterns of increased fitness seen in evolving bacterial lines, and by elucidating the molecular basis of the adaptation.</p><p>Results from previous experimental studies suggest that compensation for deleterious mutations is a general phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000671-Lenski1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000671-Schrag1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Less is known, however, about the variability of the process of compensation.

Furthermore, the cost was specific to high osmolarity, as there was no fitness cost when the two stains were competed in the absence of NaCl stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000671-t001">Table 1</xref>).

If the mutation occurred in all five lines independently, i.e. after the culture was split, then we reasoned that if we started five completely independent lines, each should acquire the same IS<italic>10</italic> insertion into P<italic><sub>otsBA</sub></italic>. To test this hypothesis, we spread an aliquot of the original &#x00394;<italic>rpoS</italic> frozen culture onto an L agar plate, picked five separate colonies (thus each founded by a single cell) and used each of these to found a new long-term line. Diagnostic PCR of the P<italic><sub>otsBA</sub></italic> promoter confirmed that each of these lines began with a wild-type promoter. These lines were evolved for 250 generations under identical conditions to those used in the first experiment. After 250 generations, all five of these lines had acquired an IS<italic>10</italic> insertion mutation in the same location and with the same orientation as the first five lines, indicating that the repeated evolution of this particular promoter mutation is not due to the mutation having been present in the starting population.</p><p>While all five &#x00394;<italic>rpoS</italic> lines fixed the same mutation, the dynamics of this mutational sweep need not have been uniform.

The frequency of the insertion varied over two orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000671.s003">Table S3</xref>), and the frequency in all five cultures was distinct. This could be due to the insertion occurring at distinct time points in each line, or due to the initial rise of the adaptive mutation being dominated by the stochastic dynamics of culture transfer from flask to flask.</p><p>To determine if the IS<italic>10</italic> insertion alone was sufficient to allow for RpoS-independent expression of <italic>otsBA</italic>, we cloned the wild-type and evolved P<italic><sub>otsBA</sub></italic> promoters into the promoterless <italic>gfp</italic>-fusion plasmid pZep08 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000671-Hautefort1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

We found the opposite: there was <italic>less</italic> variation in the fitness increase of &#x00394;<italic>rpoS</italic> lines, due to the fact that the same mutation fixed in all five populations.</p><p>One possible explanation for our observation is that the deletion of <italic>rpoS</italic> causes the strain to cross a fitness valley, and places it on a smaller peak. On this new, smaller peak, adaptive mutations would be of smaller size, and there would be fewer of them, resulting in more parallel evolution. In biological terms, this implies that it is possible that trehalose biosynthesis is so critical that mutations upregulating <italic>otsBA</italic> will be much more strongly favored than any other adaptive mutation. If this is the case, then recovery of the same mutation in replicate lines may reflect the limited number of possible adaptive mutations that can upregulate <italic>otsBA</italic>. Alternatively, it may reflect the fact that the site in the promoter is a hotspot for IS<italic>10</italic> insertion.

Further, IS elements are found in almost all strains of <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Thus, it is not improbable that IS elements play an important role in the evolution of the RpoS regulon.</p><p>The IS<italic>10</italic> insertion in P<italic><sub>otsBA</sub></italic> affected the transcription of a number of genes beyond only <italic>otsBA</italic>. The process of compensation for a fitness cost might result in two sorts of patterns of change of transcription. In the first, deletion of RpoS changes the level of transcription of a gene, and compensatory adaptation brings the level of transcription back towards the wild-type level. An alternative is that the process of compensation results in more change in the level of transcription. For example, a gene that is somewhat down-regulated with the loss of RpoS becomes even further down-regulated, or a gene that was not initially affected by the loss of RpoS is upregulated to compensate for the lack of transcription of some other gene. We found that of the 35 genes other than <italic>otsBA</italic> with changed pattern of transcription across all 5 lines, 33 fell into the former category of (partial) restoration of transcription levels. OtsB and OtsA are biosynthetic enzymes, not transcription factors, but the small molecule they synthesize, trehalose, does stimulate expression of genes involved in maltose transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000671-Klein1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, and the <italic>malK-lamB-malM</italic> operon is up-regulated in the evolved lines.

A general implication of these observations is that regulatory systems may be structured such that in the absence of reversion at the genetic level, compensatory mutations can lead to restoration of wild-type patterns of transcription.</p><p>What are the consequences for future evolution of compensating for the lack of RpoS with an IS<italic>10</italic> insertion?

If null <italic>rpoS</italic> alleles that cannot be reverted are fixed in nutrient-poor environments, then strains may compensate in stressful environments with mutations elsewhere in the regulatory network. Because epistasis is generated in this compensation, subsequent re-acquisition of RpoS function will decrease fitness. Strains that have taken the first step of adapting in an RpoS-independent manner will continue to do so, leading to even further divergence of regulatory networks.</p><p>A mechanism to explain the origins of the observed epistasis, sigma factor competition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000671-Farewell1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000671-Nystrom1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, suggests that epistasis is likely to be a general phenomenon. Sigma factor competition is hypothesized to occur because amounts of core RNA polymerase are limiting for transcription. Thus, if an RpoS molecule interacts with a core subunit to promote transcription from one promoter, there is one less core subunit available for any other sigma factor to interact with and promote transcription. Since the P<sub>OUT</sub> promoter of IS<italic>10</italic> is not an RpoS-dependent promoter, the presence of functional RpoS protein will reduce the levels of transcription from promoters like P<sub>OUT</sub>. Because this cause of epistasis is embedded in the fundamental process of transcription, it suggests that mutations recruiting non-RpoS-dependent promoters to compensate for the loss of RpoS will generally be epistatic on the absence of RpoS.</p><p>The RpoS regulatory network is a major target for selection because it cannot handle environments that are both physically stressful and nutrient-poor. The SPANC model posits that differing levels of RpoS activity will be selected in different environments. Our work has shown an alternative to increasing RpoS levels in a stressful environment. Strains adapt with a repeatable pattern by up-regulating a single pair of genes on the periphery of a regulatory network, suggesting that regulatory networks may evolve novel structures in a rapid and predictable manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains, plasmids, and media</title><p>All strains used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000671.s004">Table S4</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000671.s008">Text S1</xref> notes the location of the two copies of IS<italic>10</italic> in the ancestral strain used for experimental evolution.
