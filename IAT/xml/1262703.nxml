It is particularly prevalent in the central nervous system and during remodelling processes such as formation of the digits and in amphibian metamorphosis. Apoptosis, which is dependent upon a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, also enables the embryo to rid itself of cells damaged by gamma irradiation. In this study, the roles of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>in protecting cells from apoptosis were examined in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>embryos using transgenesis to overexpress the <italic>XR11 </italic>gene, which encodes Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>. The effects on developmental, thyroid hormone-induced and &#x003b3;-radiation-induced apoptosis in embryos were examined in these transgenic animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Apoptosis was abrogated in <italic>XR11 </italic>transgenic embryos. However, the transgene did not prevent the apoptotic response of tadpoles to thyroid hormone during metamorphosis. Post-metamorphic <italic>XR11 </italic>frogs were reared to sexual maturity, thus allowing us to produce second-generation embryos and enabling us to distinguish between the maternal and zygotic contributions of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>to the &#x003b3;-radiation apoptotic response. Wild-type embryos irradiated before the mid-blastula transition (MBT) underwent normal cell division until reaching the MBT, after which they underwent massive, catastrophic apoptosis. Over-expression of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>derived from <italic>XR11 </italic>females, but not males, provided partial protection from apoptosis. Maternal expression of XR11 was also sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT &#x003b3;-radiation. Tolerance to post-MBT &#x003b3;-radiation from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually after the MBT in spite of abundant XR11 protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest that Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>is an effective counterbalance to proapoptotic factors during embryonic development but has no apparent effect on the thyroid hormone-induced apoptosis that occurs during metamorphosis. Furthermore, post-MBT apoptosis triggered by irradiation before the MBT could only be restrained by maternal expression of <italic>Bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>. Although maternal expression of XR11 was sufficient to abrogate apoptosis triggered by post-MBT &#x003b3;-radiation, radiation tolerance from zygotically-derived XR11 was acquired gradually, indicating that synthesis of XR11 protein is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis. Thus, repression of radiation-induced apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>during embryonic development depends upon the timing of its expression and post-translational events that enable the protein to become effective.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cell death is an essential and integral aspect of embryonic development (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). The genome is programmed to eliminate certain cells or groups of cells at particular times during development by a process called "programmed cell death" (PCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Well-known examples of PCD during vertebrate development include interdigital cell death and regression of the tail and gills during amphibian metamorphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Considerable PCD also occurs in the central nervous system (CNS; for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]), where as much as 85% of some neuronal populations may be lost by PCD during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. One form of PCD is apoptosis, which is characterized by membrane blebbing, nuclear and cytoplasmic shrinkage, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The detection of DNA fragmentation in dying cells utilizing the TUNEL (<underline>T</underline>dT-mediated d<underline>U</underline>TP <underline>n</underline>ick <underline>e</underline>nd <underline>l</underline>abeling) assay provides the basis for a sensitive and specific <italic>in situ </italic>measure of apoptosis.</p><p>The frog <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>provides an excellent model system for studying apoptosis during embryonic development. The TUNEL assay has been used on whole-mounts and tissue sections of <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos to monitor spontaneous developmental apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Apoptosis also provides the means for the embryo to rid itself of cells damaged by DNA-damaging agents, such as gamma radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Gamma radiation during embryonic development is a threat to the viability of the embryo and to its potential to develop into a healthy, functional adult organism. Embryos have two alternative mechanisms to prevent developmental abnormalities caused by irradiation: elimination of damaged cells through apoptosis or repair of the damaged DNA. <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos undergo a dramatic transition in their response to ionizing radiation coincident with the onset of gastrulation. Embryos irradiated before gastrulation continue to cleave normally and undergo an abrupt, catastrophic, comprehensive and synchronous apoptosis of DNA-damaged cells after the mid-blastula transition (MBT) using a maternally-derived mechanism that does not require transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In contrast, cells in embryos irradiated after gastrulation reportedly do not undergo apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The induction of apoptosis is subject to both pro- and anti-apoptotic cellular factors and is executed by cysteine proteases called caspases after their activation from the proenzyme state. The activation of caspases can be triggered by cytochrome c release from the intermembrane spaces of mitochondria through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Release of cytochrome c, in turn, is regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). Members of the Bcl-2 family serve a key regulatory role in apoptosis, acting as either pro- or anti-apoptotic factors. Thus, the relative levels of members with opposing functions can determine whether cells live or die [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). One of the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family is Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, which functions to inhibit apoptosis in situations in which Bcl-2 does not suffice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. For example, <italic>bcl-2 </italic>knockout mice are viable as embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] whereas <italic>bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L </italic></sub>knockout mice die as embryos that exhibit massive cell death in the nervous and hematopoietic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Over-expression studies conducted both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>in mice indicate that Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>is also <italic>sufficient </italic>to promote survival of embryonic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Similar results have been obtained with chick embryonic neurons <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Members of the Bcl family also modulate the apoptogenic effects of DNA-damaging agents. For example, lymphoid cells from <italic>bcl-2 </italic>null mice are hypersensitive to irradiation <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Conversely, over-expression of <italic>bcl-2 </italic>reduces the rate of apoptosis of &#x003b3;-irradiated hematopoietic cells both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Cruz-Reyes and Tata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]cloned two <italic>bcl-</italic>related genes in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, which they designated as <italic>XR1 </italic>and <italic>XR11</italic>. XR11 [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="X82461">X82461</ext-link>], which most closely resembles Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, is expressed as early as stage 12 (gastrula) and continues to be expressed throughout embryonic, larval and adult life. Over-expression of XR11 in Rat-1 fibroblasts protected the cells from apoptosis, thus demonstrating that XR11 is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl family. Misexpression of human Bcl-2 or XR11 in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos has been shown to impede developmental- or chemically-induced apoptosis, respectively, during early <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The transgenesis technique developed by Kroll and Amaya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] provides the means to study the effects of genes on later developmental events and to examine the effects of the transgenes on subsequent generations. For example, Coen <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] employed a neuron-specific promoter driving XR11 over-expression to demonstrate selective protection of Rohon-Beard cells during metamorphosis. In this report, we have used a constitutive promoter to examine the effects of generalized XR11 over-expression throughout <italic>Xenopus </italic>development and to examine the respective roles of maternal and zygotic XR11 in protection against &#x003b3;-radiation-induced apoptosis during development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Over-expression of XR11 dramatically reduced spontaneous developmental apoptosis in embryos</title><p>Over-expression of XR11 in nuclear transplant embryos was achieved by utilizing a plasmid containing colinear CMVXR11 and CARGFP genes. CMV is a strong constitutive promoter in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, whereas XCAR promotes gene expression in muscle and cardiac tissue. Thus, XR11 should be expressed universally, whereas expression of the colinear GFP reporter gene in muscle and heart was used to select XR11 transgenics. To determine whether the over-expression of XR11 protected embryonic cells from apoptosis, we compared the incidence of TUNEL-positive nuclei between XR11 and control transgenic whole-mount and sectioned tailbud-stage embryos. Yeo and Gautier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] demonstrated that the TUNEL assay is effective and specific for detecting apoptosis in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos. Examination of control whole-mount tailbud-stage embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, C</xref>) showed that darkly labelled apoptotic nuclei are particularly prevalent in the heads, whereas XR11 transgenics (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, D</xref>) exhibited little or no detectable apoptosis. Examination of cross-sections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) revealed that TUNEL-positive nuclei were most prevalent in the retinas and brains, whereas XR11 transgenic embryos lack TUNEL-positive nuclei. Counts of total TUNEL-positive nuclei in sections were made at stages 28, 33/34, 37 and 41 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In GFP controls, TUNEL-positive cells peaked at stage 33/34, whereas XR11 overexpressing embryos had nominal numbers of TUNEL-positive nuclei at all stages. For example, over-expression of XR11 at stage 33/34 reduced apoptosis by 95%. Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests indicate that the differences in the numbers of TUNEL-positive nuclei between the XR11 and GFP embryos are highly significant (p = 0.001 for stage 41 and 0.001 &#x0003e; p &#x0003e; 0.000 for stages 28, 33/34 and 37).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>TUNEL assays on whole-mount tailbud-stage embryos at stages 28(<italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>) and 33/34 (<italic>C</italic>, <italic>D</italic>)</bold>.

However, XR11 transgenic tadpoles developed as apparently normal larvae that underwent metamorphosis, losing their transient larval structures, such as gills and tails (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). The loss of gills is evident by the slimming of the body profile in the pharyngeal region (arrow in <italic>A</italic>). The remnant of the tail is indicated by the arrow in <italic>B</italic>.

One-week tadpoles were exposed to triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) for five days. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;J</xref>, tadpoles transgenic for XR11 displayed the same gross responses to thyroid hormone, including gill resorption, as shown by the GFP transgenics with no discernable delay. The gill apparatus, which is visible in the absence of T<sub>3 </sub>(arrow in <italic>H</italic>), regresses after T<sub>3 </sub>treatment in both cases. Meckel's cartilage (the lower jaw) shows a dramatic beak-like reshaping (arrows in <italic>F </italic>and <italic>J</italic>).</p><p>To determine whether apoptosis was occurring equally in the GFP and XR11 transgenic tadpoles, we focused on the ventral velum, a portion of the larval filter feeding apparatus that has a chevron shape in cross section before it dissociates through apoptosis during metamorphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K&#x02013;R</xref>, TUNEL-positive nuclei, which are rare in the velums in the absence of T<sub>3</sub>, were prevalent in the velums of both T<sub>3</sub>-treated GFP and XR11 transgenic tadpoles. These results indicate that apoptosis that occurred in response to thyroid hormone was unaffected by over-expression of XR11. One possible explanation for the extensive apoptosis in the XR11 transgenic tadpoles is that the XR11 protein was no longer over-expressed. However, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3S</xref>, immunoblotting with an antibody to XR11 confirmed that the 22 kDa XR11 protein was over-expressed in the transgenic tadpoles. Proteins were extracted from individual tadpoles at approximately stage 45, separated by electrophoresis, blotted and probed as described in Methods. These tadpoles had been treated with triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>). Similar results were obtained with samples from untreated tadpoles (data not shown). The variation in the GFP signal reflected the intensity of GFP fluorescence in the live tadpoles, presumably reflecting differences in the number of integrated copies of GFP. The 22 kDa XR11 signal is considerably stronger in the XR11 transgenic sample than in the GFP transgenic sample, reflecting XR11 transgene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>XR11 transgenic frogs are fertile and transmit the transgene</title><p>The failure of XR11 over-expression to prevent metamorphosis enabled us to rear the resultant frogs to sexual maturity. We induced ovulation in adult females and used the sperm from adult males to obtain second-generation embryos overexpressing XR11.

Crossing him with the XR11-01 female gave a 3:1 ratio, a result consistent with a single transgene integration site.

Reduced damage from radiation was always observed after exposure to 10 Gy, but protection from 20 Gy was variable from experiment to experiment, suggesting that overexpression of XR11 was not always sufficient to overcome the effects of 20 Gy.</p><p>To investigate whether protection from radiation-induced damage was due to maternal or zygotic expression of the transgene, we irradiated embryos derived from fertilizing eggs of wild-type females with sperm from XR11 males and compared them to wild-type embryos. If zygotic expression of the transgene could partially overcome the effects of pre-MBT &#x003b3;-radiation, we would have expected to see a subset of embryos with few or no TUNEL-positive nuclei that resembled embryos derived from eggs of XR11 females. Instead, all embryos resembled irradiated wild-type embryos (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4J&#x02013;L</xref> to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G&#x02013;I</xref>). Extensive TUNEL-positive nuclei are seen in both groups at both doses. Furthermore, the embryos exposed to 20 Gy fragmented during the TUNEL procedure. These results are consistent with a requirement for a maternal source of radiation protection at these early stages.</p><p>According to the literature, embryos irradiated after the MBT do not undergo apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed, embryos that were irradiated after the MBT (stage 11.5) and examined 12 hours later did not show outward signs of radiation damage (data not shown). However, TUNEL assays showed that irradiation enhanced apoptosis in wild-type embryos, predominantly in the brain, eyes, pharynx and tail bud. Hence, we sought to determine whether the maternal effect of the XR11 transgene was sustained after the MBT and whether zygotic expression of the transgene could also confer radiation tolerance. To do this, we segregated the XR11 transgenic embryos of over-expressing XR11 females from their non-transgenic siblings based upon their expression of the GFP reporter gene under control of the cardiac actin promoter. The GFP negative (GFP-) embryos had maternal expression of the XR11 transgene but no zygotic expression, whereas the GFP positive (GFP+) embryos had both maternal and zygotic XR11 transgene expression. Results show that maternal expression of the XR11 transgene protected embryos irradiated at stage 11.5 even if they did not express zygotic XR11. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;F</xref>, neither the GFP- nor the GFP+ embryos had extensive apoptosis after irradiation, although some GFP- embryos demonstrated some apoptosis in the hindbrain region, but not in the tail tip (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). When embryos were irradiated during the mid-30 stages (late tail bud) and examined 12 hours later, the protection afforded by maternal expression of XR11 had diminished significantly in the head and pharynx, although the tail tips were still protected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5K, L, O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5P</xref>).

In this study, we have used XR11 transgenics to examine the role of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>in suppressing apoptosis during embryonic development, thyroid-hormone-induced metamorphosis and in response to &#x003b3;-radiation. Our ability to raise XR11 transgenic frogs to maturity has also given us the opportunity to distinguish between maternal and zygotic contributions of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>to radiation protection.</p><p>This study supports the growing evidence in the literature that Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>is sufficient to promote neuronal survival in mice and chicken embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our experiments showed that the XR11 transgene could eliminate most apoptosis in the developing <italic>Xenopus </italic>nervous system, including the brain and eyes. This result is consistent with a model in which the execution of developmental apoptosis is dependent upon a balance between pro-and anti-apoptotic factors with Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>being one of the anti-apoptotic factors. In spite of the abatement of developmental apoptosis in XR11 transgenic embryos, there were no apparent gross developmental consequences; the embryos developed into phenotypically normal tadpoles. This result suggests that developmental apoptosis is not essential for development of vital organ systems, notably the central nervous system, and that embryos can adapt to an overabundance of neurons. However, detailed morphometric studies would be necessary to confirm this conclusion. Yeo and Gautier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] previously showed that injection of human <italic>bcl-2 </italic>mRNA abrogated programmed cell death during early <italic>Xenopus </italic>development, resulting in an expansion of neural tissue and variations in the patterns of expression of a number of genes expressed during early neurogenesis. We did not examine gene expression patterns in our embryos. However, if such alterations did occur, they had no apparent functional consequences.</p><p>Contrary to expectation, metamorphosis of XR11 transgenic tadpoles was normal, as was the response to exogenous thyroid hormone. If over-expression of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>had hindered metamorphosis, it would have indicated that thyroid hormone triggers apoptosis by shifting the balance between pro-apoptotic factors and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>. However, this proved not to be the case, even though we found that Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>was still misexpressed at metamorphosis. One possibility is that other members of the Bcl-2 family counter apoptosis during these later stages. Another possibility for the failure of XR11 transgenesis to prevent apoptosis during metamorphosis is that expression of the transgene was insufficient to shift the balance between pro-and anti-apoptotic factors sufficiently to prevent apoptosis. It is also possible that subtle changes in the timing, rate or cellular selectivity of metamorphosis did occur that we failed to detect. For example, Coen <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] demonstrated selective protection of Rohon-Beard neurons in XR11 over-expressing tadpoles during metamorphosis. We did not assess cell-specific neoronal survival during metamorphosis.</p><p>Upon reaching sexual maturity, both male and female frogs were fertile. Crosses of transgenic frogs indicated that most had small numbers of transgene integration sites. This result was consistent with a previous transgene transmission study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The ability to produce second generation transgenic XR11 embryos provided us with the opportunity to examine both the maternal and zygotic contributions of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>to the apoptotic response to &#x003b3;-radiation. This provided evidence for a significant role for apoptotic factor balance in determining whether cells that had received damaging dosages of radiation during development were eliminated. Other Bcl-2 family members may carry out similar roles in that microinjection of human <italic>Bcl-2 </italic>mRNA into <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos is effective in inhibiting irradiation-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Expression of the XR11 transgene had a profound effect on whether cells of irradiated embryos underwent apoptosis. Furthermore, the application of transgenics allowed us to demonstrate that this effect depended upon the source of the over-expressed protein. Over-expression of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>derived from XR11 females provided partial protection from the normal massive apoptosis that occurs in irradiated pre-MBT wild-type embryos after reaching the MBT. However, if the XR11 gene was derived from XR11 males, no protection was seen. This result demonstrates conclusively that apoptosis triggered by irradiation before the MBT can be restrained by maternal expression of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>and that zygotic expression of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>is ineffective in overcoming the effects of prior irradiation.</p><p>Irradiation soon after the MBT (at stage 11.5) had much more subtle effects on embryos. In wild-type embryos, apoptosis was enhanced in the brain, eyes, pharynx and tail tip. However, maternal expression of XR11 was sufficient to abrogate apoptosis. Interestingly, zygotic expression of XR11 at this time was not effective in preventing apoptosis even though XR11 protein was abundant at the time of irradiation. The failure of zygotically-derived XR11 to provide protection from apoptosis implies that synthesis of XR11 protein is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis.</p><p>Embryos irradiated during the mid-30 stages of development revealed that the maternal effect conferring protection from radiation-induced apoptosis had diminished significantly in the head and pharynx but persisted in the tails. It will be interesting to learn whether the difference between the heads and tails is due to preferential distribution or stability of maternal XR11 protein itself or is due to auxiliary factors that influence XR11 protein function. Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>and other members of the Bcl-2 family are known to be subject to post-translational regulation by such events as phosphorylation, proteolysis, cleavage, protein-protein interactions and subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Intriguingly, at these later stages, zygotic XR11 protein conferred global radiation protection. Thus, the initial lack of functionality of zygotic XR11 protein that we observed after the MBT had been overcome.</p><p>Biologically, the responses to irradiation after the MBT are probably more significant than the universal, catastrophic apoptosis that occurs in embryos irradiated before the MBT. Failure to eliminate cells mutagenized by irradiation would result in retention of cells that may have functional deficiencies and have the potential to become malignant due to genetic damage. Thus, the mechanisms that control apoptosis in response to DNA damage have important adaptive significance. Radiotherapy and a number of chemicals have been shown to damage DNA and induce apoptosis in mammals; this property has been exploited in the clinic to induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Resistance to apoptosis has important implications for the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy because tumor cells that overexpress either <italic>bcl-2 </italic>or <italic>bcl-x</italic><sub><italic>L </italic></sub>may be resistant to either mode of cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. On the other hand, their over-expression in non-tumor cells could enhance the ability of these cells to survive the otherwise lethal effects of radiation and chemotherapy.</p><p>Our results indicate that synthesis of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>is not sufficient to confer radiation protection; rather, it belatedly acquires functionality. Possible explanations for the failure of Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>synthesized after the MBT to protect against apoptosis could include the absence of posttranslational modifications to the protein or the lack of a cooperative factor that is necessary for the protein to function effectively. The presence of this mechanism that confers functionality on Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>protein before the MBT and its absence soon after the MBT may provide an assay system that would facilitate its identification. The discovery of a mechanism that could control whether cells undergo apoptosis after exposure to an apoptogenic stimulus could have important implications for improving the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results are consistent with a model in which the execution of developmental apoptosis in embryos is dependent upon a balance between pro-and anti-apoptotic factors with Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>being one of the anti-apoptotic factors.

Metamorphosis of transgenic tadpoles was apparently normal, as was the response to exogenous thyroid hormone.
