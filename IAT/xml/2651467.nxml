The DN population can be sub-divided into four subsets, DN1-DN4, depending on the expression of the cell surface molecules CD44 and CD25. The earliest CD44+CD25&#x02212; (DN1) cells give rise to the CD44+CD25+(DN2) population that progresses to the CD25+CD44&#x02212; (DN3) stage, and then to the CD44&#x02212;CD25&#x02212; (DN4) population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Expression of rearranged TCR&#x003b2; and formation of the pre-TCR complex leads to a series of events collectively known as &#x003b2;-selection, resulting in allelic exclusion of the TCR&#x003b2; locus, expansion and differentiation to the DP stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].

The fact that T cell development in these mice is arrested at the DN3 stage has lead to the assumption that pre-TCR signalling and &#x003b2;-selection occur at the transition from DN3 to DN4 and are obligatory for differentiation beyond the DN3 stage of development.

Rag1 transcripts were two to four times less abundant in DN4 thymocytes compared to DN3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, left panel</xref>). More than 80% of DN4 thymocytes on day E15.5 did not express TCR&#x003b2; suggesting that downregulation of Rag1 in the DN4 subset on day E15.5 was independent of pre-TCR signalling. Rag2 transcription was also significantly decreased in foetal DN4 thymocytes compared to DN3 cells but the difference in Rag2 expression in the adult thymocyte population was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, right panel</xref>). When foetal and adult Rag1&#x02212;/&#x02212; thymocytes were treated with antiCD3 antibody for 24 hours to mimic the pre-TCR signal, downregulation of Rag2 transcription was even greater (six to twelve fold) compared to downregulation of Rag2 in foetal DN4 wild type thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).

In adults, however, thymocyte production is continuous and the adult thymus has reached steady state with pre-existing cells at all stages of development and homeostasis between thymocyte populations. The difference in the expression of TCR&#x003b2; in the DN4 subset that we observe between foetal and adult thymocytes could be due to a foetal restricted capability of thymocytes to differentiate to the DN4 stage independently of normal pre-TCR signalling, either as a result of differences between foetal and adult hematopoietic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] or between the foetal and adult thymic microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].

To distinguish between these two hypotheses we synchronized the differentiation of immature thymocytes by treating adult mice with hydrocortisone (HC). HC treatment induces apoptosis of immature DP thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] but mature single positive cells survive treatment and the thymus then grows exponentially to recover its normal size and subset distribution a week following the treatment. HC enabled us to study the differentiation of thymocytes in the adult thymus in a synchronized wave and in a rapidly expanding thymus that had not yet reached homeostasis.

On all embryonic days tested the percentage of DN4 cells that were in cell cycle as assessed by the intensity of cyclin B1 staining, was lower than the corresponding percentage of DN3 cells, and the percentage of cycling cells decreased over time in both DN3 and DN4 subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Interestingly, the ratio of cycling cells in the DN3 relative to the DN4 population increased six fold between foetal and adult thymus, accounting for the decline in the DN4 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Staining for the active form of caspase-3 revealed that contrary to the data obtained from the wild type foetal thymus, apoptotic cells were present in Rag1&#x02212;/&#x02212; foetal DN3 and DN4 subsets and their percentage was higher in the DN4 subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c and d</xref>).

The observed increase in apoptosis in the foetal DN4 subset relative to the DN3 subset during ontogeny provides an additional explanation for the decline of the DN4 population.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Here we showed that in the foetal thymus downregulation of CD25 cell surface expression and differentiation to the DN4 stage can occur independently of TCR&#x003b2; expression and hence pre-TCR signalling. Rare TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cells in adult mice have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] but we showed that in contrast to the adult thymus, most DN4 thymocytes in the E15.5 foetal thymus were icTCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>.

Likewise, we found a normal percentage of DN4 cells in the early Rag1&#x02212;/&#x02212; foetal thymus, despite their inherent inability for TCR&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; rearrangement and expression.</p><p id="P21">Most DN4 cells that emerged after HC treatment of adult mice were also icTCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. The abundance of TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cells in the HC treated adult thymus demonstrated that their production was not foetal-restricted and that both adult lymphoid and stromal elements are capable of supporting differentiation to DN4 in the absence of TCR&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; expression. This similarity with the foetal thymus could reflect the synchronicity of the transition in both cases (enabling the identification of normally undetectable TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> that would physiologically make the transition from DN3 to DN4 in the adult thymus). Alternatively, the production of TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cells in the adult HC-treated thymus could be a direct consequence of the treatment, as regeneration and rapid growth are induced. During embryogenesis the foetal thymus also expands exponentially. It therefore remains to be determined to what extent pre-TCR independent mechanisms of differentiation from DN3 to DN4 occur in the adult thymus under physiological conditions, but clearly TCR&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; expression independent differentiation from DN3 to DN4 is important in the foetal thymus. It likewise remains to be determined if low-level signalling through other components of the pre-TCR complex in the absence of TCR&#x003b2; expression, such as CD3 polypeptides, would be sufficient to drive downregulation of CD25.</p><p id="P22">The fact that DN4 thymocytes are found in the foetal Rag1&#x02212;/&#x02212; thymus is important for the interpretation of the phenotype of other genetically altered mice that have arrested thymocyte development. For example, particularly in the foetus, the appearance of DN4 cells may have lead to the assumption that a mutation affected processes following pre-TCR signalling when in fact this might not necessarily be the case.</p><p id="P23">There are several studies indicating that pre-TCR signalling and &#x003b2;-selection induce proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. We also demonstrated directly, both by PI and anti-cyclin B1 staining that four times more TCR&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> cells were dividing in both the foetal and HC treated adult thymus, compared to the TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 population.

In addition, it is worth noting that we detected some cell division in all thymocyte populations examined, including the TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 population, suggesting the existence of pre-TCR independent mechanisms of proliferation, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P24">It has been shown that the pre-TCR can promote cell survival by induction of anti-apoptotic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and that cell death is increase in the adult TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 population relative to the adult TCR&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> DN4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The experiments of Falk and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] correlated cell surface CD69 expression with absence of icTCR&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;&#x003b4; in the DN4 population, and then demonstrated relatively more apoptosis in the CD69<sup>+</sup> DN4 population than in the CD69<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cells. Consistent with this study, our analysis confirms directly an increase in apoptosis of TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cells relative to TCR&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> DN4 cells in the adult thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Our experiments suggest, however, that absence of the pre-TCR complex does not immediately induce apoptosis as we did not observe apoptosis amongst the foetal or recently differentiated adult DN4 cells either by caspase-3 or annexin-V staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> and data not shown) regardless of the presence or absence of TCR&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;. The increase in apoptosis in the TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 population on successive days after HC treatment is consistent with accumulation of ageing cells and absence of pre-TCR induced pro-survival signals that are upregulated in the TCR&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> DN4 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. The proportion but not the number of icTCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cells greatly decreased over time, and was very low in the fully developed adult thymus. Taken together our experiments indicate that the age-dependent decline in the proportion of TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cells is due to pre-TCR induced proliferation of the TCR&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> DN4 subset, rather than immediate induction of apoptosis in cells that fail to pass the &#x003b2;-selection check-point at the DN3 stage.</p><p id="P25">The fate of the TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cells is unclear. In the foetal and HC treated adult thymus, there was no enrichment for TCR&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> cells in the DN4 subset compared to the DN3 population. It is possible that some wild type TCR&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cells eventually rearrange and express TCR&#x003b2; or TCR&#x003b3;&#x003b4; and continue their maturation, but the foetal Rag1&#x02212;/&#x02212; DN4 thymocytes clearly cannot progress beyond the DN4 stage as neither DP nor SP cells are observed in either the foetal or adult Rag1&#x02212;/&#x02212; thymi. We showed that the foetal Rag1&#x02212;/&#x02212; DN4 population is disadvantaged compared to the DN3 population due to both reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, explaining the virtual absence of DN4 cells in the adult thymus. In addition, the presence of apoptotic Rag1&#x02212;/&#x02212; DN3 and DN4 cells, not detectable in the equivalent wild type populations and the reduced proliferation in the Rag1&#x02212;/&#x02212; foetal compared to wild type thymocyte populations seem to reflect differences in the thymic microenvironment of Rag1&#x02212;/&#x02212; and wild type thymus. This is consistent with a previous report showing that the reduced proliferation of adult Rag2&#x02212;/&#x02212; compared to wild type thymocytes was at least partly due to differences in the thymus environment rather than the absence of cell autonomous, pre-TCR related proliferation signals in the Rag2&#x02212;/&#x02212; thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p id="P26">In conclusion we have shown that in the foetal thymus the transition from the DN3 to the DN4 stage is frequently independent of pre-TCR signalling.
