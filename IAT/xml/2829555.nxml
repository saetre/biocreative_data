These proteins are vital for maintaining water homeostasis in living organisms. In mammals, thirteen aquaporins (AQP0-12) have been characterized, but in lower vertebrates, such as fish, the diversity, structure and substrate specificity of these membrane channel proteins are largely unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The screening and isolation of transcripts from the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) genome revealed eighteen sequences structurally related to the four subfamilies of tetrapod aquaporins, i.e., aquaporins (AQP0, -1 and -4), water and glycerol transporters or aquaglyceroporins (Glps; AQP3 and AQP7-10), a water and urea transporter (AQP8), and two unorthodox aquaporins (AQP11 and -12). Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences demonstrated dual paralogy between teleost and human aquaporins. Three of the duplicated zebrafish isoforms have unlinked loci, two have linked loci, while DrAqp8 was found in triplicate across two chromosomes. Genomic sequencing, structural analysis, and maximum likelihood reconstruction, further revealed the presence of a putative pseudogene that displays hybrid exons similar to tetrapod AQP5 and -1. Ectopic expression of the cloned transcripts in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes demonstrated that zebrafish aquaporins and Glps transport water or water, glycerol and urea, respectively, whereas DrAqp11b and -12 were not functional in oocytes. Contrary to humans and some rodents, intrachromosomal duplicates of zebrafish AQP8 were water and urea permeable, while the genomic duplicate only transported water. All aquaporin transcripts were expressed in adult tissues and found to have divergent expression patterns. In some tissues, however, redundant expression of transcripts encoding two duplicated paralogs seems to occur.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The zebrafish genome encodes the largest repertoire of functional vertebrate aquaporins with dual paralogy to human isoforms. Our data reveal an early and specific diversification of these integral membrane proteins at the root of the crown-clade of Teleostei. Despite the increase in gene copy number, zebrafish aquaporins mostly retain the substrate specificity characteristic of the tetrapod counterparts. Based upon the integration of phylogenetic, genomic and functional data we propose a new classification for the piscine aquaporin superfamily.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Aquaporins constitute a superfamily of major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) that facilitate passive, yet remarkably efficient permeation of water molecules across cellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Some aquaporins can also permeate non-ionic compounds, such as glycerol and urea, and are termed glycerol facilitators (Glps) or aquaglyceroporins. The first water channel was isolated from human red blood cell membranes as a novel integral membrane protein of 28 kDa (CHIP28). This channel is now termed aquaporin-1 (AQP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Subsequently, thirteen aquaporin paralogs (AQP0-12) have been identified in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and up to 38 MIP-related sequences, divided into four types, plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), small and basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) and nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), have been documented in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Each form is composed of a single polypeptide chain varying in length from ~270-350 amino acids that spans the lipid bilayer six times with three extracellular loops (loop A, C and E) and two intracellular loops (loop B and D), which have their N- and C-termini located intracellularly. The loops B and E fold and extend intramembranous hemi-helices that bear the highly conserved amino acid motifs Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA), which are involved in the formation of the water pore. When translocated to the cell membrane, most aquaporins form homotetramers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], in which one or two monomers may be glycosylated, but each monomer functions as an independent water channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The maintenance of body fluid homeostasis is essential for the survival of any living organism. Aquatic animals also face the problem of direct interaction with their aqueous environment. Depending upon the life history of the species, the osmolarity of the saline or freshwater medium differs manifold from their internal body fluids, and therefore an important physiological role of aquaporins would be expected. Accordingly, some studies in teleosts have reported differential mRNA and protein expression of specific aquaporin isoforms in osmoregulatory organs in response to changes in environmental salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, recent studies of neofunctionalized vitellogenins and the essential role of an AQP1-related channel have revealed the evolutionary importance of oocyte hydration in marine teleosts as a pre-adaptation to spawning in the hyper-osmotic oceanic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To date, however, the genomic repertoire of aquaporin isoforms present in teleosts, as well as the permeability properties of the encoded proteins, remains largely unknown.</p><p>During the last decades, the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) has become a powerful model organism in comparative genomics and developmental biology. This species is amenable for genetic analysis in which large-scale mutagenesis screens have been successfully performed, and a large amount of genomic and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) data, BAC libraries and fine genetic linkage maps have been accumulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Work with zebrafish has also extended its application to a wide variety of experimental studies relevant to human disease, such as cardiovascular disorders, angiogenesis and neurological and renal diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Aquaporins have been shown to play important roles in some of these alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and therefore the diversity and functional properties of zebrafish aquaporins need to be determined prior to using this species as a suitable experimental model in biomedical research and comparative physiology.</p><p>With the sequence of the zebrafish genome completed, the complexity of the teleost aquaporin gene family can be assessed. In the present study, we screened the zebrafish genome for aquaporin-related sequences and determined their phylogenetic relationships, permeability properties, and the pattern of mRNA expression in adult tissues. We found a high number of functional aquaporins in this species, and based upon the data obtained we propose a new classification of the piscine aquaporin superfamily.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>The zebrafish aquaporin gene family</title><p>The screening of the zebrafish genome revealed the presence of 18 putative members of the aquaporin superfamily, most of them existing as duplicate or triplicate genes, ranging in size from 2.2 to 18 kb that encode proteins between 255-320 amino acids long (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We successfully cloned and characterized 17 of these transcripts. The nomenclature of these genes was chosen based on their phylogenetic position and chromosomal locus, their identity to human orthologs, as well as on their structural and functional features (see below), in accordance with the recommended guidelines for Human Genome Nomenclature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and the Zebrafish Information Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, zebrafish aquaporin-4, -7, -11b and -12 (<italic>draqp4</italic>, <italic>-7</italic>, <italic>-11b </italic>and <italic>-12</italic>, respectively) are present as single copy genes, whereas aquaporin-0, -1, -3, -9 and -10 genes (<italic>draqp0a</italic>, <italic>-0b</italic>, <italic>-1a</italic>, <italic>-1b</italic>, <italic>-3a</italic>, <italic>-3b</italic>, <italic>-9a</italic>, <italic>-9b</italic>, <italic>-10a </italic>and <italic>-10b</italic>, respectively) are duplicates. For the <italic>draqp8 </italic>gene, three copies were found (<italic>draqp8aa</italic>, <italic>-8ab </italic>and <italic>-8b</italic>). Unlike the other aquaporin isoforms, we found that Aqp8 has both tandem and genomic duplicates encoded within the genomes of zebrafish and stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) (see below for an explanation of the nomenclature).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acid sequence alignment of zebrafish aquaporins</bold>. (A) The consensus sequence logo is scaled according to amino acid conservation. Highest residue similarity (blue: 100%, green: 80-100% or sand; 60-80%) is found within the &#x003b1;-helical regions (H1-8). The transmembrane domains (TMD1-6) are annotated for DrAqp0a based upon a molecular sequence wrap to the crystallographically resolved structure of <italic>Bos taurus </italic>AQP0 (B).

The only exception was DrAqp8b in which only five transmembrane domains could be determined <italic>in silico</italic>, despite the equality in sequence length. Analysis of the primary structures of the zebrafish aquaporins indicated that they could be classified into two paralogous subgroups and two more divergent subgroups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The first subgroup includes DrAqp0a, -0b, -1a, -1b and -4, which share 35-85% amino acid identity (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and clustered with the <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>aquaporin-Z (EcAqpZ), thus suggesting that these aquaporins belong to the water-specific aquaporin subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The identity of the duplicated isoforms present in this group varied, since DrAqp0a and -0b were 85% identical, whereas DrAqp1a and -1b share only 61% identity (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The second group includes DrAqp3a, -3b, -7, -9a, -9b, -10a and -10b, which were 40-73% identical and clustered together with the <italic>E. coli </italic>glycerol facilitator (EcGlpF), suggesting that they belong to the aquaglyceroporin (Glp) subfamily. In this group, the identity between DrAqp3a and -3b, DrAqp9a and -9b, and DrAqp10a and -10b, was 73, 61 and 45%, respectively. The percent identity between the aquaporin and Glp groups was as low as 19-28%. The most divergent paralogs were those including the AQP8-like (DrAqp8aa, -8ab and -8b), and DrAqp11b and -12 sequences, which share 23-28% and 13-25% identity, and 20-14% and 4-22% identity with aquaporins and Glps, respectively. DrAqp8aa, -8ab and -8b share 43-60% identity between them, and DrAqp11b and -12 were 27% identical. These observations indicate that zebrafish harbours the largest complement of aquaporin genes of any vertebrate studied to date, which can be classified into four tetrapod-like subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]: classical water-selective aquaporins (<italic>AQP0</italic>, <italic>AQP1 </italic>and <italic>AQP4</italic>), a water and urea transporter (<italic>AQP8</italic>), classical Glps (<italic>AQP3 </italic>and <italic>AQP7-10</italic>), and two unorthodox aquaporins (<italic>AQP11b </italic>and <italic>-12</italic>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic relationships among zebrafish aquaporins</bold>.

Classical aquaporins (<italic>aqp0</italic>, <italic>-1</italic>, <italic>-2</italic>, <italic>-5 </italic>and <italic>-6</italic>) are encoded by 4 exons, with <italic>Xenopus tropicalis </italic><italic>aqp1 </italic>as an apparent exception with 2 exons.

Classical Glps are highly conserved with 5-6 exons in metazoa, while the vertebrate-specific unorthodox <italic>aqp11 </italic>has 3 exons, but the more ancestral unorthodox <italic>aqp12 </italic>retains 3-4 exons in vertebrates, but 4-7 exons in invertebrates.</p><p><italic>In silico </italic>genomic screening using ensembl v56 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] also revealed the presence of an 18th gene in zebrafish (ENSDARG00000038202) with an anomalous structure showing 8 exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The inferred exon structure of this gene is different to that of other metazoan aquaporins and the gene appears to be a hybrid with exons 1-3 more related to AQP2 and -5, but exons 4-8 showing higher nucleotide sequence identity to AQP1 and -6 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Using BLAST we noted that it was related to tetrapod <italic>AQP5</italic>. To validate the existence of this gene, we isolated genomic DNA based upon the predicted ensembl sequence. Using PCR and subsequent sequencing, we found that exons 1-3 are 100% identical to the predicted sequence, and the gene was therefore named <italic>draqp5/1 </italic>in accordance with its hybrid status. Maximum likelihood analysis of the codons of <italic>draqp5/1 </italic>confirmed that exons 1-3 encode a putative protein that is structurally related to tetrapod AQP5 and -2, while exons 4-8 encode a putative protein that is more related to AQP1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Bayesian analysis of the codons placed exon 1-3 basal to <italic>AQP0</italic>, but the protein product as a polytomy between AQP5 and AQP2 (data not shown). It therefore appears that despite retaining a large aquaporin repertoire of which ~40% are duplicate isoforms specific to the teleost crown-clade, the zebrafish lacks functional orthologs of tetrapod <italic>AQP2</italic>, <italic>-5 </italic>or <italic>-6 </italic>genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis of zebrafish aquaporins</title><p>To validate the orthology of the zebrafish aquaporins, we investigated the molecular phylogeny of 233 piscine nucleotide and amino acid sequences in relation to 14 human orthologs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These analyses corroborated the structural homologies outlined above and consistently demonstrated a dual- or in the case of Aqp8 a tri-paralogous clustering of piscine isoforms as sister branches to human orthologs. Two mutually exclusive clades are observed within the superfamily, a vertebrate aquaporin clade containing nine subfamilies (Aqp8, -12, 11, -4, -1, -0, 2, -5 and -6) stemming from EcAqpZ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and a Glp clade containing four vertebrate subfamilies (Aqp9, -3, -7 and -10) that stem from EcGlpF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The elasmobranch aquaporins are represented by single-copy variants, of which all but Aqp7, -11, -8, -2, -5 and -6 were found. Each clustered basal to Teleostei or together with the human transcripts indicating that the encoded proteins have differentially evolved functions specific to the actinopterygian or sarcopterygian lineages, respectively. The internal distribution of teleost isoforms within each subfamily was consistent with a whole genome duplication (WGD) event at the root of the crown-clade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

We therefore annotated each of the teleost paralogs with the postscript "a" or "b" to reflect the genomic duplicate.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Bayesian majority rule consensus tree for the codon alignment of piscine and human aquaporins</bold>.

For humans this entails LG16, while for Teleostei, the descendent chromosomes are LG2 (predicted locus of <italic>aqp8aa, -8ab</italic>) and LG3 (<italic>aqp8b</italic>) for green-spotted pufferfish, LG19 (<italic>aqp8ab</italic>) and LG1 or LG8 (predicted locus of <italic>aqp8b</italic>) for medaka. The chromosomal loci of <italic>aqp8 </italic>genes in stickleback and zebrafish further support this ancient origin. Moreover, the early divergence of teleost <italic>aqp8aa</italic>, <italic>-8ab </italic>and <italic>-8b </italic>is clearly evident in the trichotomous clustering of these transcripts among diverse taxa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and further confirmed through functional and expression analyses in zebrafish (see below).</p><p>Similar ancestral reconstructions can be made for the other linked aquaporins, wherein <italic>aqp1 </italic>genes descend from protochromosome m, <italic>aqp0 </italic>originated on prototochromosome l, and <italic>aqp7 and </italic><italic>-3 </italic>derive from protochromosomes l and i, respectively. In this latter instance, <italic>aqp7 </italic>and <italic>-3 </italic>have remained linked in all vertebrata, except the opossum (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>), and thus likely became colocalized prior to the separation of Sarcopterygii from Actinopterygii. The evidence supporting this latter proposal lies in the observation that zebrafish has maintained the linkage between <italic>aqp3b </italic>and <italic>-7 </italic>on LG21, while <italic>aqp3a </italic>is located on LG5. Zebrafish LG5 is the orthologon of stickleback LGXIII and medaka LG9, both of which harbour the <italic>aqp3a </italic>orthologs. Hence the single <italic>aqp7 </italic>gene found in teleost genomes is the surviving <italic>aqp7b </italic>product of WGD. The close linkage of teleost <italic>aqp1a </italic>and <italic>-1b </italic>genes, suggests that they could have arisen through tandem duplication. However, the fact that all teleost genomes, except medaka, retain both isoforms, and that each shows dichotomous clustering in the phylogenetic trees (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), their origin must be close to, or coincident with the WGD event at the root of the crown-clade. Hence, although we cannot exclude a tandem duplication scenario suggested earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], a parsimonious explanation for the appearance or <italic>aqp1a </italic>and <italic>-1b </italic>would seem to be WGD with subsequent colocalization, rather than local duplication and loss of WGD paralogs. The divergence of these isoforms is clearly evident in the phylogenetic trees, where <italic>aqp1b </italic>transcripts display significantly longer branch lengths compared to the <italic>aqp1a </italic>paralogs. This latter feature is consistent with our earlier findings wherein Aqp1b is a rapidly evolving channel protein with novel functions specifically associated with oocyte hydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and osmoregulatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In a separate analysis of metazoan aquaporins (Finn and Cerd&#x000e0;, unpublished data) we confirmed that <italic>aqp7, -12 </italic>and <italic>-4 </italic>have remained single-copy genes in non-human vertebrates while the present data show that <italic>Aqp11 </italic>duplicated at the root of the teleost crown-clade. With the exception of torafugu (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>), which retains both <italic>aqp11a </italic>and <italic>-11b</italic>, Teleostei, including zebrafish, appear to have differentially retained alternate isoforms. This is clearly shown in the phylogenetic tree (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), with closely related Protacanthopterygii and Acanthomorpha harbouring opposite isoforms. Based upon the more ancestral ostariophysan position of zebrafish and the fathead minnow (<italic>Pimephales promelas</italic>), we arbitrarily assigned the zebrafish cluster as the "b" variant.</p><p>Although zebrafish retains two isoforms of <italic>aqp3</italic>, these genes proved the most difficult class of Glp to resolve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Here we show the codon topology, which also includes variants obtained from EST databases. By specifically increasing the taxon sampling of these Glps, we were able to resolve a branch topology that matched the chromosomal loci of the teleost genes. As a result, the genomic duplicates are annotated as "a" or "b" accordingly. However, the protein trees did not always corroborate the codon topology and therefore these Glps will require further validation with the advent of new sequence data. The placement of <italic>draqp5/1 </italic>as an outgroup between <italic>aqp0 </italic>and <italic>-1 </italic>was consistent with its hybrid status, while the <italic>AQP2</italic>, <italic>-5 </italic>and <italic>-6 </italic>genes are specific to the sarcopterygian lineage.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular features of zebrafish aquaporins and functional implications</title><p>The characteristic residues in a water channel that distinguish a true water facilitator from a Glp have previously been analyzed by comparing sequences of aquaporins with known functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

Together with desolvation, these regions are essential for water transport specificity while excluding proton transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Accordingly, Asn is the least variable in aquaporin sequences whereas Pro and Ala are more exchangeable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The primary structure of zebrafish aquaporins and Glps confirm these observations since Asn was conserved in both NPA boxes of all paralogs, whereas Pro is substituted by Ala in the first box of DrAqp7 as observed in human and rat AQP7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). The third residue of the NPA boxes shows more variation as previously found in over 450 aquaporin-encoding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In zebrafish, Ala is substituted by Pro (first box of DrAqp8ab), Ser (first box in DrAqp8b), Val (second box in DrAqp8b), or Thr (first and second box in DrAqp3b, and DrAqp7 and -11b, respectively).</p><p>The second significant energy-barrier in aquaporins is located close to the extracellular exit of the channel forming the narrowest region of the pore and is referred to as the aromatic/arginine (ar/R) constriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. This region in water-selective aquaporins is formed by four amino acids (Phe<sup>56</sup>, His<sup>180</sup>, Cys<sup>189 </sup>and Arg<sup>195 </sup>in human AQP1; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B,C,E,F</xref>) that create the hydrophobic and size filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The site sensitive to mercurial inhibition (Cys<sup>189 </sup>in AQP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] is less conserved. In contrast, in GlpF, and essentially in all other Glps, the ar/R region is wider and more hydrophobic due to the lack of His and substitution of the Cys by a second aromatic residue, which allows the passage of polyols and urea, and possibly of other small solutes such as NH<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>2 </sub>or O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>The present data show that zebrafish aquaporins previously inferred to be water-selective or Glps after amino acid sequence analysis retain the respective three amino acid consensus in the ar/R constriction, and show the P1-P5 residues conserved in each sub-family (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6 C,F</xref>). However, the Cys residue just prior to the second NPA box, which is potentially mercury-sensitive, is maintained in DrAqp1a and -1b. Similarly, DrAqp8aa, -8ab, -8b, -9a, -9b and -10a also show a Cys upstream of the second NPA motif in loop B but at slightly different positions. Despite these minor differences, the structural features of zebrafish aquaporins strongly suggest that they encode functional channels. A slightly different situation is found in DrAqp8aa, -8ab and -8b, which despite having the conserved P1-P5 residues of the aquaporin subfamily, contain His instead of Phe<sup>56</sup>, and Val or Ile instead of His<sup>180</sup>, in the ar/R constriction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). As for their mammalian counterparts, DrAqp11b and -12 appear to be more divergent since they did not show any of the typical residues in the ar/R constriction and only three aquaporin-conserved amino acids (P2, P4 and P5) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Water and solute permeability of zebrafish aquaporins</title><p>Typically, aquaporin water-channel activity is tested by the oocyte-swelling assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], in which <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes expressing aquaporins are exposed to hypo-osmotic shock and the subsequent water influx is measured by determining volume changes over time.

Such inhibition was not always reversed with the reducing agent &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol. However, DrAqp4 (as in mammalian AQP4) and DrAqp8b were mercury-insensitive, even though DrAqp8b has a potential mercury-sensitive Cys upstream of the second NPA box (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). It thus appears that water and solute flux through zebrafish aquaporins can be blocked by mercurial compounds regardless of the presence or absence of Cys<sup>189</sup>.

For AQP12, this seems to be caused by the absence of protein expression in the oocyte plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], but in the case of AQP11 the protein is readily targeted to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].

However, when AQP11 was reconstituted into liposomes this protein proved to be a functional water channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Although the identity of DrAqp11b and -12 with AQP11 and -12 is low (35% and 38% identity, respectively), a similar situation may be speculated in zebrafish.

Thus, in the ovary SaAqp1b is oocyte-specific, whereas SaAqp1a seems to be only present in the external epithelium surrounding the ovarian follicle. In the gut, SaAqp1b is exclusively detected at the apical membrane of rectal enterocytes, whereas SaAqp1a is localized at the brush border of enterocytes in the duodenum and hindgut. Therefore, the significance of the redundant aquaporin expression in zebrafish must be further investigated by determining the subcellular sites of transcription and protein targeting.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we identified a large number of MIP encoding genes in zebrafish when compared to tetrapods. By integrating the molecular phylogeny and the genomic loci with structural and functional analyses we demonstrate dual- or tri-paralogy between teleost aquaporins and human orthologs. Consequently teleost aquaporins can be classified into the same water-selective and Glp subfamilies previously described in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Expression in <italic>X. laevis </italic>oocytes also demonstrated that zebrafish aquaporin genes, except <italic>aqp11b </italic>and <italic>-12</italic>, encode functional channels, which in most cases have retained the substrate specificity of the tetrapod counterparts. Some mammalian aquaporins are also permeable to NH<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>2 </sub>or O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>], but whether any of the zebrafish orthologs are permeable to these compounds remains to be investigated.</p><p>The high number of aquaporin genes in zebrafish and other teleosts result from WGD at the root of the crown-clade. Most duplicated isoforms are retained, while <italic>aqp4</italic>, <italic>-7</italic>, and <italic>-12 </italic>have remained single-copy genes in non-human vertebrates. The findings further reveal that tandem duplication has occurred within the clade and in a lineage-specific manner, but such intrachromosomal replication events are rare for this superfamily. While most of the duplicated genes seem to be conserved during the diversification of teleosts, some such as <italic>aqp11, -3 and -8 </italic>appear to have been differentially retained among species.

Total RNA was extracted from the kidney, gut, gills, liver, brain and ovary of adult fish using the RNeasy Maxikit (Qiagen) followed by DNase treatment following the manufacturer's instructions. A pool of 1-10 &#x003bc;g total RNA from the different tissues was reverse transcribed using 0.5 &#x003bc;g oligo (dT)<sub>17</sub>, 1 mM dNTPs, 40 IU RNAse inhibitor (Roche), and 10 IU MMLuV-RT enzyme (Roche), for 1.5 h at 42&#x000b0;C. For amplification, PCR was carried out with 1 &#x003bc;l of the synthesized cDNA and specific oligonucleotide primers designed according to the available cDNAs and genomic sequences. The PCR reactions were conducted using a total volume of 50 &#x003bc;l containing 1x reaction buffer supplemented with 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 mM of each forward and reverse primer, and 1U of Easy-ATM High-Fidelity PCR Cloning Enzyme (Stratagene). The PCR conditions were an initial denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min, followed by 36 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 60-65&#x000b0;C for 1 min (depending on the Tm of each primer pair), and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min. A final elongation cycle at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min was carried out in all cases. The products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and both strands sequenced by BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing on ABI PRISM 377 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The deduced amino acid sequences of cloned cDNAs were 100% identical to those available in the databases, except for DrAqp7 and -11b, which were 98% identical (3 and 2 amino acid changes, respectively), and the cDNAs encoding DrAqp8aa, -8ab, -9b, -10a and -12, which were 99% identical (1 amino acid change in each sequence). In further structural and phylogenetic analyses we used the amino acid sequences derived from the cDNAs cloned in this study since they were found to encode functional proteins in oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional expression in <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>oocytes</title><p>Zebrafish aquaporin full-length cDNAs were cloned into the <italic>Eco</italic>RV/<italic>Spe</italic>I sites of the oocyte expression vector pT7Ts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>].

An aliquot of RNA (500 ng) was treated with Turbo-DNase (Ambion) and reverse transcribed as described above. PCR was carried out with 0.3-0.6 &#x003bc;l of cDNA employing <italic>Tfi </italic>DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and aquaporin isoform-specific oligonucleotide primers (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). For each aquaporin nucleotide sequence, the oligos were designed to flank one or separated introns that were complementary to non-conserved regions among aquaporin paralogs. The reactions were carried out in a 25 &#x003bc;l volume containing 1x reaction buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 mM of each primer and 1U of <italic>Tfi </italic>polymerase. The PCR conditions were as described above except for the number of the cycles, which was increased to 40. As a reference gene to control the variation in mRNA concentration, zebrafish <italic>b-actin1 </italic>(<italic>drbactin1</italic>) was used, employing PCR conditions of 22 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min. Amplification of genomic DNA (500 ng), purified from liver, was used as a positive control using the same PCR conditions but with an elongation step of 1 min per kb. An aliquot of the PCR reactions was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and the products were visualized and photographed.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Orthologs of the aquaporin superfamily were obtained from public GenBanks via entrez and BLAST and identified via BLASTP, BLASTN or BLAT from ensembl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and the ghost shark (<italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>] genome databases. Construction of aquaporin amino acid multiple sequence alignments was achieved using the t-coffee v7.54 suite of tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>] and ClustalX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>]. Each amino acid alignment was converted to a codon alignment (nucleotide triplets) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and manually adjusted to correct errors using MacVector (MacVector Inc, Cambridge, UK). Three-dimensional alignments of each zebrafish amino acid sequence against crystallographically resolved aquaporin molecules (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>) were used to identify conserved secondary structures in order to minimize gaps in the &#x003b1;-helical regions. Three-dimensional protein wraps were rendered using Cn3D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Identity and similarity matrices were calculated using MacVector.</p><p>Preliminary Bayesian analyses (Mr Bayes v3.1.2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]) were run for all sequences, and identical predictions pruned from the alignments. Where possible GenBank sequences were run with predicted variants to validate the latter. Prior to phylogenetic analyses, the alignments were trimmed to remove unrelated N- and C-terminal regions. To determine the influence of lesser-conserved regions, large gap regions were removed and these alignments tested via Bayesian analyses. This resulted in shorter branch lengths, and an increased incidence of polytomies, but no significant change to the tree topologies.</p><p>Each data set was modeled primarily via Bayesian, but also via maximum likelihood or maximum parsimony methods of phylogenetic inference as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Neighbor joining (NJ) methods were used for efficient identification of orthologs. Tree topologies were accepted after validating convergence using Tracer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>] and when the codon and protein tree topologies were congruent. For Bayesian analyses the following settings were used for codon alignments: nucmodel = 4by4, nst = 2, rates = gamma; and amino acid alignments: aamodel = mixed, with 1,000,000 generations, sampled every 100 generations using 4 chains and a burnin of 3,500. For each run, a majority rule consensus tree together with posterior probabilities from the last 6,500 trees, representing 650,000 generations was arranged using Archeopteryx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>] and subsequently rendered with Geneious Pro (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand). Maximum likelihood codon trees were attained using PAUP v4b10 (Sinauer Associates Inc.) and rendered using FigTree v2.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>].
