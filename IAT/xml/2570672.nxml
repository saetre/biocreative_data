Patients with LQTS have increased risks of developing life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) when subjected to physical or emotional stress, or upon exposure to QT prolonging drugs. VT/VF can result in cardiac events such as syncope, cardiac arrest and sudden death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. LQTS-related cardiac events often occur in the young, otherwise healthy individuals, and sudden death may present as the first symptom in many cases.</p><p>Multiple genes have been found to cause LQTS and these include <italic>KCNQ1 </italic>(LQT1), <italic>KCNH2 </italic>(LQT2), <italic>SCN5A </italic>(LQT3), <italic>ANK2 </italic>(LQT4), <italic>KCNE1 </italic>(LQT5), <italic>KCNE2 </italic>(LQT6), <italic>KCNJ2 </italic>(LQT7), <italic>CACNA1C </italic>(LQT8), <italic>CAV3 </italic>(LQT9) and <italic>SCNB4 (LQT10)</italic>. LQT4-10 are rare and there is a controversy as whether some of the subtypes are truly LQTS. LQT1 and LQT2 remain the mainstay as the most common LQTS genotypes. Previously, we reported a study of mutational analysis of <italic>KCNQ1 </italic>in 102 families and patients with a family history of lethal cardiac events, including LQTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The present study was carried out as a continued investigation in the same cohort of patients plus 10 new LQTS families/patients enrolled since the earlier report, and focused on mutational analysis of the <italic>KCNQ1 </italic>gene in the new families/patients and the LQT2 gene, <italic>KCNH2 </italic>in the whole cohort. Multiple mutations were identified. Most importantly, we provide the first family-based genetic evidence to show that two variants in <italic>KCNH2</italic>, mutation A490T and a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) K897T, interact with each other in <italic>cis </italic>orientation to reduce the risk of LQTS (shorter QTc, less severe symptoms).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>Patients with a clinical diagnosis of LQTS or idiopathic VT/VF and their first degree blood related family members were enrolled from medical clinics in North America. A total 154 families/patients were involved in this study. This study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Institutional Review Board on Human Subject Research and informed consent was obtained from the study participants or their guardians.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical examinations</title><p>Diagnosis of LQTS was based on the QT interval and T wave morphology from 12-lead ECG and medical history of syncope, cardiac arrest and sudden death as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. All the 12-lead ECG tracings available to the study were recorded at 25 mm/sec as standard in North America. QT interval was manually measured in leads II or V5 or the lead with longest QT interval and QTc was calculated using Bazett's formula for heart rate correction. A LQTS clinical diagnosis was considered if QTc &#x02265; 0.47 s in males or QTc &#x02265; 0.48 s in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Borderline QT prolongation (0.45&#x02013;0.47 s) associated with symptoms were also considered as affected. Asymptomatic family members with QTc of &#x02264;0.44 s and with a normal T wave morphology were phenotyped as non-affected. Other individuals were classified as having uncertain phenotype with regard to LQTS.</p><p>For the purpose of LQTS diagnosis, we used a stationary bike (ergometer) exercise protocol as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Superior to treadmill tests, ergometer tests eliminates the upper body movement to reduce ECG artifacts. An accurate QT measurement therefore can be achieved for exercise ECG recordings. 24-h Holter ECG monitoring was performed using Lifecard CF Digital Holter Recorder (Renolds Medical). LQTS phenotyping including ECG measurement was performed by G.M.V. and R.B. prior to the genetic testing.</p><p>For the bike test, we recorded standard 12-lead ECG in a paper speed of 25 mm/sec with voltage calibrated as 1 mV = 10 mm (or 10 mm/mV) for the baseline in supine and sitting positions, and exercise (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 minutes) and recovery (1, 3, 5 and 8 minutes) stages. QT interval was measured in the lead with the longest QT interval (mostly in lead II or V5) as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of human genomic DNA</title><p>Each study participant donated 5&#x02013;20 ml of blood samples, which were used for isolation of genomic DNA using the DNA Isolation Kit for Mammalian Blood (Roche Diagnostic Co.)</p></sec><sec><title>Linkage analysis</title><p>For the two large families with LQTS, linkage analysis with markers spanning known LQTS genes was carried out to identify the specific gene for mutational analysis.

Among mutation carriers, 58% (18/31) had normal to borderline prolonged QTc (&#x02264;0.46 sec) on their initial ECGs, which overlapped with non-carriers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A bicycle exercise test was performed for 24 mutation carriers and 4 non-carriers. Mean QTc was significantly prolonged during exercise in mutation carriers, whereas it remained in the normal range in non-carriers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). All mutation carriers with a normal or borderline prolonged QT interval reached QTc of 0.48 sec or greater during exercise tests.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Reduced penetrance of LQTS phenotype and effect of exercise on QTc.</bold> Mean QTc for carriers with mutation L187P and 11 non-carriers (left) and mean QTc for mutation carriers before (resting state) and during exercise (right).

The proband in the family was a 75-year-old female with a prolonged QTc of 0.596&#x02013;0.687 s and left bundle branch block (QRS = 0.122 s). The patient developed a long run of polymorphic VT at the age of 75 years, which was cardioverted. She also developed two syncopal episodes at the age of 67 and 75 years, and a transient ischemic attack at the age of 63. Telemetry Holter ECG monitoring identified frequent multiform ventricular ectopic beats with occasional supraventricular ectopy, no bradycardia, and 173 runs of polymorphic VT. Echocardiography showed normal left and right ventricles, ejection fraction of 40% and abnormal left ventricular relaxation (stage I diastolic dysfunction). EEG, neurological and hearing tests, and troponin T and creatine kinase-MB levels (0.01 ng/ml and 4.8 ng/ml, respectively) were normal. Cardiac catheterization showed mild luminal irregularities without obstructing lesions, and mild global systolic left ventricular dysfunction consistent with hypertensive cardiomyopathy.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of a novel mutation in <italic>KCNH2</italic>, 2020insAG, in family QW258.</bold> Top, pedigree structure; Middle, DNA sequence for the patient using the forward primer; Bottom, DNA sequence for the patient using the reverse primer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2350-9-87-4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Identification of five other mutations in KCNH2</title><p>DNA sequence analysis of the rest of families and patients identified five previously-known mutations in the <italic>KCNH2 </italic>gene.

Patients with mutations A561T, D609N, A614V, N629S all had a typical diagnosis of LQTS. Interestingly, the LQTS patient with mutation R366X also presented with bradycardia at the age of 30 years, <italic>torsade de pointes</italic>, recurrent syncopal episodes when awakening, startling and sitting, and first degree AV block.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we carried out mutational analysis of <italic>KCNQ1 </italic>and <italic>KCNH2</italic>, the two most common potassium channel genes associated with LQTS in 112 families and patients with a family history of lethal cardiac events, including LQTS, Mutations were identified in 8 of 112 families. Interestingly, genotype-phenotype correlation studies in family QW2648 showed that two variants in <italic>KCNH2</italic>, mutation A490T and SNP K897T, interact with each other in <italic>cis </italic>to reduce the risk of LQTS (shorter QTc, less severe symptoms). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, in LQTS family QW2648, two variants in the <italic>KCNH2 </italic>gene, one common SNP K897T and one mutation A490T, were identified. Because both variants co-segregated or in linkage disequilibrium in the family, they are located in the <italic>cis </italic>orientation on the same chromosome. A490T was previously reported as a <italic>de novo </italic>mutation in a Japanese female who showed markedly prolonged QTc of 0.61 s, bradycardia, <italic>torsades de pointes </italic>and recurrent syncope. Functional studies revealed that the mutant channel showed reduced current density by 39% compared to the wild type channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In a sharp contrast, none of the seven mutation carriers with A490T and K897T showed a QTc of &#x0003e; 0.48 s. The difference in QTc between A490T alone and combination of both A490T and K897T was notable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). These results suggest that the T allele of SNP K897T confers a protective effect against QTc prolongation. On the other hand, SNP K897T did not appear to exert any effect on bradycardia because both A490T and A490T/K897T carriers exhibited clear evidence of the bradycardia phenotype. A mutation that changes A490 to P490 was recently reported in a large family with nine LQTS patients by Pellegrino et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The penetrance of mutation A490P was 100% in the family and the phenotype of LQTS in the family appears to be very severe. QTc ranged from 0.48 s to 0.57 s (mean QTc = 0.510 +/- 0.036), and five of the nine patients showed QTc of &#x0003e;0.50 s. Recurrent syncope, <italic>torsade de pointes</italic>, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and family history of sudden death were documented in the family. The mean QTc between carriers with mutation A490P in comparison and those with both A490T and K897T was statistically significant (<italic>P </italic>= 0.0008, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Our study is the first family-based genetic investigation to show that two variants in <italic>KCNH2</italic>, mutation A490T and SNP K897T, interact with each other in <italic>cis </italic>orientation and resulted in a mild LQTS phenotype.</p><p>Interestingly, no bradycardia was reported for mutations carriers with A490P, suggesting that the effect of mutation A490T on bradycardia may be mutation-specific. The molecular mechanism for mutation-specific development of bradycardia is unknown, but it is an interesting subject that warrants future investigation.</p><p>The modifying effect of <italic>KCNH2 </italic>SNP K897T has been studied previously, but inconsistency exists among different studies, mostly population-based studies. In this study, we investigated the effect of SNP K897T on QTc prolongation in multiple LQTS patients in a moderate-size family. This family-based approach has the advantage that the influence by environmental factors is more limited than a population-based approach. As described above, our results indicated that the rare T allele of SNP K897T has a protective effect against QTc prolongation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). This is consistent with the results from a recent population-based study in 2,515 men and women involved in the Framingham Heart Study. In September, 2007, Newton-Cheh et al. showed that the common K allele of SNP K897T was associated with a 1.6 ms increase of QTc per allele copy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], although the effect was very mild. Similarly, in 2005 in a population of 3,966 involved in the German KORA S4 study, Pfeufer et al. found that the rare T allele was associated with 1.9 ms and 3.5 ms decreases of QTc in heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In 2005, Gouas et al. studied a French population with 200 subjects with short QTc (100 men with QTc of 0.333&#x02013;0.363 s and 100 women with QTc of 0.336&#x02013;0.365 s) and 198 subjects with longer QTc (99 men with QTc of 0.394&#x02013;0.433 s and 99 women with QTc of 0.400&#x02013;0.432 s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The rare T allele was significantly more frequent in the group with short QTc than the group with long QTc (odds ratio = 0.64, <italic>P </italic>= 0.006), suggesting that the T allele was associated with shorter QTc. In 2003, Bezzina et al. found that TT homozygotes had shorter QTc than heterozygotes and KK homozygotes in a Caucasian population of 1,030 from Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The association of SNP K897T with shorter QTc was not without controversy. In 2002, Pietila et al studied 267 women and 259 men from Finland and found that the rare T allele (KT + TT) was significantly associated with longer maximum QTc than the K allele (KK) in females only (0.441 s vs. 0.477 s, <italic>P </italic>= 0.005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In males, maximum QTc was longer in the KK group than the KT + TT group (0.465 s vs. 0.447 s), though the difference was not statistically significant (the small sample size may account for the finding of non-significance). In an Italian family Crotti et al. studied a small LQT2 family and reported a <italic>KCNH2 </italic>mutation (A1116V) and the T allele of SNP K897T on the non-mutant allele (i.e. in <italic>trans </italic>orientation) in one severe, symptomatic LQTS patient, whereas 3 relatives with A1116V alone were asymptomatic and showed mild QTc prolongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, the T allele was associated with increased QTc in the Italian family, which is contrary to the results from our study. The <italic>cis</italic>-localization between the mutation A490T and SNP K897T in our family vs. <italic>trans</italic>-localization in the study by Crotti et al. may be one of the potential causes for the discrepancy. Overall, our results are more consistent with the finding that the minor allele T of SNP K897T plays a protective role on QTc lengthening.</p><p>There are some limitations for this study. First, the comparison of the mean QTc among carriers with A490T, A490P, and A490T/K897T was made in individuals of different geographical origins under different clinical settings. The accuracy of the analysis might be compromised as the ethnic and environmental influences have not been accounted for. Furthermore, the studied family was small. Second, no modifying variants in <italic>SCN5A</italic>, <italic>KCNE1</italic>, and <italic>KCNE2 </italic>were identified in the carriers with A490T/K897T in family QW2648, however, we cannot exclude the presence of variants in other ion channels that may influence QTc and other QTc-modifiers such as NOSAP1 variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Third, an <italic>in vitro </italic>functional study to examine the electrophysiological effects of the mutations or combinations of mutations may provide an insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of LQTS.</p><p>In this study, we also identified two new mutations associated with LQTS, L187P in <italic>KCNQ1 </italic>and a <italic>KCNH2 </italic>mutation, the 2-bp insertion 2020insAG. The L187P mutation is located in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains S2 and S3 of the KCNQ1 channel. Two other mutations in the same area, G189R and R190Q, were loss-of-function mutations when expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] Thus, the L187P mutation may also act by a loss-of-function mechanism. However, the mild phenotype of this large LQT1 family with 58% presented with a normal to borderline QT prolongation and only 16% of gene careers had a history of cardiac events, indicating that the functional outcome of L187P may be more complicated than a simple loss-of-function mechanism. The 2-bp insertion 2020insAG occurs at codon 674 and results in frameshift that leads to premature termination of translation. The mutant protein contains amino acid residues 1 to 673 of KCNH2 and addition of a short peptide, YQTHRCCGCGSSSASTRSPIPCASASRSTSSTPGPTPTASX. Alternatively, the frameshift creates an internal stop codon that leads to degradation of <italic>KCNH2 </italic>mutant mRNA by non-sense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). A recent investigation that the NMD effect resulted in a mild phenotype in a large LQT2 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, since &#x0003e;30% of <italic>KCNH2 </italic>mutations are nonsense mutations that may lead to NMD, a mutation that can trigger NMD effect may not necessarily lead to a mild LQTS phenotype. The investigation of modifier effects has opened a new chapter for us to better understand why some LQTS patients die suddenly and others do not. Genotype-phenotype correlation and further molecular electrophysiology investigation may help the risk stratification.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our study identified two novel mutations causing LQTS, the L187P mutation in <italic>KCNQ1 </italic>and the 2020insAG mutation in <italic>KCNH2</italic>. Most interestingly, we showed that the rare T allele of SNP K897T conferred a protective effect on LQTS patients with <italic>KCNH2 </italic>mutation A490T located in <italic>cis </italic>orientation. Our study is the first to investigate the effect of SNP K897T on another <italic>KCNH2 </italic>mutation located in <italic>cis </italic>orientation.
