MazF is an endoribonuclease that leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis by cleaving mRNAs at ACA sequences. Here, using 2D-gels, we show that in <italic>E. coli</italic>, although MazF induction leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of most proteins, the synthesis of an exclusive group of proteins, mostly smaller than about 20 kDa, is still permitted. We identified some of those small proteins by mass spectrometry. By deleting the genes encoding those proteins from the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome, we showed that they were required for the death of most of the cellular population. Under the same experimental conditions, which induce <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death, other such proteins were found to be required for the survival of a small sub-population of cells. Thus, MazF appears to be a regulator that induces downstream pathways leading to death of most of the population and the continued survival of a small sub-population, which will likely become the nucleus of a new population when growth conditions become less stressful.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The enteric bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic>, as most other bacteria, carries a pair of genes on its chromosome; one of them specifies a toxin and the other one an antitoxin. Previously, we have shown that that the <italic>mazEF</italic> toxin&#x02013;antitoxin system in <italic>E. coli</italic> is responsible for bacterial cell death under stressful conditions. Clearly, a system that causes any given cell to die is not advantageous to that particular cell. On the other hand, the death of an individual cell may be advantageous for the bacterial population as a whole. Here, for the first time, we report that MazF activates a complex network of proteins. Moreover, we also show, for the first time, that MazF affects two opposite processes: cell death and cell survival. We suggest that this dual effect may provide an evolutionary rational for <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death. When exposed to stressful conditions, most of the cell population undergoes programmed cell death; however, there appears to be an active process that keeps a small fraction of the population alive. When growth conditions become less stressful, it is probably this small sub-population of survivors that becomes the basis of a new cell population.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Toxin-antitoxin modules consist of pairs of genes on the bacterial chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-EngelbergKulka1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Pandey1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>: the downstream gene encodes a stable toxin which causes cell death and the upstream gene encodes a labile antitoxin which counteracts the activity of the toxin.

But we were particularly interested to find that this inhibition was not complete: though MazF led to the inhibition of the synthesis of most proteins, it selectively enabled the synthesis of other specific proteins. Some of those specific proteins were required for the death of most of the population. Surprisingly, we also found that MazF enabled the synthesis of proteins that permitted the survival of a small sub-population under those stressful conditions that cause <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death for the majority of the population.

Our careful analysis revealed that, after MazF-induction, though most protein synthesis was inhibited, a low level of protein synthesis remained.

This change is reflected in the size of the synthesized proteins. Clearly, the synthesis of proteins whose molecular weight was greater than &#x0223c;20 kDa tended to be inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), while the synthesis of proteins whose molecular weight was less than &#x0223c;20 kDa tended to be increased.

Moreover, we have shown that during this death process, some of those genes function as &#x0201c;Survival Genes&#x0201d;. Therefore, we asked whether the genes <italic>soxS</italic> and <italic>soxR</italic>, known to be involved in ROS detoxification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Green1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, might function as &#x0201c;Survival Genes&#x0201d; in the ROS-dependent <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death pathway.

Once again, we compared the viability of those deleted mutants to that of the WT and its &#x00394;<italic>mazEF</italic> derivative under the following stressful conditions: (a) brief inhibition of translation by spectinomycin or (b) DNA damage caused by nalidixic acid.</p><p>As we expected, the mutants &#x00394;<italic>soxS</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>soxR</italic> were significantly less viable than the WT strain upon a brief inhibition of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) &#x02013; a stressful condition which induces a ROS-dependent <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-KolodkinGal3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, the viability of &#x00394;<italic>soxS</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>soxR</italic> strains resembled that of the WT strain when DNA was damaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) - a stressful condition which induces a ROS-independent <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-KolodkinGal3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we suggest that <italic>soxS</italic> and <italic>soxR</italic> function indeed as &#x0201c;Survival Genes&#x0201d; in ROS-dependent <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Until now, it has been understood that MazF causes the complete inhibition of protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Zhang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Inouye1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, when we performed incorporation experiments similar to those previously done by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Zhang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Christensen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, we indeed observed a dramatic reduction in the level of protein synthesis. However, in contrast to previous reports, we found that the inhibition of protein synthesis was incomplete: a basal level of about 10&#x00025; protein synthesis remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Comparing MazF-induced and MazF-uninduced cultures in 1D-gels revealed that this basal level of protein synthesis remaining after MazF induction represented an exclusive group of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). More thoroughly analyzing those results on 2D-gel revealed that MazF induction led to a clear change in the pattern of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g002">Figure 2</xref>). After MazF induction, we observed an increase in the level of synthesis of proteins whose molecular weight was smaller than &#x0223c;20 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), but a decrease in the level of synthesis of proteins whose molecular weight was greater than &#x0223c;20 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g002">Figure 2A and 2C</xref>).</p><p>MazF is an endoribonuclease that cleaves mRNAs at ACA sequences in a ribosome-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Zhang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Zhang2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. For this research we used mass-spectrometry to identify 13 proteins that were synthesized within a period of 15 minutes after MazF induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We observed that each of the mRNA sequences encoding these proteins carried at least one ACA sequence (data not shown). Since the mRNAs of these proteins carry the MazF's target site, how could those proteins be synthesized after MazF induction? A possible explanation is that there is an as yet unknown mechanism that protects those mRNAs from cleavage by MazF, or at least reduces the rate of cleavage in comparison to the other mRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We are currently searching for such a mechanism that would allow the selective synthesis of those proteins.</p><p>We also found that some of the proteins selectively synthesized after MazF induction were required for cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>). Thus, while inhibiting bulk protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g001">Figure 1</xref>), it seems that MazF also enabled the selective synthesis of proteins essential for cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The genes encoding the proteins, which are essential for cell death, can be divided into three groups: (a) <italic>ygcR</italic> and <italic>yfbU</italic> are involved in cell death only when triggered by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) but not in cell death triggered by the inhibition of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3B</xref>); (b) <italic>elaC</italic> is involved in cell death only when triggered by the inhibition of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) but not in cell death triggered by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3C</xref>); (c) <italic>clpP</italic>, <italic>slyD</italic>, and <italic>yfiD</italic> are involved in cell death triggered by both the inhibition of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggest that there may be at least two separate death pathways that may share some common steps.</p><p>What are the roles of the genes that were found by us to be required for <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death in <italic>E. coli</italic>? (i) <italic>slyD</italic> encodes a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Roof1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Hottenrott1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> which also functions as an <italic>E. coli</italic> chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Bernhardt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Scholz1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, SlyD is required for phage &#x003c6;X174-induced cell lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Roof1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Maratea1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> where it appears to stabilize the &#x003c6;X174 lysis protein E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Bernhardt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. We have not yet tested if these functions of SlyD also contribute to <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death. However, the involvement of SlyD in cell lysis is very intriguing and is currently under our investigation. (ii) <italic>yfiD</italic> encodes a glycyl radical protein that can replace a pyruvate formate-lyase subunit that has been damaged by oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Wagner1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

(iii) <italic>clpP</italic> has already been shown to be involved in <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Aizenman1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The ATP-dependent ClpAP serine protease degrades MazE antitoxin. When <italic>mazEF</italic> expression is inhibited by specific stressful conditions, there is no <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of MazE and MazF. Then, ClpAP degrades MazE and the concentration of MazE is reduced. In the absence of MazE, the stable MazF can act freely and cause cell death. In addition, the ATP-dependent ClpXP protease is involved in the synthesis of the communication signaling peptide EDF which is required for <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-KolodkinGal2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that MazF induction causes an increase in the amount of the intracellular ClpP. This may be a part of a positive feedback loop in which the increase in ClpP will cause both a decrease in the level of MazE and an increase in the level of EDF. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that ClpP has an additional role in the cell death process, downstream from MazF activity. (iv) Generally, CCA is the consensus sequence required for a tRNA to be charged with an aminoacyl group. <italic>elaC</italic> encodes RNase BN that cleaves the 3&#x02032;-terminal portion of tRNA if it differs from CCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Callahan1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the contribution of RNase BN as a 3&#x02032;-terminal nuclease remains elusive since <italic>E. coli</italic> has no tRNAs lacking the CCA sequence at their 3&#x02032;-termini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Callahan1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Deutscher1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

At this stage we cannot determine whether these functions of RNase BN are connected to <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death or whether this enzyme may have additional functions essential for <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death. (v) <italic>yfbU</italic> and <italic>ygcR</italic> encode for proteins of unknown function. Here we show, for the first time, that those genes are required for at least one cellular process in <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x02013; programmed cell death.

Instead, we found that these genes, whose gene products were selectively synthesized after MazF induction, supported the survival of a small sub-population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that MazF enabled the simultaneous synthesis of specific proteins essential for the death of most of the population and of specific proteins essential for the survival of a small sub-population.</p><p>How could these &#x0201c;Survival Genes&#x0201d; contribute to the survival of a small sub-population under stressful conditions causing <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death?

The first is induced by the inhibition of transcription and/or translation and the second by DNA damaging agents.

(ii) <italic>deoC</italic> encodes deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase that is involved in the catabolism of deoxyribonucleosides in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-HammerJespersen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

This dual effect of MazF on two such opposite processes, cell death and cell survival, may provide an evolutionary rational to <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death. We suggest that when exposed to stressful conditions, while most of the bacterial cell population undergoes programmed cell death, an active process keeps a small fraction of the population alive. When the growth conditions become less stressful, these survivors probably become the nucleus of a new population. We have previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-KolodkinGal1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-KolodkinGal2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> that <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death is a population phenomenon requiring a quorum-sensing factor called EDF. That <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death is indeed a population phenomenon is strongly supported by the results of our work here showing that MazF induction contributed both to the death of most of the population and to the survival of a small sub-population. It should be noted that an analogous phenomenon, in which an active process of cell death of a sub-population enables the survival of the rest of the population, was found in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-GonzlezPastor1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-Ellermeier1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Based on our present results, we have developed our model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000390-EngelbergKulka5">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> for <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Thereby, the stable toxin MazF can act freely as an endoribonuclease. As we have reported here, the unrestricted action of MazF leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of many proteins, particularly those larger than &#x0223c;20 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, some proteins, particularly those smaller than &#x0223c;20 kDa, can still be selectively synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g002">Figure 2</xref>). At least six of those proteins, which are selectively synthesized after MazF activation, are necessary for implementing the death of most of the cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, it seems that more than one death pathway can be activated by MazF. The specific pathway chosen appears to be a function of the particular stressful condition, like DNA damage or the inhibition of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We believe that the cell is led towards its own death by the combination of the inhibition of the general synthesis of proteins, necessary for life, and the parallel synthesis of proteins necessary for the death process. Furthermore, while at least six of the selectively synthesized proteins are required for the death of most of the cell population, at least three other small proteins, also selectively synthesized after MazF activation, are required for the survival of a small sub-population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000390-g003">Figure 3</xref>). It seems likely that the survival of that small sub-population would be supported by the dead cells, that would then release nutrients and other factors, like signal molecules, essential for survival.</p><fig id="pgen-1000390-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000390.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death process - an extended model.</title><p>Text and arrows in black represent the <italic>mazEF</italic>-mediated cell death process that occurs following either DNA damage or brief inhibition of protein synthesis.
