Budding yeast are a useful model of polarized growth, helping to define many molecular components of this conserved process. Besides budding, yeast cells also differentiate upon treatment with pheromone from the opposite mating type, forming a mating projection (the &#x02018;shmoo&#x02019;) by directional restructuring of the cytoskeleton, localized vesicular transport and overall reorganization of the cytosol. To characterize the proteomic localization changes accompanying polarized growth, we developed and implemented a novel cell microarray-based imaging assay for measuring the spatial redistribution of a large fraction of the yeast proteome, and applied this assay to identify proteins localized along the mating projection following pheromone treatment. We further trained a machine learning algorithm to refine the cell imaging screen, identifying additional shmoo-localized proteins. In all, we identified 74 proteins that specifically localize to the mating projection, including previously uncharacterized proteins (Ycr043c, Ydr348c, Yer071c, Ymr295c, and Yor304c-a) and known polarization complexes such as the exocyst. Functional analysis of these proteins, coupled with quantitative analysis of individual organelle movements during shmoo formation, suggests a model in which the basic machinery for cell polarization is generally conserved between processes forming the bud and the shmoo, with a distinct subset of proteins used only for shmoo formation. The net effect is a defined ordering of major organelles along the polarization axis, with specific proteins implicated at the proximal growth tip.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short"><p>Upon sensing mating pheromone, budding yeast cells form a mating projection (the &#x02018;shmoo&#x02019;) that serves as a model for polarized cell growth, involving cytoskeletal/cytosolic restructuring and directed vesicular transport.

Polarization mechanisms are important for both basic cell division and specialized growth processes, such as formation of neuronal processes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> cell motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> and asymmetric stem cell differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> The resultant coordinated asymmetry affects major developmental, cell division, and metabolic programs in the cell. The budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, has proved an excellent model system for studying polarized growth, as it restructures the cell differentially in vegetative growth, mating and filamentous growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Each of these developmental fates is characterized by a distinct morphology, and the stimulus and outcomes of each differentiation pathway are unique. For example, internal bud cues from the previous bud site drive the cycle of bud emergence and cytokinesis. External cues such as mating pheromone and nutrient starvation trigger signal transduction pathways that induce formation of a mating projection or the filamentous &#x02018;foraging&#x02019; phenotype, respectively. These changes in cellular morphology are accompanied by dynamic changes in the cellular proteome that function in setting up the polarization axis and orchestrating specific activities required for the appropriate growth response.</p><p>Wild-type yeast cells, upon treatment with pheromone from the opposite mating type, undergo a differentiation program typified by the formation of a mating projection (the &#x02018;shmoo&#x02019;) accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase (reviewed in refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>)). Many proteins are redistributed to different subcellular locations culminating in the formation of a highly structured polarization axis oriented toward the shmoo tip. Although similar polarization mechanisms dominate the formation of a bud and a mating projection, there are obvious differences underlying the two processes. While budding is preordained by location of the previous budding landmark, mating projection formation appears to be a dynamic process that relies in the wild on a directional pheromone gradient. Mating-competent cells can therefore continuously sense pheromone gradients and alter the site of projection formation accordingly, and in some instances, even sequentially form multiple &#x02018;shmoos&#x02019;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Cells subjected in the laboratory to uniform pheromone concentrations form randomly oriented mating projections. The shape and structure of mating projections also differ from buds, with the conspicuous constriction that marks buds being largely absent at the base of the &#x02018;shmoos&#x02019;. This region contains the septins, chitin, and pheromone induced proteins such as Afr1p that interact with the septins. It is therefore likely that an altered set of protein interactions during the mating process determines the shape and morphology of the projection and distinguishes it from bud formation during vegetative growth. This is more evident when one analyzes finer details such as the growth dynamics of a bud relative to a shmoo. Bud growth becomes isotropic after the apical growth phase, while a shmoo displays more unidirectional growth dynamics, possibly because of differential rates of recruitment of proteins that deposit cell wall constituents. These differences arise due to the distinct functional goals that each process seeks to achieve&#x02014;nuclear segregation to the daughter and cytokinesis during vegetative growth, as opposed to cell fusion and karyogamy during mating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Systematic identification of the proteins associated with each process will therefore begin to shed light on their mechanistic differences.</p><p>Significant strides have been made in technologies for increasing the throughput of imaging protein spatial localization in mammalian cells (e.g., see refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>)), but the power of yeast genetics has already resulted in proteome-wide imaging and epitope tagging strategies being successfully employed in this model organism. Cellular imaging of protein localization has been conducted on transposon-tagged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> as well as recombination-based tagged open reading frame (ORF) libraries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Immunofluorescence and live-cell imaging of the tagged strains in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has identified the subcellular localization of most of the proteome under standard laboratory conditions and these data are now accessible through the TRIPLES, GFP/UCSF, and other databases.</p><p>We previously reported the development of spotted cell microarrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> (cell chips) for measuring cell morphology and morphology defects across collections of thousands of yeast strains, more recently applied to measure a bacterial protein&#x02019;s localization in thousands of differing genetic backgrounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Briefly, spotted cell microarrays allow for cells of different genetic backgrounds to be robotically arrayed onto coated glass slides at high density, then each strain imaged in turn using automated microscopy. The cell microarray approach is readily adapted to measure eukaryotic protein subcellular localization by taking advantage of the availability of epitope-tagged strain collections, such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strain collection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> In this strain set, each of the &#x0223c;4200 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains carries a genomic copy of the <italic>Aequoria victoria</italic> GFP (S65T) gene fused to the carboxy-terminus of a different open reading frame. Arraying this strain set on spotted cell microarrays and imaging the entire set of strains thus measures the subcellular localizations of &#x0223c;4200 proteins in parallel, providing a measure of each tagged protein&#x02019;s localization under the assayed conditions. This approach might logically be combined with immunofluorescence experiments, as a major advantage of the cell chips is the minimal use of expensive reagents on the chips, achieved by limiting the use of antibodies and dyes to single microscope slides. Imaging entire libraries on chips also results in reduced imaging times in comparison to, for example, imaging the 50 96-well plates required for the complete GFP tagged collection.</p><p>In this study, we have attempted to map the changes in localization of the yeast proteome upon formation of a mating projection. Although individual proteins that localize to the shmoo tip have been characterized (e.g., the shmoo tip marker Fus1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup>), proteome-wide screens have not been performed to measure such localization changes due to their expensive and cumbersome nature. We developed and implemented a cell microarray-based imaging assay for measuring the spatial redistribution of a large fraction of the yeast proteome, and applied this assay to identify proteins localized along the mating projection following pheromone treatment. By further incorporating information about known yeast gene associations and about protein localization during vegetative growth, we trained a machine learning algorithm to refine the cell imaging screen, resulting in a total of 74 proteins identified that specifically localize to the mating projection. Functional analysis of these proteins, coupled with analyses of individual organelle movements during shmoo formation, suggests a model in which the basic machinery for cell polarization is generally conserved between processes forming the bud and the shmoo, with a distinct subset of proteins used only for shmoo formation. The net effect is a defined ordering of major organelles along the polarization axis, with specific proteins implicated at the proximal growth tip.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1.1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Tagged Strains and Growth Conditions</title><p>Spotted cell microarrays were manufactured from the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> GFP tagged clone collection (Invitrogen), in which each of &#x0223c;4200 individual strains with genetic background EY0986 (ATCC 201388: MATa his3&#x00394;1 leu2&#x00394;0 met15&#x00394;0 ura3&#x00394;0 (S288C)) was chromosomally tagged with the coding sequence of <italic>A. victoria</italic> GFP (S65T) at the carboxy-terminal end of an open reading frame.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> This collection was copied in 96 well plates using a Biomek FX liquid handling robot, inoculating each strain into 200 &#x003bc;L of YPD containing 17% glycerol, growing at 30 &#x000b0;C for &#x0223c;2 days without shaking, mixed on a plate shaker, and sealed and frozen at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Alpha Factor Treatment</title><p>GFP-tagged strains were treated with alpha factor in the following manner: A copy of the GFP clone collection was thawed from &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C and a 1% inoculum used to seed a fresh copy in YPD medium.

Additional cell microarrays were printed and imaged from the GFP-ORF strain collection in the absence of pheromone, serving as a negative control for the localization.

These composite images were created by stacking all fluorescent channels as well as a histogram-modified DIC image.

For the training set, we employed the proteins identified in the high-throughput screen. Classifier features were aggregated from data provided by the UCSF GFP screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> and the functional gene network of Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> The features collected for each gene were the sum of the gene&#x02019;s network log likelihood scores (LLS) to the set of training genes, the ratio of the sum of the gene&#x02019;s LLS scores to the training set genes divided by the sum of LLS scores to all other genes, protein abundance (molecules per cell), and cell location (using primary cellular location). All features were numeric values except location which was treated as a discrete estimator (e.g., binary flags for nucleus, bud neck, etc.). The classifier was implemented in Weka and applied to the set of 5804 yeast genes, either using all training genes as the training/test set or using 10-fold cross-validation (both gave similar results). The classifier proved reasonably predictive, with an area under a 10-fold cross-validated receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.843. At the score threshold selected for experimental validation, shmoo-localized proteins were predicted with a cross-validated true positive rate of 0.51 and a false positive rate of 0.027. This corresponds to recovering 20 of the 37 shmoo genes (cross-validation: 19). An additional 151 (cross-validation: 153) genes not identified in the initial screen were also classified as shmoo genes using a 0.5 probability cutoff. Of the 151 genes, 118 were present in the GFP library and were rescreened manually; 37 of these proved to be shmoo localized.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>1</label><title>Organellar Movement during Pheromone-Induced Polarized Growth</title><p>It has been previously observed that organelles move during the pheromone-induced, polarized growth of yeast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> To establish conditions for screening for genes involved in polarized growth, we used fluorescence microscopy to identify reproducible trends in organellar movements. We systematically measured the subcellular localization of 9 major organelles via organelle-specific fluorescent protein fusion markers. For each organelle, we constructed a yeast strain expressing both a red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged organelle marker, and an orientation marker, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged shmoo tip marker, Fus1. The positions of the two fluorescent protein markers and the nucleus (detected by staining with DAPI dye) were determined before and after treatment with the mating pheromone alpha factor.

In this case, clathrin (as localized by Chc1) shows a definite bias toward the shmoo tip and lies predominantly between the shmoo tip and nucleus.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr-2008-00524g_0001" id="gr2" position="float"/></fig><p>Each organelle marker strain (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) strongly revealed the formation of an axis of polarity, presumably toward the pheromone gradient in anticipation of the mating process and subsequent cellular fusion. Several common features about organellar arrangement were evident: The nucleated actin filaments that form the actin cables were polarized toward the shmoo tip (as evidenced by Sac6-RFP fusions, the cross-linking fimbrin protein used as the marker). This was consistent with actin cables acting as &#x02018;conduits&#x02019; for transporting organelles during mating, just as they do during vegetative growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The spindle pole body core component, Spc42, was prominent in its movement toward the shmoo tip, indicating that the tethered spindle microtubules, the nuclear envelope and the chromosomes were also reoriented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> In consequence, the entire nucleus was also reoriented toward the shmoo tip, with the nucleolus being preferentially located at the opposite side of the nucleus relative to the shmoo tip. Another consequence was extensive vesicular trafficking of cargo intended for membrane deposition and new cell wall formation at the site of the shmoo projection (as evidenced by localization of clathrin protein Chc1 with Fus1-GFP). No bias toward the polarization tip was observed for the endoplasmic reticulum marker Sec13, a component of the Nup84 nuclear pore complex and COPII complex. As expected, there was a broad distribution of a Golgi cisternal marker, Anp1, both toward and away from the shmoo tip. While polarization was along the shmoo tip axis, transport may occur in both directions. The endosome marker, Snf7 tended to accumulate away from the shmoo tip, possibly implicating the involvement of the endocytic pathway in trafficking components between the membrane and the vacuole (for example, the pheromone receptor Ste2 which upon pheromone binding and ubiquitination, is internalized and endocytosed into vesicles).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Analysis of yeast expressing the GFP-tagged mitochondrial marker Ilv3 (data not shown) revealed mitochondria throughout the shmooing cells, occasionally shmoo-tip localized but also generally found widely distributed.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Organelles are differentially distributed along the polarization axis.

More specifically, we note that many of the proteins localized to the shmoo tip belong to protein complexes that are also involved in mediating polarized growth at the bud tip during vegetative growth (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

For instance, proteins such as Sfb3, Sec31 and Shr3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> mediate sorting of COPII vesicles between the ER and Golgi, and Sec18,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> which is involved in post-Golgi vesicular transport. Other endosomal pathway proteins such as Bsp1 that functions as an adaptor linking the synaptojanin protein Inp52 implicated in TGN-to-early endosome sorting to the cortical actin cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> were also identified. The type V myosin, Myo2 along with its interacting partners and cargo peroxisomes compose the observed vesicular transport phenomena directed at the shmoo tip. Myo2, for example, interacts with Chs5 to deliver chitin synthase enzyme Chs3 and with Smy1 to transport vesicles, and organelles such as vacuole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> toward the tip. The final step involves docking and tethering of the endosomal vesicles to the site of polarized growth. Sec2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> a protein that functions as the Guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the rab GTPase Sec4, mediates vesicle tethering to the exocyst and localizes at the shmoo tip. Proteins involved in cellular processes such as maintenance of cell wall integrity (Rgd1, Slg1, Wsc2, Wsc3) and in cell fusion (Kel1, Kel2 and Fus1) are tip localized as well as tying polarization events and pheromone specific functions at a systemic level.</p><p>An interesting observation made from the shmoo tip localization screen was the relative positioning of the proteins that were involved in various phases of vesicle mediated transport in our images (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Proteins that were involved in exocytosis, such as the components of the exocyst, were spatially situated tightly at the shmoo tip as compared to the rest of the proteins from the screen. These proteins are involved in the final stages of protein transport such as protein docking and secretion and presumably indicate regions of membrane-vesicle interactions. In contrast, proteins of endocytosis localized more broadly around the shmoo tip, often with a punctate distribution possibly defining hot spots of endocytosis, and including proteins such as Sla1, Las17 and others. Formation of such hot spots is still an active area of research with recent discoveries being made in yeast of &#x02018;eisosomes&#x02019; that appear to mark endocytic sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> The actin cytoskeleton and cortical proteins play important roles in such processes with Rvs161 (also identified in this screen) interacting with eisosomal marker proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Lastly, proteins involved in ER-Golgi and trans-golgi to plasma membrane vesicle trafficking showed a definite bias of GFP signal toward the shmoo tip, presumably reflecting vesicular transport, but were even more broadly distributed around the tip than the exocytic or endocytic proteins.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Spatially distinct localization of different vesicle transport processes is apparent along the shmoo tip.

Proteins that are part of other events such as ER-golgi and TGN vesicular sorting are notably more diffuse in their distribution, with a bias towards the shmoo tip.

Among the 81 false positive GFP-tagged strains predicted to be shmoo tip-localized by the classifier, several were involved in vesicular transport with 18 localizing to the bud tip (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In other words, even though the computational method did not always directly predict localization to the mating tip, it predicted proteins involved in processes very similar to and possibly mechanistically overlapping with shmoo formation. For example, Boi2 and Bnr1 were conspicuously absent from the shmoo tip but were present at the bud tip and may reflect differential organization and positioning of the cytoskeletal architecture during pheromone induced mating as compared to vegetative buds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> In contrast, the formins Bni1 and Boi1 were found proximal to the shmoo tip consistent with their role in remodeling this dynamic locale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup></p><p>Additional proteins were found, emphasizing the differential sets of interactions driving the processes of mating and cell fusion. The shmoo tip marker Fus1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> was recovered, as was Bck1, a cytosolic protein kinase in vegetative cells that appears to concentrate at the polarized shmoo tip.

Some suggestions for more precise function can again be gained from the yeast functional network (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B), which connects Yer071c with actin cap binding proteins Cap1 and Cap2, while Ycr043c links to Rvs161, a lipid raft protein, all of which we observed at the shmoo tip. In addition, Car1, an arginase that when deleted causes cells to undergo G1 cell cycle arrest upon starvation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> and Lsg1, a protein involved in 60S ribosome biogenesis are two other proteins we identified in this screen, but that were not obviously mating related.

A summary of our findings is presented in Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. Our screen has enabled us to align the proteome down to the level of individual proteins identified along the polarization axis induced by pheromone stimulation. Upon the basis of this systematic assay, we demonstrate that the bulk of shmoo-tip localized proteins are conserved with those localized to the bud tip during vegetative growth. These data therefore support a model for the adaptive reuse of polarized growth machinery between different polarized growth processes. For example, Huh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> had shown that actin related genes are structured along the polarization axis during budding. We show that this observation is true during mating as well. This process is not automatic since the budding and mating projection sites are distinct and therefore the point of origin of cellular asymmetry is likely also different. Moreover, the 67 proteins shared between the mating and budding polarization processes (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) are significantly more conserved between human and yeast than expected by chance (39 of the 67 yeast genes have human orthologs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup><italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.023, chi-square test), indicating that the functions of these core polarization components are likely to be preserved across eukaryotes. Although the process of establishment of cell polarity by proteins such as Cdc42, Cdc24 and Far1 are well-studied, the exact molecular mechanisms toward predictive cellular models are still wanting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> Our efforts are a first step toward screening proteome-wide dynamics to understand precisely how biological systems spatially coordinate protein interactions and regulate their dynamics.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Schematic summarizing the spatial reorganization of organelles and protein complexes along the major polarization axis formed during shmooing.
