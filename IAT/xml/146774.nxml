The helicases encoded by the Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) B and D genes function in both nucleotide excision repair and transcription initiation. Mutations that affect the repair function of these proteins result in XP while mutations affecting transcription result in neurological and developmental abnormalities, although the underlying molecular and cellular basis for these phenotypes is not well understood. To better understand the developmental roles of these genes, we have now identified and characterized the rep B and rep D genes from the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum . Both genes encode DNA helicases of the SF2 superfamily of helicases. The rep D gene contains no introns and the rep B gene contains only one intron, which makes their genomic structures dramatically different from the corresponding genes in mammals and fish. However the predicted Dictyostelium proteins share high homology with the human XPB and XPD proteins. The single copy of the rep B and D genes map to chromosomes 3 and 1, respectively. The expression of rep B and D (and the previously isolated rep E) genes during multicellular development was examined, and it was determined that each rep gene has a unique pattern of expression, consistent with the idea that they have specific roles in development. The pattern and extent of expression of these genes was not affected by the growth history of the cells, implying that the expression of these genes is tightly regulated by the developmental program. The expression of the rep genes is a very early step in development and may well represent a key event in the initiation of development in this organism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
