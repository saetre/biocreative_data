Whereas some family members such as HDGF and HRP-2 are expressed in a wide range of tissues, the expression of others is very restricted. HRP-1 and -4 are only expressed in testis, HRP-3 only in the nervous system. Here we investigated the expression of HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 in the central nervous system of adult mice on the cellular level by immunohistochemistry. In addition we performed Western blot analysis of various brain regions as well as neuronal and glial cell cultures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>HDGF was rather evenly expressed throughout all brain regions tested with the lowest expression in the substantia nigra. HRP-2 was strongly expressed in the thalamus, prefrontal and parietal cortex, neurohypophysis, and the cerebellum, HRP-3 in the bulbus olfactorius, piriform cortex and amygdala complex. HDGF and HRP-2 were found to be expressed by neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In contrast, strong expression of HRP-3 in the adult nervous system is restricted to neurons, except for very weak expression in oligodendrocytes in the brain stem. Although the majority of neurons are HRP-3 positive, some like cerebellar granule cells are negative.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The coexpression of HDGF and HRP-2 in glia and neurons as well as the coexpression of all three proteins in many neurons suggests different functions of members of the HDGF protein family in cells of the central nervous system that might include proliferation as well as cell survival. In addition the restricted expression of HRP-3 point to a special function of this family member for neuronal cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The family of Hepatoma derived growth factor (HDGF) and HDGF related proteins (HRPs) comprises six members which belong to different subgroups according to their length and isoelectric points. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Little is known about the function of the different family members. So far, most studies addressed HDGF which was initially purified from the supernatant of human hepatoma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Five HDGF homologous proteins have been identified so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Four of these proteins have been termed HRP-1 to -4 (HDGF Related Proteins 1 to 4), the fifth p52/75 or LEDGF (Lens Epithelium-derived growth factor). HDGF and its homologues display between 54% and 78% sequence identity among the 91 N-terminal amino acids. Because of this similarity the amino-terminal region has been termed <italic>Homologue to Amino Terminus of HDGF </italic>(HATH region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). In contrast, the length and amino acid sequence of HRP's C-terminal regions vary suggesting a modular structure of these proteins. This is supported by structural data obtained by NMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The main cellular localization of HDGF is nuclear, although in some cells HDGF can be found in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. HDGF has two nuclear localization signals, one in the conserved HATH region, the other one in the C-terminal area specific for the different family members. The nuclear localization has been shown to be a prerequisite for the mitogenic activity of intracellular HDGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] whereas extracellular HDGF seems to signal through signal transduction pathways from the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Except for their growth factor activity functions of HDGF family members are largely unknown. HRP-1 is believed to play a role in spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and LEDGF has been shown to function as a transcriptional activator. It also binds to and potentiates the activity of HIV integrase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The latter activity has also been shown for HRP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. For HDGF it has been speculated that it plays a role in renal, liver, lung and heart development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, a growing number of studies report a possible role of this growth factor in the development of different types of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In contrast, no functional data exist for HRP-3. The expression of this protein in contrast to the other family members is mainly restricted to nervous tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Here we examine the cellular expression of HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 in the adult rodent brain by Western blot analysis and immunhistochemistry. Data from these studies are compared to the expression of all three proteins in primary and secondary cell cultures of neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Western blot analysis of various brain regions</title><p>Of the six members of the Hepatoma-derived growth factor family only HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 are expressed in the central nervous system.</p><p>To study the expression of these factors in more detail we performed Western blot analysis of samples obtained from different brain regions using HDGF, HRP-2, and HRP-3 specific antibodies. HDGF was rather evenly expressed throughout all brain regions investigated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), except for low levels in the substantia nigra. The HDGF-antiserum detected two polypeptides of 38 kDa and 40 kDa, the smaller form being predominant in all brain regions. In contrast to HDGF, expression of HRP-2 and HRP-3 varied substantially between different brain regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). HRP-2 was strongly expressed in the thalamus, prefrontal and parietal cortex, neurohypophysis, and the cerebellum. In some tissues, the HRP-2 antiserum recognized up to three proteins of 90, 110 and 125 kDa.</p><p>HRP-3 expression was high in the bulbus olfactorius, piriform cortex and amygdala complex. The HRP-3 antiserum recognized a single polypeptide of 30 kDa, only in the amygdala complex an additional faint 35 kDa polypeptide was detectable. As for HDGF, substantia nigra contained only low amounts of HRP-2 and HRP-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical analysis of neuronal expression in brains of adult mice</title><p>For a more detailed expression analysis we performed immunhistochemistry to detect HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 in brain section of adult mice and compared their expression to that of cell type specific markers. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows cerebellar sections immunostained for HDGF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), HRP-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) and HRP-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>), respectively. These sections reveal that HDGF and HRP-2 are found in the internal granule cell layer (IGL), Purkinje cell layer (PCL) and to a lower extent in the molecular cell layer (MCL). Simultaneous immunostaining for HDGF or HRP-2 and NeuN &#x02013; a marker for granule cells in the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] -, respectively, yielded comparable patterns of expression and confirmed that HDGF as well as HRP-2 are expressed in granule cells of the IGL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C+F</xref>). In contrast, HRP-3 did not colocalize with NeuN and is therefore not expressed by granule cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). Nevertheless a few HRP-3 positive cells were detected in the IGL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref> arrowheads). These cells most likely represent Golgi cells. To a lower extent also cells of the MCL are stained most likely representing basket/stellate cells, another type of inhibitory interneuron in the cerebellum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).</p><p>The overlay figures reveal that HDGF and HRP-2 expression is not restricted to granule cells. Cells in the adjacent PCL also strongly express HDGF and HRP-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C+F</xref>) as well as HRP-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the expression of HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 in Purkinje cells double staining with calbindin a marker for these cells in murine cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] was performed. Expression of all three family members was detected in the nuclei of Purkinje cells (arrowheads in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, D, G</xref>) whereas the cytoplasm of these cells is free of immunoreactivity (compare to calbindin in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). As pointed out already, some cells in the IGL are strongly positive for HRP-3 and may represent Golgi cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref> arrows).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical analysis of glial expression in brains of adult mice</title><p>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref> (arrows) show that HDGF and HRP-2 are also expressed in nuclei of cells within white matter tracts of the cerebellum (arrows in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C+F</xref>). In contrast, no HRP-3 positive cells were detected in the cerebellar white matter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref>). The occurrence of HDGF and HRP-2 positive cells in white matter tracts led us to investigate the expression of HDGF family members in glial cells. For this purpose we applied the specific antisera directed against the three proteins together with a monoclonal antibody recognizing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows that cells with HDGF and HRP-2 positive nuclei also express GFAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C+F</xref> arrowheads). In contrast, HRP-3 did not localize to GFAP positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). Therefore, astrocytes express HDGF and HRP-2 but no HRP-3.</p><p>To investigate the expression of HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 in oligodendrocytes we performed coimmunostainings on brain stem sections for these three proteins together with an antibody against 2,3-cyclonucleotid-phosphodiesterase (CNPase, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Again, HDGF and HRP-2 were strongly expressed by cells positive for CNPase (arrowheads in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C+F</xref>) whereas these cells showed only very limited HRP-3 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>, arrowheads) when compared to cells most likely representing neuronal cells of the brain stem that are strongly positive for HRP-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>, asterisk).</p></sec><sec><title>Examination of HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 coexpreesion</title><p>Immunohistochemistry with the different cellular markers but also prima vista comparison of HDGF and HRP-2 expression in the cerebellum (e.g. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) revealed a considerable overlap in expression pattern for HDGF and HRP-2 in neuronal as well as glial cells. In contrast, coexpression with HRP-3 seemed to be restricted to special types of neuronal cells (for example Purkinje cells). To investigate the degree of coexpression of HDGF and HRP-3 in more detail we raised an antiserum against HDGF in sheep to perform double immunfluorescence of both proteins. In addition to cerebellar sections we also investigated hippocampal and cortical sections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>These pictures reveal that HDGF expression is widespread in all brain areas investigated. The same applies for HRP-3, except for the cerebellum, in which the number of HRP-3 expressing cells is limited. There is considerable colocalization of HDGF and HRP-3 in the hippocampus but whereas HDGF is equally distributed over the whole hippocampus there is lower HRP-3 expression in the dentate gyrus than in the other parts of this brain region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A+B</xref>). In a higher magnification of this brain region cells can be distinguished that predominantly express HRP-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, arrowheads) as well as a cell layer at the inner part of the dentate gyrus showing a particularly high expression of HDGF and being negative for HRP-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, arrows). In addition, ependymal cells of the ventricular surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, arrow) where also found to be only positive for HDGF.</p><p>In the cortex cells expressing HDGF and HRP-3 in layer I are less frequent than in layer II, however, there are only very few cells in layer I which express HDGF only (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, arrows). In good correlation to the ependymal cells mentioned above meningeal fibroblasts forming the pia mater are only expressing HDGF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, PM).</p><p>In contrast to the hippocampus and cortex coexpression of HDGF and HRP-3 is limited in the cerebellum. As already shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, in the cerebellum strongest expression of HRP-3 was found in cells most likely representing inhibitory interneurons of the internal granular cell layer (Golgi cells, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D-F</xref> + <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref> arrowheads). Very few unidentified cells in the IGL are only positive for HRP-3 (asterisks in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E+F</xref>).</p><p>In the double stainings between HDGF and HRP-3 differences in the pattern of expression were most striking in the cerebellum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D-F</xref>). Therefore, to get an idea about the percentages of cells in this brain region positive for the two proteins we performed double staining with propidium iodide to label the nuclei of all cells. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> shows examples for these stainings for HDGF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A-C</xref>) and HRP-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D-F</xref>). For each marker three independent pictures were taken and used to count all cells (propidium iodide) and cells positive for HDGF or HRP-3, respectively. Cells were independently counted for the molecular layer (MCL) on the one hand and the Purkinje cell layer (PCL) together with the internal granule cell layer (IGL) on the other hand. As can be seen already in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A&#x02013;C</xref> 100% of the cells in the cerebellum express HDGF. For HRP-3 we obtained different results for the two counted regions. In the MCL in the three pictures examined 64, 68 and 69% of all cells showed HRP-3 immunreactivity. Because of the restriction of HRP-3 to neuronal cells this cells most likely represent basket/stellate cells another type of inhibitory interneuron in the cerebellum. In the PCL and IGL together because of the high amount of granule cells negative for this family member less than 5% of cells were positive for HRP-3. As mentioned before Purkinje cells are positive for HRP-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref> arrows). As can be seen in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref> there are additional cells in the Purkinje cell layer that do not stain for HRP-3 most likely representing the cell bodies of radial glia cells that lie in direct contact with the Purkinje cell bodies in this cell layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref> asterisks). In addition there is not a sharp boundary between this layer and the granule cell layer. Therefore some of this HRP-3 negative cells display also granule cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 in cultured cells</title><p>To compare the results obtained by immunhistochemistry of brain sections of adult mice with cell cultures of neuronal and glial cells, we prepared cultures of neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes as described in material and methods. HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 were quantified in cell homogenates by Western blot analysis. For HDGF and HRP-3 the results of these Western blots confirmed the data of immunhistochemistry. Whereas HDGF showed strong expression in all of the four cell types, high amounts of HRP-3 were only found in cultured neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Only low amounts of HRP-3 were detected in glial cell cultures. To exclude that this observation might be due to residual neuronal cells in the glial cell culture we analyzed the samples for the presence of the neuron specific marker protein growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43). This protein was only detected in cultured neurons, but not in the glial cell cultures. In contrast to the data obtained on adult mouse brain sections, HRP-2 is not or only weakly expressed in cultured astrocytes or neuronal cells, respectively. Strong HRP-2 expression was found in cultured oligodendrocytes and microglia.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The family of Hepatoma derived growth factor related proteins comprises six members. Whereas HDGF and HRP-2 are expressed in a wide variety of tissues including the nervous system, HRP-3 is expressed in the nervous system only. Previous data indicate that at least HDGF and HRP-3 proteins are expressed by differentiated neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Western blots of protein extracts of different brain regions demonstrate a rather ubiquitous expression of HDGF family members in various CNS regions. HDGF is the most evenly distributed member whereas HRP-2 and HRP-3 expression varies between different regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). On the cellular level HRP-3 shows the most restricted expression when compared to HDGF and HRP-3. HRP-3 was strongly expressed in neurons only. Expression in neurons is, however, not ubiquitous but occurs only in a subpopulation: e.g. Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and neurons within the subiculum and cornu ammonis of the hippocampus are strongly positive whereas cerebellar granule cells are negative for HRP-3. The term granular cell is used to describe major cell populations in the cerebellar cortex the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus. These cells share the characteristics of being born late during development and they all express at least one common molecular marker, termed RU49, that has been implicated in their specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This has led to the suggestion that these diverse kinds of granule cells are of a common developmental origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This is supported by the observation that granule cells of the dentate gyrus show a remarkably reduced expression of HRP-3 in addition to its missing expression in cerebellar granule cells described above.</p><p>Beside the correlation between HRP-3 and neuronal origin, the limited cerebellar expression of this protein regarding neuron subtypes correlates also with the transmitter phenotype of this cells. Whereas granule cells are glutamatergic all other neurons of this brain structure use gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter. Ptf1a, which was reported to be a lineage determinator in the cerebellum, for example, is also exclusively expressed by GABAergic neurons of the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. At least for the cerebellum HRP-3 might therefore be a marker to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations.</p><p>Except for neurons very low amounts of HRP-3 could also be detected in oligodendrocytes located in the brain stem. In contrast, white matter tracts of the cerebellum contained no HRP-3 expressing cells. Studies on the place and time of origin of oligodendrocytes have demonstrated heterogeneity inside of this cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Maybe HRP-3 expression in oligodendrocytes similar to our observations for granule neurons is also dependent on their time of birth. In contrast to oligodendrocytes HRP-3 could not be detected in astrocytes in vivo.</p><p>Expression of HDGF and HRP-2 is much less restricted than that of HRP-3. Both proteins are found in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendroglia, in meningeal fibroblasts and ependymal cells. Immunohistochemistry shows that HDGF and HRP- 2 expression in neurons is widespread, except for the cerebellum this also applies for HRP-3. Our data indicate that all three proteins are found in the majority of neurons. However, our data do not allow to exclude that a minor subpopulation of neurons may in fact be negative for HDGF and HRP-2.</p><p>The results obtained by immunohistochemistry of brain slices are only partly reflected in cultured cells.</p><p>As expected, in cultured cells HRP-3 is predominantly expressed in neurons and only to a low extent in glial cells. Expression levels of HDGF are similar in all cells investigated, which also reflects the in vivo situation. Clear differences between cell culture and tissue data regarding the expressing cell type were detected in the case of HRP-2. Whereas in immunhistochemistry cells positive for GFAP showed also HRP-2 immunreactivity, no HRP-2 protein could be detected in the astrocytic culture. This may either reflect species differences since the cultures were prepared from rat brain or developmental differences, because immunohistochemistry was performed on brain sections of adult animals, whereas cultures were prepared from neonatal rats.</p><p>It has already been noted previously that the antisera against the various HRP proteins detect more than one polypeptide in Western blot analysis. The HDGF antiserum recognizes a predominant 38 kDa and a minor 40 kDa polypeptide, respectively. The molecular basis for this is unclear. Similarly, the HRP-2 antiserum detects three polypeptides of 90, 110 and 125 kDa in Western blots. Thus, as already shown for HDGF and HRP-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] also HRP-2 is migrating at a molecular weight significantly higher than the one predicted (74 kDa) by its primary amino acid sequence. Whether this is due to posttranslational modifications or as shown for HDGF and HRP-3 to abnormal migration behavior in SDS-PAGE has to be determined. In contrast, in most tissues only a single HRP-3 polypeptide can be detected. Only in homogenates of piriform cortex and the amygdala complex a faint 35 kDa polypeptide is detectable. Similarly, low amounts of additional 35 kDa and 33 kDa polypeptides cross react in homogenates of cultured neurons and astrocytes respectively. Thus, all of the antisera detect several polypeptides. The functional significance of these different polypeptides is unknown.</p><p>The overlapping expression pattern of HDGF and HRP-2 and for neuronal cells also HRP-3 suggests different functions for these proteins. Beside its proliferating activity HDGF displays also survival activity for neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A relation of this factor to cell death and survival is further underlined by the observation that it is involved in TNF&#x003b1; induced apoptosis in Hela cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It can be speculated that the function of HDGF in neurons during development changes from more proliferative aspects to cellular survival. Expression in glial cells indicates that within the nervous system HDGF may have similar functions also in non-neuronal cells. For HRP-2 much less is known regarding the function of this family member. Structurally it shows the highest similarities to LEDGF and also functionally their might be an overlap between these two proteins. For example, for both of them it was shown that they bind to and enhance the activity of HIV integrase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similar to HDGF, LEDGF was reported to be neuroprotective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Whether this is also true for HRP-2 has to be determined.</p><p>HRP-3 in contrast to the other two family members seems to be restricted to neurons, but the nature of its function in these cells is still obscure. Beside its localisation in the cell nucleus at least in younger animals a prominent protein signal in neurites can be observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Whether HRP-3 therefore is involved in the extension or maintenance of these cellular processes has to be addressed in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Prior studies have demonstrated HDGF as well as HRP-3 expression in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The presented data show a wide distribution of both family members as well as HRP-2 in brain neurons. In contrast glial cells express only low amount or even no HRP-3 but HDGF as well as HRP-2. This observation point to a special function of HRP-3 for neuronal cells. In addition, the overlapping expression pattern of HDGF and HRP-2 and for neuronal cells also HRP-3 suggests different functions for these proteins that might include proliferation as well as cell survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>For Western blot analysis antibodies against &#x003b2;-actin (pan Ab-5) was obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany) and against GAP-43 from Chemicon International (Hofheim, Germany). For immunhistochemistry antibodies against NeuN, Calbindin and GFAP were from Chemicon International, Vector Laboratories (Burlingham, CA, USA) and Sigma (Munich, Germany) respectively.</p><p>Rabbit antibodies against HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 were produced and purified as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The sheep antiserum against HDGF was raised against the histidine tagged protein as described for the rabbit antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Three aliquots of about 500 &#x003bc;g protein each were used to immunize a sheep (Diagnostics Scotland, Edinburgh, Scotland). Immunization was performed according to local governmental regulations. In order to obtain specific antibodies suitable for immunhistochemistry rabbit and sheep sera were purified by affinity chromatography using GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion proteins of the different growth factors. Therefore, mouse HDGF, HRP-2 and HRP-3 coding regions were cloned into the pGEX4T3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) using BamHI and SalI restriction sites. After purification via glutathione sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) the purified proteins were coupled to Affigel 10 using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad, M&#x000fc;nchen, Germany). The resulting matrices were used for immunoaffinity purification of antibodies specific for the respective growth factor. All antibodies were examined for crossreactivity by preincubation with the respective recombinant protein (for results see file 1 and 2 of the additional material and Abouzied and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]).</p><p>All fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies used for immunhistochemistry were obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of protein extracts and western blot analysis</title><p>Protein extracts from the different brain regions of adult rat brain were prepared by homogenization in TBS (Tris-buffered saline; 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl) containing 1% Nonidet P40 and protease inhibitors (5 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride, 1 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin and 1 &#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin). After homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 20.000 g for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C to remove unhomogenized material. The protein content in the supernatant was determined by a detergent-compatible assay (BCA&#x02122; protein assay; Pierce). Equal amounts of protein for each brain region were loaded on to a SDS/PAGE gel (10% acrylamide) and resolved according to the method of Laemmli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>To obtain protein samples for Western blotting, neural cell cultures (on 50 mm dishes) were washed with 5 ml ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl) and lysed for 10 minutes in 400 &#x003bc;l lysis solution (0.3 &#x003bc;M aprotinin, 1 &#x003bc;M leupeptin, 1 &#x003bc;M pepstatin, 100 &#x003bc;M phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride in H<sub>2</sub>O) on ice. Aliquots of the lysates were lyophilised and used for protein assays and for Western blot analysis.</p><p>After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P&#x02122;; Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany). Free binding sites on the membrane were blocked by incubation in 3% (w/v) skimmed milk in TBST (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). Primary antibodies against HRP-3 (1:1.000), HRP-2 (1:500), HDGF (1:1.000), actin (1:10.000) and GAP 43 (1:1.000) and peroxidase-labelled secondary antibodies against rabbit and sheep (both 1:20.000; Dianova) were incubated in TBST containing 3% skimmed milk for 2 h at room temperature. After three washings in TBST, bound antibodies were visualized by ECL<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the detection of the different target proteins on the same PVDF membrane remaining antibodies were stripped by incubation with Glycine/HCl pH 3.0 for 20 min at room temperature. For the Western blot of the brain region homogenates detection was performed in the order HRP-2/HDGF/HRP-3/actin, for the Western blot of the neural cell culture samples in the order HRP-2/HDGF/HRP-3/actin/GAP 43, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cultures of neural cells</title><p>Neuron-rich primary cultures were prepared from the brains of embryonal (E16) Wistar rats as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 2.5% avertin in 0.9% saline (0.8 ml/100 g body weight). Subsequently, they were transcardially perfused with 0.4 ml/g body weight of Ringers solution for mammalians, followed by 2 ml/g body weight of 4% (w/v) freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in PBS. Following perfusion, brains were removed from the skull and postfixed for 7 h at room temperature in the same fixative and afterwards kept in PBS over night. Then, 40 &#x003bc;m thick, sagittal sections were cut in PBS using a Leica vibratome (VT1000S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). To visualize the different antigens, sections were washed in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized by incubation in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 min. Non-specific protein binding sites were blocked using 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h followed by incubation of the primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing in PBS and sections were incubated with the respective fluorescently labelled antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 2 h at RT. After 2 washes in PBS and one wash in distilled water immunfluorescence was analyzed by laser scan microscopy using a Leica TCS SP2 instrument.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HME carried out the immunhistochemical experiments and participated in the design of the study and the drawing up of the manuscript.

Double stainings demonstrate that in contrast to HDGF and HRP-2, HRP-3 is not expressed in NeuN positive granular cells of the cerebellum. Distinct cells in the IGL detected by HRP-3 antibodies are most likely Golgi cells (I, arrowheads). In addition HRP-3 is also clearly expressed in the PCL and weakly in some cells of the MCL (I).

Antibodies against HDGF (A) or HRP-3 (B) were used to detect both proteins in the hippocampus of an adult mouse. Comparison of the double immunfluorescence demonstrates the lack of expression of HRP-3 in cells covering the ventricel wall of the hippocampal region (C, arrow), whereas HDGF is clearly expressed in this cell type. In contrast, hippocampal neurons coexpress both family members, but whereas HDGF is found to a similar extent in all neurons of the hippocampal formation (A), neurons of the dentate gyrus show only weak expression of HRP-3 when compared to the rest of the hippocampus (B). Higher magnification of this region demonstrates the existence of cells predominantly expressing HRP-3 (D, arrowheads) as well as a cell layer only positive for HDGF (D, arrows).

Antibodies against HDGF (A, D) or HRP-3 (B, E) were used to detect both proteins in the neocortex and cerebellum of an adult mouse. Comparison of the double immunfluorescence demonstrates the lack of expression of HRP-3 in cells building the pia mater at the surface of the cortex (PM in C) and some cells in layer I (C, arrows), whereas cells in the rest of the cortex show a high degree of coexpression of HDGF and HRP-3. A lower degree of coexpression is found in the cerebellum, where HRP-3 family member is only expressed in Purkinje cells and Golgi cells of the IGL. Some of these HRP-3 positive cells do not (E+F, asterisks) and some do also express HDGF (D-F, arrowheads).

Antibodies against HDGF (A, C) or HRP-3 (D, F) were used to detect both proteins in the cerebellum of an adult mouse. To label the nuclei of all cells in the sections counterstaining with propidium iodide was performed (B,C and E,F). Double stained sections were used to calculate the percentage of cells positive for HDGF or HRP-3, respectively. Whereas HDGF is expressed in all cells, HRP-3 expression is much more restricted (for details see text). Cells labeled with arrows in D represent HRP-3 positive Purkinje cells. Asterisks in E mark most likely radial glia cells.
