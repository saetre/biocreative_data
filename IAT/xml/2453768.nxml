In human adult articular cartilage, FGF2 mediates anti-anabolic and potentially catabolic effects via the suppression of proteoglycan (PG) production along with the upregulation of matrix-degrading enzyme activity. The aim of the present study was to determine the biological effects of FGF2 in spine disc cells and to elucidate the complex biochemical pathways utilized by FGF2 in bovine intervertebral disc (IVD) cells in an attempt to further understand the pathophysiologic processes involved in disc degeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We studied the effect of FGF2 on IVD tissue homeostasis by assessing MMP-13 expression (potent matrix-degrading enzyme), PG accumulation, and PG synthesis in the bovine spine IVD, as well as evaluating whether FGF2 counteracts known anabolic factors such as BMP7.

Stimulation of bovine nucleus pulposus cells cultured in monolayer with FGF2 augmented the production of MMP-13 at the transcriptional and translational level in a dose-dependent manner. Stimulation of bovine nucleus pulposus cells cultured in alginate beads for 21 days with FGF2 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in PG accumulation, due at least in part to the inhibition of PG synthesis. Further studies demonstrate that FGF2 (10 ng/ml) antagonizes BMP7-mediated acceleration of PG production in bovine nucleus pulposus cells via the upregulation of noggin, an inhibitor of the transforming growth factor beta/bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway. Chemical inhibitor studies showed that FGF2 utilizes the mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways to upregulate noggin, serving as one potential mechanism for its anti-anabolic effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>FGF2 is anti-anabolic in bovine spine disc cells, revealing the potential of FGF2 antagonists as unique biologic treatments for both prevention and reversal of IVD degeneration.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Back pain is a common ailment among American adults, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 70% to 85% in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. While the etiology is largely unknown, the pathological degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) has been associated with chronic back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. At present, the current treatments for back pain are mainly symptomatic or involve surgical procedures that ablate the disc, but most strategies make no attempt to interfere with early biochemical and pathophysiologic processes involved in disc degeneration. Elucidation of the contributory metabolic pathways at play would therefore enable us to focus on more specific treatment regimens in the future.</p><p>Structurally, the IVD consists of tough outer rings, collectively termed the annulus fibrosus (AF), and a gelatinous inner core, the nucleus pulposus (NP). This unique structure has both shock-absorbing properties and the ability to resist deformation upon mechanical loading. The AF is composed mainly of collagen secreted by disc cells, while the NP is largely composed of proteoglycans (PGs), principally aggrecan. It has been suggested that the degenerative process begins in the NP and is associated with the progressive loss of PGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Disc cells residing in both the AF and NP actively regulate matrix homeostasis through activities modulated by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines and growth factors acting in a paracrine and/or autocrine fashion. The cells in the normal adult IVD maintain the matrix in which they reside at a steady state. Degeneration of the IVD may result from an imbalance between the anabolic and catabolic processes and loss of this steady-state metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. IVD damage caused by mechanical injury, inflammation, or aging may change the structure of the IVD, shifting IVD homeostasis and disc cell-mediated gene expression in favor of a procatabolic state. Evidence shows that matrix metalloproteases (for example, MMP-13 &#x02013; otherwise known as collagenase 3) and aggrecanases (ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5) &#x02013; enzymes strongly upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines &#x02013; may have critical pathogenic roles in the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation that characterizes the degeneration of the IVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In particular, MMP-13 has been shown to act as a PG-degrading enzyme in addition to assisting in collagen degradation, and thus may play a dual role in IVD degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Regenerative medicine is aimed at regulating the metabolism of IVD cells to achieve biological regeneration that will have more permanent therapeutic benefits than synthetic or metallic implants. Anabolic regulators of IVD homeostasis include polypeptide growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor 1, transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;) and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In particular, numerous reports have implied the anabolic effect mediated by BMP7 (otherwise known as osteogenic protein-1) on cartilage regeneration in both articular joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and spine discs <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Catabolic regulators of IVD homeostasis, on the other hand, include proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors such as IL-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] &#x02013; and potentially fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) (otherwise known as basic fibroblast growth factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] &#x02013; both of which have been implicated in the degeneration of the IVD. An upregulation of anabolic factors coupled with a downregulation of catabolic factors may potentially induce cartilage regeneration.</p><p>In cartilage, FGF2 is produced by chondrocytes, is stored in the ECM, and is immediately released from the ECM upon cartilage injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We recently reported significant upregulation of FGF2 and its cognate receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor type I (FGFR1), in arthritic articular cartilage compared with normal cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In human adult articular cartilage, FGF2 stimulates cartilage-degrading enzyme expression, inhibits PG accumulation and synthesis, and antagonizes the anabolic activity of insulin-like growth factor 1 and BMP7, suggesting that FGF2 plays a principal pathophysiological role in articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the IVD, Peng and colleagues demonstrated highly upregulated FGF2 and FGFR1 in painful degenerated human spine disc cells compared with normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further immunohistologic studies have demonstrated the presence of FGF2 in human herniated IVD tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and in injured AF tissue in adult merinos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. While these findings demonstrate the localization and/or expression of FGF2 in IVD tissue, however, the function and biological effects mediated by FGF2 in spine discs have yet to be assessed.</p><p>In the current study, we determined the role of FGF2 in the IVD using bovine disc cells. Specifically, we studied the effect of FGF2 on IVD homeostasis by assessing MMP-13 production, PG accumulation, and PG synthesis in the bovine spine, as well as evaluating whether FGF2 counteracts known anabolic factors such as BMP7. Our results may provide important new information on spine disc metabolism mediated by FGF2 relative to the understanding of IVD degeneration as one mechanism of low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus cell isolation and culture</title><p>Human lumbar IVDs were obtained from cadaveric donor spines (Gift of Hope) from June 2004 to June 2005.

Stimulation with FGF2 mediated a dose-dependent upregulation of MMP-13, a significant inhibitory effect on PG accumulation and synthesis, and the inability of BMP7 to stimulate PG production in the presence of FGF2. In addition, the chemical pathways utilized by FGF2 to antagonize the activity of BMP7 were analyzed to gain a better understanding of the complex interplay of growth factors, cytokines, and enzymes in the IVD. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the pathophysiologic effects of FGF2 in spine disc tissue.</p><p>Based on our DMMB results, treatment with FGF2 in alginate culture for 21 days dose-dependently decreased the accumulation of PG in NP cells. This reduction could be due to either increased PG degradation or decreased synthesis, or due to both. Examples of increased PG degradation include the FGF2-stimulated, MMP-13-mediated or ADAMTS4-mediated and ADAMTS5-mediated destruction of aggrecan. Accumulated evidence has indicated that in arthritic articular cartilage the overproduction of collagenases, in particular MMP-13, by chondrocytes plays a central role in collagen and aggrecan degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We found that FGF2, MMP-13, and ADAMTS5 were upregulated in human degenerative disc tissue compared with normal discs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and that FGF2 stimulated ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 expression, as well as a dose-dependent increase in MMP-13 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>), in bovine NP cells. FGF2 therefore plausibly enhances PG degradation in part through an upregulation of matrix-degrading enzymes.</p><p>Our sulfate incorporation results, however, suggest that the decrease in PG levels is at least in part due to decreased PG synthesis. We demonstrated an FGF2-mediated, dose-dependent suppression of PG synthesis as well as the inability of BMP7 to stimulate PG production in the presence of FGF2 in bovine disc cells. We therefore suggest that FGF2 exerts a dual effect on PG accumulation in spine discs via stimulation of PG degradation as well as inhibition of PG synthesis. Previous studies have demonstrated similar results in rabbit articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], in human OA cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and in adult human articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], but this is the first study to do so in spine tissue.</p><p>Outside the joint, FGF2 is known to stimulate angiogenesis and, among other functions, play a role in wound repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It has also been shown to be a potent mitogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and our results were consistent with this function. We found that FGF2 significantly stimulates proliferation of both NP and AF cells isolated from bovine tail IVD tissue (data not shown). Of note, we observed that FGF2 at concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/ml stimulates threefold and 16-fold induction of cell proliferation, respectively, compared with control (no FGF2 treatment) after 7 days. At a concentration of 100 ng/ml, we found &#x0003e;70-fold induction of NP cell proliferation after 21 days of incubation in alginate beads.</p><p>The mitogenic capabilities of FGF2 have sparked controversy over the exact role played by this growth factor in cartilage homeostasis. Previous studies have suggested that FGF2 acts as an anabolic mediator of cartilage homeostasis due to its mitogenic capacity, and several studies are currently using FGF2 in scaffolds for cartilage regeneration and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] For example, FGF2 has been associated with a stimulation of cell proliferation in adult bovine articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and in canine IVD cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Based on the results from this study as well as previous results from our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], however, we suggest that the mitogenic effect of FGF2 in both human articular chondrocytes and bovine IVD tissue may be a pathologic sign of degeneration rather than regeneration. While FGF2 has already been found to substantially increase cell proliferation in bovine spine discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], it failed to increase ECM synthesis in parallel in our study, resulting in clustering of cells with little surrounding ECM &#x02013; a hallmark of arthritic cartilage.</p><p>Further, we previously suggested that the increase in cell proliferation mediated by FGF2 in human articular cartilage may result from increased turnover of fibroblast-like cells rather than chondrocytes, resulting in fibrocartilage formation rather than the stronger, more durable hyaline cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We suggest the same principle in the IVD, as treatment of bovine NP cells with FGF2 stimulated an upregulation of collagen I compared with collagen II (data not shown), resulting in a decreased collagen II:I ratio and the formation of fibrocartilage compared with the collagen II-rich cartilage of a healthy IVD. Taken together, treatment of disc cells with FGF2 increases cell proliferation and decreases ECM production, resulting in clusters of disc cells in a fibrocartilage network similar to our findings from human articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Tsai and colleagues recently analyzed the effects of FGF2 on bovine NP cell growth and differentiation, and found that FGF2 stimulated increased sulfated PG synthesis, lowered aggrecan turnover, and lowered differentiation of the NP cell phenotype by maintaining responsiveness to TGF&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Our data, however, support the hypothesis that FGF2 serves primarily as an anti-anabolic factor rather than a pro-anabolic factor in cartilage homeostasis. Indeed, similar to results reported by Tsai and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], we have found that FGF2 does stimulate an overall increase in sulfated PG synthesis. After normalizing these findings to cell number, however, our [<sup>35</sup>S]-sulfate incorporation and DMMB results suggest that, per cell, PG synthesis and total PG accumulation decreased dose dependently after treatment with FGF2. In addition, Tsai and colleagues reported increased gene expression of both collagen I and collagen II; however, we suggest that the ratio between type I and type II collagen may be more important than overall levels to determine the homeostatic effect in IVD tissue, and we have found an FGF2-mediated upregulation of collagen I compared with collagen II (data not shown), leading to the formation of a weak fibrocartilaginous network.</p><p>The potent mitogenic effect of FGF2 in cartilage has previously been correlated with FGF receptor activation. In the growth plate, for example, FGFR1 and FGFR3 have significant yet opposite roles in cartilage homeostasis. Binding of FGF2 to FGFR1 increases proliferation of chondrocytes, whereas binding of FGF2 to FGFR3 inhibits proliferation and therefore promotes differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The upregulation of FGFR1 with minimal expression of FGFR3 in the bovine IVD could therefore potentially explain the potent mitogenic effects of FGF2 in the spine disc. Interestingly, Valverde-Franco and colleagues found that, in the absence of signaling from FGFR3, a compensatory increase in interaction is seen between FGF2 and FGFR1, resulting in degradative effects such as defective articular cartilage with increased MMP-13 expression and increased cleavage products from type II collagen and aggrecan in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>Our studies revealed an upregulation of FGFR1 in degenerative disc tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), as well as an FGF2-mediated increase of MMP-13 expression, but no FGF18-mediated effect on MMP-13 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). These results were similar to previous studies revealing that FGF18 acts primarily via FGFR3 in articular and growth plate cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. We therefore suggest that FGF2, but not FGF18, utilizes FGFR1 to stimulate both mitogenic and anti-anabolic events in bovine spine IVD tissue. Further studies linking pathogenic disc degeneration and FGF-ligand binding activity to specific FGFRs may provide important information for understanding the potential role of FGFR1 in IVD homeostasis and disc degeneration.</p><p>Other studies have suggested an important role of FGF2 in the spontaneous resorption process of degenerative or herniated IVD tissue via stimulation of angiogenesis and/or inflammatory cytokines that aid in cartilage destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Minamide and colleagues used a rabbit disc sequestration-type model to emulate IVD herniation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and found that epidural injection of FGF2 stimulates increased angiogenesis, increased speed of disc resorption, and increased the number of inflammatory cells compared with control (saline) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Based on these findings, we suggest multiple roles of FGF2 in disc homeostasis depending on the stage of degeneration. In normal or recently injured disc tissue, FGF2 may act as an anti-anabolic mediator, suppressing PG synthesis and stimulating MMP-13 expression. These same properties, however, may be beneficial after disc herniation, stimulating degradation of herniated tissue and encouraging spontaneous disc resorption. The expression and role of FGF2 in different stages of degeneration should be further analyzed in human disc tissue, as well as in degenerative or herniated disc tissue, to gain a better understanding of its pathophysiologic function at each stage.</p><p>Clinically, noggin may be a potential target for disc degeneration as it is a well-known inhibitor of the anabolic TGF&#x003b2;/bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and is upregulated by FGF2 in bovine disc tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Our pathway-specific inhibitor studies suggest that the ERK pathway is necessary for noggin stimulation by FGF2, while the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway (IKK) is involved in, but not necessary for, noggin stimulation leading to inhibition of BMP7 activity. These data suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) and NF-&#x003ba;B are involved in the anti-anabolic actions of FGF2, a factor that exerts its effects via multiple pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). These results may be advantageous as pathway-specific inhibitors continue to gain favor as potential treatment strategies. Unlike treatment with FGF2, the stimulation of cells with IL-1&#x003b2; showed no significant increase in noggin expression, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of FGF2 and IL-1&#x003b2; on BMP7 are perhaps through distinct signaling pathways and biological actions.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic of the regulation of catabolic and anti-anabolic actions of FGF2 in intervertebral disc cells</bold>.

Moreover, it retains its mitogenic capacity in spine tissues while decreasing ECM formation, leading to clustering of cells often seen in arthritic states. The pathways involved are multiple and complex, and further investigation should be pursued to help gain a better understanding of the signaling cascades governing the interactions between FGF2, MMP-13 and BMP7.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADAMTS = a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; AF = annulus fibrosus; BMP = bone morphogenetic protein; CM = cell-associated matrix; DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMMB = dimethylethylene blue; ECM = extracellular matrix; FGF2 = fibroblast growth factor 2; FGFR = fibroblast growth factor receptor; IL = interleukin; IVD = intervertebral disc; MMP = matrix metalloprotease; NF = nuclear factor; NP = nucleus pulposus; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PG = proteoglycan; RT = reverse transcriptase; TGF&#x003b2; = transforming growth factor beta.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>H-JI participated in the study design, analysis and interpretation of data, manuscript preparation, and statistical analysis.
