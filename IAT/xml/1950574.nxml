To control transcription, we selected human kidney epithelial cells (A498), which lack the RUNX1 transcription factor. RUNX1 dependent transcription was artificially induced, by co-transfecting the cells with an AML-1b expression vector and as a result, RUNX1 dependent transcription was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000825-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>). In this RUNX1 dependent assay, the luciferase activity from the mutant allele was reduced compared to the wild type allele, thus supporting the hypothesis that variant 1 reduces <italic>CXCR1</italic> transcription. Further evidence of RUNX1 involvement in <italic>CXCR1</italic> transcription was obtained by co-transfection of A498 cells with a <italic>CXCR1</italic> promoter reporter plasmid and vectors encoding RUNX1 and PU.1.

The mRNAs from the patient carrying variant 5 and the mother with the same mutation contained reduced levels of the CXCR1 large transcript compared to the control, thus confirming the predicted effect of variant 5, suggesting that this mutation might create a more efficient cleavage site and thus reduce the amount of large CXCR1 mRNA (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Vesico-ureteric reflux</title><p>Reflux is known to predispose to acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring.

Five <italic>CXCR1</italic> sequence variants were detected in carefully selected patients with APN. Three new 3&#x02032; mutations were unique to the patients and two known variants were more common in patients than in controls, supporting a disease association. Variant 1 reduced the efficiency of RUNX1 dependent transcription and another three variants were located to transcription factor binding sites. As expected, CXCR1 expression was markedly reduced in the APN prone children compared to controls. The results suggest that <italic>CXCR1</italic> variants may render individuals UTI-prone by lowering CXCR1 expression and by incapacitating the neutrophil-dependent host defense against UTI.</p><p>Innate immunity controls the resistance to UTI and neutrophils are needed for bacterial clearance from infected tissues. The chemokine receptor deficiency in mIL-8Rh knock out mice incapacitates neutrophils by delaying their migration into the kidneys and their exit from the tissues across the mucosal barrier. In addition, the receptor is needed for neutrophil activation and phagocytosis and killing of bacteria is impaired in knock out mice. As a result, bacteria persist in the kidneys, and the trapped neutrophils destroy the tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000825-Hang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000825-Frendeus2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000825-Svensson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, transfection experiments showed that transcription of the mutant allele is reduced, suggesting that variant 1 reduces <italic>CXCR1</italic> transcription.

A similar mutation was shown to create a more efficient mRNA cleavage site in the pro-thrombin gene where more efficient processing of the transcript leads to higher pro-thrombin levels and a higher risk of thrombosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000825-Gehring1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, there were several patients with low CXCR1 expression but without variation in the <italic>CXCR1</italic> gene. Thus, even if the frequency of patients with single base changes was high, there must be additional mechanisms, which control CXCR1 expression, and which may be polymorphic in this patient group.</p><p>Longitudinal clinical studies must be performed, to reliably identify those patients, who are susceptible to recurrent APN. Such protocols were used in the present study, in two separate geographic sites, resulting in two well-defined, APN-prone patient populations. We found an increased frequency of <italic>CXCR1</italic> sequence variants in both groups. The pediatric group had been followed from the first known febrile UTI episode by our clinical team and the adults were followed regularly from their first febrile UTI episode for a median of 30 years. The need for stringent clinical definitions is illustrated by a recent report, which failed to show a significant increase in variant 2 in patients with DMSA proven kidney infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000825-Artifoni1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

The stringent clinical follow up and large number of APN prone patients probably explains the high frequency of <italic>CXCR1</italic> variants and of reduced CXCR1 expression. On the other hand, the complicated clinical procedures illustrate the need for markers, which identify the risk patients already in connection with their first UTI episode. If this were possible, proper therapeutic interventions might be made and invasive diagnostic procedures restricted to patients at high risk, while those of lower risk might be spared. We are hopeful that the results of this study will be useful and that they might stimulate attempts to identify susceptible patients who might benefit from more intense diagnostic surveillance and therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000825.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>APN prone patients.
