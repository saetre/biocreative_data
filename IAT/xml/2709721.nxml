Group B streptococci (GBS) have been recognized as an ever-growing cause of serious invasive infections in nonpregnant adults. Septic arthritis is a clinical manifestation of GBS infection. To investigate the role of IL-4 in experimental GBS infection, IL-4 deficient or competent mice were inoculated with 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> GBS/mouse. Mortality, appearance of arthritis, GBS growth in the organs, and local and systemic cytokine and chemokine production were examined.

Introduction</title><p>Group B streptococci (GBS) have long been known as a leading cause of life-threatening infection in neonates, young infants, and pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently these microorganisms have been recognized as an ever-growing cause of serious invasive infections in nonpregnant adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. GBS is responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The most common entities include primary bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia. Other relevant conditions are endocarditis, intravascular device infections, meningitis, peritonitis, endoophthalmitis and osteoarticular infections. Bacterial arthritis is a rapidly progressive and highly destructive joint disease in humans with an incidence rate ranging from 0.034% to 0.13% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The typical case of this disease is characterized by high fever and a red, warm, and swollen joint, in 80% to 90% of cases displaying a monoarticular pattern. Patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiencies as well as those who have passed through prosthetic joint surgery display enhanced susceptibility to septic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Septic GBS arthritis in nonpregnant adults was considered extremely rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] until the early 1980s, when two independent studies stressed that its incidence seemed to be increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This trend has been confirmed by recent studies in which GBS account for 7% to 10% of all diagnosed cases of bacterial arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, GBS were typically associated with involvement of multiple joints in patients with diabetes mellitus or cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. </p><p>We have previously described an experimental mouse model of type IV GBS infection with clinical features that closely resemble infection in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Mice given a single intravenous dose of GBS develop clinical signs of arthritis within 48 hours. Appearance and severity of GBS arthritis are the by-product of a multifactorial process. Viability and number of microorganisms injected and bacterial factors (i.e., presence and amount of capsule, amount of sialic acid in the capsular polysaccharide, and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hemolysin production) have been shown to influence the development of articular lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, in the pathogenesis of GBS arthritis a crucial role is played by inflammatory cells (granulocytes and monocytes) that reach the joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and by the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and tumor necrosis factor-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. </p><p>Antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 are known to regulate inflammation. Many of the IL-4 regulatory effects are directed at modulating macrophage activity. IL-4 suppresses proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and IL-12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and chemokines (interferon-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-inducible protein 10 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The antiinflammatory activity of IL-4 was assessed in vivo in several models of arthritis. It has been demonstrated that systemic administration of IL-4 effectively suppresses disease in proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Treatment with IL-4 or local expression of IL-4 in CIA prevents cartilage and bone destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. </p><p>The aim of our study was to assess the role of IL-4 in our septic arthritis model, both regarding development of the arthritic process and host susceptibility to bacteria.

Control wt Balb/c mice were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Calco, Italy). Eight-to-ten week old mice were used for experimental procedures.

Microorganisms</title><p>Type IV GBS, ATCC reference strain GBS 3139 (CNCTC 1/82), supplied by J. Jelinkova (Prague, Czech Republic) was used throughout the study. For experimental infection, the microorganisms were grown overnight at 37&#x000b0;C in Todd-Hewitt broth (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) and then washed and diluted in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy). The inoculum size was estimated turbidimetrically, and viability counts were performed by plating on tryptic soy agar &#x02212;5% sheep blood agar (blood agar), and overnight incubation under anaerobic conditions at 37&#x000b0;C. A bacterial suspension was prepared in RPMI 1640 medium. Mice were inoculated intravenously via the tail vein with 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> GBS in a volume of 0.5 mL.

Clinical Evaluation of Arthritis and Mortality</title><p>GBS-infected mice were evaluated for signs of arthritis and for mortality. Mortality was recorded at 24-hour intervals for 30 days. After challenge, mice were examined daily by two independent observers (L. T., M.

Arthritis was defined as visible erythema and/or swelling of at least one joint. Clinical severity of arthritis was graded on a scale of 0&#x02013;3 for each paw, according to changes in erythema and swelling (0 = no change; 1 point = mild swelling and/or erythema; 2 points = moderate swelling and erythema; 3 points = marked swelling, erythema, and/or ankylosis). Thus, a mouse could have a maximum score of 12. The arthritis index (mean &#x000b1; SD) was constructed by dividing the total score (cumulative value of all paws) by the number of animals used in each experimental group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4.

Samples were examined under blinded conditions. Tibia-tarseal, tarsus-metatarseal, and metatarsus-phalangeal joints were examined, and a histologic score was assigned to each joint based on the extent of infiltrate (presence of inflammatory cells in the subcutaneous and/or periarticular tissues), exudate (presence of inflammatory cells in the articular cavity), cartilage damage, bone erosion, and loss of joint architecture. Arthritis severity was classified as negative (no infiltrate), mild (minimal infiltrate), moderate (presence of infiltrate, minimal exudate, and integrity of joint architecture), and severe (presence of massive infiltrate/exudate, cartilage and bone erosion, and disrupted joint architecture).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.5"><title>2.5.

Discussion</title><p>The murine model of GBS infection has proven to be beneficial in elucidating bacterial and host factors responsible for GBS arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our previous studies pointed out a major role for proinflammatory cytokines such as of IL-6, IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, IL-18, and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in the pathogenesis of GBS arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">36</xref>]. In this study, by using deficient mice, we found that the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-4 has a relevant influence on GBS-induced sepsis and septic arthritis. The first effect of IL-4 absence on the course of GBS infection is the decrease of mortality rates. This result is in line with a paper by Hultgren et al., who described a beneficial effect of IL-4 lack in an experimental murine model of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">37</xref>]. In this paper, the diminished mortality rates observed in IL-4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were associated to an increased systemic bacterial clearance, attributable to an enhanced intracellular killing capacity mediated by phagocytic cells. It has been demonstrated that IL-4 acts on phagocytes by suppression of oxidative bursts and intracellular killing of <italic>Leishmania </italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">38</xref>], and inhibits peritoneal and splenic macrophage killing of <italic>Candida albicans </italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">39</xref>]. Actually, in our experimental model a lower number of GBS were recovered both from blood and kidneys of IL-4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice compared to controls, thus suggesting that IL-4 exerts an inhibitory effect also on GBS killing by phagocytes. </p><p>Lack of IL-4 also results in a worsening of articular lesions. This was apparently in contrast with the lower bacterial load found in the joints of IL-4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice with respect to controls. However, it must be considered that severity of GBS arthritis is not exclusively linked to the amount of bacteria present in the joints, but is also dictated by other parameters, including proinflammatory cytokine production and the extent of inflammatory infiltrate/exudates in the articular tissues. The recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells at infection sites is a complex and dynamic process that involves the coordinated expression of both pro- and antiinflammatory mediators. Indeed, although an inflammatory response is essential to clear pathogens from the site of infection, a prolonged inflammatory response might lead to a detrimental outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">35</xref>]. In this respect, a beneficial effect of IL-4 has been demonstrated in many experimental model of arthritis. Administration of exogenous IL-4 resulted in suppression of CIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], while, in the same experimental model, administration of anti-IL4 monoclonal antibodies augmented both incidence and severity of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Daily treatment with IL-4 was reported to reduce all disease parameters in a streptococcal cell wall (SCW) rat arthritis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In the PGIA model, arthritis was prevented by IL-4 treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and exacerbated in IL-4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In these mice, the rapid induction of arthritis parallels in vivo increase of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion. It is well known that proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines play a critical role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. Resident synovial macrophages and fibroblasts as well as infiltrate cells produce proiflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-1, IL-6, IL-15, and IL-17 that drive disease pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. These cytokines initiate a cascade of events that induce cartilage-degrading enzymes, such as metalloproteases, and that stimulate osteoclastogenesis and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Recruitment of cells to the synovial tissues involves chemokines, such as MIP-1<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> responsible for recruitment of mononuclear cells and MIP-2 that acts on neutrophils. All these inflammatory cells contribute to articular damage by cytokine and proteolytic enzyme production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In our model, despite the lower number of GBS in the joints of IL-4&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, all the other parameters leading to an exacerbation of articular lesions are manifested. In fact, worsening of joint disease was associated with a marked increase of local proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) responsible for articular damage, together with sustained levels of monokines and a consequent enhanced inflammatory cell influx.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose that IL-4 plays a dual role in the immune response to GBS infection. By one side, by inhibiting the intracellular killing of phagocytes, IL-4 may cause a more severe systemic infection and, consequently, higher mortality rates. By the other side, by downregulating local levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, it appears to positively influence the progression of GBS arthritis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Stefano Temperoni and Alessandro Braganti for their excellent technical assistance in histological processing and animal care.
