The OKR requires no training, assesses the function of diverse CNS circuits, can be induced repeatedly with minimal fatigue or adaptation, and produces an electronic record that is readily and objectively quantifiable.</p><p>We describe a new type of OKR test apparatus in which computer-controlled visual stimuli and streamlined data analysis facilitate a relatively high throughput behavioral assay. We used this apparatus, in conjunction with infrared imaging, to quantify basic OKR stimulus-response characteristics for C57BL/6J and 129/SvEv mouse strains and for genetically engineered lines lacking one or more photoreceptor systems or with an alteration in cone spectral sensitivity. A second generation (F2) cross shows that the characteristic difference in OKR frequency between C57BL/6J and 129/SvEv is inherited as a polygenic trait. Finally, we demonstrate the sensitivity and high temporal resolution of the OKR for quantitative analysis of CNS drug action.</p><p>These experiments show that the mouse OKR is well suited for neurologic testing in the context of drug discovery and large-scale phenotyping programs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rapid growth in the number and variety of behavioral studies of mice&#x02013;in the contexts of forward genetic screens, targeted mutagenesis, or preclinical drug testing-has put a premium on developing methods for quantifying nervous system function in this species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Picciotto1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Crabbe1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

The OKR is induced when the entire visual scene drifts across the retina, eliciting eye rotation in the same direction and at a velocity that minimizes the motion of the image on the retina. Steady eye rotation in the direction of stimulus motion is periodically interrupted by rapid rotations in the opposite direction (the quick phases or saccades), which reset the position of the eye for a new period of steady rotation. The VOR is an analogous response to head movement, with input coming from the vestibular system rather than the retina. Normally, the OKR and VOR work together to ensure image stabilization on the retina over a wide range of head and body motions.</p><p>Both the OKR and the VOR are largely controlled by subcortical circuits: the OKR is controlled by neurons in the retina, diencephalon and midbrain (the accessory optic system), pons, and dorsal medulla, and the VOR is controlled by neurons in the labyrinth of the inner ear, midbrain, pons, dorsal medulla, and cerebellum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Leigh1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Simpson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In foveate animals, such as primates, eye movements that bring the object of regard onto the fovea add an additional layer of complexity and are controlled largely by the cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Leigh1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In considering the neurologic assessment of mice, it would be useful to work with a stimulus-response paradigm that (1) is simple and rapid, (2) can be induced repeatedly with minimal fatigue or adaptation, (3) requires no training, (4) assesses the function of diverse CNS circuits, and (5) produces an electronic record that is readily and objectively quantifiable. For larger mammals, including humans, it has long been appreciated that these criteria are met by the OKR and the VOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Leigh1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Dodge1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Alpern1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

To deliver an OKR stimulus that encompasses so large a visual field, the most common approach is to place the animal in the center of a vertical cylinder that is painted on its inner surface with vertical black and white stripes. The cylinder rotates around its axis and the OKR is monitored either by (1) tracking the orientation of a scleral search coil (a magnetic ring that is fixed to the outer surface of the eye)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-vanAlphen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Stahl3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>; or (2) using an infrared video camera to view, through a transparent circumferential slit in the cylinder, the position of the pupil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Mangini1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Sakatani1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Stahl3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. One variation on the rotating cylinder method uses a non-rotating cylinder illuminated from above by light that passes through numerous small holes in a slowly rotating screen; the resulting pattern of light and shadow rotates around the inner face of the cylinder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Hess1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Another approach to creating a rotating stimulus uses a square stimulus chamber, the walls of which consist of four computer screens that display continuously moving vertical black and white stripes; this design has been used in the context of the head tracking optomotor response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Douglas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The OKR stimulus methods based on physical rotation of a cylinder or screen have the virtue that image motion is uniform and continuous, but they lack the flexibility associated with electronic stimulus presentation. By contrast, the use of multiple computer screens to form the walls of a stimulus chamber achieves the flexibility associated with electronic stimulus presentation but it imposes nonmoving borders at the interface between adjacent computer screens and it requires that visual stimuli be in the form of a movie, with an attendant increase in programming complexity. To combine the most favorable attributes of these two approaches, we designed and built an OKR apparatus in which a projector and laptop computer are mounted on a motorized rotating stage suspended 2 meters above the floor, with the optical axis of the projector coincident with both the axis of rotation of the stage and the axis of a white cylindrical test chamber at floor level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002055-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A radially symmetric image on the computer screen (e.g. alternating black and white pie wedges) appears as a series of vertical lines when projected onto the cylindrical wall of the test chamber. The intensity of the image is varied either computationally or by inserting neutral density filters in front of the projector. A small window in the wall of the test chamber permits an infrared light source and video camera to image the eye of an awake and head posted mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002055-g001">Figure 1B&#x02013;D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002055-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002055.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>OKR apparatus and testing arrangement.</title><p>(A) The mouse is held in a horizontal acrylic cylinder within a large cylindrical drum. A small transparent zone in the wall of the drum allows an infrared (IR) light source and camera (bottom, in foreground) to monitor eye movements. The stimulus is controlled by a laptop computer and a projector, both of which sit approximately two meters above the drum on a rotating table that is controlled by a variable speed motor (not shown). Neutral density or chromatic filters can be placed in the light path (rectangle, at right). (B) A headposted mouse with two plastic nuts set along the anterior posterior axis.

(D) IR image of a mouse eye showing the pupil (large upper right white circle with centered cross) and the corneal reflection (lower left white circle with centered cross). The ISCAN software has assigned the IR sink as the pupil and the IR peak as the corneal reflection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002055.g001"/></fig><p>Commercial software (ISCAN) was used to monitor the positions of (1) the pupil, the principal sink for both visible and infrared radiation, and (2) the point of reflection of incident infrared radiation at the surface of the cornea. For relatively small eye movements, the distance between the center of the pupil and the corneal reflection is roughly proportional to a frontal projection of the angular deflection of the eye. An empirical approach to determining this proportionality can be found in Sakatani and Isa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Sakatani1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This proportionality would be constant (and easily calculated) if (1) the eye was a perfect sphere that rotated about its center and (2) the pupil was located at the surface of the sphere. As discussed by Stahl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Stahl3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, neither of these conditions apply, but in practice the proportionality is still reasonably constant over different angles of deflection because the two principal deviations from the ideal case&#x02013;namely, (1) the rotation of the eye around a point behind the center of the globe, and (2) the position of the pupil behind the corneal surface&#x02013;produce largely compensating errors. In the interests of simplifying the OKR analysis, we show here only the horizontal distance between the pupil and the corneal reflection, referred to hereafter as &#x0201c;eye position&#x0201d;, without calculating the angle of eye rotation per se.</p><p>The OKR offers only a few parameters for quantitative evaluation, including the number of eye tracking movements (ETMs) per unit time and the gain (the angular velocity of the eye relative to the angular velocity of the stimulus). Here we define an ETM as one slow tracking movement followed by one saccade, and we quantify the ETMs by counting the number of saccades. In animals that lack a fovea, such as mice, the gain is typically less than unity, with the result that the image is not fully stabilized on the retina. We have focused on the number of ETMs per unit time because this parameter is relatively insensitive to changes in the shape of the slow component of the OKR, and it is easily quantified by automated procedures based on the first derivative of eye position with respect to time or with a neural network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002055-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and data not shown); it is also easily quantified by visual inspection. We note that the highly uniform time course and amplitude of the OKR in 129/SvEv mice is more readily scored than the somewhat variable OKR in C57BL/6J mice (see below for a comparison between these two strains; see also ref. 36 for an analysis of spontaneous eye movements in C57BL/6J mice). Artifacts due to eye blinks or to spontaneous eye movements not related to the OKR can generally be recognized by the presence of rapid movement in the &#x0201c;wrong&#x0201d; direction, i.e. the same direction as the rotating stimulus. A simple algorithm eliminates many of these artifacts by discounting all supra-threshold first derivative excursions in the &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; direction that occur within 470 msecs of a supra-threshold excursion in the &#x0201c;wrong&#x0201d; direction.</p><fig id="pone-0002055-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002055.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Stimulus, response, and data analysis during an OKR recording session with a wildtype mouse.</title><p>(A) From top to bottom, the following features are shown.

N, nasal; T, temporal. The first derivative of eye position is shown above a pair of traces that indicate the times at which the first derivative exhibits an excursion below or above negative or positive thresholds, respectively. At the bottom are the assignments of discrete eye-tracking movements (ETMs) during the 30 second stimulus interval scored by inspection of eye position and its first derivative; the rightmost suprathreshold negative excursion on the first derivative plot is not counted as an ETM because it occurred outside of the 30 second stimulus interval.

The M pigment is encoded on the X-chromosome.

In the present experiment, we have compared the strength of the OKR among mice expressing (in addition to the S-pigment): (1) only the mouse M pigment, (2) only the human L pigment, or (3) both M and L pigments. For the third class of mice, X-inactivation in heterozygous females creates a fine-grained mosaic of M and L cones across the retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Smallwood1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. To insure that the OKR reflects only cone function, these experiments were performed on a rod transducin alpha knockout genetic background (<italic>Gnat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>). A further simplification arises from the relative insensitivity of the UV-sensitive S pigment to the visible wavelengths that dominate the output of the projector. Therefore, under these experimental conditions, the OKR should be driven almost exclusively by the output of M and/or L cones.</p><p>For the chromatic OKR experiment, a pattern of alternating colored and grey stripes is presented. The intensity, hue, and saturation of the colored stripe are held constant, while the lightness of the grey stripe is varied in 10&#x00025; increments from white to black. For a mouse expressing only M pigment, the number of photons captured per unit time from the grey stripe equals, at some point along a continuum of grey intensities, the number captured from the colored stripe. At that point, the OKR is extinguished, and, therefore, this grey intensity represents the null point for the response. A similar argument applies to mice expressing only the L pigment. This experimental design closely resembles an optokinetic test developed by Teller and Palmer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002055-Teller1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> to assess red/green color vision in human infants.</p><p>In classical color vision psychophysics, gratings and filters permit the production of chromatic stimuli with wavelength compositions that are narrow and adjustable. By contrast, the three channels of the projector provide stimuli with spectral compositions that are fixed and relatively broad.

These experiments show that, despite its seeming simplicity, the OKR provides a rich record of CNS activity.</p><p>As demonstrated by our analysis of the polygenic inheritance of OKR differences between strains, OKR testing can be used to analyze dozens to hundreds of mice, generating data sets with many thousands of ETMs. Furthermore, the ketamine experiment demonstrates the high sensitivity and temporal resolution of the OKR in monitoring drug effects on CNS function. These examples suggest that the murine OKR could be usefully applied to a wide variety of investigations. For example, the OKR could be used to quantify drug-induced sedation or arousal, or to monitor the progression or the therapeutic response of neurodegenerative disease. The OKR is also well suited for quantifying the functional response to stem cell, pharmacologic, or genetic approaches aimed at restoring vision in the context of retinal degenerative diseases. In summary, the OKR can help meet the growing demand for functional neurologic testing as drug discovery programs generate a growing pipeline of preclinical drug candidates and as targeted and random mutagenesis technologies generate increasing numbers of mice with CNS defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal Surgery</title><p>Mice were handled and housed in accordance with the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Protocols and IACUC guidelines. For headpost surgery, instruments were autoclaved, a sterile environment was prepared, and mice were anesthesized using a ketamine/xylazine mixture. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes during surgery to prevent corneal drying and lens opacification, a side-effect of ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Once the mouse was areflexive to paw pinch, povidone-iodine ointment was used to sterilize the top of the head, and an incision was made to expose the cranium. 0.5 ml of 3&#x00025; hydrogen peroxide was applied to the skull to remove soft tissue covering the bone. Four holes were drilled into the skull, and four 0.93 mm diameter metal screws (Plastics One; Roanoke, VA; Part Number: #8L010121202F) were inserted to provide support. Dental cement (a 1:1 mixture of methyl methacrylate and diethyl phthalate; Lang Dental; Wheeling,IL, Part Number: 60090) was mixed and added drop-wise to the top of the skull to cover the metal screws. Two 1/8 inch nylon screws and hex nuts (width across flats: 0.180 inch; thickness: 0.070 inch; thread size: 2&#x02013;56; Small Parts Inc; Miami Lakes, FL, Part Numbers: MN-0256-04B and HNN-0256-M) were inserted into the solidifying dental cement along the midline such that each nut and the distal half of each screw was embedded in the resin while the head of the screw protruded upward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002055-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Following the &#x0223c;15 minute surgery, the mice were placed on a 37&#x000b0;&#x02013;42&#x000b0;C heating pad. For sequential surgeries, instruments were sterilized between mice by immersion in Cidex (Advanced Sterilization Products; Miami, FL; Part Number: 2245). The mice typically awoke 30&#x02013;60 minutes after surgery and were monitored for feeding, grooming, and gait. Buprenorephine (0.5mg/kg) was delivered as needed for pain or discomfort. OKRs were recorded &#x0003e;48 hours after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>OKR apparatus</title><p>Stimuli were projected vertically into a clear plastic drum (29.5 cm diameter&#x000d7;61 cm height) lined with white reflective poster paper using a Mitsubishi SL2U projector mounted on a rotating aluminum stage 91 cm above the top of the drum. A headposted mouse centered within the cylinder and 20 cm below the upper edge of the cylinder sees the rotating stimulus throughout the visual field except for a vertically centered cone subtending &#x0223c;35 degrees. An electric motor (Dayton; Niles, IL; Part Number: 4Z525A) controlled by a DC Speed Control (Dayton) rotated the stage. A rotating electrical adaptor (Moog; Blacksburg, Virginia) supplied power to the projector. To deliver scotopic stimuli, neutral density filters (ThorLabs; Newton, NJ) were placed in the light path using a holder fixed to the bottom of the rotating aluminum stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Visual stimuli</title><p>Visual stimuli were designed in Adobe Photoshop and displayed using Microsoft PowerPoint. To create vertical stripes on the walls of the test cylinder, we projected a circularly symmetric series of alternating black and white sectors (i.e. pie wedges) centered on the axis of the cylinder. Unless otherwise stated, OKR stimuli were presented as alternating 30-second intervals of moving black and white stripes and of a uniform grey. The geometry of the apparatus dictates that the projected image exhibits a progressive change in focus and a diminution in intensity from the top to the bottom of the cylinder. As both of these variations are barely noticeable to a human observer, we have not attempted to correct them. The uniform grey illuminant used during the rest periods was set to an intensity that delivered the same number of photons as the average of the black and white striped OKR stimuli. As expected, the pupil neither constricts nor dilates during the transitions between rest and stimulus intervals. For monocular stimulation, an opaque panel was placed over one-half of the test cylinder.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>OKR measurements and data analysis</title><p>For genotypes that eliminate pupil constriction (<italic>Cng&#x003b1;3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>; <italic>Gnat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>; <italic>Opn4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Cng&#x003b1;3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>; <italic>Gnat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>; <italic>Opn4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>), 5&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;l of 3&#x00025; pilocarpine hydrochloride or 3&#x00025; carbamoylcholine chloride was applied to the eye to induce constriction. Pupil constriction improves the accuracy of the calculation that identifies the center of the pupil. In mice with other genotypes, the intrinsic pupil constriction with photopic stimuli was sufficient for accurate measurements of pupil position. With scotopic stimuli, all mice were treated with a constricting agent.</p><p>To collect OKR data, the eye was imaged through a small hole cut in the poster paper using infrared illumination and an ISCAN (Burlington, MA) infrared video camera. ISCAN software locates the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the calculated centers of the corneal reflection and the pupil, and creates a time series (sampled at 60 Hz) of the difference between these two points along the horizontal and vertical axes. The data were stored as a Microsoft Excel file, and prior to data analysis the eye position data file was edited by discarding excursions &#x0003e;1.15 mm from the mean eye position. Larger excursions arise from errors in the automated assignment of pupil location. Time derivatives and thresholding operations were performed in Excel. ETM assignments were made by visual inspection, by thresholding the first derivative of eye position, or by NeuralWorks Predict Version 3.13 (NeuralWare, Carnegie PA).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Ketamine experiments</title><p>For each mouse, the OKR was recorded before and &#x0003e;24 hours after drug exposure using the standard 30 seconds on/30 seconds off OKR stimulus paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002055-g002">Figure 2</xref>) with alternating clockwise and counterclockwise rotation. To initiate an experiment, 75 mg/kg ketamine was administered by IP injection, and the mouse was immediately transferred to the recording chamber to begin measuring the OKR. A strong optokinetic stimulus (4&#x000b0; wide black and white stripes rotating at 5&#x000b0;/second) was continuously displayed during the 15&#x02013;20 minute recording session. The OKR records were subsequently divided into 30 second intervals, and the following parameters were calculated for each 30 second interval: (1) the number of ETMs, as determined by automated thresholding of the first derivative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002055-g002">Figure 2</xref>), and (2) the distribution and standard deviation of eye position (1800 data points per interval).</p><p>The eye position data file was subject to a local smoothing procedure with the following formula &#x0005b;where x<sub>n</sub> is the n<sup>th</sup> eye position measurement (sampled at 60 Hz) and &#x003c4; is set to 0.8&#x0005d;:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002055.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>To calculate the standard deviation of eye position in 30 second intervals, the eye position at each time point was further modified by subtracting from it the average eye position over a three second moving window centered on that time point, an operation that largely compensates for any slow background drift in eye orientation. To evaluate drug-induced changes in the slow component of the OKR, individual ETMs were aligned and averaged beginning with the first time point after the end of the fast component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002055-g008">Figure 8D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002055.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Spectral composition and relative intensities of OKR stimuli used for chromatic vs. gray scale experiments.
