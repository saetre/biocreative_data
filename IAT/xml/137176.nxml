In the present study, we have examined the repair capacity of DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for Xan and Oxa. The nicking assay with the defined substrates containing Xan and Oxa revealed that AlkA &#x0005b;in combination with endonuclease (Endo) IV&#x0005d; and Endo VIII recognized Xan in the tested enzymes.

The DNA bases bearing an exocyclic amino group &#x0005b;adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C)&#x0005d; undergo deamination. The rate of hydrolytic deamination is the highest for C under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c1">1</xref>), and it is estimated that approximately 100 C residues are deaminated per human cell per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c2">2</xref>). If unrepaired the resulting uracil (U) induces CG&#x02192;TA transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c3">3</xref>). Deamination of A gives rise to hypoxanthine (Hx), which pairs with C and induces AT&#x02192;GC transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c4">4</xref>). Since U and Hx are mutagenic, organisms are equipped with repair mechanisms for these lesions. Uracil in DNA is removed by uracil-DNA glycosylase, which is highly conserved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c5">5</xref>). Hypoxanthine is generally excised from DNA by a family of methyl purine DNA glycosylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c6">6</xref>) and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has an extra enzyme for Hx, namely endonuclease (Endo) V, which incises the second phosphodiester bond on the 3&#x02032; side of Hx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c7">7</xref>).</p><p>Guanine undergoes spontaneous hydrolytic deamination to yield xanthine (Xan), but the spontaneous deamination rate of G is lower than that of C and A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c8">8</xref>). Therefore, so far as spontaneous deamination is concerned, deamination of G is biologically less important than that of C or A. However, nitrogen oxides such as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous acid (HNO<sub>2</sub>) induce deamination of DNA bases with significant rates. In contrast to spontaneous hydrolytic deamination, G is the most sensitive of the three bases to nitric oxide and nitrous acid. NO has been characterized primarily as a second messenger exerting various physiological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c9">9</xref>). In humans, 1 mmol of NO is constitutively generated per body per day and the amount increases by 10&#x02013;100 times upon bacterial infection or inflammation. NO overproduced by activated macrophages in chronically inflamed tissues has been implicated as carcinogenic by virtue of its ability to cause DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c11">11</xref>). Nitrous anhydride (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), formed by autoxidation of NO, is a powerful nitrosating agent, and induces deamination of C, A and G in nucleosides and DNA, generating U, Hx and Xan, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c12">12</xref>). Nitrous acid that is formed by protonation of sodium nitrite (NaNO<sub>2</sub>), present in food intake, also induces base deamination via N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Although nitrosation of C and A leads exclusively to U and Hx, respectively, that of G gives rise to not only Xan but also oxanine (Oxa) with a molar ratio of 3 (Xan):1 (Oxa) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c13">13</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that Xan and Oxa are formed by nitroso group transfer to G from <italic>N</italic>-nitrosoindoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c14">14</xref>). Xan and Oxa are produced via the common precursor (a diazoate derivative of the 2-amino group of G), but formation of Oxa involves deamination of the 2-amino group followed by rearrangement of the ring atoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c15">15</xref>). The biochemical and genotoxic effects of Xan and Oxa have been assessed previously by several studies. Substitution of Xan or Oxa for G in duplex DNA results in large decreases in the helix stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c16">16</xref>). Xan in template DNA directs incorporation of T as well as C during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c18">18</xref>). Similarly, 2&#x02032;-deoxyribonucleoside 5&#x02032;-triphosphates of Xan (dXTP) and Oxa (dOTP) are incorporated opposite template T as well as C by DNA polymerase, though their incorporation efficiencies are much lower than dGTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c19">19</xref>). In addition, Xan but not Oxa can be spontaneously converted to a cytotoxic and mutagenic AP (apurinic&#x0002f;apyrimidinic) site due to its labile <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c16">16</xref>). Thus, Xan may show additional biological effects after conversion to an AP site. Recently, Oxa has been shown to form a covalently bound adduct with glycine, suggesting a novel cytotoxic&#x0002f;genotoxic mechanism for this lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c20">20</xref>). These data combined together indicate the necessity of repair capacities for Xan and Oxa in cells. However, studies on the enzymatic repair of these lesions are extremely limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c21">21</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we have examined the repair capacity of <italic>E.coli</italic> base excision repair enzymes for Xan and Oxa using defined oligonucleotide substrates containing these lesions. We report here that, among the enzymes tested, AlkA and Endo VIII exhibit repair activities for Xan and Oxa in a paired base-dependent manner and the repair efficiency for Oxa is much lower than for Xan. Induction of the <italic>alkA</italic> gene encoding AlkA protein in <italic>E.coli</italic> cells results in an increased releasing activity of Xan. Furthermore, <italic>E.coli</italic> deficient in both AlkA and Endo VIII, but not either of them alone, exhibits increased sensitivity to nitrous acid.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, enzymes and chemicals</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MV1161 (<italic>thr1</italic>, <italic>ara14</italic>, <italic>leuB6</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>(gpt-proA)62</italic>, <italic>lacY1</italic>, <italic>tsx33</italic>, <italic>supE44</italic>, <italic>galK2</italic>, <italic>hisG4</italic>, <italic>rfbD1</italic>, <italic>mgl51</italic>, <italic>rpsL31</italic>, <italic>kdgK51</italic>, <italic>xyl5</italic>, <italic>mtl1</italic>, <italic>argE3</italic>, <italic>thi1</italic>, <italic>rfa550</italic>) and MV1571 &#x0005b;<italic>alkA51</italic>::<italic>Mud1</italic> (<italic>Amp</italic><sup><italic>R</italic></sup><italic>lac</italic>) in MV1161&#x0005d; were laboratory stocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c22">22</xref>).

PRIM15 (50 pmol) and COM25C (100 pmol, 2-fold molar excess) in 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5) and 25 mM NaCl were heated at 90&#x000b0;C for 10 min and then annealed at room temperature. PRIM15&#x0002f;COM25C (25 pmol) in the polymerase buffer (200 &#x000b5;l) were incubated with dXTP or dOTP (both 20 nmol) and Pol I Kf (25 U) at 25&#x000b0;C for 5 min to introduce a single residue of Xan or Oxa opposite C (16th position from the 3&#x02032; terminus in COM25C). The polymerase buffer consisted of 66 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.0), 1.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 6.6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Then dCTP and dTTP (10 nmol each) were added to the reaction mixture to extend the primer fully. The oligonucleotides containing Xan and Oxa were designated 25XAN and 25OXA, respectively. The duplexes (25XAN&#x0002f;COM25C and 25OXA&#x0002f;COM25C) were purified by phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation and gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (1 ml). The site-specific introduction of Xan and Oxa into 25XAN and 25OXA, respectively, was confirmed by the heat&#x0002f;acid and ammonia&#x0002f;piperidine treatments (see Results). For preparation of oligonucleotide substrates containing Xan:N and Oxa:N pairs (N &#x0003d; A, G, C, T), the DNA polymerase reaction was performed in a similar manner except that COM30C was used as a template in place of COM25C. This facilitated the subsequent electrophoretic separation of 25XAN and 25OXA from the template (COM30C). After the reaction, 25XAN and 25OXA were purified by 16&#x00025; denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), extracted from the gel and desalted by a Sep-pak cartridge. Purified 25XAN and 25OXA were annealed with COM25N (N &#x0003d; A, G, C, T). 25XAN containing &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;Xan was prepared as described above using PRIM15&#x0002f;COM25C, &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;dXTP and Pol I Kf for the initial polymerization reaction. 25G containing &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;G in place of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;Xan was also prepared using &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;dGTP.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemical cleavage reactions of oligonucleotides</title><p>25XAN, 25OXA and 25G (all <sup>32</sup>P-labeled at the 5&#x02032; end, 100 fmol) were heated at 90&#x000b0;C for 30 min under acidic conditions (pH 3.5, adjusted by acetic acid) and the solution was evaporated to dryness.

These cultures were diluted into 100 ml of LB media with or without antibiotics and cells were grown to a logarithmic phase (OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0003d; 0.6) at 37&#x000b0;C. After washing in acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.6), cells were incubated in NaNO<sub>2</sub> (0&#x02013;30 mM) in 5 ml of acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.6) at 37&#x000b0;C for 10 min.

After washing in minimal A medium twice, the cell suspension was appropriately diluted and incubated overnight on LB plates at 37&#x000b0;C. The colonies were scored for surviving fractions. It is noted that the viability of all the test strains decreased to &#x0223c;10&#x00025; after incubation with acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.6) alone. Thus, variations in viability depending on the strain were virtually negligible in the incubation with acetate buffer alone.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Site-specific introduction of Xan and Oxa into oligonucleotides</title><p>Xan and Oxa were site-specifically incorporated into the oligonucleotide substrates (25XAN and 25OXA, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf630tb1">1</xref>) by the DNA polymerase reaction using dXTP and dOTP as substrates. The <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond of Xan is fairly labile so that heat&#x0002f;acid treatment causes depurination, generating an AP site. On the other hand, the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond of Oxa is as stable as that of G to the heat&#x0002f;acid treatment. However, Oxa contains an <italic>O</italic>-acylisourea structure in the six-membered ring (1,3-oxazine ring) that undergoes a ring-opening reaction at alkaline pH (p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> &#x0003d; 9.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c16">16</xref>). An extensive treatment of the ring-opened structure of Oxa induces decomposition of the Oxa ring, though the final decomposition product has not been identified yet. Knowing the chemistry of Xan and Oxa, 25XAN and 25OXA prepared by the DNA polymerase reaction were treated by heat&#x0002f;acid or ammonia&#x0002f;piperidine as described in Materials and Methods. PAGE analysis of the treated oligonucleotides showed that 25XAN was specifically cleaved by the heat&#x0002f;acid treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f2">2</xref>, lane 9) but not the ammonia&#x0002f;piperidine treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f2">2</xref>, lane 10). According to the gel mobility of the products, the cleaved products were 15mers with different 3&#x02032; terminal modifications resulting from breakdown of an AP site (a mixture of &#x003b2;-elimination, &#x003b4;-elimination and 3&#x02032;-OH products). Conversely, 25OXA was stable in the heat&#x0002f;acid treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f2">2</xref>, lane 6) but was specifically cleaved by the ammonia&#x0002f;piperidine treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f2">2</xref>, lane 7). The products were 15mers bearing 3&#x02032;-phosphate (&#x003b4;-elimination product) and 3&#x02032;-OH groups. 25G was virtually intact in both treatments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f2">2</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that Xan and Oxa were site-specifically introduced into 25XAN and 25OXA, respectively, by the DNA polymerase reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Repair activities of AlkA and Endo VIII for Xan and Oxa</title><p>The repair activities of various <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA repair enzymes for Xan and Oxa were examined using the nicking assay with 25XAN&#x0002f;COM25C and 25OXA&#x0002f;COM25C as substrates. The enzymes tested included three bifunctional glycosylases containing <italic>N</italic>-glycosylase&#x0002f;AP lyase activities (Fpg, Endo III and Endo VIII), two monofunctional <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases (AlkA and Ung) and two AP endonucleases (Endo IV and Exo III). Among the enzymes tested, AlkA and Endo VIII recognized Xan. The results of PAGE analysis of the reaction products of AlkA and Endo VIII are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f3">3</xref>. The treatment of 25XAN by AlkA (followed by Endo IV) resulted in a clear band of a 3&#x02032;-OH product arising from cleavage at the introduced Xan site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f3">3</xref>A, lane 7). Similarly, the treatment with Endo VIII resulted in a &#x003b4;-elimination product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f3">3</xref>B, lane 7). The observed incision products were consistent with the known catalytic modes of AlkA (&#x0002b; Endo IV) and Endo VIII. Although incision products of 25OXA by AlkA (&#x0002b; Endo IV) and Endo VIII were barely detected with the same amount (600 fmol) of the enzymes as used for 25XAN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f3">3</xref>A and B, lane 5), treatment with an excessive amount of AlkA and Endo VIII (both 3 pmol) revealed their activity for Oxa (see Paired base effects on the repair activity for Xan and Oxa).</p><p>Since Xan appeared to be a fair substrate of AlkA and Endo VIII, their kinetic parameters for Xan were determined from Michaelis&#x02013;Menten plots and the results were compared with those for 7mG (AlkA) and Tg (Endo VIII). The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values of AlkA for 7mG and Xan were 31 and 53 nM, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf630tb2">2</xref>). The <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> values were 2.1 and 0.72 nM&#x0002f;min for 7mG and Xan, respectively. These results indicated that AlkA had almost comparable affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) for 7mG and Xan, but the catalytic rate for Xan was somewhat lower than for 7mG. The difference in the reaction efficiencies (<italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) between 7mG and Xan was only 5-fold. Considering that 7mG is a physiological substrate of AlkA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c30">30</xref>) and the relatively small difference in the reaction efficiencies, Xan is a fairly good substrate for AlkA. In contrast, Endo VIII showed a significantly lower reaction efficiency for Xan than for Tg, a physiological substrate of Endo VIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c33">33</xref>). The difference in the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values was &#x0223c;50-fold. In terms of affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>), Xan and Tg differed by 2.6-fold (124 versus 47 nM) and of catalytic rate (<italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>) by 19-fold (0.94 versus 18 nM&#x0002f;min). Thus, Xan is a relatively poor substrate among those recognized by Endo VIII.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>N</italic>-glycosylase activity of AlkA and Endo VIII for Xan</title><p>To confirm the activity of AlkA and Endo VIII for Xan further, the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylase activity of both enzymes was examined by the release assay using 25XAN&#x0002f;COM25C containing &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;Xan. After enzymatic treatment, the released product was separated from the substrate by gel filtration. Analysis of the radioactivity of the fraction from the gel filtration column showed that there was significant release of the tritium count when 25XAN&#x0002f;COM25C was incubated with AlkA and Endo VIII. However, the released tritium count was negligible when control 25G&#x0002f;COM25C containing &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;G instead of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;Xan was incubated with AlkA and Endo VIII. This was also the case when 25XAN&#x0002f;COM25C was incubated with the reaction buffer alone. The pooled gel filtration fractions containing the released product were further analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. In the HPLC analysis of the product released by AlkA and Endo VIII, the major peak of the tritium count was eluted at 10.4 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f4">4</xref>B and C) where authentic Xan (unlabeled) was eluted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f4">4</xref>A). Authentic G was eluted at 8.7 min under these conditions. Accordingly, AlkA and Endo VIII acted as <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases for 25XAN&#x0002f;COM25C, releasing a free base of Xan from the substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Repair capacity of <italic>E.coli</italic> cell extracts for Xan</title><p>The repair capacity of the <italic>E.coli</italic> cell extracts for Xan was measured by the release assay. 25XAN&#x0002f;COM25C containing &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;Xan was incubated with the cell extracts from <italic>E.coli</italic> MV1161 (wild type) and MV1571 (<italic>alkA</italic>), and the released tritium count was measured after separation on a gel filtration column. However, no significant difference in released radioactivity was observed between wild type and <italic>alkA</italic> mutant cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f5">5</xref>). It is possible that the basal level of AlkA protein in the wild type cell was so low that the activity difference between the wild type and <italic>alkA</italic> mutant cells could be within an experimental fluctuation. The <italic>alkA</italic> gene is inducible by alkylating agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c34">34</xref>). Therefore, MV1161 and MV1571 cells were treated with MNNG, and the cell extracts from the two strains were subjected to the release assay. After MNNG treatment, the wild type cell extract showed a 4-fold increase in Xan-releasing activity in comparison with the cell extract without the MNNG treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f5">5</xref>). In contrast, such induction was not observed with the <italic>alkA</italic> mutant treated with MNNG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f5">5</xref>). The results obtained with MNNG-treated cells were consistent with the data obtained with purified AlkA.</p></sec><sec><title>Paired base effects on the repair activity for Xan and Oxa</title><p>Xan and Oxa are potentially mutagenic lesions and pair with C and T during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c18">18</xref>). Thus, the ability of AlkA and Endo VIII to recognize Xan and Oxa paired with different bases was examined. The activity was measured by the nicking assay using 25XAN&#x0002f;COM25N and 25OXA&#x0002f;COM25N (N &#x0003d; A, G, C, T) as substrates. AlkA recognized not only a Xan:C pair (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f6">6</xref>A, lane 5) but also a Xan:A pair (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f6">6</xref>A, lane 3). The activities for both pairs were comparable. The Xan:G and Xan:T pairs were very poor substrates of AlkA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f6">6</xref>A, lanes 7 and 9). The order of activity for Xan was C &#x0003d; A &#x0003e;&#x0003e; G &#x0003e; T with respect to the paired base. Unlike AlkA, Endo VIII recognized Xan:C and Xan:G pairs with comparable efficiency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f6">6</xref>B, lanes 7 and 10). The Xan:A and Xan:T pairs were very poor substrates. The order of activity was C &#x0003d; G &#x0003e;&#x0003e; A &#x0003e; T with respect to the paired base. Compared to the reaction with Xan, a large excess of the enzymes (5- or 10-fold) and a long incubation time (1 h) were required to detect the activity for Oxa. For Oxa, AlkA and Endo VIII exhibited a similar preference of the paired bases. The pairs of Oxa:A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f7">7</xref>, lanes 4 and 5), Oxa:C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f7">7</xref>, lanes 8 and 9) and Oxa:G (lanes 12 and 13) were comparable substrates for AlkA and Endo VIII, whereas an Oxa:T pair was recognized poorly by the enzymes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f7">7</xref>, lanes 16 and 17). Therefore, the order of the activity of both enzymes was C &#x0003d; G &#x0003d; A &#x0003e; T with respect to the paired base.</p></sec><sec><title>Nitrous acid sensitivities of <italic>E.coli</italic> strains deficient in AlkA and Endo VIII</title><p>To assess the role of AlkA and Endo VIII in the repair of Xan and Oxa in <italic>E.coli</italic> cells, the sensitivity of <italic>E.coli</italic> strains MV1161 (wild type), MV1571 (<italic>alkA</italic>), KY100 (<italic>nei</italic>) and KY101 (<italic>alkA nei</italic>) to nitrous acid was determined by treating them with sodium nitrite (NaNO<sub>2</sub>) pH 4.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c29">29</xref>) under selective conditions (i.e. in the presence of appropriate antibiotics). The single mutants defective in either the <italic>alkA</italic> or <italic>nei</italic> gene showed nitrous acid sensitivities similar to those of the wild type cell. On the other hand, the <italic>alkA nei</italic> double mutant exhibited increased sensitivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f8">8</xref>), implying a degenerative role of AlkA and Endo VIII in counteracting the cytotoxic effect of nitrous acid. In the above NaNO<sub>2</sub> treatment, <italic>E.coli</italic> strains MV1161, MV1571 and KY100 were grown in the absence or presence of one antibiotic (ampicillin or kanamycin), while strain KY101 was grown in the presence of two antibiotics (ampicillin and kanamycin). The differences in growth conditions (i.e. selective pressure) might have created an advantage for the strains MV1161, MV1571 and KY100 over the strain KY101 with respect to survival. Thus, NaNO<sub>2</sub> treatment was also performed in the absence of antibiotics by taking advantage of the fact that the chromosomal markers for antibiotic resistance (ampicillin and kanamycin in this study) are rarely lost even in the absence of selection pressure. However, the results obtained without antibiotics were essentially similar to those obtained with antibiotics, hence ruling out the effects of selection pressure on survival measurements.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we have screened the repair activity of <italic>E.coli</italic> enzymes for Xan and Oxa formed from G by nitrogen oxides such as NO and nitrous acid. For this purpose, we prepared defined oligonucleotide substrates containing Xan and Oxa by DNA polymerase reactions with dXTP and dOTP. It has been reported that dXTP is a poor substrate of DNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c35">35</xref>). Our previous study has also shown that dOTP as well as dXTP are poorly utilized by DNA polymerase I relative to dGTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c19">19</xref>). However, the low but significant usability of dXTP and dOTP by DNA polymerase I was good enough for targeted incorporation of the nucleotides under appropriate DNA polymerase reaction conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f2">2</xref>).</p><p>Among the seven enzymes tested, AlkA and Endo VIII recognized Xan and Oxa, though their activity for Oxa was lower than for Xan. Analysis of enzymatic parameters revealed that the activity (<italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) of AlkA for Xan is one-fifth of that for 7mG, a physiological substrate of AlkA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf630tb2">2</xref>). AlkA recognizes a variety of alkylated purine and pyrimidine lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c34">34</xref>). It has been shown that 5-formyluracil and fragmented thymine residues are also substrates of AlkA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c38">38</xref>). Thus, AlkA accepts structurally diverse base lesions as substrates. Common features of the substrates recognized by AlkA are weak <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bonds and explicit or implicit positive charges induced in the base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c24">24</xref>). A plausible catalytic mechanism of AlkA has been proposed based on these features and the three-dimensional structure of AlkA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c41">41</xref>). In view of the weak <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond of Xan and the capacity of the active site of AlkA, it seems reasonable that AlkA recognizes Xan as a substrate. Oxa was also a substrate of AlkA but recognized poorly. The relative hydrolysis rate of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond of Oxa is 44-fold lower than that of Xan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c16">16</xref>). Therefore, it is very likely that such a difference affected the hydrolysis of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond by AlkA and slowed down the reaction of Oxa relative to Xan.</p><p>The cell extracts from the <italic>E.coli</italic> strains proficient and deficient in the <italic>alkA</italic> gene showed no significant difference in Xan-releasing activity. Possibly, the basal level of AlkA protein present in wild type cells was too low to exhibit detectable activity over the experimental fluctuation in the present assay. Although the attempt to show the difference in Xan-releasing activity between wild type and <italic>alkA</italic> mutant cells was unsuccessful, the repair activity for Xan in the wild type cell was clearly increased when the cell was treated with MNNG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f5">5</xref>). Such an increase was not observed with the <italic>alkA</italic> mutant when it was treated in the same manner, indicating that the induction of the repair activity for Xan in cells was dependent on the <italic>alkA</italic> gene. These results suggest that AlkA can at least participate in the repair of Xan when it is present at the induced level. The <italic>alkA</italic> gene is under the control of the <italic>ada</italic> gene and inducible by the alkylating agent such as MNNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c34">34</xref>). However, no information is currently available on whether NO or nitrous acid induces the <italic>alkA</italic> gene through this pathway.</p><p>In this study, it has also been shown that Endo VIII has repair activity for Xan. The activity of Endo VIII for Xan measured by enzymatic parameters was low relative to that for its physiological substrate (Tg) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf630tb2">2</xref>). However, the low but significant activity may be crucial for repair of Xan when the level of AlkA is not sufficiently high, e.g. in uninduced cells. Endo VIII was originally found as a repair enzyme for Tg and urea residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c31">31</xref>), and later it was shown to recognize other oxidative pyrimidine damage such as 5-hydroxycytosine, 5-hydroxyuracil and uracil glycol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c42">42</xref>). Thus, substrate specificity of Endo VIII is similar to that of Endo III. However, the amino acid sequence of Endo VIII shows no homology to that of Endo III. Rather, the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Endo VIII are similar to those of Fpg involved in repair of oxidative purine lesions in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c32">32</xref>). Furthermore, Endo VIII has been shown recently to excise oxidative purine lesions including 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c43">43</xref>). Thus, Endo VIII has a potential capacity to accept purine lesions as well as pyrimidine lesions, though the activities may vary. In this context, it may not be surprising that Endo VIII recognized Xan and Oxa. However, questions remain as to why Xan was a better substrate than Oxa for Endo VIII and why Xan and Oxa were substrates for Endo VIII but not for Fpg. Concerning the latter, the three-dimensional structures of Endo VIII and Fpg complexed covalently to DNA have recently been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c45">45</xref>). Although the overall structures of Endo VIII and Fpg resemble each other, there are three dissimilar patches where amino acids are not conserved between the two enzymes. One of them coincides with putative binding pockets for the everted base. Thus, interactions in the dissimilar binding pocket are likely to account for the distinct damage specificity of Endo VIII and Fpg.</p><p>The activities of AlkA and Endo VIII for Xan and Oxa showed dependence on the base opposite the lesions, though the activity for Oxa was consistently much lower than for Xan. For Xan, the activity decreased in the following order of the paired base: C &#x0003d; A &#x0003e;&#x0003e; G &#x0003e; T for AlkA and C &#x0003d; G &#x0003e;&#x0003e; A &#x0003e; T for Endo VIII (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f6">6</xref>). For Oxa, the order was C &#x0003d; G &#x0003d; A &#x0003e; T for both AlkA and Endo VIII (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f7">7</xref>). Considering the base pairing capacity of Xan and Oxa, C and T are the most biologically relevant paired bases. The Xan:C and Oxa:C pairs can be formed by the reaction of a G:C pair with NO and nitrous acid, and Xan:T and Oxa:T pairs by misincorporation of T opposite these lesions during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c18">18</xref>). Excision of Xan and Oxa from Xan:C and Oxa:C pairs, respectively, by AlkA and Endo VIII and subsequent repair synthesis leads to restoration of genetic information, thus error free. Conversely, excision of Xan and Oxa from Xan:T and Oxa:T pairs, respectively, results in mutation fixation and induces G:C&#x02192;A:T transitions if it occurs in cells. According to the present results (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f7">7</xref>), AlkA and Endo VIII recognized Xan:C and Oxa:C pairs relatively well but Xan:T and Oxa:T pairs were poor substrates for the enzymes. Thus, the poor activity of AlkA and Endo VIII for Xan:T and Oxa:T pairs seems to be consistent with avoidance of mutation fixation in cells. This is in contrast to the preference of <italic>E.coli</italic> Endo V, which recognizes all four Xan:N pairs (N &#x0003d; A, G, C, T) with a preference for the Xan:T pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c21">21</xref>). Endo V was originally found as a deoxyinosine endonuclease that incises the second phosphodiester bond on the 3&#x02032; side of deoxyinosine (a deoxyribonucleoside form of Hx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c7">7</xref>). More recently it has been shown to have a broad substrate specificity including Hx, U, Xan, AP site and mismatched bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c47">47</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, it has been shown that the <italic>alkA nei</italic> double mutant, but not the <italic>alkA</italic> and <italic>nei</italic> single mutants, was sensitive to nitrous acid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf630f8">8</xref>). These results suggest a degenerative role of AlkA and Endo VIII in the repair of a certain class of nitrous acid-induced DNA lesions, for example Xan and Oxa, though involvement of other <italic>E.coli</italic> base excision repair enzymes such as MutY, Mug and TagI has not been eliminated in this study. The actual mechanisms operating in <italic>E.coli</italic> cells to counteract the lethal and mutagenic effects of nitrous acid and NO appear to be rather complicated. Several studies show cell killing and mutagenicity by nitrous acid or NO increase in the cells deficient in nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c50">50</xref>) or recombination repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c51">51</xref>). In contrast, studies on <italic>nfi</italic> (the Endo V gene) mutants by Weiss&#x02019;s group indicate the involvement of Endo V in avoidance of nitrous acid-induced mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf630c54">54</xref>). Thus, at least four repair pathways including base excision repair indicated by this study, nucleotide excision repair, recombination repair, and repair initiated by Endo V have been implicated in restoration of DNA lesions formed by nitrous acid and NO. It is not clear whether such differences originate from dosage or types of nitrogen oxide species, cell conditions or accessed phenotypes (lethal or mutation effect). Thus, further studies are necessary to clarify the whole picture of the cellular mechanisms to counteract mutagenic and lethal effects associated with nitrogen oxide species.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf630f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Products formed by the reaction of guanine (G) with nitrogen oxides (NO and HNO<sub>2</sub>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkf630f1"/></fig><fig id="gkf630f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p> Chemical cleavage of oligonucleotides containing G (25G), Xan (25XAN) and Oxa (25OXA). 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled 25G, 25XAN and 25OXA were heated at 90&#x000b0;C for 30 min in an acidic aqueous solution (pH 3.5, adjusted by acetic acid) (lanes 3, 6 and 9).
