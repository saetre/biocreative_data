Like any other living organism, protein secretion is a fundamental process essential for various aspects of <italic>Salmonella</italic> biology. Herein we report the identification and characterization of a horizontally acquired, autonomous and previously unreported secretion pathway. In <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium, this novel secretion pathway is encoded by STM1669 and STM1668, designated <italic>zirT</italic> and <italic>zirS</italic>, respectively. We show that ZirT is localized to the bacterial outer membrane, expected to adopt a compact &#x003b2;-barrel conformation, and functions as a translocator for ZirS. ZirS is an exoprotein, which is secreted into the extracellular environment in a ZirT-dependent manner. The ZirTS secretion pathway was found to share several important features with two-partner secretion (TPS) systems and members of the intimin/invasin family of adhesions. We show that <italic>zirTS</italic> expression is affected by zinc; and that in vivo, induction of <italic>zirT</italic> occurs distinctively in <italic>Salmonella</italic> colonizing the small intestine, but not in systemic sites. Additionally, strong expression of <italic>zirT</italic> takes place in <italic>Salmonella</italic> shed in fecal pellets during acute and persistent infections of mice. Inactivation of ZirTS results in a hypervirulence phenotype of <italic>Salmonella</italic> during oral infection of mice. Cumulatively, these results indicate that the ZirTS pathway plays a unique role as an antivirulence modulator during systemic disease and is involved in fine-tuning a host&#x02013;pathogen balance during salmonellosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Bacteria of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> genus are important human pathogens and a leading cause of food-borne illness. Like for all other living organisms, protein secretion is a fundamental process, which is required for many different aspects of <italic>Salmonella</italic> biology including biogenesis of organelles, nutrient acquisition, and virulence. In this work we describe a new secretion pathway in <italic>Salmonella</italic> termed ZirTS. This pathway consists of an exported protein (ZirS) and a designated membrane translocator (ZirT), which mediates the secretion of ZirS to the extracellular milieu. Using a mouse model of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, we found that the ZirTS system is induced in <italic>Salmonella</italic> colonizing the small intestine and in <italic>Salmonella</italic> shed in fecal pellets during acute and persistent infections. Interestingly, inactivation of ZirTS results in a hypervirulence phenotype of <italic>Salmonella</italic> during oral infection of mice. These observations indicate that the ZirTS pathway plays a unique role as an antivirulence modulator and is involved in fine-tuning host&#x02013;pathogen interactions during disease.

Infection by this highly versatile pathogen can lead to different outcomes including asymptomatic carriage, gastroenteritis, or severe, life-threatening systemic disease, known as typhoid fever. The nature and the severity of the disease depend upon the serovar of the infecting <italic>Salmonella</italic> as well as the species and immunological status of the infected host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Kingsley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The two hallmarks of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium) pathogenesis are the invasion of non-phagocytic cells such as epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa, and the survival and replication inside infected phagocytic cells. Both mechanisms, as well as many of the virulence determinants used by <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, are directly linked to genes encoded within large horizontally acquired regions of the chromosome termed <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands.</p><p>Protein secretion is a ubiquitous cellular function found in organisms of all kingdoms. Gram-negative bacteria secrete a wide range of proteins whose functions include biogenesis of organelles, nutrient acquisition, virulence, efflux of toxins, and injection of virulence factors (effectors) into host cells. Protein export from the bacterial cytoplasm to the surface or the extracellular milieu requires transport across the inner membrane (IM), periplasm, and outer membrane (OM) of the cell envelope. In Gram-negative bacteria, several secretion pathways have evolved to fulfill this task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Economou1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Kostakioti1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The auto-transporters (ATs) and the two-partner secretion (TPS) systems (often classified as the Type V Secretion System) have been the focus of much interest in recent years due to their prime role in virulence traits of Gram-negative pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Henderson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Henderson2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>ATs are single functional units consisting of modular domains including: an N-terminal signal sequence that targets the protein to the general secretion (Sec) machinery at the IM; the passenger domain, which harbors the specific effector function; and the C-terminal translocation unit that forms, once inserted into the OM, a &#x003b2;-barrel secondary structure that mediates the secretion of the passenger domain. ATs are synthesized as pre-pro-proteins, and after cleavage of the signal peptide, the pro-protein is released into the periplasm. The passenger domain is then exported through the OM via the translocation unit, often cleaved off and released into the extracellular milieu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Desvaux1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Rutherford1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to the ATs, which are synthesized as a single polypeptide, in TPS systems the passenger domain and the transporter domain are translated as two separate proteins, referred to by the generic terms TpsA and TpsB, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-JacobDubuisson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. TpsA proteins are synthesized with an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide and transported across the IM by the Sec machinery. Subsequently, TpsA substrates transit through the periplasmic space to their cognate secretion partner (TpsB) which then facilitates their secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-JacobDubuisson2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The TpsB cluster members show characteristic features of integral OM proteins and like TpsA, are thought to be exported across the IM by the Sec apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-JacobDubuisson2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Conserved amphipathic motifs throughout their sequence indicate that TpsB proteins are likely to contain high numbers of transmembrane &#x003b2;-strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Clantin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This secondary structure is believed to adopt a &#x003b2;-barrel conformation forming a pore in the OM that enables the translocation of TpsA across the OM into the extracellular environment.</p><p>Another group of proteins, which are conceptually analogous to ATs is the intimin/invasin (Int/Inv) family of adhesins. These family members are specialized OM proteins found in strains of <italic>Yersinia</italic> spp. (Inv), pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (Int), and <italic>Citrobacter</italic> spp. (Int) that mediate adhesion of these pathogens to their hosts. Both invasins and intimins are translocated from the cytoplasm across the IM via the Sec-translocase and are related to each other both in terms of sequence and structure. The structure of Int/Inv includes a C-terminal C-type lectin receptor-binding domain, which is separated from a membrane-embedded N-terminal domain by several tandem Ig-like repeats, four in invasin and three in intimin. The conserved N-terminus domain is believed to form a &#x003b2;-barrel in the OM, which is used for the export of the C-terminal region. The extracellular C-terminus of Int/Inv is responsible for the receptor binding (Tir and &#x003b2;1 integrin, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Niemann1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Remaut1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

We showed that this novel secretion system consists of an OM protein, ZirT that is expected to adopt a &#x003b2;-barrel structure and the exoprotein ZirS, which is secreted into the extracellular environment in a strictly ZirT-dependent manner.</p><p>The ZirTS secretion system was found to share several important features with members of the TPS system and the Int/Inv family. However, despite the mutual similarities, some fundamental differences exist between the ZirTS and the compared systems. Obviously, as opposed to Int/Inv members, ZirTS function as a secretion system comprised of two separate components. Likewise, comparison of ZirTS to TPS systems reveals several hallmarks of TPS, which are absent from ZirTS. The most characteristic feature of the TPS exoproteins is a conserved N-terminal domain, known as the TPS domain. This region has been identified in all of the TpsA proteins characterized thus far and includes highly conserved NPNGI and NPNL motifs. The TPS domain is necessary for secretion and has been proposed to mediate recognition of the exoprotein by the transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-JacobDubuisson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-JacobDubuisson2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Kajava1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Clantin2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. An additional feature of TPS is the sequence conservation of TpsB family members, particularly within the C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Yen1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Amino acid sequence analysis and comparison of ZirS and ZirT to other known TPS members indicated the lack of these conserved modules in ZirS and ZirT and therefore differentiate ZirTS from the TPS pathway. Based on this we contend that <italic>zirTS</italic> encode a novel secretion pathway in <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p><p>Adapting the currently accepted mechanism of TPS systems, we propose the following model for the <italic>modus operandi</italic> of ZirTS: pre-ZirS is translocated across the IM, via the Sec translocase. Upon translocation, the signal peptide of pre-ZirS is cleaved off by a specific periplasmic signal peptidase and the mature ZirS is released in the periplasmic space. As was shown for other TPS systems, there appears to be no accumulation of periplasmic intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-JacobDubuisson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and ZirS is expected to transit through the periplasmic space, only briefly. Following Sec-dependent export across the IM, ZirS interacts with ZirT and then is translocated across the OM to the extracellular environment through a hydrophilic &#x003b2;-barrel pore formed by ZirT.</p><p>One of many intriguing questions related to ZirTS is its evolutionary origin. A conceivable scenario for the evolution of such a system might be a molecular separation of an ancestral Int/Inv related protein (or an AT) into two distinct functional polypeptides, early in the evolution of <italic>Salmonella.</italic> Other circumstances that might explain the development of ZirTS include a later acquisition of <italic>zirS</italic> into the genome and the &#x0201c;exploitation&#x0201d; of an already existing OM &#x003b2;-barrel porin for its secretion.</p><p>Thus far, Int/Inv and TPS systems have been shown to be primarily involved in different virulence traits of Gram-negative pathogens. In contrast, the ZirTS secretion pathway demonstrated an interesting and somewhat surprising antivirulence activity, rather than a virulence determinant, in the murine salmonellosis model. Presently, it is still unknown if the ZirTS pathway is unique to <italic>Salmonella</italic> or related systems exist in other bacteria. A bioinformatic search for non-invasin/intimin ZirT homologs has led to the identification of a predicted 934 amino acid OM protein (SG0602) in <italic>Sodalis glossinidius</italic>, which share 28&#x00025; identity and 45&#x00025; similarity with ZirT (E-value 5e-47). The gene localized immediately downstream to SG0602 is expected to encode a 371 amino acid protein (SG0603), with a predicted signal sequence. Interestingly, <italic>S. glossinidius</italic> is an endosymbiont residing intracellularly in tissues of the tsetse flies and utilize for cell invasion a type III secretion system, which is phylogenetically related to the SPI-1 type III secretion system of <italic>Salmonella</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Dale1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Although at this point, experimental evidence is still needed, <italic>de facto</italic> secretion of SG0603 in a SG0602-dependant manner will indicate a broader distribution of the ZirTS-like pathways among the Enterobacteriaceae.</p><p>Despite the fact that ZirS is being secreted into the extracellular environment, in mixed infection experiments, secretion of ZirS from a wild-type strain did not seem to complement the phenotype of a co-infecting <italic>zirS</italic> mutant. This observation may imply that ZirS exerts its effect only topically or has a short in vivo half-life.</p><p>Another interesting feature of ZirTS is its location on a horizontally acquired genomic island known as GEI 1664/1678 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-McClelland1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The acquisition of genomic islands by horizontal gene transfer enables bacteria to rapidly gain complex functions from other species and are crucial for the interaction of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium with eukaryotic host cells. From an evolutionary and ecological standpoint, infections caused by microbial pathogens that have sustained a long-standing association with their hosts are most often self-limiting or go unnoticed. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, as an example of such a pathogen, has maintained a coexistence with vertebrate hosts for millions of years and evolved extremely sophisticated mechanisms to engage vertebrate hosts. When examined at the cellular and molecular levels, this functional interface reveals an impressive array of bacterial determinants designed to manipulate the host immune system, to sense the host environment or to modulate a variety of cellular processes. The overall picture emerging from close examination is perhaps one of balance, self restraint and sophistication rather than one of uncontrolled hostility towards its host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Galan1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Most studies in bacterial pathogenesis are directed towards finding genes that promote virulence in the host. Nonetheless, recent studies have demonstrated that indeed, a fine balance during host infection is kept due to the function of a subset of <italic>Salmonella</italic> genes known as &#x02018;antivirulence genes' <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-ForemanWykert1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Deletion mutations of these genes have led to an overgrowth phenotype in the mouse model. Mouslim and colleagues have shown that a PhoPQ regulated gene, <italic>pcgL</italic>, is involved in stimulating the host immune system to prevent bacterial overgrowth in mouse organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Mouslim1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Another example of an antivirulence gene is <italic>sciS</italic>. A <italic>sciS</italic> mutant strain has been shown to display increased intracellular numbers in J774 macrophages and hypervirulence in mice, when administered intragastrically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Parsons1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. A null mutation in a Gifsy-2 phage harbored gene, <italic>grvA</italic>, increased virulence as measured by competitive index experiments in mouse spleens and small intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Ho1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Cumulatively, these studies contribute to a recurring theme in pathogenesis emphasizing the importance of pathogens to limit their effects upon the cells they infect in order to achieve a balance with their host. These examples prove that it is possible for an inactivated gene to lead to an increase in bacterial numbers in host tissues. Increased bacterial loads in the murine host would likely lead to more rapid sepsis and toxic shock, thus increasing lethality and decreasing transmission of the pathogen. The hypervirulence of &#x00394;<italic>zirTS</italic> observed in the mouse model during oral infection and its induction in the fecal pellets at an early stage of the infection are consistent with this concept. As with all <italic>Salmonella</italic> species, <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route. Infected animals excrete <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the feces, which will then gain access to an uninfected host, starting a new infection cycle. Supported by induction of <italic>zirT</italic> in the small intestine and its constant induction in feces, we hypothesize that ZirTS play a role as a &#x02018;virulence modulator&#x02019; in the early stages of infection. We propose that ZirTS contribute to a host-pathogen balance after the transmission from an infected to na&#x000ef;ve host. The role ZirTS play during an early stage of the infection may be in prevention of premature host death and, perhaps, demonstrate at the molecular level, what was understood by MacFarlane Burnet almost 70 years ago that &#x0201c;there is little point in a microorganism destroying its host in a spectacular fashion if this leaves it with no prospect of being ferried to other vulnerable hosts&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000036-Burnet1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains and in vitro growth conditions</title><p>Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000036-t001">Table 1</xref>. <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium SL1344 was used as the wild-type strain, and all mutants used in this study were isogenic derivatives of SL1344.
