Here, we investigate the function of dynein variants, defined by different intermediate chain (IC) isoforms, by expressing fluorescent ICs in neuronal cells. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)&#x02013;IC incorporates into functional dynein complexes that copurify with membranous organelles. In living PC12 cell neurites, GFP&#x02013;dynein puncta travel in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. In cultured hippocampal neurons, neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) signaling endosomes are transported by cytoplasmic dynein containing the neuron-specific IC-1B isoform and not by dynein containing the ubiquitous IC-2C isoform. Similarly, organelles containing TrkB isolated from brain by immunoaffinity purification also contain dynein with IC-1 but not IC-2 isoforms. These data demonstrate that the IC isoforms define dynein populations that are selectively recruited to transport distinct cargoes.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>J.

In neurons, dynein is responsible for the fast retrograde transport of membrane-bound organelles, such as signaling endosomes, from the axon terminus to the cell body. Signaling endosomes are formed when neurotrophins, which are target-derived growth factors such as NGF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, bind to and activate their individual tyrosine kinase receptors (Trks), TrkA and TrkB, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Delcroix et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang and Reichardt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heerssen et al., 2004</xref>). Retrograde transport of signaling endosomes from axon terminals to cell bodies is required for neuronal survival and axonal plasticity.</p><p>Very little is known about how cytoplasmic dynein is regulated to accomplish its varied functions. A single gene encodes the dynein motor domain, the &#x0003e;500-kD heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfister et al., 2006</xref>). However, at least two genes encode each of the five subunits that make up the cargo-binding domain: the intermediate chain (IC; DYNC1I), the light IC, and three classes of light chains. Cells thus contain distinct dynein complexes distinguished by different combinations of subunit isoforms, and it is hypothesized that these distinct dynein complexes make possible specific regulation of dynein motor activity and/or cargo binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tynan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Susalka and Pfister, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfister et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lo et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Rourke et al., 2007</xref>). There is evidence that dynein complexes with different IC isoforms have distinct roles in cells. At least six IC isoforms are generated by alternative splicing. IC-2C (the product of gene 2, alternative splicing variant C) is the only ubiquitously expressed isoform. Several of the IC isoforms are expressed exclusively in neurons, and the levels of the isoforms are regulated during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pfister et al., 1996a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Myers et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, dynein complexes containing distinct IC and light IC isoforms are segregated in adult rat optic nerve axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dillman et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>To identify functional differences between dynein complexes containing different ICs, we imaged two fluorescently tagged IC isoforms in living neuronal cells. We found that the fluorescent ICs incorporated into functional dynein complexes that bound to microtubules and membranous organelles. Analysis of the movement of dynein complexes containing the ubiquitous isoform IC-2C and a neuron-specific isoform IC-1B (gene 1, alternative splicing variant B) revealed differences in their kinetic properties. In addition, the dynein complexes containing the IC-1B isoform but not the IC-2C isoform bound to and transported neuronal TrkB signaling endosomes. In PC12 cells, however, dynein containing IC-2C copurified with TrkA signaling endosomes. In this cell line, NGF binding to TrkA lead to an increase in the amount of activated TrkA that copurified with dynein-associated membrane-bounded organelles and increased retrograde dynein velocity but had no effect on anterograde dynein velocity in neurites. These data indicate that different IC isoforms contribute to the regulation of dynein cargo binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We generated a stable PC12 cell line expressing low levels (&#x0003c;15% of the total) of GFP-tagged IC isoform 2C (GFP&#x02013;IC-2C) and used it to characterize the properties of dynein complexes containing the IC-2C isoform. In cell bodies, few discrete GFP&#x02013;IC&#x02013;containing structures were resolved due to the presence of a large soluble dynein pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paschal et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Habermann et al., 2001</xref>). However, in neurites, the distribution of GFP&#x02013;dynein was punctate and comparable to that observed with an antibody to dynein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Some regions of the neurites were wide enough to distinguish microtubules, and in these regions, the GFP&#x02013;dynein puncta colocalized with the microtubules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of GFP-dynein puncta near microtubules in PC12 cell neurites.</bold> (A&#x02013;E) PC12 cells with stable expression of GFP&#x02013;IC-2C (GFP-Dynein, green) were differentiated with NGF, fixed, and stained with anti-tubulin (red).

This indicated that the GFP&#x02013;IC, like the endogenous IC, was bound to the microtubule-binding motor domain of the dynein complex, the heavy chain. In addition, dynein containing the GFP&#x02013;IC was released from microtubules in the presence of Mg-ATP, demonstrating that the GFP&#x02013;IC containing dynein hydrolyzed ATP. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> shows that after sucrose density gradient sedimentation, all of the GFP&#x02013;IC-2C, like the endogenous IC, copurified exclusively with 20S dynein complexes near the bottom of the gradient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The absence of GFP&#x02013;IC at the top of the gradient showed that there was no free pool of GFP&#x02013;IC. Therefore all the GFP&#x02013;IC-2C incorporated into functional dynein complexes, and the GFP&#x02013;IC puncta observed in cells corresponded to these complexes. In addition, two membrane vesicle markers, synaptophysin and the transmembrane neurotrophin receptor TrkA, were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from a membrane fraction by antibodies to GFP coupled to magnetic beads (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>; and see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>).

Taxol-stabilized microtubules were added to the soluble fraction (S), and centrifugation yielded the microtubule depleted supernatant (MDS) and microtubule pellet (MTP). The microtubule pellet was resupended in 10 mM Mg-ATP, and centrifugation yielded the ATP supernatant (ATPS) and microtubule pellet (ATPP).

We found that 92% of the growing microtubules (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 53) in PC12 cells were oriented with their plus ends toward the tip by use of the EB3 polarity assay. Therefore, as in axons, anterograde movement in PC12 cell neurites is directed toward microtubule plus ends, and retrograde movement is directed toward microtubule minus ends. Frame-to-frame tracking of the movement of individual dynein puncta showed that their velocity changed during excursions (see Materials and methods; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The interval velocities of the puncta were in the range of 0.3&#x02013;3.1 &#x003bc;m/s, and the mean interval velocity for retrograde dynein movement was 0.9 &#x003bc;m/s (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). A larger number of the dynein puncta were observed moving in the anterograde direction than the retrograde direction in the PC12 cell neurites. This was consistent with the observation that dynein accumulated in growth cones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Myers et al., 2007</xref>). To further demonstrate that the retrograde motility of GFP&#x02013;IC dynein complexes was the result of their motor activity, siRNA specific for the untranslated region of IC-2 gene products was used to deplete the endogenous dynein pool while allowing expression of the GFP-tagged IC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Robust GFP&#x02013;dynein puncta movement in PC12 cell neurites continued after the depletion of the endogenous IC-2 isoforms, which would normally cause the cessation of movement (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Video 2). This observation confirmed that the GFP&#x02013;dynein complexes moving in the retrograde direction were active motors, rather than cargo of the endogenous dynein.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Bidirectional movement of dynein complexes containing IC-2C in a PC12 cell neurite.</bold> (A) Live cell imaging.

The kinetic and cargo-binding properties of dynein complexes with two isoforms, the ubiquitous isoform IC-2C and the neuron-specific isoform IC-1B, were determined. In the axons of hippocampal neurons, dynein complexes containing IC-2C and IC-1B moved rapidly in both the anterograde and retrograde directions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>; and Videos 3 and 4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803150/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803150/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast to the movement of IC-2C&#x02013;containing dynein complexes in PC12 cell neurites, no directional bias for either of the two distinct dynein complexes was observed in hippocampal neuron axons. Significantly more of the dynein complexes containing IC-2C were found to be nonmotile than the dynein complexes containing IC-1B (P &#x0003c; 0.0005; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). Large numbers of both classes of dynein complexes displayed jiggling motion but no net motility. Occasionally, the jiggling movement was observed to precede or follow a motile excursion. There was no significant difference between the retrograde interval velocity distributions of the two classes of dynein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The range of velocities observed for dynein complexes with either IC-2C or IC-1B was 0.3&#x02013;3.6 &#x003bc;m/s in hippocampal axons. However, compared with PC12 cells, a larger number of slow velocities were observed in axons. This accounts for the net slower mean interval velocities (0.7 &#x003bc;m/s) calculated for both dynein isoforms. The kinetics of dynein excursions in the retrograde direction were also analyzed. There was no significant difference in either the mean excursion velocities or run lengths when dynein complexes containing IC-2C and IC-1B were compared. However, on average, the excursions of dynein containing IC-1B lasted &#x0223c;30% longer (P &#x0003c; 0.0003). Some puncta from both classes of dynein were observed to switch direction during excursive movement in hippocampal axons. Interestingly, a dynein puncta was as likely to switch from the retrograde to the anterograde direction as the anterograde to retrograde direction (unpublished data). No significant difference was observed between the anterograde interval velocity distributions of dynein complexes with IC-1B and IC-2C in axons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table III</xref> and not depicted). However, the mean anterograde excursion velocity of dynein with IC-2C was slightly faster than that of dynein with IC-1B (P &#x0003c; 0.02).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Bidirectional movement of dynein complexes containing IC-2C and IC-1B in neurons.</bold> (A) IC-2C dynein.

In neurons, the retrograde transport of signaling endosomes (which contain activated, neurotrophin-binding Trks) to the nucleus is essential for axonal survival. Cortical and hippocampal neurons express the brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor TrkB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindsay et al., 1994</xref>). We have shown that hippocampal neurons express both the IC-2C (ubiquitous) and IC-1B (neuron-specific) IC isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pfister et al., 1996a</xref>). When the distribution of TrkB was compared with that of the two different dynein complexes in living hippocampal neurons, a significant difference in the extent of colocalization was observed (P &#x0003c; 0.005; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Only 2.6 &#x000b1; 1.5% of the IC-2C spots colocalized with TrkB, whereas 17.8 &#x000b1; 4.6% of the IC-1B colocalized with TrkB. Thus, dynein containing IC-1B was much more likely to colocalize with TrkB carrier vesicles than dynein containing IC-2C. Significantly, coordinate movement of TrkB with dynein containing IC-1B was also observed, demonstrating that dynein with the IC-1B isoform is responsible for the retrograde transport of TrkB containing endosomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref> and Video 5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803150/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803150/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, transport of TrkB containing endosomes by dynein containing IC-2C was not found in axons. To confirm that TrkB did not associate with IC-2C dynein complexes, signaling endosomes were immunopurified from the cortex, a brain region with high levels of TrkB expression, by using magnetic beads coupled with anti-Trk antibodies. Antibodies that distinguish between IC isoforms were used to demonstrate that dynein complexes containing IC-1 copurified with the Trk containing vesicles, but dynein containing IC-2 did not (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Thus, TrkB vesicles from cortical neurons were associated with IC-1 but were not associated with any IC-2 isoform. Together, the live cell imaging and biochemical data demonstrate that dynein complexes containing IC-1B but not dynein containing IC-2C are responsible for the transport of TrkB containing signaling endosomes in cortical and hippocampal neurons.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Coordinate movement of TrkB and cytoplasmic dynein complexes containing IC-1B in neurons.</bold> (A) Comparison of the colocalization of TrkB with IC-2C and IC-1B dynein complexes.

The addition of NGF significantly increased the mean interval velocity of the dynein puncta moving in the retrograde direction by &#x0223c;30%, from 0.9 to 1.2 &#x003bc;m/s (P &#x0003c; 0.00017), but there was no change in the anterograde interval velocity (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Also, there was a significant increase in the relative amount of dynein puncta moving in the retrograde direction, an increase from 34 to 52% (P &#x0003c; 0.0002) upon the addition of NGF (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). These data indicate that NGF stimulation of PC12 cells leads to increased association of activated TrkA containing organelles with dynein and increased dynein retrograde motor activity.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Regulation of dynein by neurotrophins and Trks.</bold> (A) Recruitment of activated (phosphorylated) TrkA to dynein containing vesicles in NGF-treated PC12 cells.

Because all cytoplasmic dynein complexes contain the same motor domain, it has been hypothesized that the isoforms of the other subunits were involved in linking specific cargoes to the dynein complex and/or for specific regulation of the dynein motor activity. Supporting this hypothesis, we have shown that dynein complexes that contain the neuron-specific IC IC-1B bind to and transport TrkB containing endosomes. In contrast, dynein complexes containing the ubiquitous IC IC-2C did not associate with or transport the TrkB signaling endosomes. Thus, although neurons express several IC isoforms, only dynein complexes with a specific IC (IC-1B) were used in the transport of TrkB. Interestingly, almost 20% of the IC-1B&#x02013;containing dynein was used for signaling endosome transport. This is a relatively large amount to be used for the retrograde transport of a single class of organelle, especially considering that the pool includes dynein being transported in the anterograde direction. In contrast, in PC12 cells, the highly related receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA, bound to and was transported by dynein complexes containing the IC-2C IC. Together these data indicate that neuronal-specific dynein isoforms are used in neurons for transporting particular critical cargoes.</p><p>The mechanism by which the ICs specify the distinct dynein complexes that associate with the different Trk signaling endosomes remains to be determined. It has been suggested that one of the cytoplasmic dynein light chains, DYNLT1 (previously called Tctex1), binds to all three Trk growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yano et al., 2001</xref>). However, we have found that the DYNLT1 light chain binds to all six ICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lo et al., 2007b</xref>). Thus, DYNLT1 does not provide the specificity necessary to account for our findings. The observation that kinase-dead TrkB-GFP is not transported toward the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heerssen et al., 2004</xref>) suggests that Trk kinase activity is important for dynein transport. One function of the alternative splicing of the ICs may be to generate unique phosphorylation sites to regulate dynein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vaughan and Vallee, 1995</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that IC phosphorylation by a downstream effector of the Trk kinases also leads to the recruitment of the appropriate dynein isoform. This hypothesis is consistent with our observation that NGF, which binds to the TrkA receptor, stimulates increased IC phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salata et al., 2001</xref>) and, as shown here, increased retrograde dynein activity in PC12 cells.</p><p>Dynein complexes with GFP&#x02013;ICs displayed ATP-sensitive microtubule binding and copurified with membrane-bounded organelles. We further found that the copurification of dynein complexes and Trks required the presence of a membranous organelle (unpublished data). In addition, we demonstrated specific differences in the motor activities of dynein complexes containing the distinct IC isoforms. When the kinetics of retrograde dynein motor complexes containing IC-2C and IC-1B were compared, we found that IC-2C&#x02013;containing dynein complexes were less likely to be motile. Although the two complexes had identical interval velocity distributions, the excursions of IC-1B&#x02013;containing dynein complexes were, on average, of longer duration. These data suggest that the different ICs isoforms do modulate dynein motor activity. They are also consistent with the recent finding that the phenotype of dynein motor mutations in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> were suppressed by the deletion of specific cargo-binding subunit isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Rourke et al., 2007</xref>). Together, the data support the hypothesis that the subunit isoforms differentially regulate dynein activity. In contrast to our observations of IC-2C in PC12 cells, there was no significant difference in the number of IC-2C and IC-1B dynein puncta moving in the anterograde and retrograde directions in axons. The neuronal dynein puncta were observed to switch directions but there was no preference for a specific change in direction for either dynein variant.</p><p>When we compared the anterograde kinetics of dynein complexes with the two distinct IC isoforms in cultured embryonic hippocampal axons, no difference was observed in the interval velocity distribution of the two dynein complexes. However, a small but statistically significant difference (P &#x0003c; 0.02; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table III</xref>) was observed in the mean anterograde excursion velocities; dynein with IC-1B moved slower in cultured hippocampal neurons. We previously found that in adult rat optic nerves, dynein with IC-2C was transported in the anterograde fast transport, whereas dynein complexes with IC-1B were transported in the anterograde slow component b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dillman et al., 1996</xref>). Transport of IC-2C dynein complexes in the anterograde fast component suggested that they were transported as cargo by a member of the kinesin family. Consistent with this, an overlap in the distributions of GFP&#x02013;IC-2C and Kinesin-1 was observed when monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)&#x02013;Kinesin-1 (Kif5a) was transfected into PC12 cells, and Kinesin-1 was present when organelles were purified from the GFP&#x02013;IC-2C cell line by immunoaffinity purification with antibodies to GFP (unpublished data). Although the anterograde kinetics of IC-1B dynein observed in cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons were more rapid than those observed in the axons of adult optic nerve, it is notable that our results are consistent with recent observations of the transport of slow component b proteins in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). A-synuclein and two other slow component b proteins were transported at velocities comparable those of dynein containing IC-1B.</p><p>Other isoforms of dynein subunits have been implicated in linking dynein to specific cargo; e.g., light IC 1 (DYNC1LI1) binds to pericentrin and DYNLT1 binds to rhodopsin, whereas DYNLT3 binds to Bub3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tynan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reilein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vallee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lo et al., 2007a</xref>). The IC subunit is involved in binding dynein to cargoes through its interaction with the p150 subunit of dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karki and Holzbaur, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vaughan and Vallee, 1995</xref>). The IC also binds some cargoes directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ligon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caviston et al., 2007</xref>). The results presented here demonstrate for the first time that specific dynein variants defined by different ICs isoforms are responsible for the transport of specific membrane-bounded organelles. Interestingly, although the chromaffin-derived PC12 cells make use of the ubiquitous IC isoform IC-2C for Trk signaling endosome transport, neurons that express IC-2C use a different IC isoform for Trk transport, one which is expressed exclusively in neurons. Therefore it will be important to identify and compare the regulatory pathways in the different cell types to understand the mechanisms involved in the recruitment of the different dynein complexes to signaling endosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Establishment of the PC12 cell line with the stable expression of GFP&#x02013;IC-2C</title><p>Rat pheochromocytoma&#x02014;PC12 cells&#x02014;cultured in DME (Invitrogen) with 5% FBS and either 10% equine serum or FCS (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific) and gentimycin were transfected with the GFP&#x02013;IC-2C plasmid using Fugene 6 (Roche), and cells with stable expression of the plasmids were selected with G418 (Invitrogen).

Excursions are defined as puncta movements greater than one pixel for four frames. The standard pixel size was 0.138 &#x003bc;m, the exposure time was 0.5 s, and the smallest detectable velocity was 0.3 &#x003bc;m/s. Motile fluorescent dynein puncta were spots with two or three bright pixels. In the GFP&#x02013;IC-2C PC12 cell line, the puncta intensities were &#x0223c;20% above background; in the siRNA-treated PC12 cell line and in the transiently transfected neurons, the puncta intensities were 60&#x02013;90% above background. The difference in background may account for the observation that the mean interval velocity of dynein in normal PC12 cell neurites was larger than that observed in the siRNA-treated PC12 cell neurites and or hippocampal axons. The higher background levels may obscure the slower movements. In addition, axons have a smaller diameter than the PC12 cell neurites. This minimizes loss of puncta due to their moving out of the plane of focus. The smaller diameter also may lead to more collisions with other puncta or other unlabeled obstructions. We occasionally observed collisions between puncta in axons and puncta leaving a group of stationary puncta.
