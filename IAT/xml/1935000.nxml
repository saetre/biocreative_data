However, relatively little is known in terms of structural requirements, kinetics of interaction with their targets and degradation in contrast to well-studied plasmid-encoded antisense RNAs. Here, we present a detailed <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of SR1, a sRNA of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> that is involved in regulation of arginine catabolism by basepairing with its target, <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA. The secondary structures of SR1 species of different lengths and of the SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> RNA complex were determined and functional segments required for complex formation narrowed down. The initial contact between SR1 and its target was shown to involve the 5&#x02032; part of the SR1 terminator stem and a region 100&#x02009;bp downstream from the <italic>ahrC</italic> transcriptional start site. Toeprinting studies and secondary structure probing of the <italic>ahrC</italic>/SR1 complex indicated that SR1 inhibits translation initiation by inducing structural changes downstream from the <italic>ahrC</italic> RBS. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Hfq, which binds both SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA was not required to promote <italic>ahrC</italic>/SR1 complex formation but to enable the translation of <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA. The intracellular concentrations of SR1 were calculated under different growth conditions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are expressed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, primarily as posttranscriptional regulators. Over the past six years, about 70 sRNAs have been discovered in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and about 20 of them have been assigned a function. Many of these trans-encoded RNAs are involved in metabolic processes [e.g. Spot42, DsrA, RprA, RyhB, SgrS, GadY, reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>)] and at least eight sRNAs regulate the expression of membrane proteins [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>)]. To date, relatively few systematic searches have been performed in Gram-positive bacteria. Among the recently discovered sRNAs in Gram-positive hosts are RatA from the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), which came up in a systematic search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) together with 12 other sRNAs that proved to be sporulation-controlled, but still await the identification of their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Furthermore, in addition to the well-studied RNAIII from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), 12 novel sRNAs from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> pathogenicity islands have been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) as well as three Hfq-binding sRNAs of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> with still unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and nine novel sRNAs from <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> within intergenic regions found by <italic>in silico</italic>-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Additionally, more than 100 potential 6S RNA species have been identified by bioinformatics approaches, and many of them were verified experimentally, among them two 6S RNA species in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Still, the identification of mRNA targets of the recently discovered sRNAs is a challenging issue, and has been successful only in less than one-third of all cases.</p><p>One important hallmark of many trans-encoded regulatory RNAs from <italic>E. coli</italic> is their ability to bind the Sm-like abundant RNA chaperone Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). While several sRNAs have been found to require Hfq for their stability, some were shown to need Hfq for efficient complex formation with their target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). For DsrA/<italic>rpoS</italic>/Hfq, the pathway of complex formation has been investigated by biophysical techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, for sRNAs from Gram-positive bacteria, the putative function of Hfq is still elusive. At least in one case, staphylococcal RNAIII/<italic>spa</italic> interaction, no influence of Hfq has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the <italic>cis</italic>-encoded sRNAs from accessory genetic elements like plasmids, phages, transposons that have been studied in detail over the past 25 years [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>)], relatively little is known about structural requirements, binding kinetics and mechanisms or degradation pathways of these new trans-encoded regulatory sRNAs. Although complexes between sRNA and mRNA have been detected <italic>in vitro</italic> in some instances, only in five cases secondary structures of such complexes predicted by Mfold have been confirmed by experimental secondary structure probing. These include MicF/<italic>ompF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), Spot42/<italic>galK</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), RyhB/<italic>sodB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), MicA/<italic>ompA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) from <italic>E. coli</italic> and RNAIII/<italic>spa</italic> from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). So far, the region of initial contact between a trans-encoded sRNA and a target RNA sharing more than one complementary region has not been narrowed down. The mechanism of action has been proposed in some cases, but not always corroborated by a combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p><p>The 205-nt untranslated RNA SR1 from the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome was found in our group by a combination of computer predictions and northern blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Recently, we have shown that SR1 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> antisense RNA that acts by basepairing with its primary target, <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA, the transcriptional activator of the <italic>rocABC</italic> and <italic>rocDEF</italic> arginine catabolic operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> translation data and translational reporter gene fusions suggested that SR1 might inhibit <italic>ahrC</italic> translation at a post-initiation stage. Hfq was shown to be dispensable for the stability of SR1.</p><p>Here, we provide a detailed <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of SR1 and the SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> complex with and without Hfq. We determined the region of initial contact between SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic>. Furthermore, a combination of toeprinting and SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> complex probing studies demonstrated that SR1 inhibits translation initiation of <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA by inducing structural changes between the <italic>ahrC</italic> SD sequence and the first complementary region G. In contrast to many <italic>E. coli</italic> sense/antisense systems, Hfq was shown to be exclusively required for translation of <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA, but not for promoting the SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> interaction. The intracellular concentration of SR1 in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was calculated to be 30&#x02009;nM in log phase and 315&#x02009;nM in stationary phase in complex TY medium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Enzymes and chemicals</title><p>Chemicals used were of the highest purity available. <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase was purchased from Roche or SphaeroQ, Netherlands, respectively, RNA ligase from New England Biolabs and Thermoscript reverse transcriptase and M-MuLV reverse transcriptase from Invitrogene and Fermentas, respectively.

Since computer-predicted RNA structures often deviate from experimentally determined ones [e.g. RNAIII of pIP501 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) or RNAI/RNAII of pT181 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>)], we performed limited digestions with structure-specific ribonucleases <italic>in vitro</italic> to determine the secondary structure of SR1. The wild-type SR1 (205&#x02009;nt) as well as the 3&#x02032; truncated species SR1<sub>132</sub>, the 5&#x02032; truncated species SR1<sub>98</sub> and the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; truncated species SR1<sub>78</sub> were 5&#x02032;-end labelled, gel-purified and treated with RNases T1 (cleaves 3&#x02032; of unpaired G residues), T2 (unpaired nucleotides with a slight preference for A residues) and V1 (double-stranded or stacked regions). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A shows an analysis of SR1<sub>205</sub> and the truncated species SR1<sub>132</sub> whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B contains the schematic representation of the structure of SR1<sub>205</sub> derived from the cleavage data. The experimentally determined structure for wild-type SR1 comprises three main stem-loops: SL1 (nt 1 to 112), SL2 (nt 138 to 154) and the terminator stem-loop SL3 (nt 173 to 203) interrupted by two single-stranded regions SSR1 (nt 113 to 137) and SSR2 (nt 155 to 172). It deviates from the structure predicted with Mfold in the 5&#x02032; as well as in the 3&#x02032; portion: The 5&#x02032; part was found to be single-stranded between nt 38 and 51, and the double-stranded stem proved to be much longer than predicted and comprises 20 paired nucleotides (nt) interrupted by three internal loops or bulged-out bases, respectively, compared to only 10 paired nt in the predicted structure. For the 3&#x02032; part, two stem-loops and the terminator stem-loop were predicted by Mfold, whereas the structure probing data support in addition to the terminator stem-loop only the second stem-loop SL2 in the centre of a long single-stranded region. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Secondary structures of SR1 species of different lengths.

If these two regions were involved in a first contact between SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA, nucleotide exchanges in either SR1 or <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA should impair or abolish complex formation, and compensatory mutations should, at least partially, restore binding. To test this hypothesis, three mutated SR1<sub>186</sub> species with either a 10&#x02009;nt exchange (5&#x02032;AGCAUGCGGC to 5&#x02032; UCGUACGCCG) between nt 176 and 185 denoted SR1<sub>186_G10</sub>, a 6&#x02009;nt exchange (5&#x02032;AGCAUG to 5&#x02032;UCGUAC), denoted SR1<sub>186_G6</sub> or a 2&#x02009;nt exchange (G<sub>177</sub>C<sub>178</sub> to T<sub>177</sub>T<sub>178</sub>) denoted SR1<sub>186_G2</sub>, were assayed in complex formation with wild-type <italic>ahrC</italic><sub>88</sub> comprising nt 109 to 196 of <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA (region G&#x02032;). The 6 and 10&#x02009;nt exchanges were designed such that the GC/AU content of the region was not altered compared with the wild-type. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, no interaction between these three mutated SR1 species and wild-type <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA was observed. By contrast, the exchange of only C<sub>178</sub> to G (SR1<sub>186_G1</sub>) did not impede complex formation, suggesting that either G<sub>177</sub> is most important for the initial contact or that substitution of one nucleotide is not sufficient to cause an effect. Interestingly, when <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA<sub>88_G&#x02032;2</sub>, a derivative of the same length carrying the compensatory mutations to SR1<sub>186_G2</sub> was used, binding could be restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B) confirming a specific basepairing interaction between SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA. When a longer <italic>ahrC</italic><sub>376</sub> RNA comprising all seven complementary regions G&#x02032; to A&#x02032; was analysed, binding was abolished by the above-mentioned mutations too, and partially restored with the compensatory mutation <italic>ahrC</italic><sub>376_G&#x02032;2</sub> mRNA (not shown).

A 250-fold lower &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was detected in the absence of Hfq, indicating that this RNA chaperone is required for efficient translation of <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>To substantiate the role of Hfq in promoting translation of <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA, the secondary structures of <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA and SR1 were probed with RNases T1 and T2 in the presence and absence of Hfq. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D, one binding site of Hfq on <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA (5&#x02032; AAAUA) is located immediately upstream of the SD sequence. The same assay was used to determine the binding site(s) of Hfq on SR1. Here, one binding site around nt 9&#x02013;13 in the 5&#x02032; part of SR1 and a second in the bulge of stem-loop SL1 (nt 43 to 47) were found (gel not shown). The facts that Hfq gel-shifts with wild-type SR1 and SR1<sub>104</sub> comprising only the 5&#x02032; stem-loop were identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), support the absence of Hfq-binding sites on SR1 downstream from nt 104.</p></sec><sec><title>SR1 blocks ribosome binding to the <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA translation initiation region</title><p>Although the first complementary region between <italic>ahrC</italic> and SR1 is located 87&#x02009;nt downstream from the <italic>ahrC</italic> SD sequence, we performed a toeprinting analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) to examine the effect of SR1 on formation of the translation initiation complex at <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A shows that in the presence of initiator tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>, 30S ribosomal subunits bind to the <italic>ahrC</italic> translation initiation region and block reverse transcription of a labelled primer, annealed downstream, at the characteristic position +15 (start codon A is +1). This signal provides a measure for the formation of the ternary complex, since it is dependent on both 30S subunits and initiator tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>. Addition of increasing amounts of SR1<sub>WT</sub> or SR1<sub>186</sub> prior to addition of 30S subunits and tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> interfered with ternary complex formation, resulting in a weaker toeprint signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and C). Thereby, the inhibitory activity of SR1<sub>186</sub> was higher than that of SR1<sub>WT</sub> which correlates with its more efficient binding activity to <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). By contrast, both the addition of a noncognate small RNA, SR2 from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> or RyhB from <italic>E. coli</italic>, failed to decrease the toeprint signal on <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D) indicating that SR1-dependent inhibition of ribosome binding was specific. To support the specificity of the SR1 inhibitory action on ternary complex formation on <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA, a control toeprint was performed with SR1 and <italic>sodB</italic> mRNA (target of RyhB). Since SR1 did not affect ternary complex formation on <italic>sodB</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), whereas RyhB did as expected, it can be excluded that the effect of SR1 on <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA is simply due to binding to the ribosome. To corroborate the importance of complementary region G for the interaction between SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA, an additional toeprinting assay was carried out with the G-region mutant SR1<sub>186_G2</sub> compared to SR1<sub>186</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). The autoradiogram and the quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D) show that this mutant is clearly impaired in blocking the binding of the 30S initiation complex, although it has still some residual activity. This result confirms both the specificity of the SR1/ahrC interaction and substantiates our conclusion from the binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) that G is required for the initial contact between SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA. In summary, these data demonstrate that binding of SR1 to <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA prevents the formation of translation initiation complexes. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Toeprinting analysis.

In the majority of cases, these regions covered the 5&#x02032; part of the target RNA, mostly including the SD sequence, and the mechanism of action was found to be inhibition or activation of translation initiation. Rather unusually, SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA contain seven regions of complementarity that comprise the 3&#x02032; half of SR1 and the central and 3&#x02032; portion of <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This prompted us to determine the secondary structures of SR1 and the <italic>ahrC</italic>/SR1 complex and to investigate the structural requirements for efficient <italic>ahrC</italic>/SR1 pairing.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B shows that SR1 is composed of one large 5&#x02032; stem-loop (SL1) structure with a prominent bulge, a central small stem-loop SL2 and the terminator stem-loop SL3 separated by two single-stranded regions. Six out of seven regions of complementarity to <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA (B to G) are located in the 3&#x02032; 100&#x02009;nt of SR1. Secondary structure probing of labelled SR1 in complex with increasing concentrations of unlabelled <italic>ahrC</italic> and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B) revealed structural alterations in six of the seven complementary regions. In SR1, all positions in region C and G as well as a few positions in B, D, E and F were affected (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). In <italic>ahrC</italic>, alterations in regions C, E, F and G as well as additional alterations between regions D and E were found. Interestingly, structural changes over a stretch of &#x0223c;50&#x02009;nt were also observed upstream of region G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B left), although the <italic>ahrC</italic> SD sequence (nt 21 to 25) and the start codon remained unaffected indicating that binding of SR1 causes structural changes in the 5&#x02032; part of <italic>ahrC</italic>-mRNA, too.</p><p>Whereas for <italic>cis</italic>-encoded antisense RNAs from plasmids, phages and transposons, a number of studies have been performed to elucidate binding pathways and to determine structural requirements for the two contacting RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), little is known, so far, about the formation of initial contacts between trans-encoded sRNAs and their targets. Here, we show that a solely 78-nt long SR1 species spanning nt 109 to 186 is sufficient for efficient complex formation with <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA, i.e. the 5&#x02032; portion of SR1 is not needed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Generally, all SR1 species lacking the 5&#x02032; half of SL3 with region G or comprising a complete SL3 were significantly impaired in pairing with <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA. This might indicate that <italic>in vivo</italic> some factor &#x02014; most likely a protein or an RNase cutting within the loop of SL3 &#x02014; opens the terminator stem-loop to promote complex formation. Since <italic>in vivo</italic> only full-length SR1<sub>205</sub> can be observed (northern blots and 3&#x02032; RACE, 23), the involvement of an endoribonuclease is highly unlikely. The possibility that the RNA chaperone Hfq that binds upstream of the terminator stem-loop of SR1 is responsible for opening up this structure, can be eliminated, too (see below). Most probably, another, yet unknown RNA-binding protein is needed to open SL3.</p><p>Two lines of evidence show that the initial contact between SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA occurs at complementary region G of SR1: complex formation assays of truncated SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> pairs containing mutations and compensatory mutations in region G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) and translational <italic>ahrC</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene fusions with the same point mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, complex formation assays with SR1 mutants affected in regions C, D, E/F or a combination thereof and a <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion with regions E&#x02032;, F&#x02032; and G&#x02032; revealed a contribution of the other complementary regions to SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> pairing. In summary, since, (i) in the absence of region G, no efficient complex could form, (ii) in the presence of wild-type regions A to E, a 2-nt exchange within G inhibits pairing and (iii) in the presence of G, significant simultaneous alterations in regions C, E and F did affect complex formation, we can conclude, that region G is responsible for the initial contact between SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA, but the other complementary regions add to efficient antisense/target RNA pairing.</p><p>Region G&#x02032; in unpaired <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA is double-stranded with a bulged-out G at position 116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B left). Interestingly, only when this G and the neighboured C were replaced by a C and G (<italic>ahrC</italic><sub>88_G2</sub>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), the interaction with SR<sub>186_G2</sub> was restored indicating that it is crucial for the initial contact. As proposed above, some factor is needed to melt or open up region G in SR1, so that the two regions can interact. Our data suggest that pairing initiates at G, but for subsequent steps and stable complex formation, a contribution of the other complementary regions B to F is needed. This is reminiscent of the binding pathway of the antisense/sense RNA pair CopA/CopT involved in regulation of plasmid R1 replication [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>)]. Here, binding starts with the interaction of two single-stranded kissing loops and, afterwards, a second region is needed to overcome the torsional stress and to propagate the helix. By contrast, for the antisense/sense RNA pair RNAIII/RNAII of plasmid pIP501, the simultaneous interaction of two complementary loop pairs was found to be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In other cases, a single-stranded region and a loop form the first complex [e.g. Sok/hok of plasmid R1 or RNA-OUT/RNA-IN of transposon IS10, reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>)].</p><p>For many trans-encoded sRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the RNA chaperone Hfq has been shown to be required for either stabilization of the sRNA or/and efficient duplex formation with the target RNA (see the Introduction section). Previous experiments have demonstrated that Hfq does not stabilize SR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This report shows that although <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Hfq binds both SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA, it is not able to promote complex formation between SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This is in agreement with data obtained for the RNAIII/<italic>spa</italic> interaction in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, for which Hfq was found to be dispensable for RNAIII/<italic>spa</italic> complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">16</xref>). The fact that no requirement for Hfq was observed in the RatA/<italic>txpA</italic> system of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), too, suggests that in Gram-positive bacteria Hfq might not be needed for sRNA/target RNA interaction or, alternatively, that another RNA chaperone may fulfil the function of Hfq. One candidate might be HBsu, for which RNA-binding activity was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>However, our previous observation that the levels of the secondary targets of SR1, <italic>rocABC</italic> and <italic>rocDEF</italic> mRNA, were increased 3- to 6-fold in an <italic>hfq</italic> knockout strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) raised the question on the role of this chaperone in the SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> system. Suprisingly, <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA proved to be not translated in a <italic>B. subtilis hfq</italic> knockout strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This indicates that Hfq is required for efficient translation of <italic>ahrC</italic>, possibly by opening up some secondary structures that otherwise inhibit binding of the 30S initiation complex. This is supported by the finding of one Hfq-binding site (5&#x02032; AAAUA) immediately upstream of the <italic>ahrC</italic> ribosome-binding site (RBS). Interestingly, for <italic>E. coli rpoS</italic> mRNA it has been also shown that Hfq is essential for efficient translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In contrast to <italic>ahrC</italic>, the binding of Hfq to SR1 does not seem to play a role in this context. The fact that Hfq binds upstream of six out of seven SR1 regions complementary to <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA supports the failure of Hfq to promote complex SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> formation. However, we cannot exclude that Hfq binding might be important for the interaction of SR1 with other, still unidentified target mRNAs.</p><p>Based on a series of translational <italic>ahrC</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusions, the dispensability of the <italic>ahrC</italic> SD sequence for pairing with SR1 and <italic>in vitro</italic> translation data with chimeric <italic>ahrC/sodB</italic> RNAs, we suggested previously that SR1 might affect <italic>ahrC</italic> translation at a post-initiation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, the structural alterations found in the <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA downstream from the SD sequence in the presence of increasing amounts of SR1 prompted us to re-evaluate our previous data using a toeprinting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Both SR1<sub>WT</sub> and SR1<sub>186</sub>, but not two heterologous RNAs, were able to inhibit binding of the 30S ribosomal subunit and formation of a ternary complex with 30S and tRNA<sub>f</sub><sup>Met</sup> on full-length <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA. These results &#x02014; together with the structure probing data &#x02014; demonstrate that binding of SR1 induces structural changes in a &#x0223c;65-nt long stretch of <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA between SD sequence and complementary region G that eventually inhibit formation of the 30S initiation complex. Since the 30S ribosomal subunit covers 54&#x02009;nt, i.e. 35 (&#x000b1;2) nt upstream and 19&#x02009;nt downstream from the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), the 5&#x02032; part of the SR1-induced structural alterations of <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA coincides exactly with this region. The analysis of the G region mutant SR1<sub>186_G2</sub> in the toeprinting assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C) corroborated that this region is involved in the first contact between SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA and supported the specific basepairing interaction between both RNA molecules. The toeprinting results are not opposed to the previously observed translation inhibition of <italic>ahrC</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), as this inhibition can be explained by SR1-induced structural changes in the 5&#x02032; part of <italic>ahrC</italic> RNA, too. Therefore, we can conclude that the mechanism of action employed by SR1 is inhibition of translation initiation. This is the first case of a small regulatory RNA that binds &#x0223c;90&#x02009;nt downstream from the ribosome-binding site and interferes with translation initiation. In contrast, in the well-studied <italic>E. coli</italic> systems like RyhB/<italic>sodB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) or MicA<italic>/ompA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), the complementary regions between small RNA and mRNA are located upstream of or overlap the target SD sequence, making an effect on ribosome binding and hence, translation initiation, more plausible. Our results raise the question on the maximal distance between SD sequence and a binding region for a small RNA permitting to affect 30S subunit binding. Furthermore, in many <italic>E. coli</italic> cases the inhibition of translation initiation was accompanied by significantly decreased amounts of the target mRNA(s) [e.g. RyhB/<italic>sodB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) or SgrS<italic>/ptsG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>)] that was attributed to degradation of the unprotected target RNA by RNase E or of the complex by RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>ahrC</italic> levels were found to be independent of the presence or absence of SR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). To date, no RNase E has been found in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Although two novel endoribonucleases with homology to RNase E, RNase J1 and J2, were recently discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), it is unclear, whether they fulfil the role of the main endoribonucleases as it does RNase E in Gram-negative bacteria.</p><p>In the few sense/antisense RNA systems, where calculations of the amount of both interacting species were performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), an at least 10-fold excess of the inhibitory small RNA over its target was determined. Here, the amount of SR1 in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> grown in complex medium was found to increase upon entry into stationary phase from 15&#x02013;20 to 250 molecules per cell. This is much lower than the 4500 molecules measured for OxyS under oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), but still in the range of RNAIII of plasmid pIP501 (&#x0223c;1000 molecules). Since we could not detect <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA in northern blots under any growth condition, its amount must be significantly lower than 15 molecules/cell ensuring at least a 15-fold excess of SR1.</p><p>The analysis of the SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA interaction yielded three major issues, which might be important for sRNA/target RNA systems in general: First, whereas the major mechanism of action of trans-encoded sRNAs reported in Gram-negative bacteria is inhibition of translation initiation by direct binding to the RBS or 5&#x02032; of it, the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> pair is first case, where translation initiation is prevented by binding of the sRNA &#x0223c;90&#x02009;nt downstream from the RBS. Second, while all sRNA/target RNA pairs studied so far comprise at the most two complementary regions, the SR1/<italic>ahrC</italic> pair is the first case with seven complementary regions between inhibitor and target RNA, and the major contribution of one region as well as the minor, but measurable contribution of five of the other regions has been demonstrated. Third, whereas in <italic>E. coli</italic>, Hfq was required for either sRNA stabilization or promotion of complex formation with the target RNA, at least complex formation in Gram-positive bacteria does not seem to depend on Hfq. The search for and analysis of other SR1 targets will reveal whether this sRNA exerts its function(s) by the same or alternative mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm439_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm439_nar-00927-r-2007-File002.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Eckhard Birch-Hirschfeld, Jena, for synthesis of the oligodeoxyribonucleotides and Poul Valentin-Hansen, Odense, for kindly sending us the <italic>E. coli</italic> strains for overexpression of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Hfq.
