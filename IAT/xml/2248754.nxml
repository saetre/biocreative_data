TGF-beta represses transcription of pulmonary surfactant protein-B gene in lung epithelial cells. Repression is mediated by SMAD3 through interactions with NKX2.1 and FOXA1, two key transcription factors that are positive regulators of <italic>SpB</italic> transcription. In this study, we found that SMAD3 interacts through its MAD domains, MH1 and MH2 with NKX2.1 and FOXA1 proteins. The sites of interaction on NKX2.1 are located within the NH2 and COOH domains, known to be involved in transactivation function. In comparison, weaker interaction of FOXA1 winged helix, and the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domains was documented with SMAD3. Both <italic>in vitro</italic> studies and <italic>in vivo</italic> ChIP assays show that interaction of SMAD3 MH1 and MH2 domains with NKX2.1 and FOXA1 results in reduced binding of NKX2.1 and FOXA1 to their cognate DNA-binding sites, and diminished promoter occupancy within the <italic>SpB</italic> promoter. Thus, these studies reveal for the first time a mechanism of TGF-beta-induced <italic>SpB</italic> gene repression that involves interactions between specific SMAD3 domains and the corresponding functional sites on NKX2.1 and FOXA1 transcription factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transforming growth factors-beta (TGF-beta) are a large family of secreted polypeptides with established roles in nearly every aspect of cellular physiology, pathology and tumorigenesis. In the lung, as in other organs, TGF-beta regulates tissue morphogenesis and cellular differentiation through regulation of target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Although regulation of gene expression by TGF-beta is complex, from a simplistic perspective, the binding of TGF-beta ligand to its receptors, T&#x003b2;RII and T&#x003b2;RI initiates a cascade of phosphorylation events that eventually result in nuclear translocation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 subsequent to their association with SMAD4. To date, much has been elucidated regarding the mechanisms of TGF-beta-induced gene activation. However, TGF-beta also inhibits gene transcription and comparatively much less is known about the latter mechanism.</p><p>Surfactant protein-B, SPB is a protein constituent of pulmonary surfactant, a surface-active material that stabilizes lung alveoli and is therefore critical to air breathing. As a key component of pulmonary surfactant, SPB is absolutely required for postnatal survival. In humans, inherited SPB deficiency is a lethal condition that requires lung transplantation. Targeted inactivation of <italic>SpB</italic> in mouse also causes perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Even reduced SPB perturbs lung function in both humans and transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Increased bioactive TGF-beta is associated with a number of pathological lung conditions, including interstitial lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). TGF-beta was found to inhibit the expression of <italic>SpB</italic>, but the precise mechanism remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Expression of <italic>SpB</italic> is dependent on the activity of a number of transcription factors. The role of the homeodomain transcription factor NKX2.1, (otherwise known as TTF-1 or TEBP) is central, illustrated by the observation that in <italic>Nkx2.1</italic>(&#x02013;/&#x02013;) embryonic lungs <italic>SpB</italic> gene activity is entirely lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Many signaling cues during lung development or in response to injury are mediated through physical and functional interactions of NKX2.1 with other nuclear factors. These interactions modulate the activity of NKX2.1 on its target gene promoters. For example, NKX2.1 interacts with the nuclear factors, TAZ (a transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding domain) and NFI (nuclear Factor I) to activate transcription from the lung-specific <italic>SpC</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). TAZ interacts with the amino-terminal domain of NKX2.1 increasing its transcription activation properties. The 5&#x02032; flanking region of the <italic>SpB</italic> gene also includes binding sites for members of the forkhead/winged helix transcription factors, FOXA1/FOXA2. In transient transfection studies, the latter binding sites were found to be critical for <italic>SpB</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Compound genetic disruption of Foxa1/Foxa2 loci eliminates epithelial cell differentiation and consequently results in the absence of <italic>SpB</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we showed that TGF-beta repression of <italic>SpB</italic> transcription in lung epithelial cells occurs through T&#x003b2;RI signaling and mediated by SMAD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). No evidence for direct binding of SMAD3 to the <italic>SpB</italic> promoter was found, and a DNA-binding mutant of SMAD3 effectively repressed <italic>SpB</italic>, eliminating direct DNA-binding requirement. Mutations within a 70 bp domain of <italic>SpB</italic> promoter that includes binding sites for NKX2.1 and FOXA proteins eliminated SMAD3-dependent repression of transcription. Further studies suggested interactions between SMAD3 and both NKX2.1 and FOXA1 proteins. We therefore proposed that SMAD3 interactions with NKX2.1 and FOXA1 underlie the molecular basis for TGF-beta-induced repression of <italic>SpB</italic> transcription. In the present study, we have elucidated the precise nature and the sites of interaction between SMAD3 and the two transcription factors NKX2.1 and FOXA1 using a number of experimental approaches. The sum of the results show that interaction of SMAD3 occurs through the MH1 and MH2 domains of SMAD3 and lead to inhibition of NKX2.1 and FOXA1 binding to their cognate sites within the <italic>SpB</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Complete coding region of rat <italic>Foxa1</italic>, rat <italic>Foxa2</italic> and human <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> were PCR amplified from cDNA clones (a gift from Dr Costa, University of Illinois at Chicago) verified by sequencing and cloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites (for <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Foxa2</italic>) or EcoRI and HindIII sites (for <italic>Nkx2.1</italic>), in translational frame with VP16 coding region of pVp16 vector (Clontech, CA, USA), and designated <italic>Vp16-Foxa1, Vp16-Foxa2</italic> and <italic>Vp16-Nkx2.1</italic> respectively. <italic>Vp16-Foxa1N, Vp16-Foxa1DB and Vp16-Foxa1C</italic> were constructed by cloning the specific <italic>Foxa1</italic> fragments that encodes amino acids 1&#x02013;137, amino acids 138&#x02013;317 and amino acids 318&#x02013;466, into EcoRI and BamHI sites of <italic>pVp16</italic>.

Using MLE15 nuclear extracts, we examined the binding of nuclear proteins to a 22 bp oligonucleotide representing the cognate-binding site for NKX2.1 (Materials and Methods section). This analysis showed the formation of at least four nucleoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Panel A, Lane 1). Incubation of the nuclear extract with an unlabeled oligonucleotide that has identical DNA sequence to that of the probe competed effectively for the formation of the four complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Panel A, Lane 2), whereas inclusion of a monoclonal anti-NKX2.1 antibody in the reaction mixture supershifted a complex as designated by the arrow (Lane 3). Inclusion of a bacterially expressed and purified GST-fused-SMAD3 protein competed, in a dose-dependent manner for the formation of all four complexes, but particularly the larger complexes (lanes 5&#x02013;7). Importantly in the control reaction, 3.5 &#x000b5;g of GST protein alone had no impact on the formation of any of the four complexes (Lane 4). These results clearly show that GST-SMAD3 protein interferes, in a dose-dependent manner, with the binding of NKX2.1 to its target sequences under <italic>in vitro</italic> settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>EMSA analysis of SMAD3 interactions with NKX2.1 (Panel <bold>A</bold>) and FOXA1 (Panel <bold>B</bold>).

SMAD3 interaction with the latter two functional domains of FOXA1 was weak when compared to the full-length protein, suggesting that overlapping domains may be required for optimized interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Physical interactions between SMAD3 and functional domains of FOXA1.

These are the domains in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus (amino acids 1&#x02013;130), also known as the MH1 domain, the linker domain represented by amino acids 130&#x02013;230 (LNKR) and the COOH-terminus or MH2 domain (amino acids 230&#x02013;424). These constructs were then used in a mammalian A549 cell two-hybrid assay with either GAL4-fused-NKX2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, Panel A) or GAL4-fused-FOXA1 expression constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> Panel A). The results showed significant interactions between full-length NKX2.1 and the MH1 domain of SMAD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The interaction between NKX2.1 and the SMAD3 MH2 domain did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.083). Little if any interaction was observed with the SMAD3 LNKR domain (<italic>P</italic> = 0.25). Furthermore, EMSA with GST-fused domains of SMAD3 verified the two-hybrid assay findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, Panel B). Consistent with the two-hybrid results, robust interaction was found between NKX2.1 and the SMAD3 MH1 domain. Weak interaction of NKX2.1 with the MH2 domain was also documented. However, no interaction was observed between LNKR domain of SMAD3 and NKX2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, Panel B, Lane 8). In contrast to the interactions with NKX2.1, significant interaction with FOXA1 occurred mainly with the SMAD3 MH2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The two-hybrid assay showed only weak interactions between FOXA1 and either SMAD3 MH1 or LNKR peptides. However, GST-fused-MH1 competed effectively against FOXA1 binding to its target DNA, either indicating the inherent differences between the two techniques or suggesting more complex interactions between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, Panel B). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Localization of SMAD3 functional domains, which interact with NKX2.1.

A <italic>Smad3-Flag</italic> expression construct was transfected into H441 cells, which exhibit endogenous <italic>Foxa1</italic> and <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> gene expression, and the cellular extracts were used for co-IP with mouse anti-FLAG, anti-NKX2.1 and anti-FOXA1 antibodies. We used three antibodies to minimize the possibility of false-negative results stemming from their intrinsic properties that may interfere with protein&#x02013;protein interactions in co-IP studies. The immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved by gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis using rabbit-derived antibodies to the three proteins. The results are summarized in the table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. Anti-FLAG, as expected, immunoprecipitated SMAD3 but also FOXA1, indicating measurable physical interactions by this antibody between SMAD3 and FOXA1, but not NKX2.1. Anti-NKX2.1 immunoprecipitated a complex that included only NKX2.1 and FOXA1, but not SMAD3. Finally, only FOXA1 was brought down by anti-FOXA1 antibodies, even though SMAD3&#x02013;FOXA1 and NKX2.1&#x02013;FOXA1 intracellular associations were established by anti-FLAG and anti-NKX2.1 co-IP results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, failure of anti-FOXA1 to co-immunoprecipitate NKX2.1 or SMAD3, a false-negative result, may be explained by an intrinsic property of this antibody (e.g. its epitope specificity may interfere with protein&#x02013;protein interactions). Similarly, it is possible that absence of demonstrable NKX2.1&#x02013;SMAD3 interactions by co-IP may simply be related to specific aspects of the antibodies used. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Co-immunoprecipitation of FOXA1, SMAD3 and NKX2.1.

Chromatin fractions were prepared from MLE15 cells treated with and without 10 ng/ml of human recombinant TGF-beta and immunoprecipitated using an anti-NKX2.1 monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal anti-FOXA1 antibody.

We found robust interactions between SMAD3 and two lung-enriched transcription factors, NKX2.1 and FOXA1, both of which are known positive regulators of <italic>SpB</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The sites of interactions with SMAD3 were identified as the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of NKX2.1 and principally the winged helix DNA-binding domain of FOXA1. SMAD3 interacted with these proteins through its MAD homology domains MH1 and MH2. Although interactions between SMADs and homeodomain proteins of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic> have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), NKX2.1 is the first mammalian member of this family whose interactions with SMAD3 result in repression of gene expression.</p><p>SMADs are intracellular effectors of TGF-beta signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In the lung, TGF-beta/SMAD signaling figures importantly in normal development as well as disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In addition to activating batteries of genes (e.g. fibronectin, collagen), TGF-beta also represses a number of genes including <italic>SpB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Although TGF-beta signaling is mediated through both <italic>Smad2</italic> and <italic>Smad3</italic>, to date, in the handful of reported studies in which TGF-beta acts as an inhibitor, <italic>Smad3</italic> has been identified as the key mediating mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Consistent with these studies, we found SMAD3 to mediate TGF-beta-induced <italic>SpB</italic> gene repression in lung epithelial cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>SMAD3 is composed of two conserved functional domains, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal MH1 and the COOH-terminal MH2 domains, separated by a non-conserved linker domain (LNKR). In the current study, the two-hybrid assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> identified both MH1 and MH2 domains of SMAD3 as sites of interaction with NKX2.1 and FOXA1, respectively. These results were further verified by the EMSA studies shown in the same Figures (Panels B). Consistent with the two-hybrid assay results, only GST-fused SMAD3, MH1 and MH2 domains and not LNKR inhibited FOXA1 and NKX2.1 DNA binding. The MH1 domain is involved in DNA binding and nuclear translocation but also negatively regulates the functions of the MH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The MH2 domain is critical for homo- and hetero-oligomerization of SMADs, as well as the recognition and phosphorylation by type I receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Interactions between transcription factors and SMAD3 through the MH2 or MH1 domains have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). By far the majority of the reported cases lead to cooperativity and positive regulation of gene expression by TGF-beta. In the few cases in which TGF-beta, through SMAD3 represses gene expression, the sites of interaction were localized to either MH1 or MH2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>We also determined the specific domains of NKX2.1 and FOXA1 with which SMAD3 interacts. The sites of interaction with SMAD3 were found to be localized to the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of NKX2.1. Little to no interaction was observed with the NKX2.1 HD domain. Both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of NKX2.1 have been found to affect transactivation function of NKX2.1 in target gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The results of the mammalian two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) are consistent with the latter findings. These domains alone were able to render transactivation function to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and activate transcription from the GAL4-responsive reporter with VP16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The HD of NKX2.1 had no transactivation function. Despite these observations, interactions of SMAD3 with NKX2.1 resulted in an overall reduction of DNA-binding affinity, as assessed by EMSA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Thus, TGF-beta-induced, SMAD3-mediated repression of <italic>SpB</italic> may affect not only DNA binding, but also transactivation function of NKX2.1.</p><p>FOXA1and FOXA2 proteins share 93% amino acid homology in the winged helix DNA-binding domain and bind to the same DNA consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The winged helix DNA-binding domain is the site of protein&#x02013;DNA interactions and may also contain the nuclear localization signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The FOXA proteins also include conserved NH2- and COOH-terminal transcriptional activation domains that are involved in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Regions II and III sequences within the COOH-terminal domain are essential in transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In the current study, the DNA binding, winged helix domain of FOXA1 was found to be the principal site of interaction with SMAD3. No statistically significant interaction was measurable between SMAD3 and either the COOH- or NH2-terminal domains of FOXA1. Interaction with SMAD3 reduced the DNA-binding affinity of FOXA1 for its target sequences on the <italic>SpB</italic> promoter. Interactions between other forkhead/winged helix family members, FOXH1 and FOXO with both SMAD2 and SMAD3 have also been documented, although the sites of interaction remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>To examine the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of our findings, we used two approaches. First, using antibodies to each of the three proteins, we showed that complexes consisting of NKX2.1, FOXA1 and SMAD3 can be co-immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the antibodies failed to demonstrate direct NKX2.1&#x02013;SMAD3 interactions by co-IP. We propose that this may be due to specific intrinsic properties of the antibodies used. An alternative conclusion is that physical interactions between SMAD3 and NKX2.1 occur only through FOXA1. This possibility however is unlikely in the face of the internally consistent data from the stringent analyses conducted in multiple two-hybrid and EMSA assays with full length and fragments of all three proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These latter studies firmly established direct and robust physical interactions between the COOH- and NH2-domains of NKX2.1 and SMAD3.</p><p>In a second approach, ChIP analysis showed that TGF-beta decreased promoter occupancy on the <italic>SpB</italic> gene for both NKX2.1 and FOXA1, suggesting that TGF-beta signaling, through SMAD3 destabilizes the binding of NKX2.1 and FOXA1 to their target DNA sites. A number of mechanisms may be invoked to explain the latter findings. The possibility that SMAD3 may bind and displace NKX2.1 or FOXA1 (competitive inhibition) does not appear likely for two reasons: First, EMSA analysis has failed to identify SMAD3 as a component of nucleoprotein complexes found on the <italic>SpB</italic> promoter (data not shown). Second, and consistent with the latter, a SMAD3 mutant lacking the DNA-binding domain is equally competent in inhibiting <italic>SpB</italic> transcription as the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Therefore, we favor a model in which interactions between SMAD3 and either NKX2.1 or FOXA1 occurs independently of the DNA thereby preventing the binding of the latter transcription factors to their target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Although examples of TGF-beta-induced, SMAD3-mediated gene repression are few, a number of findings are consistent with the results of our study in this report. For example, TGF-beta-inhibition of myogenic differentiation is mediated by SMAD3 interaction with MyoD and myogenin. SMAD3 interacts directly with the HLH domains of MyoD or myogenin and interferes with heterodimerization of the latter with their obligatory partner E12/47, thus decreasing their binding to their DNA target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>A hypothetical model of DNA-independent inhibition of NKX2.1 and FOXA1 by SMAD3.

(<bold>B</bold>) Treatment with TGF-beta activates SMAD3, which in turn binds through its MH domains to NKX2.1 and FOXA1 and prevents their binding to the <italic>SpB</italic> promoter.

In addition, many injuries to the lung are characterized by dysregulated TGF-beta signaling. The impact of TGF-beta is manifested in a variety of ways that range from interstitial fibrosis to interruption of alveolar development. Although the overall pathway of TGF-beta signaling may appear simple, physical and functional interactions between its components, such as SMAD3 and other key transcriptional regulators, such as NKX2.1 provide the means for a profound degree of signaling specificity and versatility. Undoubtedly, characterization of the interactions between SMAD3 and NKX2.1 or FOXA1 will aid our understanding of the specificity with which TGF-beta signaling functions in various physiological contexts and therefore its impact on both normal and pathological processes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>Research supported by NIH (NHLBI) and the Hastings Foundation.
