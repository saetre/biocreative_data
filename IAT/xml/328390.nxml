Sequencing of this clone has revealed that the insertion element is located between the promoter and structural gene for formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fapy-DNA glycosylase). An overproducing clone of Fapy-DNA glycosylase complements the original mutM strain that had been isolated after EMS mutagenesis. Thus, we conclude that MutM is actually Fapy-DNA glycosylase. mutM has previously been characterized as a mutator strain that leads specifically to G.C----T.A transversions. This in vivo characterization correlates well with the mutagenic potential of one of the lesions Fapy-DNA glycosylase removes, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanine (8-OxodG).</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0147-a" xlink:role="3631"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3629"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3630"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3631"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00093-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3632"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
