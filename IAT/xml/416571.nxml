Therefore, these chemokine receptors have become important targets in the search for anti-HIV agents.

The U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 cell line reliably supported HIV-1 infection of diverse laboratory-adapted strains and primary isolates with varying coreceptor usage (R5, X4 and R5/X4) and allows to investigate the antiviral efficacy of combined CCR5 and CXCR4 blockade. The antiviral effects recorded in these cells with the CCR5 antagonist SCH-C and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 were similar to those noted in the single CCR5- or CXCR4-transfected U87.CD4 cells. Furthermore, the combination of both inhibitors blocked the infection of all evaluated HIV-1 strains and isolates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Thus, the U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 cell line should be useful in the evaluation of CCR5 and CXCR4 antagonists with therapeutic potential and combinations thereof.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>After binding to the cellular CD4 receptor, HIV needs to bind one of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 to actually infect its target cells. CCR5 is the main coreceptor for R5 (M-tropic) viruses that are mainly isolated from patients in the early (asymptomatic) stage of HIV-infection. The more pathogenic X4 viruses that use CXCR4 as their major coreceptor often emerge in HIV-infected persons in a later stage of disease progression towards AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>These chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 belong to the class of seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors and their natural ligands are key players in the recruitment of immune cells to sites of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, chemokine receptors, and especially CXCR4, are also implicated in several diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]., allergic airway disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Important ligands for CCR5 are the &#x003b2;-chemokines 'regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted' (RANTES), and the 'macrophage inflammatory proteins' MIP-1&#x003b1; and MIP-1&#x003b2;. The chemokine MIP-1&#x003b1; occurs in two highly related isoforms, designated LD78&#x003b1; and LD78&#x003b2;, and although they only differ in three amino acids, the LD78&#x003b2; isoform is much more potent as a CCR5 agonist than LD78&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, LD78&#x003b2; is the most effective chemokine in inhibiting CCR5-dependent HIV replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and in human macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Unlike CCR5, the CXCR4 receptor has only one known ligand, the &#x003b1;-chemokine 'stromal cell derived factor' (SDF)-1. Since the natural CCR5 and CXCR4 ligands and peptides derived thereof are capable to block the entry of R5 and X4 HIV-1 viruses respectively, small-molecule CCR5 and CXCR4 antagonists would be most attractive new anti-HIV drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The search for chemokine receptor antagonists has already led to the discovery of several compounds with potent antiviral activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, such as the CCR5 antagonists, TAK-779 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and SCH-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The low molecular weight compound AMD3100 (1,1'-[1,4-phenylenebis-(methylene)]-bis-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclo-tetradecane), the lead compound of the bicyclams, shows antiviral activity in the nanomolar concentration range against a wide range of X4 and even dual tropic R5/X4 HIV-1 strains in PBMCs, through specific binding to CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As AMD3100 does not interact with any chemokine receptor other than CXCR4 and as the compound does not trigger any response by itself, it can be considered as a highly specific CXCR4 antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It was demonstrated that two aspartate residues at positions 171 and 262 of CXCR4 are crucial for the high-affinity binding of AMD3100 to CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The compound SCH 351125, also called SCH-C, is an oxime-piperidine compound with potent activity against R5 HIV-1 strains. As shown by multiple receptor binding and signal transduction assays, SCH-C is a specific CCR5 antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Both AMD3100 and SCH-C have shown <italic>in vivo </italic>antiviral efficacy in separate clinical studies by reducing the plasma viremia in HIV-1-infected persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These studies validated the chemokine coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 as clinical drug targets in the treatment of R5 and X4 HIV-1 infections, respectively. However, it is assumed that the combined use of a CCR5 and a CXCR4 antagonist will be necessary to achieve profound HIV inhibition and subsequently viral load decrease in HIV-infected persons.</p><p>The availibity of stable and reliable <italic>in vitro </italic>models is a prerequisite for the successful setup of an accurate screening program for chemokine receptor antagonists. Here, we have developed a double-transfected astroglioma cell line expressing both CCR5 and CXCR4 in addition to the cellular CD4 receptor, and we demonstrated its usefulness as a tool to evaluate CCR5 and CXCR4 antagonists.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Establishment of the U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 cell line</title><p>Because of its complete lack of endogenous CCR5 or CXCR4 expression, we used the U87.CD4 cell line as a starting point to create a cell line highly suitable for the evaluation of the anti-HIV activity of potential CCR5 and CXCR4 antagonists. The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXR4 were stably transfected into the U87.CD4 cells using FuGENE 6 Tranfection Reagent as described in Materials and Methods.</p><p>After the transfection and selection procedure, we evaluated CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 expression at the cell surface with mAb staining. We compared these data with the expression of the receptors on U87.CD4 cells transfected with either CCR5 or CXCR4 alone, that we previously used for the antiviral evaluation of CCR5 or CXCR4 antagonists. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, all three cell lines highly expressed the primary HIV-1 receptor CD4. In addition, U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 cells expressed CCR5 and CXCR4 at their surface with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of 55 and 142, respectively. Moreover, more then 95% of the cells are CCR5<sup>+</sup>/CXCR4<sup>+ </sup>double positive. The U87.CD4.CCR5 and U87.CD4.CXCR4 single-transfected cells expressed CCR5 or CXCR4, respectively, but completely lacked the other HIV-1 coreceptor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow cytometric analysis of the membrane expression of CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 in the U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 double-transfected cell line (3 panels, left column) and in the single-transfected U87.CD4.CCR5 cell line (3 panels, central column) and U87.CD4.CXCR4 cell line (3 panels, right column).

We compared their susceptibility to these HIV-1 strains with the infectability of three CCR5-transfected T-cell lines, i.e. the SupT1.CCR5, MOLT-4.CCR5 and Jurkat.CCR5 cells. After 5 days of infection, a strong cytopathic effect was visible microscopically for NL4.3 and HE but not for BaL in the SupT1.CCR5, MOLT-4.CCR5 and Jurkat.CCR5 cells (data not shown). The failure of these cell lines to support R5 HIV-1 infection was quite unexpected, since they express high amounts of CCR5 on their cell surface and in addition, they afford chemokine-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>fluxes and chemotaxis through this receptor. On the other hand, the R5 strain BaL induced strong cytopathicity in U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 cells, as well as the X4 strain NL4.3 and the R5/X4 strain HE.</p><p>We also compared the infectability of the U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 cells and the antiviral activity of the chemokine receptor inhibitors SCH-C and AMD3100 with that of the single-transfected cell lines U87.CD4.CCR5 and U87.CD4.CXCR4. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> presents the inhibitory effects of the CCR5 antagonist SCH-C, the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, and the CC-chemokines RANTES and LD78&#x003b2; and the CXC-chemokine SDF-1 on HIV-1 replication in the single-transfected cell lines. The 50% inhibitory concentration of SCH-C against replication of BaL in U87.CD4.CCR5 was 58 ng/ml whereas the IC<sub>50 </sub>value of the compound against HE was 0.4 ng/ml. Moreover, neither RANTES nor LD78&#x003b2; showed activity against BaL. Their IC<sub>50 </sub>values against HE were 200 ng/ml (RANTES) and 18 ng/ml (LD78&#x003b2;) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). AMD3100 strongly inhibited the NL4.3 and HE infection in U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells with IC<sub>50 </sub>values that were similar for both strains (3.6 and 3.3 ng/ml respectively). However, SDF-1 at concentrations up to 1000 ng/ml had no blocking effect on the NL4.3 and HE HIV-1 replication in these cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Inhibitory effects of SCH-C and AMD3100 on HIV-1 replication in U87.CD4.CXCR4 and U87.CD4.CCR5 cells.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center" colspan="5"><bold>IC<sub>50</sub><sup>a </sup>(ng/ml)</bold><break/></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center" colspan="3"><bold>U87.CD4.CCR5 cells</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells</bold></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>Virus strain</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Co-receptor Use</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>SCH-C</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>RANTES</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>LD78&#x003b2;</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>AMD3100</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>SDF-1</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>BaL</bold></td><td align="center">R5</td><td align="center">58</td><td align="center">&#x0003e;1000</td><td align="center">&#x0003e;1000</td><td align="center">NA</td><td align="center">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>NL4.3</bold></td><td align="center">X4</td><td align="center">NA</td><td align="center">NA</td><td align="center">NA</td><td align="center">3.6</td><td align="center">&#x0003e;1000</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>HE</bold></td><td align="center">R5/X4</td><td align="center">0.4</td><td align="center">200</td><td align="center">18</td><td align="center">3.3</td><td align="center">&#x0003e;1000</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a </sup>Effect of AMD3100 and SCH-C and the chemokines SDF-1, RANTES and LD78&#x003b2; on the replication of laboratory HIV-1 strains BaL, NL4.3 and HE.

The IC<sub>50 </sub>for the combination (ratio 1:1) of SCH-C and AMD3100 was 102 ng/ml.

The coreceptor phenotype of each of these viral isolates was determined using the single-transfected U87.CD4.CCR5 and U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells. The R5 isolates completely failed to infect the U87.CD4.CXCR4 cells, whereas the X4 isolate was unable to replicate in U87.CD4.CCR5 cells. U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 cells were inoculated with the viral isolates in the presence or absence of SCH-C and/or AMD3100 at 1000 ng/ml each. After 5 days of infection, the virus-induced cytopathic effect was observed microscopically and the virus production was quantified in the supernatant using a viral p24 core Ag ELISA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Viral infection as assessed by both giant cell formation and p24 Ag production was detected with all clinical isolates used in this study. The p24 viral Ag concentrations ranged from approximately 3600 up to 50000 pg/ml, although the virus inoculum was carefully washed away after the first two days of infection. As could be expected, the infection of all R5 isolates (CI #6, #14, #15 and #19) was completely blocked by SCH-C at 1000 ng/ml. Only for CI #15 marginal residual p24 Ag production was detected in the presence of SCH-C, although no giant cell formation could be seen microscopically. The p24 viral Ag production by the X4 isolate CI #17 could be completely inhibited by AMD3100. Remarkably, AMD3100 also inhibited to some extent the viral replication of the pure R5 clinical isolates and, vice versa, SCH-C showed partial activity against the X4 isolate CI #17. The dual-tropic isolate CI #10 could only be partially blocked by SCH-C or AMD3100 alone. In contrast, the infection of the two other dual-tropic isolates, CI #16 and #18, was totally inhibited by AMD3100 and partially by SCH-C.

We have evaluated this new cell line for its sensitivity towards HIV-1 and chemokine-induced intracellular calcium mobilization and demonstrated its usefulness for the evaluation of new potential CCR5 and CXCR4 antagonists with potent antiviral activity.</p><p>We have selected the U87.CD4 cell line as the parental cell line because of its many advantages over other cell lines. U87.CD4 cells do not endogenously express CCR5 or CXCR4 on their surface. On the contrary, other indicator cell lines such as Hela, MAGI, GHOST and HOS cells endogenously express CXCR4 on their cell surface, and this could lead to false results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Also, chemokine receptor-transfected U87.CD4 cells proved to be highly convenient for the evaluation of the effect of chemokine receptor inhibitors on chemokine-induced intracellular calcium mobilization assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo3/AM, used to monitor the transient increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration, is well retained in these cells. Also, dye loading and washing procedures of these cells can easily be performed in the black-wall 96-well tissue culture plates, in contrast to non-adherent cells such as T-cell lines or PBMCs. Furthermore, U87.CD4 cells expressing CCR5 or CXCR4 have been commonly used for HIV replication assays and evaluation of antiviral compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Importantly, U87.CD4.CCR5 cells support infection of all evaluated R5 and R5/X4 HIV-1 (and HIV-2) strains and clinical isolates. In contrast, SupT1.CCR5, MOLT-4.CCR5 and Jurkat.CCR5 cells are easily infectable by X4 strains but, unexpectedly, not by R5 strains. CCR5- or CXCR4-transfected U87.CD4 cells are also widely used, and are even preferred over the MT-2 assay, to determine the coreceptor usage of HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although the MT-2 assay was useful in determining SI/NSI (syncytium versus non-syncytium inducing) phenotype of HIV variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], it has been documented that NSI viruses as defined in the MT-2 assay turned out to be SI when evaluated in primary T-cells, suggesting that viral isolates using CXCR4 could be missed in the MT-2 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 cells express both receptors on the cell surface as ascertained flow cytometrically and were able to elicit an increase in intracellular calcium concentration when stimulated with their corresponding ligands. Also, the inhibitory effects of the CCR5 antagonist SCH-C and of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 were similar in the double- and single-transfected cell lines. The U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 cell line provides the opportunity to simultaneously evaluate the CCR5 and CXCR4 antagonism of new compounds in one experiment by sequential addition of the different chemokines.</p><p>The double-transfected cell line could be infected with the laboratory strains BaL (R5), NL4.3 (X4) and HE (R5/X4). The antiviral potency of SCH-C and AMD3100 against the R5 strain BaL and the X4 strain NL4.3, respectively, was similar in these cells compared with their anti-HIV activity in the single-transfected cell lines. Moreover, their 50% inhibition concentrations against respectively R5 and X4 viruses in the single- and double-transfected cell lines were comparable with those obtained in PBMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, SCH-C or AMD3100 administered alone did not block the infection of the R5/X4 laboratory strain HE because this dual tropic strain can always escape via entry through the other non-targeted receptor. Yet, the combination of both compounds concentration-dependently blocked the replication of HE. Thus, the antiviral activity of the antagonist combination should be interpreted differently for the three laboratory HIV-1 strains. The activity against BaL is most likely solely due to the interaction of SCH-C with CCR5 and that against NL4.3 is established by binding of AMD3100 to CXCR4. In case of the R5/X4 strain HE both inhibitors play an essential role and showed additive activity.</p><p>In general, we noticed in the single-transfected cell lines that the 50% inhibition concentrations of the CCR5 inhibitor SCH-C and the chemokines RANTES and LD78&#x003b2; were always higher for inhibition of BaL than HE (&#x02265; 8-fold). Such HIV-1 strain-dependent variation in the antiviral activity of CCR5 inhibitors has previously also been described by other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. All these variations are presumably caused by the complex interaction between the HIV-1 envelope and the chemokine receptor CCR5 and the variation in the V3 loop and other envelope domains of the different HIV-1 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>We have demonstrated that the U87.CD4.CCR5.CXCR4 cells also support infection by 8 different HIV-1 clinical isolates with distinct coreceptor usage. All R5 isolates were completely blocked by the CCR5 antagonist SCH-C but not by AMD3100, while the X4 isolate CI #17 was completely inhibited by AMD3100 but not by SCH-C. A puzzling observation was that the R5 isolates CI #14, #15 and #19 were partially blocked by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 and the X4 isolate CI #17 seemed to be partially inhibited by the CCR5 antagonist SCH-C. As both compounds are highly specific, these phenomena could not be assigned to aspecific binding of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 to CCR5 or the CCR5 antagonist SCH-C to CXCR4, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Also, the pure X4 phenotype of CI #17 and the pure R5 phenotype of CI #14, #15 and #19 were unequivocally verified by viral replication assays in U87.CD4.CXCR4 and U87.CD4.CCR5 cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that this partial blocking of R5 viruses by AMD3100 and of X4 virus by SCH-C is caused by disturbance of the membrane colocalization patterns of the CD4 receptor and the appropriate coreceptor essential for HIV-1 entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Indeed, the binding of a small-molecule compound to a chemokine receptor may be assumed to form a rigid complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This may impede the fluidity of the membrane required for the actin-dependent receptor colocalization induced by gp120-CD4 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Finally, none of the dual-tropic isolates were completely blocked by SCH-C. On the other hand, two out of three R5/X4 isolates were completely blocked by AMD3100. These data are in line with previous data demonstrating that AMD3100 on its own is able to block the infection of R5/X4 isolates in PBMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Most importantly, HIV infection was always completely suppressed by the combination of the two receptor antagonists. These results are very promising because it has been postulated that a combination these antagonists is required to actually suppress HIV-1 infection. It has been observed that when persons with a homozygous 32 bp deletion, resulting in a lack of functional CCR5 receptors, become infected with HIV-1, disease progression towards AIDS is much faster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], which is probably due to the outgrowth of X4 viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Also, in the separate Phase II clinical studies with the two chemokine receptor antagonists, SCH-C and AMD3100, viruses that use the non-targeted receptor could still be detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Other groups have reported the combined use of different CCR5 and CXCR4 inhibitors as potent antiviral agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. These studies illustrate the need for combination therapy to treat infections with mixed virus isolates and multidrug resistant viruses and suggest further clinical follow-up of these observations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This new CD4<sup>+</sup>/CCR5<sup>+</sup>/CXCR4<sup>+ </sup>cell line described here is most valuable as a tool for high-throughput evaluation of new CCR5 and CXCR4 inhibitors and <italic>in vitro </italic>evaluation of their therapeutic potential in combination anti-HIV therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Viruses</title><p>The M-tropic (R5) strain BaL was obtained from the MRC (London, UK).

Puromycin selection (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) is started after 24 hours. We established a puromycin-resistant cell culture after 2 weeks. However, only 24% percent of the CCR5 and CXCR4 positive cells were double-positive (as determined by flow cytometry).
