L20 mRNA carries two L20-binding sites, the first folding into a pseudoknot and the second into an imperfect stem and loop. These two sites and the L20-binding site on 23S ribosomal RNA are recognized similarly using a single RNA-binding site located on one face of L20. In this work, using gel filtration and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) experiments, we first exclude the possibility that L20 forms a dimer, which would allow each monomer to bind one site of the mRNA. Secondly we show, using affinity purification and FCCS experiments, that only one molecule of L20 binds to the L20 mRNA despite the presence of two potential binding sites. Thirdly, using RNA chemical probing, we show that the two L20-binding sites are in interaction. This interaction provides an explanation for the single occupancy of the mRNA. The two interacting sites could form a single hybrid site or the binding of L20 to a first site may inhibit binding to the second. Models of regulation compatible with our data are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bacteria and phages have evolved extremely sophisticated mechanisms for adapting the level of gene expression to changes in growth condition or to specific needs at a given stage of their life cycle. Although transcription is the major level of regulation in these organisms, the number of genes shown to be regulated at the translational level has increased recently with the discovery of global translational regulators, small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Most of the translational controls in prokaryotes take place at the step of initiation through three widely different mechanisms relying on <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins, <italic>trans</italic>-acting RNAs (sRNAS) or <italic>cis</italic>-acting mRNA elements acting as direct sensors of the physical or chemical state of the cell (thermosensors or riboswitches).</p><p>Protein-mediated translational regulation is mainly negative, although phage studies have provided counterexamples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the vast majority of the characterised protein-mediated translational controls are feedback regulation loops: the protein binds to its own mRNA, thereby inhibiting its translation. This is the case for most ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) that are often synthesized from long operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In general, one cistron of the operon encodes a primary ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-binding protein that also binds to its own mRNA, thereby inhibiting its translation. The binding of this regulatory r-protein takes place at the translational operator, generally located close to the RBS of the first cistron. The inhibition of translation of the first cistron is transmitted downstream by translational coupling. Nomura and co-workers proposed that r-protein synthesis is coupled to that of rRNA: if rRNA synthesis increases, it titrates all free regulatory r-proteins causing a general derepression of r-protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). These authors also proposed that the regulatory r-proteins might recognize their rRNA- and mRNA-binding sites similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). One such example of mimicry is found in the <italic>E. coli spc</italic> operon, which is regulated by r-protein S8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The 3D structure of the S8 protein within the ribosome and associated with its operator clearly indicate that it recognizes its mRNA- and rRNA-binding sites in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>A more complicated case of mimicry is illustrated by the <italic>rpmI-rplT</italic> genes encoding the two r-proteins L35 and L20, respectively. L20 directly represses the translation of the L35 cistron, and indirectly that of its own cistron by translational coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). L20 binds to two distinct sites in its leader mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The first site is a pseudoknot formed by a long-range base-pairing interaction between two nucleotide sequences, one located far upstream in the leader mRNA and the other immediately adjacent to the L35 cistron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The second L20-binding site is an imperfect double-helical structure formed by base pairing of neighbouring nucleotide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Importantly, both sites are required for control but each site is apparently able to bind to L20 when the other is inactivated by mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Both L20-binding sites on the mRNA are recognized similarly to the helix 40-41 junction of 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Also, NMR footprinting experiments indicate that the same region of L20 is responsible for the interaction with the two mRNA and the rRNA sites, i.e. L20 has only one RNA-binding site allowing the recognition of the three RNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The presence of these two binding sites on the mRNA and only one binding site on the protein suggested either that L20 recognizes its mRNA as a dimer or that two monomeric L20 molecules bind independently to each of the mRNA sites. The present work investigates both the quaternary structure of L20 and the mechanism of its interaction with its own mRNA. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Analytic gel filtration</title><p>The apparent molecular weight of L20C-ter was analysed using a Superdex 75 HR (10/30 - Amersham Biosciences) on Waters FPLC.

The microscope was a Zeiss Axiovert 200 with a 700DCSXR dichroic mirror and an extra E700SP (both from Chroma Corp, Battlesborough NH) to eliminate the exciting infrared light from the scope output. The emission was measured using the 2 channel Alba Fluorescence Correlation Instrument from ISS, Inc (Champaign Il). The red and green emission were separated by a 565LP dichroic mirror and the red channel was outfitted with a 675/50 bandpass filter while the green channel had a 525/50 bandpass filter (Chroma, Corp) to further isolate the appropriate emission. The Alba detectors were low dark noise avalanche photodiodes.

The globular C-terminal domain is located at the surface of the large ribosomal subunit and binds to the junction between helices 40 and 41 of domain II of 23S rRNA (numbering of 23S rRNA domains is according to the diagram of the <italic>E. coli</italic> 23S rRNA secondary structure available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu">http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu</ext-link>). In contrast, the N-terminus of L20 is an extremely long extension that penetrates deeply in the core of the large ribosomal subunit contacting several quite distant sequences in domains I and II of 23S rRNA. In the subunit, the extension is alpha-helical, whereas it is unfolded when L20 is in solution isolated from the subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Interestingly, the N-terminal extension can also be found, when L20 is isolated, both under a folded and partially unfolded form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) indicating that the unfolded form is in equilibrium with the folded form that can be stabilized either by contacts with the rRNA or by crystal packing.</p><p>Prior work has shown that the isolated C-terminal globular domain is able to control the synthesis of L35 with a level of efficiency similar to that of the whole protein <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Moreover, the binding of the C-terminal domain of L20 to both of its mRNA sites is apparently indistinguishable from that of the whole protein as assayed either by L20-induced reverse transcriptase stops or by protection against diverse chemical probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). These results indicate that the N-terminal domain is not required for control. Therefore, to avoid the aggregation tendency of the full-length protein, we used exclusively the globular C-terminal domain of L20 (L20C-ter) in the following experiments.</p><p>We first measured the affinity with which the L20C-ter domain binds to wild-type or mutant operator RNAs using fluorescence anisotropy based titrations. Fluorescence anisotropy is proportional to the average rotational correlation time, which increases with size. In our experiments, we labelled L20C-ter with the Alexa488 fluorophore at relatively low pH, conditions under which only the N-terminal amine is reactive (see under Materials and Methods section). The different RNAs used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) were synthesised <italic>in vitro</italic> with T7 polymerase as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and titrated onto the fluorescently labelled L20C-ter. The increase in anisotropy as a function of increasing RNA was measured for the different RNAs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The wild-type operator RNA binds to L20C-ter with a Kd of 19&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We also measured the binding affinity of L20C-ter to 23S rRNA extracted from the 50S ribosomal subunit and found a Kd of 6&#x02009;nM, i.e. an affinity about three times higher than for the operator. Titration of L20C-ter with four different mutant operator RNAs bearing the nucleotide changes indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> yielded intriguing results. While mutations at only one of the two operator sites resulted in a limited effect on binding: no effect for AA to UU change at positions iris 74 and iris 75&#x02009;in site 1 or a 2-fold increase of the Kd for AA to UU change at positions iris 8 and iris 9&#x02009;in site 2, simultaneous mutation of both sites resulted in a 10-fold decrease in affinity. </p></sec><sec><title>L20C-ter forms a monomer in solution</title><p>As mentioned above, regulation might be explained if L20 dimerizes with each monomer binding to one L20-binding site on the mRNA. We thus investigated the association state of L20C-ter in absence of operator RNA with two different sets of experiments.</p><p>We first used gel filtration on an analytical Superdex 75 HR column. The elution profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) clearly shows that in the concentration range used, L20C-ter behaves as a 6.5&#x02009;kDa protein which corresponds well to the predicted molecular weight of the isolated domain, which is of 6.8&#x02009;kDa (with the N-terminal methionine). </p><p>We also probed the quaternary structure of L20C-ter with a more reliable method working at equilibrium. We performed Two-Photon Excitation Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (TPE-FCS) and Fluorescence Cross Correlation Spectroscopy (TPE-FCCS) on two fluorescently labelled derivatives of L20C-ter, L20C-ter-Alexa488 (green dye detected in channel 2) and L20C-ter-Atto647 (red dye detected in channel 1). We performed FCS measurements on a solution containing both L20C-ter-Alexa488 and L20C-ter-Atto647, each at a nominal concentration of 150&#x02009;nM. The FCS methods measure the fluorescence fluctuations due to the diffusion of single fluorescent molecules in a small volume (calibrated to be 0.1 fl) excited by a laser beam. The results are expressed as an autocorrelation function, which is related to the probability of finding a molecule in the excited volume at time &#x003c4;, given it was there at time &#x003c4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0. Because, the molecule remains in the excited volume a limited time, the autocorrelation function decreases as &#x003c4; increases. The slower the diffusion, the longer the molecule remains in the excited volume, which shifts the correlation function to longer times. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows the autocorrelation curves of L20C-ter-Alexa488 (CH2, open symbols) and L20C-ter-Atto647 (CH1, dots). Adequate analysis of these profiles required two diffusion times (see under Materials and Methods section). For the L20C-ter labelled with the red dye, we recovered a diffusion coefficient of 164&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/s that accounted for the diffusion properties of 83.5% of the molecules, and 16.5% of a slow component, &#x0223c;10&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/s, that likely corresponds to some aggregated protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). For the L20C-ter labelled with the green dye, we recovered a diffusion coefficient of 176&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/s that accounted for 93.3% of the molecules, indicating that this protein preparation had a very low degree of aggregation. The expected diffusion coefficient for a spherical protein of 6&#x02009;kDa, is 167&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/s, quite close to the values recovered from the analysis of the data. The concentration of the two proteins in solution can be calculated from the amplitude of the autocorrelation functions at time zero. Since L20C-ter exhibits a tendency to adhere to the microscope slide (even in presence of 1&#x02009;mg/ml BSA), the actual solution concentrations are lower than the nominal 150&#x02009;nM. For the L20C-ter-Atto647, the concentration was found to be 115&#x02009;nM, whereas for the L20C-ter-Alexa488, it was significantly lower, 66&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). </p><p>Although the diffusion coefficients obtained from the analysis of the autocorrelation profiles are consistent with monomeric L20C-ter, the relatively low sensitivity of translational diffusion to changes in molecular weight does not allow us to conclude beyond a doubt that L20C-ter does not form dimers. Cross-correlation analysis, on the other hand, is much more sensitive to molecular association, since it is essentially a zero background measurement. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy measures the coincidence of the signals coming from two differently labelled molecules emitted in the same excitation volume. The amplitude of the cross-correlation signal will be zero at all times in absence of association. Thus, for example, if L20C-ter were a dimer under the conditions of our experiments, then using a mixture of red and green labelled L20C-ter preparations, at least 50% of the particles should present both red and green fluorescence, and hence, a cross-correlation amplitude at time zero equal to half the amplitude of the lowest amplitude autocorrelation function. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, the amplitude of the cross-correlation function is zero, indicating that there are no interactions between the green and red labelled L20C-ter, definitively ruling out a dimerization of the protein in the 50&#x02013;150&#x02009;nM concentration range.</p></sec><sec><title>Stoichiometry of L20C-ter binding to its operator RNA studied with affinity separation</title><p>The above experiments exclude the possibility that L20C-ter binds to the operator RNA as a preformed dimer but do not exclude that two L20C-ter molecules bind to the same operator. To analyse this possibility, we used an affinity separation method. We first tagged the N-terminal end of L20C-ter either with 6 His (His-L20C-ter) residues or with the calmodulin binding peptide (CBP-L20C-ter). Then, the <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized wild-type operator RNA was mixed with stoichiometric amounts of His-L20C-ter and CBP-L20C-ter (all at a concentration of 750&#x02009;nM, well over the Kd). The RNA&#x02013;protein mixture was adsorbed onto Co<sup>++</sup>-sepharose beads (see Materials and Methods section for details), which specifically binds His-L20C-ter. The non-adsorbed, washed and eluted material was then analysed on both RNA and protein gels. The eluted material is expected to contain His-L20C-ter and anything bound to it. If only one molecule of L20C-ter binds to the operator RNA, the only eluted material should be His-L20C-ter and RNA. If the operator RNA binds two L20C-ter molecules, the eluted material should contain RNA and both His-L20C-ter and CBP-L20C-ter. The two differently tagged L20C-ter derivatives should be detected as two bands on an SDS-PAGE because of their difference in molecular weight.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A shows that the wild-type operator RNA, if adsorbed alone on the sepharose beads, is mainly found in the flow-through (FT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 4) and only very marginally in the eluate (E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 6), whereas, in the presence of His-L20C-ter, the RNA is found in much larger quantities in the eluate (E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 3). This indicates that the operator RNA is retained on the beads through its interactions with His-L20C-ter. The binding of the operator RNA is specific since, if an operator RNA in which the two L20-binding sites are mutated is used along with the His-L20C-ter instead of a wild-type operator RNA, the RNA is found mainly in the flow-through (FT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 4) and only marginally in the eluate (E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 6). We repeated the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B with calmodulin-sepharose using the CBP-L20C-ter protein with wild-type or mutant operator RNA. Again, the binding of the operator RNA to the CBP-L20C-ter is specific since, if an operator RNA bearing the two mutated L20-binding sites is used instead of a wild-type operator, the RNA is found mainly in the flow-through (FT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, lane 4) and only marginally in the eluate (E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, lane 6). The SDS-PAGE analysis of the different fractions shows that if His-L20C-ter and CBP-L20C-ter are adsorbed to the Co<sup>++</sup>-sepharose beads in the absence of operator RNA, the only eluted material is His-L20C-ter (E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D, lane 3) as expected if L20C-ter is monomeric. In the presence of operator RNA, the eluted material (E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D, lane 6) contains only His-L20C-ter and no CBP-L20C-ter, indicating that His-L20C-ter and CBP-L20C-ter do not bind together to the operator RNA. This in turn indicates that the stoichiometry of binding is one L20C-ter per operator RNA. </p></sec><sec><title>Stoichiometry of L20C-ter binding to its operator RNA studied with fluorescence correlation</title><p>In order to prove that only one L20 molecule binds to its operator RNA at equilibrium, we probed the interaction of the labelled L20C-ter-Alexa488 and L20C-ter-Atto647 with the operator RNA using fluorescence cross-correlation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B are shown the autocorrelation profiles for these two labelled proteins at a nominal concentration of 150&#x02009;nM in absence and in presence of 150&#x02009;nM operator RNA. Profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A derived from channel 2 (L20C-ter-Alexa488, green dye) while those for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B were calculated from the data obtained on channel 1 (L20C-ter-Atto647, red dye). The profiles have been normalized for direct comparison of the diffusion timescales. The large shift to longer times of the autocorrelation curve in presence of operator RNA indicates that both of the labelled proteins bind to the operator. Increasing RNA concentration did not result in any further shifts indicating that the protein was saturated with RNA under these conditions. </p><p>The autocorrelation profiles, both in absence and in presence of operator RNA, were best fit with a model including two diffusion coefficients. We must caution that there is a great deal of uncertainty associated with the parameter values recovered from fits of autocorrelation profiles to a model including two diffusing species. This uncertainty arises due to the correlations between the fractional contributions and the diffusion times in the fit. In order to compare results under various conditions, we have linked the values of the diffusion coefficients in a global analysis of the data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We have also calculated the average diffusion coefficient as the weighted average of the two recovered diffusion coefficients. Addition of operator RNA to either of the labelled proteins results in a significant decrease in the fractional contribution of the fast diffusing species, from 91 to 58% and from 79 to 48%, respectively for the L20C-ter-Alexa488 and the L20C-ter-Atto647 samples. This corresponds to a decrease of 31 and 34% respectively of the average diffusion coefficient. The value of the larger diffusion coefficient, as noted for the free proteins, is consistent with what would be expected for a protein the size of the L20C-ter. It is unclear why in presence of saturating operator RNA two species are required to fit the curves. One possibility is the shape of the protein/RNA complex, which if not spherical, would present rapid diffusion along particular axes. Alternately, a certain fraction of the protein could be inapt for RNA binding. The average for all samples of the average diffusion coefficient obtained for free protein regardless of concentration or dye was 151&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;18&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/s. The overall average diffusion coefficient for the complex, 88&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;16&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/s (a decrease of 42% compared to the free protein) was calculated from the values obtained from fits of the data from solutions containing L20C-ter labelled with a single dye and equal nominal concentration of operator RNA to ensure saturation.</p><p>In any case, upon addition of 150&#x02009;nM L20C-ter labelled with the other dye, the autocorrelation profiles of the green L20C-ter (in presence of red L20 and operator RNA) or the red L20C-ter (in presence of green L20C-ter and operator RNA) shift back to faster timescales compared to the profiles of a single labelled species in presence of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). The global analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) confirms that the fraction of rapidly diffusing species (free protein) increases when the L20C-ter-Atto647 is added to the L20C-ter-A488/RNA complex and vice versa. Hence the red L20C-ter competes against the green L20C-ter and vice versa for binding to the operator RNA. This also means that the RNA is saturated with protein under these conditions, since the added protein would otherwise simply bind to any free RNA present, rather than compete. L20C-ter-Atto647 appears to compete somewhat more efficiently that the L20C-ter-Alexa488, but this is likely due to the difference in real concentration between the two. In addition, titration experiments revealed that the affinity of the two differently labelled proteins for operator RNA is the same (data not shown). For the same nominal protein concentration, L20C-ter-Atto647 always yields a higher measured concentration in solution (last column <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) due to differences in the adhesion of the labelled proteins to the slide. We repeated the assay at 300&#x02009;nM nominal concentration of all the components and observed the same behaviour, that is to say competition between the L20C-ter molecules labelled with different dyes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, rather than concomitant binding of both species to the operator RNA, which likely would have yielded little if any change in the apparent diffusion profile, the addition of red labelled L20C-ter to the green L20C-ter/operator RNA complex (and vice versa) led to a replacement of the protein labelled with one colour by the other. Both proteins are present at concentrations well over the Kd [see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, concentrations calculated from G(0)] and the RNA is saturated with protein (since one colour competes the other). Thus, these results are highly indicative that two L20 molecules do not bind to the operator RNA simultaneously.</p><p>Definitive support for a 1:1 L20/operator RNA complex stoichiometry comes from examination of the cross-correlation profiles obtained in presence of L20C-ter-Alexa488, L20C-ter-Atto647 and operator RNA. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>C and D, we show the autocorrelation profiles for channel 2 (L20C-ter-Alexa488) and channel 1 (L20C-ter-Atto647), as well as the cross-correlation profiles between the two channels for solutions containing 150&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C) or 300&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D) nominal concentrations of all three components (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, last column for real concentrations). The amplitude of the cross-correlation functions in both cases is very close to zero at all times, indicating that very few operator RNA molecules are bound by both red and green L20C-ter. If the L20C-ter/operator RNA complex stoichiometry were 2:1, then under our saturating conditions, a significant fraction of the complexes (in principle as much as 50%) should contain both red and green labelled L20 molecules, giving rise to a significant amplitude for the cross-correlation function. This is clearly not the case. We thus conclude that the stoichiometry of the L20C-ter/operator RNA complex is 1:1.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary structure probing of wild-type and mutant L20&#x02013;mRNA-binding sites 1 and 2 reveals long-range interaction between the two sites</title><p>Considering that the operator RNA has two potential L20-binding sites, we found quite puzzling the above results indicating that the stoichiometry of L20/operator RNA complex is 1:1. We thought that a possible explanation was that the two sites are either close together or even interact, therefore not allowing simultaneous binding of L20. We suspected that an interaction between the two L20&#x02013;mRNA-binding sites might be detected with RNA probing experiments.</p><p>The secondary structure of the region located between position 214 of <italic>infC</italic> and position 10 of <italic>rpmI</italic> (for each gene, position 1 is the first nucleotide of the initiation codon) was investigated in wild-type operator RNA and in operators containing mutations destabilizing either site 1 or site 2. Structural investigation was carried out using DMS, CMCT and kethoxal as chemical probes for Watson&#x02013;Crick positions of A and C residues, G residues, and U and G residues, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). Mutations of complementary nucleotides in both sites were used separately in order to ensure that a change in reactivity of a given nucleotide is not the result of the formation of artifactual interaction with mutant(s) nucleotide(s). Mutation of each partner of the GinfC335-Ciris78 base pair in stem S2, the key stem holding the pseudoknotted site 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, mutations 1 and 2), was used to examine whether it could affect the reactivity of nucleotides forming site 2. Vice versa, mutations of Giris1 and Giris2&#x02009;in the 5&#x02032; strand of the lower helix of site 2 and mutations of Giris53, Ciris54 and Ciris55&#x02009;in the 3&#x02032; strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C, mutations 3 and 4) were used to evaluate their effect on the reactivities of nucleotides forming site 1. Note that all four mutations result in destabilization of the cognate site and in the consequent loss of repression of <italic>rpmI</italic> expression by L20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, an interesting result is the effect of mutations iris1AA and iris53-55 (mutations 3 and 4) in site 2 which both increase the reactivity of residue UinfC345 (marked with a large star in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) located at the connection of the two halves of stem S1&#x02009;in site 1 (see lanes CMCT3&#x02212; and CMCT3+ and lanes CMCT4&#x02212; and CMCT4+ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, which correspond to mutations iris1AA and iris53-55, respectively). All the other detected changes in nucleotide reactivities are due to local destabilization of the sites 1 and 2, i.e. an increase in reactivity of residues located in the same site as the mutated residue. This is clearly the case for residues UinfC332, GinfC335 and UinfC341&#x02009;in site 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Other residues (data not shown) also display increased reactivities which are due to local destabilization of the sites: Airis72, UinfC76, and Giris82&#x02009;in site 1 and AinfC542, AinfC543, Giris1, Giris2, Giris53, Uiris56, Uiris57, Uiris58 and Giris59&#x02009;in site 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B for site1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C for site 2). </p><p>A surprising finding is that the mutations in site 1 (involving two nucleotides which base pair in the long-range interaction forming stem S2) have no detectable effect on the structure of site 2, whereas the two mutations of site 2 investigated have a strong and localized effect on site 1. This non-reciprocity could be due to either insufficient distortion of site 1 by the two point mutations used in the present study (both are single mutations whereas site 2 mutations are multiple) or no effect at all of site 1 on site 2 structure. A more appealing explanation would be that the non-reciprocity is explained by the fact that site 1 requires site 2 to be stabilized or to gain the adequate shape allowing regulation, whereas site 2 does not.</p><p>In conclusion, the results provided by probing the secondary structure of site 1 and site 2 clearly indicate that destabilization of site 2 by mutation on both strands of the lower helix induces a long-range effect on the stability of stem S1&#x02009;in site 1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>L20-binding affinities and comparison with other systems</title><p>As mentioned above, the globular C-terminal domain of L20 is able to repress the translation of the first cistron of the <italic>rpmI-rplT</italic> operon encoding L35 with about the same efficiency as the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). L20C-ter binds to its wild-type operator RNA with an affinity of 19&#x02009;nM. Taken together these results indicate that the 19&#x02009;nM affinity is sufficient to ensure appropriate regulation. The affinities of several control ribosomal proteins for their respective operators have been precisely measured. In the case of S8, the Kd is about 200&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), for S4 and S15, the Kd are close to 50&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Therefore, the affinity of L20 for its operator appears to be in the same range as in the case of S4 and S15. Considering the binding affinity of S4 for its mRNA and its relatively low free concentration (hypothesized to be around 10&#x02013;20&#x02009;nM) on one hand and the affinity of 30S ribosomes for mRNA (10&#x02013;100&#x02009;nM) and the relatively high concentration of free 30S subunits (1&#x02013;10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) on the other, Draper proposed that a simple competition between S4 and the ribosome for the target mRNA cannot explain regulation. Instead, he proposed that S4 would trap the 30S subunit into an inactive ternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Repression by entrapment is more efficient than competition and can work when the repressor affinity or concentration would not suffice for competition because the repressor only needs to increase the stability of an existing non-functional mRNA&#x02013;ribosomal complex for entrapment, whereas competition requires inhibition of the <italic>de novo</italic> formation of a functional mRNA&#x02013;ribosomal complex. This hypothesis turned out to be true since the alpha operon (the target of S4) and the <italic>rpsO</italic> gene (the target of S15) were later found to be regulated by trapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Interestingly, the translation initiation regions of both mRNAs fold into a pseudoknot that is essential for control, suggesting that this type of mechanism requires specific mRNA structures capable of blocking translation. Since the <italic>rpmI-rplT</italic> operon also carries a pseudoknot and L20 binds with a comparable affinity to its mRNA, it is possible that regulation also functions by trapping in the present case. Further experiments are required to clarify this point.</p></sec><sec><title>The interaction between the two L20-binding sites of the operator RNA</title><p>Although the L20 operator RNA carries two potential binding sites for its protein, only one is occupied as indicated by both our biochemical and biophysical experiments. This single occupancy could, <italic>a priori</italic>, be explained by some long-range effect: L20 binding to either site 1 or site 2 would cause a major structural rearrangement of the operator RNA, changing the structure of the unoccupied site in such a way that it could no longer be recognized by L20. We do not believe this explanation is true since chemical footprinting experiments indicate that L20 binding has effects that are strictly localized at the binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), which is not compatible with major changes in the secondary structure of the whole operator RNA after L20 binding. The propagation of a major structural change consecutive to L20 binding to either site through formation of alternative secondary and/or tertiary interactions is also incompatible with our mutational data, which indicate that sequences outside of the two L20-binding sites can be deleted without major effect on control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Our results indicating that the two L20-binding sites are in interaction offer an alternative explanation for the single occupancy of the operator RNA: the interaction could abolish the potential of the unbound site to be recognized by L20 when the other is bound. This could happen in either two ways: by a conformational change of the unbound site or by steric hindrance. In the first case, the interaction between the two sites &#x02018;senses&#x02019; L20 binding to one site and allows the conformational change to occur at the other site. In the second case, the role of the interaction would just be to bring the two sites close together enough for steric hindrance to occur. Regardless of its precise function, the interaction between the two sites of the operator RNA might also explain that singly mutated operator RNAs (this work) have higher affinities for L20C-ter than isolated fragments carrying only one of the sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Indeed, the effect of a mutation in one of the sites might be partially compensated by an interaction with the other site.</p><p>One of the most remarkable observations is that the changes on both strands of the lower helix in site 2 clearly increase the reactivity of only one nucleotide of site 1, UinfC345, which is located close to nucleotide CinfC318, present in the bulge contiguous to the AinfC317-UinfC345 pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This close proximity is of particular interest because nucleotide CinfC318 displays a strongly decreased reactivity when L20 is bound to the operator RNA even though it is not directly recognized by the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). This strong, but very localized effect indicates that site 1 and site 2 interact by a limited number of nucleotides.</p><p>The 1:1 stoichiometry demonstrated here for the L20/operator complex was somewhat surprising in light of our earlier structural studies of the interaction of L20 with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In these studies, the complex between the C-terminal fragment of L20 and a 42-nt long oligoribonucleotide derived from the rRNA-binding site for L20 was modelled using a combination of structural data from the ribosome, NMR and SAXS. The results demonstrated the formation of a tetrameric complex made of two RNAs and two L20C molecules. Indeed, we noted at the time that the formation of this complex suggested that translational repression could be performed by a complex of two proteins each interacting with the two distinct L20-binding sites within the operator. Distinct differences in the conditions of this earlier study and the present one can readily explain the different observations. First of all, the NMR and SAXS studies are performed at protein and RNA concentrations in the 100&#x02013;200&#x02009;&#x003bc;M range, whereas the present fluorescence studies were carried out using at most, 300&#x02009;nM L20, disfavoring any low affinity protein&#x02013;protein interactions. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the measured pools of r-proteins are between 1&#x02013;3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). However, non-specific binding is thought to reduce the r-protein concentration from 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, i.e. to the concentration range studied here. Secondly, the present studies were carried out using the full-length (&#x0223c;630&#x02009;nt) operator RNA rather than the much shorter oligoribonucleotides. It is quite possible that the 3D structure of the operator RNA plays a role in regulating the stoichiometry of the complex. However, the published model also predicts that some conserved residues in the C-ter domain might be responsible for bridging the two RNA fragments in the tetrameric complex. As discussed below, this bridging might explain how a single L20C-ter monomer interacts with both mRNA sites.</p></sec><sec><title>How does L20 bind to its operator?</title><p>L20 translational feedback regulation depends on the capacity of the protein to bind to its operator RNA and to inhibit translation initiation. Our present data demonstrate that L20 behaves as a monomer and binds to its operator RNA with a reasonable affinity compared to other systems (see above). The case of L20 is exceptional in the sense that its operator RNA carries two potential binding sites, which both resemble to its rRNA-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The potential of the two sites to bind L20 is indicated by three different sets of experiments. First, anisotropy-based titrations of L20C-ter with short operator RNA fragments carrying only either site 1 or site 2 yielded affinities of 88&#x02009;nM for the site 1 fragment and 63&#x02009;nM for the site 2 fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). These values are very close to each other and indicate that both sites have the potential to bind L20C-ter independently from each other and with about the same affinity. Second, if one of the two sites is mutated, the other is still able to bind L20 as detected by former protection and L20-induced primer extension experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Third, the limited loss of affinity when only one site is mutated as shown here, also indicates that the non-mutated site is still functional independently of the other. Despite the presence of two potential binding sites, our work shows that only one single L20 binds to the operator <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments clearly show that both sites are essential for regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>One model that accounts for our data posits that the operator folds into two different conformations that are in equilibrium with one another: the first conformation is mainly made out of the two sites as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and a second where sites 1 and 2 form an hybrid site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). In the presence of L20, the equilibrium is shifted to the hybrid site that allows binding with a higher affinity than the isolated sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Since NMR footprinting experiments indicate that the same side of L20C-ter is involved in the recognition of both sites 1 and 2, as expected for two RNA sites resembling each other, one has to postulate that the hybrid site is recognized in a manner similar to that of each isolated site as they are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. In such a hybrid site, some structural elements of site 1 would be substituted by equivalent elements of site 2. In this case, the C-ter monomer contacts both site 1 and site 2, as previously proposed (see above and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>)). </p><p>A second possibility would be that L20 binds either to site 1 or to site 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B), but never to the two sites simultaneously because the occupancy of a first site will inhibit binding to the second as explained above. Chemical footprinting experiments indicate that in a population of L20/operator RNA complexes both sites are bound, supporting the notion that the 1:1 L20/operator RNA complex stoichiometry arises from a statistical average of complexes with L20 bound either to site 1 or to site 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>A third possibility would be that L20 binds preferentially (or first) to one of the two sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C) keeping in mind that the other site is also essential for regulation. Site 2 is the first of the two L20-binding site to be completed by the transcribing RNA polymerase (the 5' part of site 1 is synthesized before but the 3' part after site 2) and has also a slightly higher affinity than site 1 for L20 as seen from affinity studies from RNA fragments carrying site 1 or site 2 independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) or from the present experiments showing that the decrease of affinity is higher when site 2 is mutated. It is possible that the role of site 2 is to catch L20 first, causing a structural change of site 1 that increases its affinity for L20 and/or a local increase of L20 concentration that maybe indispensable for site 1 to bind the protein with a reasonable efficiency. This model gives to site 1 the main role of assuming final L20 binding, which fits with the fact that some &#x003b3;-proteobacteria carry only site 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The second step of control, translation initiation inhibition, could result from different events. A first possibility is that L20 stabilizes the long-range interaction in the pseudoknot (site 1). Since this long-range interaction sequesters nucleotides adjacent to the translation initiation site of <italic>rpmI</italic>, its stabilization could inhibit translation. Alternatively, L20 binding could cause another structural change of the RNA close to the translation initiation site of <italic>rpmI</italic> inhibiting ribosome binding. The translation inhibition could also be due to L20 itself that either directly inhibits ribosome binding or traps the 30S subunit in a conformation incompatible with translation initiation. Work aimed at testing these possibilities is currently underway.</p><p>Although the mechanism of regulation of the <italic>rpmI-rplT</italic> operon is still largely unknown, the experiments shown in the present work clearly indicate that this mechanism, at least in terms of the protein&#x02013;RNA interaction, is completely different from what has been previously described for any other gene.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Eric Westhof for discussion and Marc Dreyfus, Fr&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;ric Dardel, Ciaran Condon, Youri Timsit and Maude Guillier for careful reading of the manuscript and useful suggestions.

(<bold>C</bold>) L20 binding to site 2 induces a structural change of site 1 rendering the latter competent for L20 binding and/or local increase of L20 concentration which increases the L20-binding efficiency of site 1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm197f8"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Diffusion parameters and nominal versus calculated L20C-ter concentrations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">L20C-ter- Alexa488 (green, CH2) [Nominal] (nM)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">L20C-ter- Atto647 (red, CH1) [Nominal] (nM)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Operator RNA [Nominal] (nM)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>D</italic>1 (&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/s)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">%<italic>D</italic>1</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>D</italic>2 (&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/s)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02329;
