We demonstrate that the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the SNARE VAMP7 is directly mediated by Hrb, a clathrin adaptor and ArfGAP. Hrb wraps 20 residues of its unstructured C-terminal tail around the folded VAMP7 longin domain, demonstrating that unstructured regions of clathrin adaptors can select cargo. Disrupting this interaction by mutation of the VAMP7 longin domain or depletion of Hrb causes VAMP7 to accumulate on the cell's surface. However, the SNARE helix of VAMP7 binds back onto its longin domain, outcompeting Hrb for binding to the same groove and suggesting that Hrb-mediated endocytosis of VAMP7 occurs only when VAMP7 is incorporated into a cis-SNARE complex. These results elucidate the mechanism of retrieval of a postfusion SNARE complex in clathrin-coated vesicles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CELLBIO</kwd><kwd>SIGNALING</kwd><kwd>PROTEINS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) are type II transmembrane proteins that drive membrane fusion events on the secretory and endocytic pathways (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Scheller, 2001</xref>). All SNAREs contain a 16-turn &#x0201c;SNARE&#x0201d; helix and can be defined as either Q- or R-SNAREs depending on the residue at layer 0 in the SNARE helix (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Fasshauer et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). Only certain combinations of three Q-SNAREs from one membrane and one R-SNARE from the apposing membrane can interact to form a trans-SNARE complex that brings the membranes together to facilitate their fusion (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">McNew et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). The original model for SNARE distribution suggests that Q-SNAREs are in target membranes and their cognate R-SNAREs are in vesicle membranes. However, several studies now suggest that both Q- and R-SNAREs are found in both target and vesicle membranes (<xref rid="bib26 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mossessova et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Pryor et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Three important tasks must be achieved by the processes that mediate the sorting and trafficking of SNAREs. First, in order to ensure that two membranes fuse, sufficient amounts of the correct SNAREs must have been sorted into them. Second, for vesicle trafficking to continue in the cell and membrane identity to be maintained, some SNAREs must be recycled back to their steady-state locations for reuse, whereas others are retained in their current organelle membrane. Finally, any SNAREs that have become mislocalized from their normal trafficking routes need to be retrieved (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Pelham, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms by which SNAREs are selected for incorporation into the different clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) that mediate many post-Golgi trafficking routes are largely unknown. Most do not possess the short linear motifs that are recognized by clathrin adaptors to direct the incorporation of standard cargo into CCVs, such as Yxx&#x003a6; and [DE]xxxLL motifs (AP complexes), DxxLL motifs (GGAs), and FxNPxY motifs on LDL superfamily members (ARH and Dab2) (reviewed in <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>). In addition, SNAREs are not known to be ubiquitinated, which would confer the ability to be bound by the epsins or GGAs, nor to have a docking surface for &#x003b2;-arrestins. However, many SNAREs possess a folded N-terminal domain of 100&#x02013;150 residues that precedes the SNARE helical domain. These folded domains are either of unknown structure, such as those of Sec20 or Slt1, or defined as being a three-helical H<sub>abc</sub> domain or a longin domain (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hong, 2005</xref>). Recent work (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) suggests the existence of processes that run in parallel to the short, linear motif recognition by general cargo/clathrin adaptors, whereby SNARE incorporation into CCVs is directed by the specific recognition of the folded N-terminal domains of SNAREs by other CCV components. Such a system would have the advantages that the transport of SNAREs would not be vulnerable to competition from standard motif-containing cargo, thus ensuring that sufficient amounts of the correct SNAREs are incorporated into a CCV, and at the same time it would not reduce the carrying capacity of CCVs for standard cargo.</p><p>Vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 (VAMP7), also known as tetanus neurotoxin-insensitive VAMP (TI-VAMP) or synaptobrevin-like 1 (SYBL1), is an R-SNARE that has been implicated in several fusion events, some likely to be in all cells and others occurring at specialized sites in particular types of differentiated cells. VAMP7 is the required R-SNARE for heterotypic fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes and also for fusion of lysosomes or vesicles with the plasma membrane (reviewed in <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Luzio et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). VAMP7 and yeast Nyv1p (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wen et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), along with the yeast and mammalian orthologs of Sec22 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>) and Ykt6 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Tochio et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), comprise the &#x0201c;longin&#x0201d; subfamily of R-SNAREs because they possess a 120&#x02013;140 residue N-terminal, profilin-like, longin domain (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Filippini et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>) that is also found in other proteins including the &#x003c3; and &#x003bc; subunits of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Collins et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>) and the SR&#x003b1; subunit of the signal recognition particle receptor (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz and Blobel, 2003</xref>). Longin domains have been suggested to regulate trans-SNARE complex formation, possibly by folding over their SNARE helix (<xref rid="bib12 bib20 bib21 bib23 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Mancias and Goldberg, 2007; Martinez-Arca et&#x000a0;al., 2000, 2003b; Tochio et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). In addition to its putative role in regulating trans-SNARE complex formation, the longin domain of VAMP7 has also been shown to be required for its sorting and delivery to late endocytic organelles by binding to the &#x003b4; subunit of AP3 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Arca et&#x000a0;al., 2003b</xref>), for which it does not use a standard cargo trafficking Yxx&#x003a6; or [DE]xxxLL motif.</p><p>VAMP7 must possess a complex, post-Golgi membrane traffic itinerary because it is involved in several different membrane fusion events. Because the coat composition of the transport vesicles mediating different steps in this itinerary will be different, it seemed likely that VAMP7 would have more than one vesicle-component binding partner. An obvious candidate for the location of binding sites on VAMP7 for membrane traffic machinery is the longin domain, especially given the observation that AP3 binds to this domain (<xref rid="bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Arca et&#x000a0;al., 2003a, 2003b</xref>), as well as the demonstration that the regulatory H<sub>abc</sub> domain of the SNARE vti1b binds to the clathrin adaptor epsinR (<xref rid="bib13 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screen was performed with the VAMP7 longin domain in an attempt to identify new candidate binding partners that could act as cargo-selective devices for VAMP7. In this study, HIV Rev-binding protein (Hrb), also known as Rev-interacting protein (RIP) or Rev/Rex activation-domain-binding protein (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fritz et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>), which is an ArfGAP (GTPase-activating protein), was identified as a binding partner of the longin domain of VAMP7. Hrb is shown to interact with AP2 and clathrin, and thus it could act as a highly specific cargo selective device for the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of VAMP7. The structure of the complex between the VAMP7 longin domain and the relevant portion of Hrb was determined and used to identify mutations that abolish the interaction. These mutations were subsequently used to confirm that in&#x000a0;vivo, the VAMP7 longin domain/Hrb interaction is responsible for the efficient internalization of VAMP7 from the cell's limiting membrane.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>The VAMP7 Longin Domain Binds Hrb</title><p>To identify proteins that bind the longin domain of VAMP7, a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screen using the longin domain as the bait protein was carried out. In this screen, 37 out of 39 positive clones encoded part of the AP3 complex &#x003b4; subunit trunk domain. This agreed with the observations of <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Arca et&#x000a0;al. (2003b)</xref>, who had previously demonstrated that AP3 is required for the correct localization of VAMP7. A single clone was identified whose cDNA encoded part of the ArfGAP Hrb (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fritz et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>) (NCBI accession number NM_004504, shown schematically in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A; see full sequence in <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A available online). To test the specificity of the interaction between the longin domain of VAMP7 and Hrb, we first used the yeast two-hybrid system to investigate the binding of full-length Hrb to the longin domains of VAMP7, Sec22b, and Ykt6. Strong yeast growth was only seen as a result of the interaction between Hrb and the longin domain of VAMP7, and there was no evidence of interaction with the longin domains of Sec22b and Ykt6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B).</p><p>To confirm the interaction between the VAMP7 longin domain and Hrb, bacterially expressed GST-VAMP7 longin domain was used in pull-down assays from A431 cytosol. Western blotting showed that GST-VAMP7 longin domain, but not GST-Sec22b longin domain nor GST alone, bound to endogenous Hrb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). Further binding studies using GST-VAMP7 longin domain showed that it bound to bacterially expressed His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Hrb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D). A series of truncated, C-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Hrb constructs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E) indicated that the sequence of Hrb that bound VAMP7 longin domain was between residues 136 and 176. This sequence is contained within the region that follows the ArfGAP domain, which is predicted to lack stable secondary structural elements (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cuff et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>), and contains a number of motifs commonly found in endocytic clathrin adaptors. These include NPF and FXXFXXF, motifs which should bind EH domains and AP appendage domains, respectively, as well as a probable clathrin-binding motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>A).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Hrb Is an Endocytic CCV Component</title><p>Although the VAMP7 longin domain bound to Hrb in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down experiments, we found that VAMP7 and Hrb showed little, if any, colocalization by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy in cultured NRK (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A) or HeLa cells (data not shown). In agreement with previous studies (<xref rid="bib23 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Arca et&#x000a0;al., 2003b; Pryor et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), we observed considerable overlap of VAMP7 localization with the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein lgp120 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). In contrast, membrane-associated Hrb showed no colocalization with either lgp120 or with the late endosomal marker cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) in NRK cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). However, Hrb did show extensive colocalization with clathrin and AP2 in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) and CCVs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). These observations suggested that Hrb functions primarily at the plasma membrane in CCVs, consistent with the presence of a clathrin-binding motif (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>), three FXXFXXF sequences that contain AP2 appendage-binding capability (221FANFAHF227, 240FANFDAF246, and 272FAHFDNF288) (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>) (<xref rid="bib7 bib29 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Edeling et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Praefcke et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Schmid et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), and NPF motifs that bind proteins containing EH domains including Eps15 and Eps15R (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Doria et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Structure Determination of VAMP7 Longin Domain/Hrb<sub>136&#x02013;176</sub> Complex</title><p>Using residues 1&#x02013;176 of Hrb and the VAMP7 longin domain in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the K<sub>D</sub> for the interaction was measured as 10.5 &#x003bc;M (see below). In order to increase artificially the apparent concentration of the two components and thus make crystallizing a complex of the two more likely, a cDNA encoding the fragment of Hrb mapped as binding VAMP7 longin domain (residues 136&#x02013;176) was cloned onto the 5&#x02032; end of the VAMP7 longin domain cDNA. The Hrb sequence in the resultant chimeric protein was preceded by a cleavable GST tag, and a His<sub>6</sub> tag was placed after the C terminus of VAMP7 longin domain (GST-Hrb<sub>136&#x02013;176</sub>/VAMP7 LDHis<sub>6</sub>). Following removal of the GST tag, this chimeric construct was crystallized and its structure was determined by SIRAS with a single mercury derivative (<xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref>), because attempts to solve it by molecular replacement using a variety of profilin-like fold proteins as search models failed. The chimeric construct crystallized with four molecules in the asymmetric unit (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A), with the fragments of Hrb binding to each longin domain in an identical manner but with two being intermolecular and two being intramolecular interactions (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). As expected, the VAMP7 longin domain (residues 1&#x02013;115) possessed a five-stranded antiparallel &#x003b2; sheet, flanked by helix &#x003b1;1 on one face with helix &#x003b1;2 and a truncated helix &#x003b1;3 on the other (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>). The first 20 residues of the Hrb fragment (residues 136&#x02013;155) are disordered, and only residues 156&#x02013;176 are visible in the density. These sit in a hydrophobic groove that wraps halfway around the longin domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>) and have assumed short stretches of defined secondary structure on binding the longin domain. Residues 156&#x02013;159 of Hrb form an additional &#x003b2; strand along one edge of VAMP7 longin domain strand &#x003b2;3. The Hrb short &#x003b2; strand then gives way to a single-turn &#x003b1; helix (residues 160&#x02013;167) that is flanked by proline residues, and contacts the longin domain via hydrophobic interactions using predominantly three leucine residues. Residues 168&#x02013;176 of Hrb pack against helix &#x003b1;1 of VAMP7 longin domain, with the interaction again being mediated by hydrophobic side chains and also one hydrogen bond between Asn24 of VAMP7 longin domain and Thr170 of Hrb. Overall, the interaction buries 900 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of the solvent-accessible surface of VAMP7 longin domain and 1020 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of Hrb, giving a total buried surface of 1920&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, and involves 13 residues from Hrb and 16 residues on VAMP7 longin domain and shows good shape complementarity (interface analyzed using PISA; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Krissinel and Henrick, 2005</xref>) (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>).</p><p>In order to confirm the validity of the interaction, mutations were made in pairs of key residues involved in the interaction (N24A/F25S, L43S/Y45S, and Y50S/F52S in the context of GST-VAMP7 longin domain and L160S/L163S, L163P/L164P, and L171S/L173S in the context of Hrb<sub>1&#x02013;176</sub> His<sub>6</sub>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B). The mutations N24A/F25S and Y50S/F52S in VAMP7 longin domain resulted in the protein being expressed in an insoluble form. However, L43S/Y45S in VAMP7 longin domain and the three mutations in Hrb were soluble and did not alter the fold of the proteins, as estimated by circular dichroism (data not shown). ITC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4D) and GST pull-down (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>D and S2E) experiments showed that, as predicted, all the soluble mutations strongly inhibited the interaction between the two proteins, with the K<sub>D</sub> for the binding increasing from around 10 &#x003bc;M for wild-type to undetectable levels (values of &#x0003e;300 &#x003bc;M).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Hrb Functions as an Endocytic Adaptor for VAMP7 at the Cell Surface</title><p>To investigate the possibility that Hrb functions as an endocytic adaptor for VAMP7, we knocked both Hrb and clathrin down using siRNAs. NRK cells expressing stable full-length human VAMP7 tagged with the HA epitope at the C terminus under an inducible promoter were treated with two separate siRNA oligonucleotide pairs (oligos 1 and 2) against Hrb and chc-2 (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref>) against clathrin. Depletion of Hrb resulted in an increased amount of VAMP7-HA on the cell surface of NRK cells when compared with mock transfected cells (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). Quantification using an <sup>125</sup>I-labeled monoclonal anti-HA antibody indicated that there was a doubling of VAMP7-HA on the cell surface following &#x0223c;90% depletion of Hrb (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A), similar to that demonstrated following addition of ionomycin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A), a treatment that results in lysosome fusion with the plasma membrane and the consequent appearance at the cell surface of lysosomal membrane proteins (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>B) (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). Depletion of clathrin also caused a marked increase in the level of VAMP7-HA on the plasma membrane (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>). Consistent with Hrb functioning as a SNARE-specific adaptor, depleting HeLaM cells of Hrb by siRNA had no effect on the internalization and intracellular accumulation of EGF nor on its degradation when compared to mock transfected cells (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>).</p><p>The observation that recombinant VAMP7 longin domain mutated at L43S/Y45S folded correctly but failed to bind Hrb suggested a further experiment to confirm the function of Hrb as an endocytic adaptor for VAMP7. Whereas in NRK cells stably transfected with wild-type VAMP7-HA the tagged protein was mainly in lysosomes with very little on the cell surface, cells transfected with the L43S/Y45S mutant of VAMP7-HA showed a marked increase in cell-surface localization of tagged protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>B and <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">S6</xref>A), despite expression levels of VAMP7 being equivalent (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>B). Analogous results were obtained when the experiment was performed in the absence of endogenous VAMP7, whose level had been depleted by siRNA treatment (data not shown). Further, when the longin domain of VAMP7 was attached via a linker (GSGGSG) to the neutral reporter CD8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C), the resulting construct was efficiently localized to lgp110-positive late endosomes/lysosomes. However, when the L43S/Y45S non-Hrb-binding mutant version of the longin domain was fused to CD8, this construct accumulated on the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C, panel d; <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that Hrb functions as a cargo/clathrin adaptor in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of VAMP7 through the interaction of the VAMP7 longin domain with Hrb.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Hrb Competes for the SNARE Helix Binding Site on VAMP7</title><p>It has been shown that in order for Sec22b to bind to the Sec23/24 component of the COPII coat, both its longin domain and an intact SNARE helix are required (<xref rid="bib18 bib20 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Mancias and Goldberg, 2007; Mossessova et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). The recently determined structure of the Sec22b longin domain complexed with Sec23/24 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Mancias and Goldberg, 2007</xref>) showed that a small part of the Sec22b SNARE helix binds back onto and stabilizes its longin domain such that it can interact with Sec23/24. Binding back and interaction with Sec23/24 would be impossible if the Sec22b SNARE helix was participating in a cis-SNARE complex, which leads to the conclusion that Sec23/24 can only bind to isolated, that is, uncomplexed, Sec22b. Overlaying the structures of the VAMP7 longin domain and Sec22b longin domain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A) shows that the two possess a very similar hydrophobic groove that binds the first half of the Hrb fragment in the case of VAMP7 and binds back on the SNARE helix in the case of Sec22b, both in very similar conformations and using very similar, mainly hydrophobic, side chains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C). However, the region of the Sec22b longin domain analogous to the site on the VAMP7 longin domain where residues 168&#x02013;176 of the Hrb sequence bind is different in the two proteins, explaining why Hrb cannot bind Sec22b (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). Comparison of the SNARE helix sequences of VAMP7 and Sec22b reveals a high degree of similarity in the region that in Sec22b binds back on its longin domain and, indeed, the major determinants of the Sec22b SNARE helix binding Ile139, Met140, and Ile144 (numbering as in VAMP7) are absolutely conserved between the two proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). These residues also align well with the residues in Hrb bound by VAMP7 longin domain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). These observations suggested that the SNARE helix of VAMP7 also binds back onto its longin domain, a suggestion that is in line with <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Arca et&#x000a0;al. (2003b)</xref>. However, because the SNARE helix binding back to the longin domain would occur at the same site as Hrb binding, they would be mutually exclusive. Further, because binding back of the VAMP7 SNARE helix onto its longin domain is intramolecular as opposed to Hrb binding which is intermolecular, the former would be much stronger and predominate in solution. To test the proposal that Hrb and the SNARE helix of VAMP7 compete for the same site on the VAMP7 longin domain, GST pull-down experiments were performed using GST-VAMP longin domain alone, GST-VAMP7 full-length wild-type cytoplasmic domain, and a fully folded (as determined by circular dichroism; data not shown) mutant version of the latter in which the key binding Ile139, Met140, and Ile144 residues were mutated to serines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>A). <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B shows that VAMP7 longin domain alone effectively bound Hrb, but full-length, wild-type cytoplasmic domain of VAMP7 demonstrated very little binding. However, mutation of the proposed key longin domain-binding residues in the SNARE helix of VAMP7 restored Hrb binding. In vivo, the sequestration of this &#x0201c;bind-back&#x0201d; sequence in VAMP7 would occur on SNARE complex formation, which at the plasma membrane would likely be with SNAP23 and syntaxin4 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Rao et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Consequently, a 1:1:1 stoichiometric complex was made between recombinant, bacterially produced, full-length VAMP7 cytoplasmic domain, SNAP23, and the SNARE helix of syntaxin4 and its ability to bind Hrb compared with that of both the isolated VAMP7 longin domain and full-length cytoplasmic domain. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>C and 7D, whereas isolated full-length VAMP7 showed little binding to Hrb, participation in a SNARE complex restored Hrb binding of the VAMP7 cytoplasmic domain to levels comparable to that displayed by the isolated longin domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The correct complement of SNARE proteins helps to define a specific organelle membrane and plays a major role in determining the specificity of protein sorting by permitting fusion of transport vesicles with only certain target membranes (<xref rid="bib24 bib28" ref-type="bibr">McNew et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Pelham, 2001</xref>). To date, all lysosomal fusion events in which the trans-SNARE complex has been defined appear to require the R-SNARE VAMP7 (reviewed in <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Luzio et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), and thus the high concentration of VAMP7 on the lysosome membrane may help to define the lysosome. The retrieval of VAMP7 from the plasma membrane is necessary for its use in subsequent endosomal/lysosomal fusion events, but may also prevent inappropriate endocytic organelle fusion with the plasma membrane. Our data indicate that the clathrin-mediated endocytic retrieval of VAMP7 from the cell surface is mediated by the ArfGAP Hrb, which possesses all the properties of a cargo-binding clathrin adaptor in that it can be recruited into forming CCVs by its interactions with AP2 appendages and clathrin (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref> and <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schmid and McMahon, 2007</xref>). It will also be concentrated in coated pits through its interactions with EH domain-containing proteins (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Doria et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>) and very likely a membrane-bound Arf while also binding to its cargo VAMP7. Under physiological circumstances, VAMP7 would become localized to the cell's limiting membrane following fusion of late endocytic compartments, or vesicles derived from them, during processes including lysosome exocytosis, membrane repair, and neurite outgrowth (see <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Luzio et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref> for references). Given the presence of AP3, whose &#x003b4; subunit can also bind VAMP7 longin domain, on the recycling endosome (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Peden et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), we expect that AP3 can drive the subsequent sorting of VAMP7 to late endosomes/lysosomes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Arca et&#x000a0;al., 2003b</xref>) following internalization from the cell surface. A schematic representation of this pathway of retrieval of VAMP7 from the plasma membrane is shown in <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S8</xref>.</p><p>It seems probable that VAMP7 is retrieved from the plasma membrane not as an isolated SNARE but as part of a heterotetrameric cis-SNARE complex, presumably with SNAP23 and syntaxin4 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Rao et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>) left there following lysosome fusion. This conclusion follows from our observation that in VAMP7 the SNARE helix interaction with the longin domain is intramolecular and would thus outcompete the intermolecular Hrb interaction for longin domain binding unless this competition is relieved by sequestration of the VAMP7 SNARE helix as part of a higher-affinity SNARE complex (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). This is the opposite situation to that in the incorporation of Sec22b into COPII vesicles, where binding to the Sec23/24 complex only occurs when the Sec22b SNARE helix does bind intramolecularly to the Sec22b longin domain, so that Sec22b can only be trafficked by this mechanism when it is free of its SNARE complex partners (<xref rid="bib18 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Mancias and Goldberg, 2007</xref>). These opposite effects of sorting on either complexed or free SNAREs, respectively, arise as a direct result of VAMP7 using the same site for cargo selection and SNARE helix binding, whereas Sec22b uses different but positive allosteric sites for the two binding functions. The conclusion that VAMP7 must be endocytosed as part of a cis-SNARE complex further suggests that the dissociation of the VAMP7-containing SNARE complex by &#x003b1;-SNAP and NSF must occur after the endocytic event.</p><p>In common with other integral membrane cargo, the intracellular localization of SNAREs is determined by delivery, retrieval, and retention mechanisms. The interaction of cargo with a coat component, however, needs to be of moderate affinity (1&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;M K<sub>D</sub>) and therefore dynamic, in order that the proofreading of cargo incorporated into CCVs and the dissociation of cargo and adaptors during clathrin cage disassembly can readily occur. The 10.5 &#x003bc;M K<sub>D</sub> interaction between the surface patch on VAMP7 longin domain and a portion of the Hrb unstructured C-terminal domain must be highly specific to these two components, because the topography of the VAMP7 longin domain surface is dependent on its overall fold, and the sequence of the Hrb-binding fragment is not found in other clathrin adaptors. This study therefore shows how a specific SNARE, in this case most probably present as a SNARE complex, can be sorted into a single type of CCV through the interaction of its folded N-terminal domain with a CCV component in a manner that meets the required kinetic and thermodynamic parameters required for dynamic cargo selection (reviewed in <xref rid="bib1 bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003; Edeling et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the widely used recognition by clathrin adaptors of generic transplantable motifs, or covalently attached ubiquitin selecting cargo for incorporation into CCVs, the evidence presented here demonstrates that highly specific interactions unique to a given SNARE/clathrin adaptor pair can also be used to sort SNAREs into CCVs. These CCV components can, as is demonstrated by Hrb's role as an ArfGAP, have other roles in CCV formation. By working in parallel with, but not competing with, the incorporation of standard motif-containing cargo, such mechanisms of SNARE folded domain recognition will ensure that the desired SNARE(s) is efficiently incorporated into CCVs, while the carrying capacity for standard motif-containing cargo is not reduced. When taken in conjunction with data on the interaction of vti1b with epsinR (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) and of VAMP7 with AP3 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Arca et&#x000a0;al., 2003b</xref>), the data shown here provide compelling evidence that the use of folded &#x0201c;regulatory&#x0201d; domain-mediated, rather than of the commonly used short, linear motif-mediated interactions, is the paradigm for sorting SNAREs into post-Golgi transport vesicles. The recent demonstration that Sec22b also uses its longin domain to bind to components of the COPII vesicle coat (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Mancias and Goldberg, 2007</xref>) lends yet further support to this notion.</p><p>Finally, the discovery that the predicted unstructured region of the clathrin adaptor Hrb can act directly in cargo selection, where the cargo recognition determinant, the longin domain of VAMP7, has significant tertiary structure, demonstrates both a new mechanism for CCV cargo recognition and a new role for the unstructured regions of clathrin adaptors that were previously believed to be involved only in their recruitment to and maintenance in CCVs (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Schmid and McMahon, 2007</xref>). Thus, the whole sequence of clathrin adaptors, rather than just their folded domains, should be considered when searching for the binding site of a given cargo molecule.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><p>Vectors were constructed from the cDNAs encoding full-length human VAMP7, human Hrb, human HrbL, mouse Sec22b, and mouse Ykt6 (IMAGE clones 6503665, 4836885, 4810320, 5119580, and 5370491, respectively) and mouse VAMP7 longin domain, which was a gift from Rob Piper (University of Iowa).

VAMP7 contains a putative longin domain and a SNARE helix preceding its transmembrane helix (TM). Hrb has a predicted ArfGAP domain at its N terminus with the remainder of the protein predicted to possess very little secondary structure. This region contains a predicted clathrin-binding motif, three FXXFXXF motifs predicted to bind to AP2 appendage domains, and four NPF motifs that are able to bind EH domain-containing proteins. The full sequence of Hrb is shown in <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A.</p><p>(B) Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicates that VAMP7 longin domain (LD) but not Sec22b or Ykt6 longin domains (LDs) interacts with full-length Hrb, as indicated by growth of diploid strains containing the indicated plasmids on medium lacking adenine.
