However, the specific molecules that prime the development of Th2 responses have not been identified. We report that omega-1, a glycoprotein which is secreted from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs and present in SEA, is capable of conditioning human monocyte-derived dendritic cells in vitro to drive T helper 2 (Th2) polarization with similar characteristics as whole SEA. Furthermore, using IL-4 dual reporter mice, we show that both natural and recombinant omega-1 alone are sufficient to generate Th2 responses in vivo, even in the absence of IL-4R signaling. Finally, omega-1&#x02013;depleted SEA displays an impaired capacity for Th2 priming in vitro, but not in vivo, suggesting the existence of additional factors within SEA that can compensate for the omega-1&#x02013;mediated effects. Collectively, we identify omega-1, a single component of SEA, as a potent inducer of Th2 responses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Helminth parasites are the most potent natural inducers of T helper 2 (Th2) cell&#x02013;polarized responses. Infection with <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> elicits strong Th2 responses in humans and in experimental animal models. The development of this Th2 polarization coincides with the onset of egg production by adult worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pearce, 2005</xref>). The ability of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs to induce Th2 differentiation during infection is underscored by the observation that schistosome eggs alone, or soluble <italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg antigen (SEA), are sufficient to drive Th2 polarization in naive mice even in the absence of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vella and Pearce, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jankovic et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Various cells of the innate immune system are thought to contribute to the activation of Th2 responses after infection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. Granulocytes like basophils, eosinophils, and mast cells have been shown to represent potential innate sources of Th2-associated cytokines, like IL-4, during infection, which can contribute to the polarization, sustenance, and amplification of Th2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mitre and Nutman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sokol et al., 2008</xref>). Although these cells may well support Th2 development, professional APCs, DCs in particular, are thought to play a dominant role in the initiation of these T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kapsenberg, 2003</xref>). DCs have been shown to efficiently sense, capture, and process antigens derived from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cervi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">van Liempt et al., 2007</xref>), resulting in the capacity of these DCs to prime for strong Th2 polarization both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">MacDonald et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Jong et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although the ability of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs and their soluble antigens to promote potent Th2 responses has been well documented, the specific components responsible for this activity are only beginning to be characterized. In this respect, glycans on proteins from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs have been shown to contribute to the Th2-polarizing properties of SEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Okano et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, IPSE/alpha-1 and peroxiredoxin, which are both glycoproteins secreted by the eggs, have recently been shown to trigger basophils to produce IL-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schramm et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2007</xref>) and to induce the development of alternatively activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Donnelly et al., 2008</xref>), respectively, both of which can contribute to Th2 polarization after exposure to egg antigens. However, the specific molecules responsible for the initiation of Th2 differentiation have remained elusive.</p><p>In this paper, we show that omega-1, a glycoprotein present in both SEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dunne et al., 1991</xref>) and excretory/secretory products (ESPs) from live eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cass et al., 2007</xref>), potently instructs human DCs to prime highly Th2-polarized responses from naive human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro. In addition, we demonstrate that injection of omega-1 alone into IL-4 dual reporter mice is sufficient to prime Th2 responses in vivo, even in the absence of the IL-4R&#x003b1; chain. Together, these findings demonstrate that omega-1 is a potent initiator, rather than amplifier, of Th2 responses.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>ESPs from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs condition human DCs for Th2 priming</title><p>DCs are known to play a pivotal role in the initiation and polarization of T cell responses, and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg preparations have been shown to prime Th2 cells via the functional modulation of DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">MacDonald et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Jong et al., 2002</xref>). To study and identify the components from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg preparations that instruct Th2 development, we used a well established co-culture system of human monocyte-derived DC and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which is generally thought to mimic in vivo DC-mediated T helper cell polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kapsenberg, 2003</xref>). It stands to reason that ESPs from live eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cass et al., 2007</xref>) are the first egg-derived molecules to interact with cells of the innate immune system, including DCs. Therefore, we initially tested ESPs for their capacity to condition DCs to prime Th2 development from naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Similar to SEA, exposure of DCs to ESP resulted in a robust Th2 skewing irrespective of the presence or absence of LPS as a neutral maturation factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In a recent paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cass et al. (2007)</xref> identified omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1 as the most abundant proteins within ESP from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs. Separation of ESP preparations by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), followed by Western blotting with specific monoclonal antibodies, revealed prominent bands representing IPSE/alpha-1 and omega-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), which was confirmed by mass spectrometry (not depicted). Both omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1 are glycoproteins that are specifically expressed in and secreted from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs. Omega-1 has been demonstrated to display RNase activity and hepatotoxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dunne et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fitzsimmons et al., 2005</xref>), whereas IPSE/alpha-1 has previously been shown to trigger IL-4 production by human and mouse basophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schramm et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Immunological and biochemical characterization of ESP from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs.</bold> (A) Monocyte-derived DCs pulsed for 48 h with the different antigen preparations in the absence (top) or presence (bottom) of 100 ng/ml LPS as a maturation factor were co-cultured with allogeneic naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for 12 d in the presence of staphylococcal enterotoxin B and IL-2.

Although some immunological properties of IPSE/alpha-1 have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schramm et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2007</xref>), the effects of omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1 on DC-driven T helper cell polarization have not been investigated. To this end, natural omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1 were purified from SEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) and used for the conditioning of human DCs in comparison with whole SEA. The concentrations of omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1 used in these assays were equivalent to those in the unfractionated SEA preparations. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">van Liempt et al., 2007</xref>), stimulation with SEA did not lead to classical maturation of DCs, based on surface marker expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082460/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Likewise, omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1 did not induce the expression of these markers on DCs (Fig. S1). Apart from the failure to induce the maturation of DCs, SEA is also known to interfere with TLR-mediated DC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kane et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">van Liempt et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, when DCs were matured with the TLR4 ligand LPS, a nonpolarizing maturation factor for human DCs, the presence of SEA significantly impaired the LPS-induced up-regulation of CD83 and CD86 surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Strikingly, omega-1 alone was sufficient to suppress the induction of these molecules on LPS-stimulated DCs to a similar extent, whereas IPSE/alpha-1 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>SDS-PAGE of SEA, natural omega-1, and natural IPSE/alpha-1 as well as of recombinant omega-1 (silver staining and Western blotting).</bold> (A&#x02013;C) 5 &#x000b5;g/cm SEA, 0.3 &#x000b5;g/cm omega-1, 0.3 &#x000b5;g/cm and IPSE/alpha-1 purified from SEA were separated by SDS-PAGE and silver stained or blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Silver staining (A) revealed a weak banding intensity of both natural and recombinant omega-1 compared with IPSE/alpha-1, although the purified proteins were applied to the gel at the same amounts (0.3 &#x000b5;g/cm). The two bands stained by anti-IPSE/alpha-1 represent posttranslational variants of the same protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schramm et al., 2003</xref>).

To establish whether omega-1 can induce Th2 polarization in the absence of IL-4R signaling, we immunized 4get/KN2 IL-4 dual reporter mice on the IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mohrs et al., 1999</xref>). Injection of omega-1, as well as SEA, resulted in an increased frequency of GFP<sup>+</sup> and huCD2<sup>+</sup> cells in IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>), albeit with reduced magnitude, as has been previously reported for SEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jankovic et al., 2000</xref>). The observation that IL-4R signaling is dispensable for the in vivo priming of Th2 responses by omega-1 further supports that omega-1 itself can provide the initial triggers driving Th2 differentiation rather than simply amplifying the process.</p></sec><sec><title>Omega-1 is a major factor in SEA that conditions DCs for Th2 priming but is not the only Th2-inducing component of SEA</title><p>Given the potency of omega-1 to condition DCs for Th2 priming in vitro and to drive Th2 polarization in vivo with similar characteristics as SEA, we depleted omega-1 from SEA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082460/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>) to address the extent to which the Th2-polarizing capacity of SEA can be attributed to omega-1. Depletion of omega-1 almost completely abrogated the inhibitory effect of SEA on LPS-induced in vitro maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>) and IL-12 cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>) by DCs. Consistent with this observation, the Th2-polarizing capacity of omega-1&#x02013;depleted SEA was also significantly reduced compared with whole SEA in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>) or absence of LPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082460/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). This suggests that omega-1 is a principal factor in SEA mediating the conditioning of DCs for Th2 priming in vitro. In contrast, omega-1&#x02013;depleted SEA was not impaired in its capacity to prime Th2 responses in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Thus, additional components in SEA are able to compensate for omega-1 with respect to Th2 priming in vivo. An interesting candidate could be the glycoprotein peroxiredoxin present in SEA, as this molecule has recently been shown to induce the development of alternatively activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Donnelly et al., 2008</xref>), which may render it capable of initiating a Th2 response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cua and Stohlman, 1997</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Omega-1 is a major factor in SEA that conditions DCs for Th2 priming but not the only Th2-inducing component present in SEA.</bold> (A and B) Monocyte-derived DCs were pulsed for 48 h with 25 &#x000b5;g/ml SEA or 25 &#x000b5;g/ml omega-1&#x02013;depleted SEA in combination with 100 ng/ml LPS and analyzed for surface expression of maturation markers and IL-12 production as described in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> legend.

Although omega-1 was known to be secreted by live <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs and to be one of the most abundant molecules present in SEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dunne et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">1991</xref>), its immunological properties have remained elusive. This study shows that omega-1 alone is sufficient to drive Th2 responses both in vitro and in vivo. Using a well established in vitro model to study the T helper polarization of naive human T cell by DCs, we demonstrate that omega-1 can elicit Th2 responses via the conditioning of DCs. Nonetheless, our observations do not exclude the possibility that in vivo omega-1&#x02013;driven Th2 responses are also supported by cell types other than DCs like, for instance, basophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Perrigoue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sokol et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yoshimoto et al., 2009</xref>). However, our in vivo studies with IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice demonstrated that IL-4R signaling is dispensable for the in vivo priming of Th2 responses by omega-1. Given that DCs have the unique capacity to initiate Th2 responses independently of IL-4 signaling in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">MacDonald and Pearce, 2002</xref>), these data support a role for DCs in omega-1&#x02013;driven Th2 priming. Our findings are corroborated by an independent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steinfelder et al. (2009)</xref>, showing that omega-1&#x02013;conditioned bone marrow&#x02013;derived mouse DCs prime Th2 responses in vitro and also upon transfer into naive mice in vivo. Collectively, these studies support a role for omega-1 in driving Th2 responses via the functional modulation of DCs.</p><p>The molecular basis underlying the immunomodulatory property of omega-1 still remains to be determined. Carbohydrates present in SEA have been found to contribute to the Th2-polarizing properties of this antigen preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Okano et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>). Because omega-1 is a glycosylated protein, the glycosylation pattern of omega-1 might play a role in its Th2-priming activity. Furthermore, its RNase activity could provide an alternative or additional mechanism through which omega-1 drives Th2 polarization because several RNases have been implicated in Th2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garcia-Ortega et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Whether the reduced Th2-inducing activity of recombinant compared with natural omega-1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, B vs. A</xref>) is the result of differences in the glycosylation pattern or reduced RNase activity remains to be determined. The specific modification of the glycosylation and/or the RNase activity of omega-1 will define their respective roles and will help to identify the molecular pathways through which omega-1 conditions DCs to initiate Th2 polarization.</p><p>Although the immunological processes resulting in Th1 polarization have been extensively characterized, it is still poorly understood exactly how Th2 responses are initiated. SEA has often been used as a model antigen mixture to study the immunological mechanisms underlying the induction of Th2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jankovic et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Worsley et al., 2008</xref>). Now, two groups using different but complementary models have independently identified omega-1 as a single glycoprotein in SEA with potent Th2-polarizing properties. These findings will pave the way for the use of a defined molecule, omega-1, to further delineate the cellular mechanisms and molecular signals that drive Th2 differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Preparation and purification of egg antigens.</title><p>Freshly isolated <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs from trypsinized livers from infected hamsters were washed in RPMI medium with 300 U/ml penicillin, 300 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin, and 500 &#x000b5;g/ml fungizone.
