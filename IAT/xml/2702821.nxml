Although overall five-year survival rates of 60&#x02013;70&#x00025; are now achieved, a significant proportion of cases will die from their disease, and the intensive chemotherapeutic and radiotherapy regimes employed in treatment are associated with long-term neuroendocrine and cognitive dysfunction in surviving patients. Advances in our understanding of the biology of medulloblastoma will be essential to future improvements in therapeutic outcome, through strategies including the identification of specific targets for the development of novel therapies, and biomarkers for improved treatment stratification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006159-Ellison1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006159-Pizer1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The identification of specific genetic defects has been central to advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of medulloblastoma.

Although SNP-array data indicate that the regions of amplification are discrete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006159-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), the relationship between this novel amplification and <italic>MYC</italic> amplification at 8q24.21, was assessed by co-hybridization of RP11-383N10 and BAC probe dJ968N11, recognising <italic>MYC</italic>, in D384MED cells, to investigate whether their amplification was co-localised on a single amplicon. The combined result from over 100 cells indicated a mixed pattern of amplification in the cell population; <italic>MYC</italic> amplification alone was observed in 32&#x00025; of cells, while the novel amplification alone was observed in 28&#x00025; of the cell population. 22&#x00025; of the cells showed amplification of both regions, but in two thirds of these cells, signals generated by the two BAC probes were not co-localised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006159-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>The amplification status and physical gene content of the novel amplicon was additionally investigated using real-time PCR-based mapping. Analysis of the status of the coding genes within and surrounding the putative amplicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006159-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) showed that <italic>ZFAT1</italic>, <italic>LOC286094</italic> and <italic>KHDRBS3</italic> were amplified in both cell lines D341MED and D384MED, but not in the non-amplified MHH-MED-8A line.

The respective high level gain/amplification identified at 17q21.31, and the homozygous deletion at 6q23.1, will yield candidate target genes and facilitate the further mapping and investigation of these chromosomal aberrations.</p><p>The novel region of recurrent amplification identified at 8q24.33&#x02013;q24.23 formed the focus of our further investigations. In addition to its recurrent nature, we have demonstrated its high-copy number amplification, independence of <italic>MYC</italic> amplification, and uniqueness to medulloblastoma amongst a panel of &#x0003e;800 cell lines derived from different tumour types, indicating this novel amplicon contains key gene(s) in medulloblastoma development, with the potential to inform critical insights to disease pathogenesis. The identification of the genetic target(s) of this novel amplicon, and their validation in studies of primary tumours, and in functional models, is therefore now paramount. Our detailed genetic mapping of its physical location and gene content, and investigation of their relationship to gene expression in medulloblastoma cell lines, identified <italic>KHSRBS3</italic> and the genes encoding mi-RNA species, hsa-miR-30b and hsa-miR-30d, as putative oncogenic targets whose expression is closely correlated with amplification status.</p><p>In primary tumours, although we did not detect evidence of amplification of this target region in our cohort of primary medulloblastomas, consistent with data from a recent SNP-array screen of 212 primary medulloblastomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006159-Northcott1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, our investigations of the transcript levels of these target species further support roles in medulloblastoma. Based on these data, all three candidates, <italic>KHSRBS3</italic>, hsa-miR-30b and hsa-miR-30d, could be considered as potential targets of this novel amplification, as all showed elevated expression in a sub-set of primary medulloblastomas, measured relative to the normal cerebellum. hsa-miR-30b is arguably of most interest because, in addition to its high-level expression in cell lines which is closely correlated with amplification, it showed the greatest frequency of elevated expression in primary tumours (over 50&#x00025; of cases), with expression levels detected in certain cases equivalent to those observed in amplified cell lines. Although such investigations were beyond the scope of the limited initial primary tumour cohort employed in the current study, the clinico-pathological correlates of expression of all candidates in extensive, well characterised, and statistically powered clinical cohorts, is additionally likely to inform any potential roles in medulloblastoma.</p><p>Importantly, none of the three candidates can be fully excluded at this stage, and further investigations of their functional roles in medulloblastoma are required. The function(s) of <italic>KHDRBS3</italic>, hsa-miR-30b and hsa-miR-30d, and in particular any roles they may play in tumourigenesis, have not been widely investigated, and this is the first study, to our knowledge, to investigate their status in medulloblastoma. KHDRBS3 (KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 3) belongs to a RNA binding protein family, and regulates the variant splicing of certain target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006159-Venables1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.
