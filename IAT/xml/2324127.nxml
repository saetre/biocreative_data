However, some studies in recent years indicated that MSCs might have no plasticity or only have a limited plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and that the in vivo multi-lineage differentiation of MSCs might be a result of their fusion with the host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. That is why, recently, people have been suspicious about the plasticity of MSCs. Some researchers think that the previously separated MSCs are actually a mixed cell population containing several kinds of stem cells with different differentiation potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, how to isolate homogeneous MSCs with high plasticity becomes a ready task of researchers.</p><p>Isolation of MAPCs from adult bone marrows was firstly reported by Verfaillie&#x02019;s team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Compared with MSCs, these cells were thought to be a more primitive cell population with partially overlapping ontogeny. Moreover, MAPCs have been proven to be capable of extensive in vitro proliferation with no senescence or loss of differentiation capability. A few researchers held that when embryonic stem cells differentiate into different somatic germ layers and tissue cells, some pluripotent cells remain in specific tissues for future use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; judging from their differentiation property, MAPCs should belong to this type of cell. Although the above hypothesis needs to be further verified, this subpopulation of pluripotent stem cells provides a new thought and may serve as a new cell source for tissue engineering.</p><p>Based on the above understanding, we started our experiment with isolation of MAPCs from bone marrow of adult rats and then fully studied their differentiation potentials. MAPCs were isolated using a modified protocol of Verfaillie&#x02019; team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. By screening for cells highly expressing Oct4 from clone-like clusters, we successfully obtained a comparatively homogeneous population of MAPCs with multi-lineage differentiation potential. The present study was aimed to find a less complicated and more economical protocol for obtaining single cell-derived MAPCs and understand the molecule mechanism of multi-lineage differentiation of MAPCs. Our observations confirmed that single cell-derived MAPCs were able to transcribe Oct4 and genes of three germ layers simultaneously, and differentiate into multiple lineages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Culture and clone expansion of MAPCs</title><p>Bone marrow was obtained from 4-week-old male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley (SD) rats.

For example, stromal stem cells screened out with different molecular markers demonstrated certain varieties in growth and plasticity, and were therefore given different names, including MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], MAPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], MPCs (mesodermal progenitor cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and marrow-isolated adult multi-lineage inducible cells (MIAMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the present study, we used culture conditions similar to those of Verfaillie&#x02019;s team and successfully obtained a comparatively homogeneous population of MAPCs through the following protocol: isolating mononuclear cells from rat total bone marrow by direct adherence, eliminating non-adherent cells after three to four passages, subjecting the remaining cells to single cell clonal culture by limiting dilution technique, plating the cells at a low density of 250 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> for further passage, and finally screening for clone-like cells. We found that single cell-derived MAPCs did not express CD34, CD45, CD44, and MHC-I, which was consistent with the results of Verfaillie&#x02019;s team, who found that MAPCs were able to reserve their pluripotency when plated at a low density, and unable to do so when plated at a much higher density. With pluripotency decreasing, CD44 and MHC I turned from negative to strongly positive in MAPCs, and therefore could serve as a marker for the loss of pluripotency. It should be notified that our protocol for MAPC isolation, which involved direct adherence, passage selection, single cell clonal culture and low density passage, is less complicated and more economical than that of Verfaillie&#x02019;s team, who employed the technique of immunomagnetic microbeads. The reliability of our protocol is verified by its results. Single cell-derived MAPCs retained their multi-potential differentiation capability even after being passaged for 20 generations, and could not only give rise to adipocytes and osteoblasts (mesoderm) but to neurons, glia cells (ectoderm), and hepatocytes (endoderm).</p><p>It has been demonstrated that the isolation method and cultivation condition are vital to the isolation of bone marrow stem cells and the maintenance of stem cell property [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The latest research showed that in vitro culture of human MSCs with autologous serum is superior to FBS for the amplification and for maintaining the pluripotency of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and the original culture strategy might lead to the loss of differentiation potential of MSCs. Moreover, some researchers found that serum-free culture could upgrade the differentiation potential of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. So recently, researchers have made persistent efforts to optimize the isolation method of MSCs. For example, people have isolated another population of pluripotent cells, called marrow-isolated adult multilineage inducible (MIAMI) cells, from human bone marrow by plating whole bone marrow cells initially in media containing 5% FBS and subsequently maintaining them in the medium containing 2% FBS in fibronectin-coated dishes. These cultures were then maintained in hypoxic conditions at 1,300&#x02013;1,400 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. MIAMI cells still expressed telomerase, Oct-4, and Rex-1 even after being expanded for more than 50 population doublings. In the present study, our medium contained a low level of serum, but was supplemented with growth factor and LIF, which promoted the proliferation of MAPCs to some extent and retained their dedifferentiated state. Single cell clonal culture and low density passage may help to isolate a more homogenous cell population with strong proliferation capability.</p><p>As the marker for pluripotent stem cells, Oct-4 is closely linked with the pluripotency of MAPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our results showed that single cell-derived MAPCs not only highly expressed Oct-4 but expressed the early markers of endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm: CYP51, SM22&#x003b1;A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], GATA4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and NMDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which is the molecular basis for their differentiation into three germ layers. Woodbury&#x02019;s team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] demonstrated that MSCs expressed germline, ectodermal, endodermal, and mesodermal genes before neurogenesis. The present research extended their observations. Our observations confirm that single cell-derived MAPCs transcribe Oct4 and genes of the three germ layers simultaneously, and could differentiate into multiple lineages. It may be concluded that under appropriate circumstances, single cell-derived MAPCs can maintain not only characteristics of stem cells but multi-lineage differentiation potential which has expressed corresponding regulating genes, and single cell-derived MAPCs could differentiate into multiple lineages through quantitative modulation of regulating gene expression, rather than switching on expression of specific genes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30600651) and the Cooperation Foundation for Overseas Young Scientists (No. 30428001).
