The cytoplasmic nuclease domain of Ire1 cleaves the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding XBP-1 (X-box&#x02013;binding protein 1), enabling splicing and production of this active transcription factor. We recently showed that Ire1 activation independently induces the rapid turnover of mRNAs encoding membrane and secreted proteins in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cells through a pathway we call regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD). In this study, we show that mouse fibroblasts expressing wild-type Ire1 but not an Ire1 variant lacking nuclease activity also degrade mRNAs in response to ER stress. Using a second variant of Ire1 that is activated by a small adenosine triphosphate analogue, we show that although XBP-1 splicing can be artificially induced in the absence of ER stress, RIDD appears to require both Ire1 activity and ER stress. Our data suggest that cells use a multitiered mechanism by which different conditions in the ER lead to distinct outputs from Ire1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ER is responsible for folding and processing proteins entering the secretory pathway and uses a variety of mechanisms to adjust its capacity in response to changes in the folding burden. This collection of mechanisms, termed the unfolded protein response (UPR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>), is activated by stress caused by environmental stimuli and diseases such as viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tardif et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bechill et al., 2008</xref>) and multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carrasco et al., 2007</xref>). In metazoans, components of the UPR are essential for developmental processes requiring high levels of secretion such as the differentiation of plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gass et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iwakoshi et al., 2003</xref>) and pancreatic &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harding et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). The UPR restores ER function both by increasing its capacity and decreasing the load of new proteins through transcriptional induction of secretory pathway components and general translational attenuation. One of the key players in the UPR is Ire1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1), a conserved transmembrane protein with a luminal domain that senses protein misfolding in the ER. The resulting oligomerization of Ire1 leads to activation of its cytoplasmic kinase and endoribonuclease domain. The main function of the kinase appears to be activation of the nuclease, which requires binding of ATP or ADP in the active site of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Papa et al., 2003</xref>). The nuclease in turn cleaves two specific sites in the mRNA encoding XBP-1 (X-box&#x02013;binding protein 1), a conserved UPR transcription factor, which leads to XBP-1 activation and translation through removal of a regulatory intron.</p><p>We have recently shown that Ire1 in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cells independently mediates the cleavage and degradation of mRNAs encoding proteins that traverse the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>). This new branch of the UPR, which we call regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD), has the potential to selectively relieve the burden on the ER while clearing the translation and translocation machinery for the subsequent influx of new proteins induced by the UPR. Studies on the regulation of specific messages suggest that the RIDD pathway also operates in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tirasophon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iwawaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Iqbal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lipson et al., 2008</xref>). Mammals express two isoforms of Ire1: Ire1-&#x003b1; is expressed ubiquitously, and Ire1-&#x003b2; is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. Overexpression of Ire1-&#x003b1; leads to cleavage of its own message in COS-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tirasophon et al., 2000</xref>) and reduced levels of the message encoding CD59 (complement defense 59) in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oikawa et al., 2007</xref>). Ire1-&#x003b1; also appears to mediate the degradation of insulin transcripts in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells under chronic high glucose conditions, perhaps promoting cell survival during extreme chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lipson et al., 2008</xref>). Ire1-&#x003b2; appears to have alternative targets as well, mediating cleavage of the 28-S ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iwawaki et al., 2001</xref>) and the mRNA encoding microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, an ER chaperone important for the assembly of lipid transport vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Iqbal et al., 2008</xref>). Together, these examples of Ire1 function in mRNA decay may explain observations that Ire1 in metazoans has a broader range of physiological outputs than XBP-1 splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we take advantage of mouse fibroblasts lacking Ire1 activity, both to confirm that RIDD is conserved in mammalian cells and to investigate the functional requirements of RIDD. By expressing wild-type and mutant variants of Ire1-&#x003b1;, we find that the nuclease activity of Ire1 is required for both splicing and RIDD. However, these two outputs can be differentially triggered, revealing an unexpected complexity in Ire1 activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Ire1 degrades mRNAs in response to ER stress in mouse fibroblasts</title><p>To determine whether the RIDD pathway functions in mammals as well as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we used a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al. (2002)</xref> in which the Ire1-&#x003b1; gene has been disrupted. We stably introduced human Ire1-&#x003b1; (hIre1) into these cells using flippase-mediated, site-directed recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen and Panning, 2007</xref>), which allowed us to insert the wild-type and hIre1 variants discussed in the next sections into the same sites within the genome. In response to various forms of chemically induced ER stress, the reconstituted cells (referred to here as <italic>hIre1<sup>R</sup></italic>) but not the Ire1 knockout (<italic>Ire1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) cells induced the splicing of XBP-1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Both cell lines strongly induced immunoglobin-binding protein (BiP), an abundant ER chaperone, in response to ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), which is in agreement with previous observations that BiP induction is Ire1 independent in mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). As expected, induction of ERdj4, a transcriptional target of the Ire1/XBP-1 branch of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2003</xref>), was stronger in the <italic>hIre1<sup>R</sup></italic> cells compared with <italic>Ire1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, especially in response to DTT, a reducing agent which disrupts disulfide bond formation in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>mRNAs are down-regulated in response to multiple stressors in an Ire1-dependent manner.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) mRNA abundance for targets of ER stress in <italic>hIre1<sup>R</sup></italic> and <italic>Ire1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells treated with 2 mM DTT (A), 3 &#x000b5;g/ml Tm (B), or 500 nM thapsigargin (C) for 5 h relative to untreated cells.

We induced ER stress in the <italic>Ire1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>hIre1<sup>R</sup></italic> cells with DTT, purified total RNA from treated and untreated cells, amplified and labeled these samples, and hybridized them to whole-genome MEEBOChip arrays. As expected, treatment of our <italic>hIre1<sup>R</sup></italic> cells with DTT led to the induction of classical UPR targets to levels comparable with that seen by others in wild-type cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200903014/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the RIDD pathway functioning in these cells, we observed that several RNAs were down-regulated in response to ER stress in the <italic>hIre1<sup>R</sup></italic> but not the <italic>Ire1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and Fig. S1). Although &#x0223c;120 mRNAs fell into this category in the array data, the magnitudes of the changes in expression were generally small (many were twofold or less) compared with those seen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, where many RNAs were down-regulated by 5&#x02013;10-fold. Despite the relatively small changes for individual messages, the effect of down-regulating mRNAs at the ER surface may profoundly impact the folding burden of the ER. For example, the redistribution of certain nascent proteins from the ER to the cytosol during ER stress significantly impacts cell survival, although the effect on translocation is similar in magnitude to RIDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To limit false positives, we applied a series of strict criteria for identifying the most likely RIDD targets (see Materials and methods); the results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>. We confirmed the regulation of several of these targets by reverse transcription followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and Fig. S1). To determine whether the down-regulation was a general response to ER stress or was restricted to DTT, we also treated cells with tunicamycin (Tm), which inhibits N-linked glycosylation or thapsigargin, which disrupts calcium homeostasis. All candidate RIDD targets tested were down-regulated in response to these three forms of ER stress in an Ire1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1,

First, the down-regulation of mouse target mRNAs was independent of XBP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Using RNAi to deplete Ire1 from cells lacking a functional XBP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2003</xref>), we found that Ire1-dependent down-regulation of several target mRNAs occurred in the absence of XBP-1. As a control, in cells lacking XBP-1, ERdj4 was induced only to the level seen in <italic>Ire1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells, and this induction was insensitive to Ire1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Second, the down-regulation of many mouse targets was achieved through an increase in their decay rates. We inhibited transcription with actinomycin D and monitored mRNA levels over time in the absence and presence of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200903014/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). For 7 of the 11 targets tested, the decreases in mRNA abundance were dependent not on transcription but on increased rates of mRNA degradation. Third, as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, the set of targets in mouse cells is highly enriched for mRNAs encoding membrane proteins. 17 of the 22 targets in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> that were assigned localization annotations in the mouse genome encode membrane or ECM proteins, as do 6 of the 7 confirmed targets that displayed increased decay rates. The seventh confirmed target, Blos1, encodes a protein that does not appear to contain a membrane-spanning domain itself but is part of a complex detected in both cytosolic and peripheral membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Starcevic and Dell'Angelica, 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>mRNAs down-regulated by Ire1 are degraded faster in the presence of ER stress.</bold><italic>hIre1<sup>R</sup></italic>, <italic>Ire1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, or NIH-3T3 cells were treated with 1 &#x000b5;g/ml actinomycin D and/or 2 mM DTT, and relative mRNA abundance was monitored over time by qPCR.

As in our reconstituted cells, NIH-3T3 cells displayed increased decay rates and lower abundance for RIDD targets in the presence of DTT. Collectively, our data indicate that RIDD is a general, conserved pathway associated with folding stress in the ER.</p></sec><sec><title>The nuclease activity of Ire1 is required for RIDD</title><p>Because the parent <italic>Ire1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cell line lacks Ire1 activity, we could probe specific functions of Ire1 by inserting variants of hIre1 containing point mutations into these cells in an isogenic manner. Using this approach, we expressed an hIre1 variant containing a single point mutation (D847A) that has been previously shown to compromise the nuclease activity of hIre1 while leaving the kinase activity intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tirasophon et al., 2000</xref>). For these experiments, we used C-terminally Flag-tagged versions of both the wild-type and mutant Ire1 and confirmed by Western blotting that the hIre-D847A variant was expressed at similar levels to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Consistent with a lack of nuclease activity, cells expressing hIre1-D847A did not support XBP-1 splicing in the absence or presence of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) and induced ERdj4 only to the level seen in <italic>Ire1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>).

This variant, I642G in hIre1, has very little activity in the absence of the ATP analogue 1NM-PP1 (4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-[1'-naphthylmethyl]pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine). Binding allows activation of the nuclease while simultaneously inhibiting the kinase activity of Ire1-I642G. In HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2007</xref>) and MEF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Han et al., 2008</xref>), hIre1-I642G splices XBP-1 and induces the UPR upon binding 1NM-PP1 alone, even in the absence of ER stress. To test whether activation of Ire1 is sufficient for degradation of RIDD substrates, we introduced hIre1-I642G into <italic>Ire1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells and tested its activity in the absence and presence of 1NM-PP1 and ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Treatment of mouse cells expressing hIre1-I642G with 1NM-PP1 was sufficient to induce splicing of XBP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and transcriptional induction of the Ire1/XBP-1 target ERdj4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). This Ire1 activity was not caused by a general induction of ER stress, as cells lacking Ire1 or expressing the wild-type hIre1 were insensitive to 1NM-PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), although the drug did suppress the Ire1-independent induction of ERdj4 by DTT in all strains through an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The 1NM-PP1&#x02013;induced activation of hIre1-I642G was not caused by increased levels of the protein, as assayed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Thus, our data are consistent with a 1NM-PP1&#x02013;induced conformational change in the Ire1 variant itself, as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Papa et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Activation of Ire1 is not sufficient for RIDD.</bold> (A) Percentage of spliced XBP-1 in the absence (gray bars) and presence (black bars) of 7 &#x000b5;M 1NM-PP1 in the indicated cell lines.

Treatment of cells expressing Ire1-I642G with DTT or Tm alone (in the absence of 1NM-PP1) had very little effect on splicing or RIDD targets. However, cells treated with both 1NM-PP1 and ER stress degraded RIDD targets to similar levels as those expressing the wild-type Ire1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>). As a further control, we confirmed the XBP-1 independence of RIDD in these cells. XBP-1 is transcriptionally induced in our cells in a largely Ire1-independent manner and therefore does not occur to a significant extent in cells treated with 1NM-PP1 alone. Therefore, we depleted XBP-1 from cells expressing Ire1-I642G using RNAi, and although this blocked induction of ERdj4 by DTT, RIDD remained intact when cells were treated with both 1NM-PP1 and DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the lack of RIDD in our 1NM-PP1&#x02013;induced cells is merely a threshold effect, we treated cells with higher concentrations of 1NM-PP1, such that no further XBP-1 splicing or ERdj4 activation could be achieved with 1NM-PP1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, G and H</xref>). The levels of XBP-1 splicing in cells expressing hIre1-I642G treated with 30 &#x000b5;M 1NM-PP1 were as high or higher than those seen in wild-type cells treated with low concentrations of DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>) or with Tm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), where RIDD was clearly functioning. Note that although XBP-1 splicing appears insensitive to low concentrations of DTT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>, we observed partial splicing shortly after the addition of DTT followed by rapid recovery before changes in gene expression could be reliably measured. For cells expressing wild-type hIre1, ERdj4 and RIDD appeared to be activated in parallel by low DTT concentrations, suggesting that RIDD is not limited to extreme ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>). In contrast to splicing and activation of ERdj4, no change in mRNA abundance for RIDD targets was detected in cells expressing hIre1-I642G and treated with 1NM-PP1 alone, even at high concentrations, although the cells were still capable of inducing RIDD when treated with 1NM-PP1 and DTT together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>). In summary, although XBP-1 splicing and downstream transcriptional induction can be artificially induced with 1NM-PP1, RIDD cannot.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for the mechanism of RIDD</title><p>Our results indicate that in mammalian cells, RIDD requires an active Ire1 nuclease domain but does not, per se, depend on Ire1's kinase activity. ER stress&#x02013;dependent degradation of RNAs by hIre1-I642G was seen at concentrations of 1NM-PP1 &#x0223c;1.5-fold higher than those that inhibited the kinase activity of the protein in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Papa et al., 2003</xref>) and sixfold higher than those that inhibited kinase activity in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). These data, together with the observation that RIDD does not require new transcription, are consistent with a direct mechanism of mRNA target cleavage by Ire1, although we cannot rule out an alternative role for Ire1's nuclease activity and/or the involvement of other nucleases.</p><p>However, our data also indicate that activation of Ire1's nuclease is not sufficient for RIDD. This observation represents a mechanistic divergence between RIDD and Ire's well-established role in XBP-1 splicing, which is induced by 1NM-PP1 activation of hIre1-I642G. There are several potential explanations for this. It may be that Ire1 assumes a distinct conformation or oligomerization state when activated by 1NM-PP1 versus ER stress and that although the former is sufficient for splicing XBP-1, the latter is required for RIDD. For example, it was recently found that yeast Ire1 forms higher order oligomers that lead to higher levels of RNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>). Such oligomers may form only in the presence of misfolded proteins or, conversely, in the absence of binding to BiP, an ER chaperone which binds Ire1 and is titrated off by misfolded proteins during ER stress. A second possibility is that other factors activated by ER stress are necessary for RIDD. Although new transcription of such a factor is not required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), there may be proteins recruited or activated by ER stress that are important for mRNA decay but not for splicing. Finally, the complement of mRNAs available for targeting to this decay pathway may change upon subjecting cells to ER stress. Certain signal sequences are sensitive to the ER folding environment and influence how associated ribosomes partition between the ER and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kang et al., 2006</xref>); thus, a substantial change in the pool of mRNAs associated with the ER membrane under stress conditions could affect the RIDD pathway.</p><p>The fact that the two outputs of Ire1's nuclease activity, RIDD and XBP-1 splicing, can be differentially activated reveals an unanticipated complexity in the UPR. Growing evidence suggests that various sensors associated with the UPR are activated under different conditions, allowing for specific responses to different forms of ER stress in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gass et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DuRose et al., 2006</xref>). This customization of responses may extend to activation within Ire1 itself. Activation of XBP-1 leads to a protective remodeling and expansion of the secretory pathway, whereas RIDD reduces the load of incoming proteins. Under certain physiological situations, e.g., during plasma cell development, activating the XBP-1&#x02013;dependent remodeling pathway without inducing RIDD may be more beneficial; thus, cells may induce an active state of Ire1 that is similar to the 1NM-PP1&#x02013;mediated activation described in this study. In contrast, conditions such as viral infection may call for a more destructive response that limits the load of incoming proteins, which is analogous to the effects of reduced translation mediated by the PERK (PKR-like ER kinase) branch of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harding et al., 2000</xref>). Intriguingly, both hepatitis C virus and human cytomegalovirus induce Ire1 but appear to block downstream effects of XBP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tardif et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Isler et al., 2005</xref>). However, hepatitis C virus protein production is increased in the absence of Ire1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tardif et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that an alternate activity of Ire1 such as RIDD may be attenuating viral protein synthesis. It remains to be determined what role RIDD may play in viral infection and other physiological stress conditions, but the ability of this pathway to function in mammalian cells and the potential to decouple it from XBP-1 splicing could allow for a more specific and effective response to changing conditions within the ER.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Establishment of Ire1-expressing cell lines and RNAi</title><p><italic>Ire1-&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> MEFs were obtained from R.
