The infection starts with the uptake of the metabolically inactive elementary bodies (EBs) by the eukaryotic cell. EBs differentiate to metabolically active reticulate bodies (RBs) which replicate in a vacuole inside the host cell. RBs re-differentiate to EBs, which are then released from the cells to initiate a new cycle of infection. Despite the fact that they are strictly dependent on host eukaryotic cells for their growth, infections with <italic>Chlamydia</italic> are the cause of several human diseases. Among these, <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> infection induces respiratory disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Grayston1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> has been demonstrated to be the major causative of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases and ocular infections leading to blindness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Grayston2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Modulation of host cell apoptosis is an important immune escape mechanism employed by a broad range of viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens. For instance, several pathogenic bacteria like <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. and <italic>Yersinia</italic> spp. induce apoptosis in macrophages to avoid their destruction by these powerful immune effector cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Hilbi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Obligate intracellular bacteria like <italic>Rickettsia</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> have evolved strategies to increase the resistance of their host cells for apoptotic stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Clifton1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Fischer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Inhibition of host cell apoptosis may protect the replicating bacteria from the action of cytotoxic T cells, which eliminate infected cells by the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, an important aspect of preventing apoptosis in infected cells is the chronic infection. <italic>Chlamydia</italic> spp. can persist inside the infected cells and apoptosis inhibition may even prolong the life span of the host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Dean1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanisms of apoptosis induction have been worked out in great detail. Apoptosis is primarily induced by two major pathways namely the &#x02018;extrinsic&#x02019; or the death receptor-mediated or by the &#x02018;intrinsic&#x02019; or the mitochondria-mediated pathways. Caspases, the effector proteases are activated either by the binding of death ligand to the receptors or by the release of pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Thornberry1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Initiator caspases are activated independent of cleavage by recruitment to large signaling complexes assembled by the ligation of death receptors. For instance, caspase-8 is activated by the Fas receptor associated <italic>death inducing signaling complex</italic> (DISC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Peter1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and caspase-9 is activated by the apoptosome triggered by cytochrome c released from mitochondria into the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Green1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) constitute an important class of apoptosis regulators as they can directly bind and prevent the activation of effector caspases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Salvesen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. During apoptosis, the mitochondrial outer membrane is permeabilized and is primarily accomplished by the activation of &#x0201c;pro-apoptotic&#x0201d; Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak. Activation of Bax and Bak can be counteracted by the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members like Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, Mcl-1 and A1. Mcl-1 was identified as an early induction gene during myeloblastic cell differentiation and has also been established to play a crucial role in the survival and homeostasis of lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Opferman1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Opferman2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Mcl-1 has a fast turnover rate and several growth factors modulate the expression of Mcl-1 both at the transcriptional as well as post-translational levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Cuconati1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Mcl-1 has a strong binding affinity for BH3-only family member Bim, and is localized in a complex with Bim and Bak at the mitochondrial outer membrane. The Bim-Mcl-1 complex has been shown to be disrupted during induction of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Han1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One of the major mechanisms by which the immune system clears intracellular infections is by Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated cytotoxicity. CTLs and Natural killer cells (NK) utilize two main pathways to activate target cell death, Fas and Granzyme/perforin. While the FAS-mediated apoptosis pathway also plays an important role in lymphocyte homeostasis, granule-mediated killing is vital for clearing intracellular infection, tumor surveillance and transplant rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Barry1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Granzyme B (GrB), one of the important and well-studied proteases of CTLs is a serine protease with an unusual specificity to cleave substrates at aspartic residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Odake1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. GrB is stored in cytoplasmic granules in the CTLs and NK cells and is delivered to the target cells in a perforin-dependent manner. Though GrB can directly cleave caspase-3, it is still dependent on the permeabilisation of mitochondrial outer membrane as release of Smac/DIABLO is required to inhibit XIAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Goping1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous studies have revealed that cells infected with <italic>Chlamydia</italic> resist cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release in response to several apoptotic stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Fan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Fischer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Contradictory to the published observations, we have failed to detect a specific degradation of the BH3 only family members in the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infected cells. Using epithelial cells as infection model, we demonstrate here that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection activates both the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway as well as the PI3K/AKT pathway to resist apoptosis induced by GrB, stress and death receptor. Infection with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> leads to the MEK-dependent up-regulation of Mcl-1 mRNA and PI3K-dependent stabilization of Mcl-1 protein levels. Depletion of Mcl-1 reverses the block in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and sensitizes infected cells to apoptosis induced by GrB, stress and death receptor-mediated pathways. Our data suggest the up-regulation and stabilization of Mcl-1 are crucial events for the apoptosis resistance of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>-infected cells for a broad range of apoptotic stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mcl-1 is up-regulated in a MAPK-dependent fashion in infected cells</title><p>Cells infected with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> have previously been demonstrated to resist the activation of Bax and Bak to prevent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Fischer3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Using RNA interference screens, we identified host factors which upon knockdown sensitized infected cells for apoptosis induced by ligation of the TNF receptor (unpublished data). Since a dominant role of anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in regulating mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization is well documented, we searched for such factors among the hit list. The only anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member identified by this approach was Mcl-1. In addition, Mcl-1 has previously been demonstrated to be significantly up-regulated in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Hess1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Xia1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. To confirm the latter observations, we tested for the mRNA and protein levels of Mcl-1 in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>-infected cells. Q-PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed that Mcl-1 is strongly up-regulated in a time dependent manner in HeLa cells infected with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003102-g001">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). Mcl-1 was also up-regulated in infected human primary End-1 cells (endocervical epithelial cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003102-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), and HEp-2 cells (data not shown), suggesting that Mcl-1 up-regulation is a general effect of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection. As Mcl-1 has been shown to be profoundly regulated by MAPK signaling, we investigated the role of MAPK pathways towards the up-regulation of Mcl-1 and resistance to apoptosis in infected cells. To perform these experiments, we first checked if the RAS/MAPK cascade is activated in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infected cells. Previous studies have also demonstrated that acute infection with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> can activate MAPK in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Su1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with the published observations, Ras-GTP could be pulled down from the infected cells at 15 h post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003102-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) and Raf, ERK and AKT were activated as revealed by their active-phosphorylation status during the early and late phase of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003102-g001">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). To further analyze if MAPK pathways play any role in modulating Mcl-1 levels in the infected cells, we exploited the use of chemical inhibitors. HeLa cells were infected in the presence or absence of MEK-1 inhibitor U0126 or the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. While treatment of infected cells with U0126 did not exert any significant alteration in the chlamydial growth or cell survival, treatment with LY294002 caused a defect in the fusion of inclusions suggesting that PI3K pathway may play a crucial role in the fusion of chlamydial inclusions (data not shown). Q-PCR analysis of Mcl-1 mRNA levels revealed that Mcl-1 was up-regulated in the infected cells in a MEK-dependent fashion, while cIAP-2 levels remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003102-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). As Mcl-1 protein levels were also shown to be influenced by PI3K activation, we infected HeLa cells and the protein levels of Mcl-1 were monitored after treatment with MAPK inhibitors. Inhibition of PI3K leads to complete loss of Mcl-1 protein levels in the control and infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003102-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>), suggesting a role for MEK-1 and PI3K pathways in modulating the expression and stabilization of Mcl-1.</p><fig id="pone-0003102-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003102.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mcl-1 is up-regulated via MAPK pathways during <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection.</title><p>(A,B) HeLa cells were infected with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (MOI 3) and the expression of Mcl-1 was determined in HeLa cells by q-PCR (A) and in HeLa and End-1 cells by immunoblot analysis, at various time points post infection (B).

However, sensitization to apoptosis was confined only to cells that carry small inclusions in the range of 4 to 8 &#x000b5;m, while the cells which carry inclusions larger than 10 &#x000b5;m still resisted apoptosis despite the suppression of Mcl-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003102.s002">Fig. S1</xref>), suggesting that apoptosis resistance depends on the host cell signaling machinery only during the early stages of infection. We therefore performed time course experiments and tested for cleaved PARP as readout for apoptosis to further substantiate our initial finding with a different assay at different time points.

To test if silencing of Mcl-1 can rescue mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and release of pro-apoptotic proteins from the mitochondria of infected cells, the release of Smac/DIABLO, a direct inhibitor of IAPs, from the mitochondria after apoptosis induction was analyzed. Loss of Mcl-1 led to the release of Smac in the infected cells when induced to apoptosis with TNF/CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003102-g005">Fig. 5A,B</xref>; for enlarged versions see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003102.s008">Fig. S7</xref>).

The initial phase of the infection cycle, characterized by full sensitivity of the host cell for apoptotic stimuli, is followed by a time window from about 16 to 24 hours post infection during which apoptosis resistance depends on the activation of host anti-apoptotic factors like IAPs and Mcl-1. Recently it has been suggested, that apoptosis inhibition by <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> does neither require IAPs nor Mcl-1 in cells derived from genetically modified mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Ying2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Apart from the species and cell type specific differences, these discrepancies could also be attributed to the stage of infection or inclusion size. Consistent with these observations, we detected that host cells are fully resistant to apoptotic stimuli during late phase infections despite the loss of IAPs or Mcl-1 (data not shown). The mechanism underlying apoptosis resistance during the late phase of infection is not known; it is, however, tempting to speculate that bacterial factors then directly interfere with the host cells' apoptosis machinery.</p><p>It has been suggested that the block in apoptosis signaling depends on the downregulation of BH3-only proteins in cells infected with <italic>Chlamydia</italic> since depletion of several of these activators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathways has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Fischer2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Ying1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast to these reports, we could, however, not detect significant and long-lasting depletion of BH3-only proteins using immunofluorescence and immunoblot techniques with carefully validated antisera. The observed discrepancy could not be attributed to the infection conditions as we have detected a decrease in protein levels of keratin 8, a substrate of <italic>chlamydial</italic> protease-like activity factor, CPAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Dong2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, with the onset of chlamydial growth, in our experiments. Another possibility is the unspecific degradation of proteins in lysates of infected cells (K.R., T.R., unpublished observations). In any case, degradation of BH3-only proteins can not be the (only) reason for apoptosis resistance in infected cells.</p><p>Recently, we have demonstrated that cells infected with <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Paland1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> resist TNF-induced apoptosis primarily by the up-regulation of cIAP-2 and the stabilization of IAP-IAP complexes to block the processing and activation of effector caspases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Rajalingam2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The resistance to TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis at the caspase-3 level suggests that cells infected with <italic>Chlamydia</italic> resist the release of Smac, which is indeed required during TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis to relieve the inhibition on caspases-3 processing and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Rajalingam3">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that the block in the release of Smac from the mitochondria is reverted in the infected cells upon apoptosis induction suggesting that Mcl-1 is probably the prime block upstream of mitochondria modulating the release of Smac in these cells. Of interest in the same lines is also a recent study made by Mimuro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Mimuro1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, which demonstrates the CagA dependent upregulation of Mcl-1 in gastric pits to prevent the replenishment of gastric epithelium and to sustain <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. Thus activation of MAPK and upregulation of Mcl-1 may be a more general strategy in combating host cell apoptosis for successful infection.</p><p>Our data show that MAPK pathways activated by <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> play a crucial role in maintaining apoptosis resistance in the infected cells in response to different apoptosis inducers. Most importantly, we have investigated strategies employed by <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> to resist GrB-mediated apoptosis, the most relevant apoptotic pathway employed by the CTLs to clear intracellular infections. Mitochondria play a crucial role during several pathways of apoptosis induction including the GrB pathway. Viruses and bacteria have evolved strategies to modulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization either by regulating the levels of host Bcl-2 family proteins or by the release of effector proteins to host cell cytosol to directly influence mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Mller1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies have revealed the important role of Mcl-1 in modulating mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization as destabilizing Mcl-1 can induce the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-Maurer1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the strong up-regulation and stabilization of Mcl-1 during acute and persistent infections explains the previous observation of a complete block of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization in the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infected cells.</p><p><italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection activates Ras which in turn can activate the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway. We found that active MEK-1 is responsible for the upregulation of Mcl-1 mRNA while an active PI3K pathway is required for the stabilization of Mcl-1 protein levels. Interestingly, we have detected that the Raf/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT pathway are also required for the infection-induced stabilization of cIAP-2 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003102.s007">Fig. S6</xref>). This may explain why inhibition of either of these MAPK pathways sensitized infected cells to GrB-, stress- and death receptor-mediated induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003102-g003">Fig. 3</xref> and data not shown). We therefore propose the following model for apoptosis resistance in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003102-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>): During the early phase of infection, Mcl-1 and IAPs are upregulated and stabilized in a MAPK-dependent manner. Infection-induced upregulation of Mcl-1 prevents the release of the IAP antagonist Smac/DIABLO whereas IAP upregulation directly prevents the activation of caspases-3. In this model, interference with MAPK signaling affects both branches of apoptosis inhibition up- and down-stream of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003102-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). Depletion of Mcl-1 sensitizes infected cells for the release of the strong IAP antagonist Smac/DIABLO whereas downregulation of IAPs may allow the activation of caspases in the absence of significant cytosolic levels of Smac/DIABLO.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Propagation of <italic>Chlamydia</italic></title><p><italic>C. trachomatis</italic> LGV serovar L2 was propagated in HEp-2 cells and purified as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003102-AlYounes1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

For each field, the latter cells were counted manually and the percentage of such cells in the total number of cells was calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003102.s001"><label>Materials and Methods S1</label><caption><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0003102.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003102.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Sensitization to apoptosis is confined only to cells carrying small inclusions.
