Receptor-interacting proteins such as corepressors and coactivators play a crucial role in specifying the overall transcriptional activity of the receptor in response to ligand treatment. Little is known however on how receptor activity is controlled by intermediary factors which interact with RARs in a ligand-independent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have identified the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), a transcriptional corepressor, to be a RAR-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid assay. We confirmed this interaction by GST-pull down assays and show that the PLZF N-terminal zinc finger domain is necessary and sufficient for PLZF to bind RAR. The RAR ligand binding domain displayed the highest affinity for PLZF, but corepressor and coactivator binding interfaces did not contribute to PLZF recruitment. The interaction was ligand-independent and correlated to a decreased transcriptional activity of the RXR-RAR heterodimer upon overexpression of PLZF. A similar transcriptional interference could be observed with the estrogen receptor alpha and the glucocorticoid receptor. We further show that PLZF is likely to act by preventing RXR-RAR heterodimerization, both <italic>in-vitro </italic>and in intact cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Thus RAR and PLZF interact physically and functionally. Intriguingly, these two transcription factors play a determining role in hematopoiesis and regionalization of the hindbrain and may, upon chromosomal translocation, form fusion proteins. Our observations therefore define a novel mechanism by which RARs activity may be controlled.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>atRA receptors (RARs) &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; and 9-cis retinoic acid receptors &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; (RXRs) are encoded by three different genes and are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. They function as ligand-inducible transcription factors in the form of RAR/RXR heterodimers. RAR is activated by atRA and binding of this ligand induces receptor conformational changes that switch on transcription of genes containing RA Response Elements (RAREs) by favoring coactivator tethering to regulated promoters. This protein complex assembly at regulated promoters induces chromatin remodeling and increased binding of RNA polymerase II to these promoters, thereby inducing a variety of biological effects (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). While a detailed understanding of the ligand-dependent activation of RARs has been achieved by structural and functional studies, little is known about factors regulating the activity of the unliganded receptor. We therefore undertook a 2-hybrid screen in yeast using an AF2-inactivated hRAR&#x003b1; as a bait, thus unable to respond transcriptionally to ligand, to identify proteins potentially able to regulate RAR functions in a ligand-independent manner. Among the identified proteins, PLZF was found to physically interact with RAR&#x003b1; through its zinc finger domain.</p><p>The human promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein is a 673 amino acid (AA) transcriptional repressor belonging to a large protein family characterized by a 120 AA N-terminal bric-&#x000e0;-brac, tramtrack, brad complex (BTB)/poxvirus zinc finger (POZ) domain. Proteins containing this BTB/POZ domain are associated to multiple functions such as development, embryogenesis and chromatin remodeling. The BTB/POZ domain allows protein homodimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and is involved in the recruitment of transcriptional corepressor complexes (NCoR) harboring histone deacetylases (HDAC) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, this multimeric NCoR complex has been shown to provide a docking site for eight-twenty one (ETO), a non-DNA binding transcriptional repressor fused to the transcriptional activator AML1 in acute myelogenous leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Another structural feature of PLZF is its C-terminal DNA binding domain made of nine C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub><italic>Kruppel</italic>-like zinc fingers that binds the consensus sequence GTACAGTTSCAU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The first two zinc fingers are dispensable for DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], although other domains of the protein seem to contribute to the DNA binding specificity by restricting the DNA binding repertoire of PLZF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Finally, a proline-rich and an acidic domains are found in the central part of the molecule (see also Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for more details).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Structure and properties of the bait RAR mutant and of one of the identified preys, PLZF. </bold>A) Schematic representation of the nuclear receptor RAR&#x003b1; and structural localization of the two mutations K262A and K244A.

However, its localization to nuclear bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which are nuclear structures associated to a central, transcriptional regulatory role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], as well as its down regulation upon myeloid cell differentiation hint at a crucial role in cell growth control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Indeed, genetic ablation of the PLZF gene in mice led to aberrant limb modeling resulting from deregulated cell proliferation and apoptosis, and also suggested that PLZF is, like <italic>all trans </italic>retinoic acid (atRA), a critical regulator of the linear expression of the Hox gene cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Another strong argument for the biological importance of PLZF is the association of the chromosomal translocation t(11;17) to a rare variant of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which fuses the PLZF protein to retinoic acid receptor " (RAR&#x003b1;, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). The PLZF-RAR&#x003b1; fusion protein maintains most of the DNA and dimerization properties of both moieties, and PLZF-RAR binds to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) as a heterodimeric partner of RXR, interfering with RAR&#x003b1; functions by exerting a dominant negative effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The resistance of t(11;17) APL to pharmacological doses of atRA contrasts with the sensitivity of the more common t(15;17) APL, which is characterized by a fusion between the promyelocytic leukemia transcription factor PML and the RAR&#x003b1; proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus the highly stable, targeted recruitment of NCoRs and HDACs to PLZF-RAR, mostly through the BTB/POZ domain, is likely to underlie the pathogenesis of the t(11;17) APL and renders it refractory to atRA chemotherapy, although additional factors are involved in the t(11;17)-induced leukemogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the PML protein acts either as a corepressor or a coactivator in a DNA-binding independent manner. PML gene inactivation leads to a strongly decreased transcriptional activation of the p21 gene and to impaired myeloid differentiation in response to retinoid stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Consistent with its role of coactivator, it has been shown to be integrated in the DRIP complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and to interact with CBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Thus, quite intriguingly, PML and RAR have a functional relationship during transcriptional regulatory processes, and are chromosomal translocation partners. In this paper, we describe the physical interaction of PLZF with RAR&#x003b1; and explore the functional consequences of this interaction on retinoid-regulated transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>PLZF interacts with RAR&#x003b1; <italic>in-vitro</italic></title><p>In a search for proteins that could interact with the unliganded, transcriptionally inactive RAR&#x003b1;, we set up a yeast two hybrid screen using a mutated receptor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Mutations were designed on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of the RAR&#x003b1; ligand binding domain (LBD). It defines K262 as establishing salt bridges with E412 and E415 of the RAR&#x003b1; activating function 2 (AF2) activating domain (AD) upon agonist binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Mutation of K262 and of the neighboring K244 into alanine residues (RAR&#x003b1; 2 K) prevents the ligand-induced folding of RAR&#x003b1; AF2, impedes coactivator recruitment, weakens corepressor interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and inactivates the transcriptional activity of RAR&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>A human ovary cDNA library was screened for interaction with RAR&#x003b1; 2 K and twelve positive clones were isolated and further characterized by DNA sequencing. A BLAST search indicated that we isolated, among these clones, a cDNA encoding amino acids 389 to 658 of human promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), thus encompassing the first three N-terminal zinc fingers (ZF) of the PLZF DNA-binding domain. Although PLZF has been reported to interact specifically with LexA consensus binding sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the two N-terminal ZF are dispensable for this activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We therefore carried out <italic>in-vitro </italic>protein interaction assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) using the three PLZF Nt-ZF fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST-PLZF 3ZF) to determine its ability to bind to full length RAR&#x003b1;, RAR&#x003b1; 2 K, or various deletion mutants of this receptor [AF1: RAR&#x003b1; AF1 (AAs 1&#x02013;88); LBD: RAR&#x003b1; LBD (AAs 152&#x02013;462); RAR&#x003b1;)403 (AAs 1 to 403)]. As a control for specificity, we used RXR&#x003b1;, a nuclear receptor displaying strong sequence homologies with RAR in the DNA binding domain, but harboring significant sequence divergence in both the AF1 and AF2 regions. As expected, PLZF 3ZF interacted with RAR&#x003b1; in a ligand-independent manner, as well as with the AF2-inactivated RAR&#x003b1; 2 K mutant. Thus ligand-induced structural transitions do not affect PLZF/RAR&#x003b1; interactions and are not conditioned by AF2-AD positioning, as confirmed by the interaction of RAR&#x003b1;)403 with PLZF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The isolated RAR&#x003b1; AF1 domain did not retain a strong affinity for PLZF 3ZF, however, a weak but reproducible interaction was detected with the LBD moiety of the receptor. RXR&#x003b1; did not bind to PLZF 3ZF, suggesting that some degree of specificity may be achieved in the PLZF/nuclear receptors interaction. Reciprocal protein interaction assays were then carried out using wild type RAR&#x003b1; or RAR&#x003b1; 2 K, and functional domains of human PLZF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Full length PLZF interacted with wild type RAR&#x003b1; and RAR&#x003b1; 2 K in a ligand-independent manner, suggesting that intra molecular interactions do not affect PLZF affinity for RAR&#x003b1;. The DNA binding domain of PLZF, comprising 9 C2H2 zinc fingers, interacted significantly with wild type RAR&#x003b1; and RAR&#x003b1; 2 K, demonstrating that this domain is necessary and sufficient to promote the physical association of RAR&#x003b1; with PLZF. None of the other isolated structural domains (BTB/POZ, acidic or proline-rich) demonstrated detectable binding to RAR&#x003b1; or to RAR&#x003b1; 2 K.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction of RAR&#x003b1; with the first three N-terminal zinc fingers of the DNA-binding domain of PLZF. </bold>A) Bacterially expressed GST-PLZF 3ZF fusion protein was used to generate an affinity matrix with which (panel B) <sup>35</sup>S-labeled full length RAR&#x003b1;, RAR&#x003b1; 2 K, isolated functional domains (RAR&#x003b1; AF1, RAR&#x003b1; AF2) or RAR&#x003b1; deleted of its AF2-AD and the domain F (RAR&#x003b1; &#x00394;403) were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 &#x003bc;M atRA.

HeLa cells were transfected with a chimeric retinoid-responsive reporter gene insensitive to endogenous receptors, a derivative of RXR&#x003b1; able to bind to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) and RAR&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Adding increasing amounts of PLZF 3ZF efficiently repressed the retinoid-induced activity of RAR&#x003b1;, and full length PLZF exhibited a similar property, albeit to a lesser extent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Overexpression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase did not alter the responsiveness of the system, suggesting that the observed effect is specific for PLZF and its derivatives. A likely explanation for this functional interference would be that PLZF interaction prevents RAR&#x003b1;-lignad interaction. We excluded this possibility by carrying out ligand binding experiments which showed no interference of PLZF with the ligand binding activity of RAR&#x003b1; (Figure 7, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>PLZF interferes with the transcriptional activity of RAR&#x003b1; and of ER&#x003b1;, GR and VDR. </bold>A) Transcriptional activation of RAR&#x003b1; is decreased upon overexpression of PLZF 3ZF or of full length PLZF. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the p(GRARE)tkLuc reporter gene, the pSG5-RAR&#x003b1; and the pSG5-RXGR expression vectors together with increasing amounts of pCMV-PLZF 3ZF or pSG5-PLZF expression vectors as indicated. Cells were treated with 1 &#x003bc;M atRA and luciferase activity was assayed 16 h later as described under "Experimental Procedures". Results are expressed as the mean +/- S.D. of at least three individual experiments, with the basal level of luciferase activity arbitrarily set to 1.

Cells were treated with 1 &#x003bc;M estradiol (E2), 0.1 &#x003bc;M Dexamethasone (Dex), or 1 &#x003bc;M vitamin D3 (Vit D3) respectively. Luciferase activity was assayed 16 h later.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1478-1336-1-6-4"/></fig><p>We then investigated whether PLZF acts similarly on other nuclear receptor-controlled systems. The transcriptional activity of ER&#x003b1;, GR and VDR was thus evaluated in conditions analogous to those described above. As for RAR&#x003b1;, increasing amounts of PLZF 3ZF repressed the ligand induced activity of ER&#x003b1;, GR and to a lesser extent that of VDR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This ligand activity was similarly decreased when full length PLZF is added for VDR and GR. ER&#x003b1; turned out to be less sensitive to full length-PLZF mediated inhibition, which was only detectable at high doses of transfected expression vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). As a control, overexpression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase did not alter the responsiveness of the system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), suggesting that the observed effect is specific for PLZF and its derivatives.</p><p>We then wanted to establish whether this transcriptional inhibition was correlated or not to a physical interaction between these proteins. <italic>In vitro </italic>GST pull-down assays using GST-PLZF 3ZF and <sup>35</sup>S radiolabelled GR or ER&#x003b1; were performed.

As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we observed that VDR interacted with PLZF (data not shown). These results thus demonstrate that PLZF interacts physically with others nuclear receptors and can interfere with their transcriptional activity, although there is not a strict relationship between dimerization in-vitro and transcriptional inhibition.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>PLZF interacts physically with nuclear receptors. </bold>RAR&#x003b1;, ER&#x003b1; and GR were synthesized and labeled by <italic>in-vitro </italic>coupled transcription/translation and then incubated with a GST-PLZF 3ZF-Sepharose matrix in the absence or presence of ligand, which were 1 &#x003bc;M atRA, 1 &#x003bc;M E2 and 0.1 &#x003bc;M Dex as indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1478-1336-1-6-5"/></fig></sec><sec><title>PLZF interferes with the dimerization of RAR&#x003b1; with RXR&#x003b1;</title><p>PLZF interference with the RXR&#x003b1;:RAR&#x003b1; heterodimer transcriptional activity suggested that one plausible mechanism for the observed inhibition is a PLZF-triggered decrease of RAR&#x003b1; dimerization with RXR&#x003b1;. To test this hypothesis, we first used a mammalian two-hybrid assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) which reflects the ability of RARs to interact with RXRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. HeLa cells were transfected with a Gal4 responsive gene, the RAR&#x003b1; gene fused to the VP16 activation domain gene and the RXR&#x003b1; gene fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain gene as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the presence of Am580, a selective agonist of RAR&#x003b1;, we observed a stronger luciferase activity in our system, reflecting a more stable interaction between RAR&#x003b1; and RXR&#x003b1;. Adding increasing amounts of PLZF 3ZF, as well as full length PLZF reduced the luciferase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), suggesting that PLZF interferes with the dimerization of RAR&#x003b1; with RXR&#x003b1;. Overexpression of the LacZ gene did not alter the responsiveness of the system, suggesting that the observed effect is specific for PLZF. We then tested the ability of PLZF to prevent RXR:RAR dimer formation by <italic>in vitro </italic>protein interaction assays by using a GST-RAR&#x003b1; fusion protein and radiolabeled RXR&#x003b1;. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, RAR&#x003b1; and RXR&#x003b1; interacted constitutively, however, this interaction was potentiated in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;M atRA. Adding increasing amounts of <italic>in vitro </italic>translated PLZF protein inhibited both the ligand-independent and the ligand-dependent dimerization between RAR&#x003b1; and RXR&#x003b1;, whereas similar amounts of control protein (luciferase) did not alter the interaction between RAR&#x003b1; and RXR&#x003b1;. Thus the dimerization of RAR with RXR is specifically inhibited by PLZF in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibition occurs irrespective of the presence of the ligand. In this respect, we also observed that the ligand-dependent dimerization occured in the presence of TTNPB and Am580, two synthetic retinoids. Moreover, the complexation of RAR&#x003b1; to Ro41-5253, a synthetic antagonist, did not modify the PLZF-mediated inhibition of RXR-RAR dimerization, strongly suggesting that PLZF binding to RAR&#x003b1; is not affected by ligand-induced structural transitions (Figure 7, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>PLZF decreases the dimerization of RAR&#x003b1; with RXR&#x003b1;. </bold>A) PLZF decreases the interaction of RAR with RXR in intact cells.

A more detailed analysis of the PLZF-RAR&#x003b1; interaction showed that this functional interaction stems from a direct, physical interaction of RAR with PLZF. We also noted that bcl6, a transcriptional repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] sharing structural and functional similarities with PLZF, also interacted with RAR&#x003b1; (data not shown). Alignment of PLZF and bcl-6 sequences did not however reveal significant homologies that could represent a conserved motif of interaction. While the domain of PLZF required for the interaction with RAR maps, and is limited to, the 3 N-terminal zinc fingers, the structural integrity of RAR seems to be required for a strong interaction, although the isolated ligand binding domain is able to interact significantly with PLZF. The AF2 activation domain (helix H12) is not required for this interaction, as shown by the interaction observed with the hRAR&#x003b1; &#x00394;AF2 and the hRAR&#x003b1; 2 K mutants. This further suggests that PLZF is unlikely to interact with the coactivator binding interface. Furthermore, PLZF exerted a similar effect when a mutation preventing the association of corepressors to RAR&#x003b1; was introduced. This mutation is located in the domain D (RAR&#x003b1; AHT, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). Thus, our data instead suggest that PLZF interferes with the RXR-RAR dimerization process, and not with the ligand binding activity of RAR&#x003b1;, based on experiments carried out in intact cells or in an acellular system. This is in contrast with a previous report showing that PLZF inhibits the VDR transcriptional activity by forming a complex with the VDR-RXR dimer, the formation of which requiring the DNA binding domain of VDR and the BTB/POZ domain of PLZF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In this case, increased recruitment of corepressors to the VDR-RXR complex through the BTB/POZ domain is unlikely to be the mechanism of repression, since histone deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) did not perturb the observed inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Similarly, we observed that the addition of TSA or sodium butyrate did not alter the outcome of PLZF overexpression on the RXR-RAR dimer transcriptional activity, ruling out a possible inhibition through increased corepressor binding to the RXR-RAR complex.</p><p>Recently, Ward and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] reported that RAR&#x003b1; was unable to bind to PLZF in GST pull down experiments and to interfere with RAR-mediated transcriptional activation in the lymphoma cell line U937. While the activity of PLZF may be conditioned by cell-specific factors, it is not clear why <italic>in-vitro </italic>protein-protein interaction assays did not reveal such an interaction. We showed that domains involved in the PLZF-RAR interactions are clearly distinct from these involved in PLZF-VDR interaction, and it is likely that subtle differences in the experimental procedures make a direct comparison very difficult.</p><p>Alternative splicing of the PLZF pre mRNA species generates potentially several proteins deleted from the BTB/POZ domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We also noted that the isolated 3ZF molecule was a better inhibitor of the RXR-RAR response when carrying out dose-response assays, and that the interaction of full length PLZF with RAR is weak when compared to other known interacting proteins such as coactivators and corepressors. This suggests that a possible functional interference will occur at high PLZF concentrations. Although we have not evaluated the respective half-lives of each PLZF species, it is interesting to note that P19 cells express only the spliced form corresponding to the truncated protein, and that the full length transcript appears upon atRA treatment. The ratio of spliced transcripts to full length transcripts also varies in a tissue-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], suggesting that the degree of interference of PLZF with the RAR-RXR pathway may vary similarly, although this point remains speculative at this stage. PLZF mRNA expression is regulated both spatially and temporally in the developping central nervous system, suggesting that it may exert some control on the retinoid pathway. Indeed, a high level of PLZF expression indicates rhombomeric boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and this up regulation is observed concomitantly to a down regulation of other markers of segmentation, and most notably Hox genes and Krox-20, which are known to be regulated by retinoic acid and to play a crucial role in hindbrain anterioposterior patterning (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>atRA was obtained from Sigma.

PLZF or a control protein were synthesized with the Quick T7 TnT kit (Promega) with unlabeled methionine. GST-RAR&#x003b1; was incubated on a rotating wheel for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C with increased amounts of PLZF or of control protein in the presence of 20 nM [<sup>3</sup>H] atRA (50 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer), and with or without 1 &#x003bc;M unlabeled atRA to assess non specific binding.
