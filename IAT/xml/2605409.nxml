BMP-2 is involved in numerous cellular functions including development, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix synthesis. We examined BMP-2 expression in human scleral fibroblasts (HSF) and assessed the effects of recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) on HSF proliferation, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) to study BMP-2 distribution in HSF cells and frozen human scleral sections. The influence of rhBMP-2 on cell proliferation at different concentrations (0 ng/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, and 100 ng/ml) was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The effects of rhBMP-2 on the cell cycle were investigated with flow cytometric analysis. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT&#x02013;PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to examine <italic>MMP-2</italic> and <italic>TIMP-2</italic> mRNAs and secreted proteins in HSF that were incubated with rhBMP-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>BMP-2 protein expression from human sclera was confirmed by CFM. Cell proliferation was significantly increased with 100 ng/ml rhBMP-2 in a time-dependent manner (p&#x0003c;0.05).

A 48 h incubation with 10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml rhBMP-2 resulted in significantly increased <italic>TIMP-2</italic> mRNA and protein expression and significantly decreased <italic>MMP-2</italic> mRNA expression (p&#x0003c;0.01) while MMP-2 protein expression significantly decreased at 100 ng/ml rhBMP-2 (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Human sclera fibroblasts expressed BMP-2, which promoted cell proliferation, and elicited changes in MMP-2 and TIMP-2, might influence extracellular matrix synthesis.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Scleral fibroblasts are involved in scleral remodeling, which occurs during axial elongation in myopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Many aspects of scleral extracellular matrix remodeling and fibroblast proliferation are regulated by specific growth factors including transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. The matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) proteoglycans are involved in scleral extracellular matrix remodeling events associated with eye growth under both normal and myopic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are subgroups from the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) superfamily and have numerous cellular functions including development, morphogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Recent research suggests that BMPs have multiple body functions and are frequently designated &#x0201c;body morphogenetic proteins&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. BMP-2 is a bone morphogenetic protein and is also a potent osteoinductive cytokine. It induces bone and cartilage formation, controls fibroblast apoptosis, and regulates extracellular matrix synthesis in many tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Additionally, BMP-2 expression has been detected in both adult and embryonic tissues of the cornea, the trabecular meshwork, the optic nerve head, the retina, and the conjunctiva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].

Our study revealed that BMP-2 can be localized in HSF to the nucleus and the cytoplasm. BMP-2 is a 26&#x000a0;kDa protein composed of two identical 114 amino acid polypeptide chains (monomers) linked by a single disulfide bond.</p><p>In our study, rhBMP-2 significantly promoted HSF cell proliferation in vitro only at a concentration of 100 ng/ml, and in a time-dependent manner; it also increased the HSF percentage in the S and S+G<sub>2</sub>M phases and decreased the HSF percentage in the G<sub>l</sub> phase. This suggests that rhBMP-2 stimulated mitosis of <italic>HSF</italic> DNA and promoted cell proliferation as a result. BMP-2 is expressed in the human cornea and is considered a heparin-binding cytokine that can stimulate positive chemotaxis and modulate corneal fibroblast apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. The alterations in the scleral fibroblast population are involved in the modulation of scleral matrix turnover during myopia development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Accordingly, BMP-2 is an important growth factor influence on HSF and is possibly involved in the growth of human sclera.</p><p>Significantly increased expression of TIMP-2 and decreased expression of MMP-2 in HSF after incubation with rhBMP-2 were observed in our present study. These results are similar to those in a recent study demonstrating the influence of rhBMP-2 on <italic>MMP-2</italic> and <italic>TIMP-2</italic> mRNA expression in bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Human scleral fibroblasts express MMP-2 (gelatinase A, 72-kDa gelatinase, Type IV collagenase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] and TIMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. MMP-2 is a protein initially secreted as a pro-enzyme (ProMMP-2) and converted to an active enzyme after cleavage (ActiveMMP-2). TIMP-2 inhibits MMP-2 activation and MMP-2 activity by blocking further cleavage of the pro-form active site cleft and by blocking the catalytic domain of both active MMP-2 and MMP-14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Scleral remodeling is a dynamic process that involves continual synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Degradation of scleral connective tissue during remodeling is partially regulated by the balance between MMPs and TIMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Elevation of MMP activity in the sclera by cytokines associated with HSF has been implicated as a potential mechanism of tissue destruction in myopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. All these suggested that BMP-2 may act as a cytokine in the control of scleral extracellular matrix remodeling in myopia progression.</p><p>The human sclera is a dynamic tissue and is capable of rapid responses to changes in the visual environment. It alters ocular size and refraction, and the HSF proliferation and scleral extracellular matrix remodeling events can result in dramatic and immediate changes in biomechanical properties of the sclera and subsequent changes in ocular length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. A gene microarray analysis was used to identify gene expression changes in human scleral fibroblasts in response to mechanical loads and possible mechanisms of scleral remodeling in the development of myopia and showed that mechanical stresses induced <italic>BMP-2</italic> mRNA expression after 30 min and 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. We detected BMP-2 protein in HSF, and our data showed rhBMP-2 promotion of cell proliferation and altered the expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in HSF. Our results suggest that BMP-2 may influence extracellular matrix synthesis and scleral reconstruction, which contributes to the development of human myopia. Further research on BMP-2 and its effects on the alteration of scleral proteoglycan and collagen synthesis and the control of ocular growth in animal models will contribute to the increased understanding of the remodeling of the sclera.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by grant 30572005 from the National Natural Science Foundation in
