A clone encoding a fragment of a novel human protein was isolated (clone 538). The interaction was confirmed using in vitro binding assays. A full-length cDNA clone (F538) was isolated. Sequence alignment with known proteins and 3D structure predictions suggest that F538 is a novel human uridine kinase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. The GFP-F538 fluorescent fusion protein showed a preferentially cytoplasmic distribution but translocated to the nucleus upon co-expression of EBNA-3. A naturally occurring splice variant of F538, that lacks the C-terminal uracil phosphoribosyltransferase part but maintain uridine kinase domain, did not translocate to the nucleus in the presence of EBNA3. Antibody that was raised against the bacterially produced GST-538 protein showed cytoplasmic staining in EBV negative Burkitt lymphomas but gave a predominantly nuclear staining in EBV positive LCL-s and stable transfected cells expressing EBNA-3.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggest that EBNA-3 by direct protein-potein interaction induces the nuclear accumulation of a novel enzyme, that is part of the ribonucleotide salvage pathway.

EBV infection in adolescence causes infectious mononucleosis. The virus associates with several human malignancies, particularly, with Burkitt lymphoma (BL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and post transplant lymphoproliferative disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> EBV transforms B-cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that express 9 virally encoded proteins &#x02013; the nuclear proteins EBNA 1&#x02013;6 and the membrane proteins LMP1, 2A and 2B. Six of them &#x02013; EBNA-1, -2, -3, -5 and -6 and LMP-1 are required for immortalisation of B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. EBNA-3 (also called EBNA-3A) is a member of the EBNA-3-protein family, designated as EBNA-3, 4 and 6, or in the alternative nomenclature, EBNA-3A, B and C. These three proteins bear a major responsibility for the induction of the immune rejection response that makes mononucleosis a self-limiting disease. All three proteins can bind to the DNA binding protein RBP-Jk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The role of the EBNA-3 family in the viral strategy is not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We have previously identified two cellular proteins that can bind to EBNA-3 in yeast two-hybrid system. The &#x003b5;-subunit of the TCP1 chaperonin complex may assist the initial folding of the nascent EBNA-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The Xap-2 protein is a minor subunit of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is also a cellular target for the Hepatitis B virus encoded X antigen. HBX is believed to be involved in HBV associated carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In this paper we have identified yet another human protein, designated F538, through its binding to EBNA-3. We have found that it is homologous to human and mouse uridine kinases, human uridine-cytidine kinase, and to uracil phosphoribosyltransferases of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> .</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RBP-Jk is one of the known interacting partners of EBNA-3. It binds to the N-terminal part of EBNA-3. In order to find additional targets of this large viral protein we used an N-terminus truncated EBNA-3 cDNA clone (encoding amino acids 127&#x02013;945) for screening of a human lymphoblast cDNA library. We identified an interactive clone (designated <italic>clone 538</italic>) that could grow on His, Leu and Trp deficient medium and expressed &#x003b2;-galactosidase from an interaction dependent reporter locus. Plasmid rescue from the yeast to E. coli produced a clone with a ~800 bp long insert at its XhoI site.</p><p>Retransformation of clone 538 DNA together with the EBNA-3 construct into the yeast tester strain (SFY526) confirmed the interaction. Plasmids containing EBNA-1, &#x00394;EBNA-4, EBNA-5, EBNA-6 and the empty pGBT9/BR vector were also retransformed together with the clone 538 DNA as negative controls. None of them showed any significant interaction in &#x003b2;-galactosidase test (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

EBNA-3 but not EBNA-5 induced nuclear translocation of GFP-F538. C-terminally truncated protein remained in cytoplasm. EBNA-3 re-distributed in the nucleus and formed nuclear precipitates together with GFP-F538.

The flexible loop that is involved in the binding to another monomeric unit is present as well.

Recently it was demonstrated that uracil salvage might take place also in mammalian (rat) cells, but the responsible enzyme was still unidentified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It was also shown that the activity of uridine kinases is increased 5&#x02013;13 fold in human colon tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] ovarian carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and damaged tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Uridine kinase activity is increased in the tumor cells. The increase of the nuclear UTP pool may be an important factor for maintenance of high proliferation rate. We suggest that the nuclear accumulation of this novel human UK/UPRT may be part of the viral strategy to convert a resting B cell to continuously proliferating lymphoblasts by securing a salvage pathway enzyme at the site of the RNA synthesis.</p><p>We have shown that F538 interacts specifically with EBNA-3 in the yeast two-hybrid system and in GST pull down assays. The predominantly cytoplasmic GFP-F538 translocates to the nucleus when EBNA-3 is expressed. GFP-F538&#x00394;C is not targeted to the nucleus by EBNA-3. This together with the sequence position of the cDNA fragment recovered from the yeast two hybrid screen indicates that binding site of F538 to EBNA-3 is located between residue 368 and 473, where the conserved domains of UPRT are located.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that EBNA-3 may bring an enzyme that participate in the uridine salvage pathway to the euchromatic part of the nucleus. Through this, EBNA-3 may contribute to the increase of UTP nuclear pool, that in turn is needed for increased cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The polylinker region of the GAL-4 DNA-binding domain containing pGBT9 vector (Clontech) was modified to make it compatible with the GST-2TK expression vector (designated as BD).
