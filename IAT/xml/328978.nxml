On the contrary, the three PvuII sites were cleaved at about the same rate on the unmethylated DNA molecule. The results show that the cleavage inhibition of the methylated DNA on the certain PvuII site was caused by methylation outside the PvuII recognition sequence. Maybe a adjacent methylated dam site *A was responsible for the less efficient cleavage. This observation suggests that methylation outside the recognition sequence may be considered a new factor in the kinetic experiment of restriction endonuclease.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00100-0219-a" xlink:role="5704"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00100-0218.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5703"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00100-0219.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5704"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00100-0220.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5705"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
