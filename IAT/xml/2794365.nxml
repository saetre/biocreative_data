Here we present a computational approach for analyzing modules of genes with a common regulation that are affected by specific DNA polymorphisms. We identify such regulatory-linkage modules by integrating genotypic and expression data for individuals in a segregating population with complementary expression data of strains mutated in a variety of regulatory proteins. Our procedure searches simultaneously for groups of co-expressed genes, for their common underlying linkage interval, and for their shared regulatory proteins. We applied the method to a cross between laboratory and wild strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, demonstrating its ability to correctly suggest modules and to outperform extant approaches. Our results suggest that middle sporulation genes are under the control of polymorphism in the sporulation-specific tertiary complex Sum1p/Rfm1p/Hst1p. In another example, our analysis reveals novel inter-relations between Swi3 and two mitochondrial inner membrane proteins underlying variation in a module of aerobic cellular respiration genes. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this approach provides a useful framework for the systematic mapping of quantitative trait loci and their role in gene expression variation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>High-throughput genotypic and expression data for individuals in a segregating population can provide important information regarding causal regulatory events. However, it has proven difficult to predict these regulatory relations, largely because of statistical power limitations. The use of additional available resources may increase the accuracy of predictions and suggest possible mechanisms through which the target genes are regulated. In this study, we combine genotypic and expression data across the segregating population with complementary regulatory information to identify modules of genes that are jointly affected by changes in activity of regulatory proteins, as well as by genotypic changes. We develop a novel approach called <italic>ReL analysis</italic>, which automatically learns such modules. A unique feature of our approach is that all three components of the module&#x02014;the genes, the underlying polymorphism, and the regulatory proteins&#x02014;are predicted simultaneously. The integrated analysis makes it possible to capture weaker linkage signals and suggests possible mechanisms underlying expression changes.

With the advent of microarray and other genotyping technologies, it is now possible to examine the genome-wide effects of naturally occurring DNA sequence polymorphism on gene expression variation in segregating populations.

Although standard linkage analysis successfully identifies eQTLs when applied to relatively small datasets, its utility in high-throughput eQTL analysis is limited due to the increased amount of background noise. To tackle this problem, a variety of methods take advantage of the modularity of biological systems and identify sequence polymorphisms that underlie an entire group of genes rather than single gene expression traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Lee1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Yvert1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Kliebenstein1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Sun1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Lee2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, a number of integrative approaches combine several data sources, including promoter binding data and sequence information, to improve the accuracy of eQTL identification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Schadt1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Ye1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Several advanced methods capture not only sequence polymorphisms, but also the regulatory proteins underlying the expression changes. In those methods, the regulatory proteins are inferred concurrently with the linkage analysis, based on the approximation of regulatory protein activities by their mRNA expression level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Lee1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Lee2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>In this study we devise a new method for characterizing the transcriptional response to DNA sequence variation. Called Regulatory-Linkage (ReL) analysis, it captures groups of genes together with their underlying DNA polymorphisms and their common regulatory mechanisms. The method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) takes as input genotyping and expression data for individuals in the segregating population, as well as a compendium of high-throughput transcription regulatory signatures. These regulatory signatures are gene expression profiles (selected from the literature) of strains mutated in particular regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. Our method produces a set of &#x02018;ReL modules&#x02019;, each consisting of a triplet: a small set of regulatory proteins, a group of target genes, and a genetic linkage interval. The target genes are jointly linked to the interval and share a common transcriptional control by the regulatory proteins. We say that the module's target genes are co-regulated by the module's regulatory proteins and are co-linked to the modules' linkage interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000800-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000800.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of the ReL analysis procedure.</title><p>(A) The &#x0201c;linkage matrix&#x0201d; contains eQTL likelihood scores between particular genetic markers (columns) and target genes (rows). The compendium of regulatory signatures consists of gene expression arrays from strains mutated in a variety of regulatory proteins. First, we aim to detect groups of genes that are co-expressed in one signature and co-linked to a specific genetic marker. Given a regulatory signature j and genetic marker i, we ask to what extent genes with high linkage to i manifest a distinct distribution in signature j. The difference between the distributions is estimated, producing a P-value called &#x0201c;ReL score.&#x0201d; The &#x0201c;ReL matrix&#x0201d; represents these scores across all regulatory signatures (columns) and genetic markers (rows). Blue/white indicates significant/non-significant ReL scores. Next, we aim to detect a group of genes that are co-expressed in a few signatures and co-linked to a common linkage interval. To that end, we look for high-scoring sub-matrices in the ReL matrix, referred as &#x0201c;ReL modules.&#x0201d; (B) Each ReL module represents a triplet: (i) a range of genetic markers (linkage interval) that contains a genetic causal regulator, (ii) a set of regulatory signatures matching particular regulatory proteins, and (iii) a group of target genes that are co-regulated by the module's regulatory proteins and co-linked to the module's causal regulator.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000800.g001"/></fig><p>The novelty of the current approach is twofold. All three components of the ReL modules &#x02013; the groups of target genes, the underlying polymorphism and the regulatory proteins &#x02013; are predicted simultaneously. Extant methods predict only two of the components simultaneously and add the third one in a separate pre- or post-processing step. Moreover, we integrate high-throughput gene expression data consisting of perturbations in a large variety of transcription factors. This integrated approach has several important benefits: First, the additional regulatory information makes it possible to capture weaker linkage signals. Second, the analysis focuses on groups of target genes that have a common regulatory protein and therefore avoids groups of genes that happen by chance to be co-linked to the same genomic interval. Third, the approach infers regulatory relations based on perturbations in a variety of regulatory proteins, thereby avoiding the approximation of protein activities by mRNA expression levels. Previous studies relied on this rough approximation to infer regulatory proteins concurrently with DNA polymorphisms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Lee1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Lee2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>). Finally, the predicted regulatory proteins may suggest possible mechanisms through which genetic polymorphisms affect their target genes, providing initial interpretations of the ReL modules as part of the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Our analysis takes, as input, genotypic and expression data for a set of 112 individuals in a yeast wild-type segregating population. We organize these data as a linkage matrix, which presents the linkage (an eQTL likelihood score) between the expression level of each gene and each genetic marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). In addition, our procedure utilizes a compendium of &#x02018;regulatory signatures&#x02019; that includes gene expression profiles from 283 different strains mutated in a variety of regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Roberts1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Hu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In the following analysis, linkage relations are evaluated based on the linkage matrix, whereas regulatory relations are assessed by preferential over- or under-expression of target gene groups across regulatory signatures.</p><p>We aim to identify triplets of (i) target genes, (ii) linkage interval, and (iii) regulatory signatures, where the target genes are jointly linked to the linkage interval and co-expressed in the regulatory signature. The na&#x000ef;ve approach of finding high-scoring triplets by evaluating all possible combinations is computationally infeasible even for relatively small datasets. To tackle this problem, our method proceeds heuristically in two stages. In the first stage, we organize the input as a higher order &#x02018;ReL matrix&#x02019; across all genetic markers and regulatory signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Each entry in the matrix indicates whether genes that are strongly linked to a particular marker are also over- or under-expressed in a particular regulatory signature. This statistical measure, referred to as ReL score, is calculated as follows: For each genetic marker, we partitioned the genes into two sets: genes with high linkage to the genetic marker and the rest of the genes. Given the regulatory signature, the ReL score measures the difference in the gene expression distribution between these two sets (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p><p>We now use the observation that when a group of genes is co-regulated by several regulatory proteins and is jointly linked to the same linkage interval, the corresponding ReL sub-matrix will attain high scores. In accordance, the second analysis stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) applies a biclustering algorithm on the ReL matrix to search for sub-matrices whose average scores are higher than randomly expected. In this work, we assume a single linkage interval underlying each sub-matrix. Accordingly, the ISA biclustering algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Ihmels1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> was adapted to choose a single range of genetic markers (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p><p>The biclustering output is a set of sub-matrices, each scored by its average ReL scores, and specifies a set of regulatory signatures and a single linkage interval. For each high-scoring sub-matrix, referred to as ReL module, we attached additional attributes: (i) A set of regulatory proteins &#x02013; the proteins that were mutated in the strains from which the module's regulatory signature was obtained. (ii) A group of target genes - genes that are both co-regulated by the module's regulatory proteins and co-linked to the module's linkage interval (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Since we focus only on trans-acting regulation, genes residing within or near the modules' linkage interval were excluded from the group of target genes. (iii) We hypothesize that the linkage interval contains a single gene that underlies the module's gene expression variation. We call this gene the causal regulator of the module. Among the genes within the linkage interval, we predict a plausible putative causal regulator (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>In this analysis, we focus on the thirteen highest-scoring ReL modules (modules with ReL score &#x0003e;3). A comprehensive description of these modules is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s002">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s003">Table S2</xref>. Five additional modules were highly enriched in target genes residing in telomeric or subtelomeric regions of multiple chromosomes, and therefore were excluded from the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s003">Table S2</xref>; gene expression variation in telomeres has been discussed extensively elsewhere (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Lee1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>)). Each of the identified ReL modules consists of at least 10 target genes. The modules comprise a total of 311 genetic markers, 82 different regulatory proteins, and 281 different target genes. Randomization analysis shows that the identified modules are highly unlikely to be generated at random (module size P-value&#x0003c;0.05, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s006">Text S1</xref> for details).</p><p>The identified ReL modules have no overlapping linkage intervals and only a few shared regulatory proteins: Eleven regulatory signatures are shared across two modules and no regulatory signature is shared across three or more modules. This is likely to be a consequence of our biclustering approach and the small number of modules. The little overlap allows us to organize the ReL matrix into a global map of ReL modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The global map highlights the existence of &#x02018;high intensity&#x02019; sub-matrices (modules). The map clearly shows that the high ReL scores within each module decrease drastically at the boundaries of its linkage interval and for regulatory signatures that are not part of the module.</p><fig id="pgen-1000800-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000800.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The ReL matrix.</title><p>A matrix of genetic markers (rows) versus regulatory signatures (columns), where the colors indicate the ReL score.

These significant enrichments give further support to the inferred ReL modules. For example, they justify the division of linkage interval II:352&#x02013;697kb into two neighboring modules, #1 and #2 (linkage intervals II:352&#x02013;376kb and II:489&#x02013;697kb, respectively), since each module is characterized by a different biological process (&#x02018;ribosome biogenesis&#x02019; and &#x02018;cytokinesis&#x02019;, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s004">Table S3</xref>).

For example, we have two indications that the causal regulator <italic>URA3</italic> underlies gene expression variation in module #6.

Out of six known relations, ReL detects five relations whereas compared methods detect zero and four relations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s008">Text S3</xref> for details). Interestingly, the nucleobase biosynthesis system was detected only by the ReL analysis.</p><p>The nucleobase biosynthesis system (module #6; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000800-t001">Table 1</xref>) shows the unique ability of ReL analysis to recover not only the causal regulators, but also the regulatory proteins. The module's causal regulator is <italic>URA3</italic>, the target genes consist of <italic>URA1</italic> and <italic>URA4</italic>, and the highest scoring regulatory protein is Ppr1. The module successfully captures the current biological knowledge about the uracil biosynthesis system. The RM parental strain carries a deletion of the <italic>URA3</italic> gene, which is known to be linked to several members of the uracil biosynthesis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Brem1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. De-novo uracil biosynthesis is catalyzed by seven biosynthetic enzymes (Ura2,3,4,5,6,7,10). Four biosynthetic enzymes (Ura1,3,4,10) are subject to transcription regulation via the transcriptional activator Ppr1, whose activity is negatively regulated by uracil production rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Flynn1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The predicted effect of <italic>URA3</italic> mutation on <italic>URA1,4</italic> is highly likely to be mediated by Ppr1 activity: in the absence of Ura3 (RM variant), uracil production is reduced, causing Ppr1 activation (through the negative feedback) and, consequently, a transcriptional up-regulation of the uracil biosynthetic genes.</p><p>Notably, although most extant methods detect the nucleobase biosynthesis module, our approach is unique in inferring Ppr1 as the regulatory protein of the module (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s008">Text S3</xref>). This difference is not surprising, as most extant methods estimate Ppr1 activity by its mRNA level, whereas the actual activity is governed by uracil production rate. Taken together, the nucleobase biosynthesis module highlights the advantage of ReL analysis in predicting regulatory proteins based on causal information, without estimating protein activities with mRNA levels.</p><p>The sporulation module (module #13) shows our method's ability to reveal small modules. This module consists of only seventeen genes, eight of which encode meiosis- and sporulation-specific proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), linked to a locus on chromosome XV. Using previously reported mRNA expression patterns of all yeast genes through the sporulation time course, we found that these target genes are induced during mid-sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In agreement, the module's regulatory proteins are two DNA-binding proteins, Hst1 and Sum1, both required for transcriptional repression of middle sporulation-specific genes during vegetative growth and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Xie1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

Notably, Rfm1 lies in the modules' linkage interval; in fact, it is located within the peak of the interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). It has an average eQTL likelihood score of 2.6 to its targets, and explains 27&#x00025; of their gene expression variation. Segregants that inherited the linked locus from the wild RM showed higher expression of the sporulation module's targets than did segregants carrying the locus from the BY strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000800-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The BY parent carries two polymorphisms at the <italic>RFM1</italic> locus: P247S and N227D.

This observation suggests that the Ser247 impairs Rfm1 function, perhaps affecting the activity of the entire Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 complex, leading to residual de-repression of mid-sporulation genes during vegetative growth. The linkage of <italic>RFM1</italic> to expression variation has not been previously shown, probably since the signal could not be detected robustly for a small number of target genes. Our methodology overcomes this problem by exploiting the joint repressive effect of Hst1 and Sum1 during vegetative growth, enabling prediction of the genetic cause of variation in mid-sporulation genes.</p><p>The two respiration modules (#5 and #12) show the ability of our method to identify two distinct linkage intervals sharing the same target genes.

To that end, we analyzed all genes that have high linkage (eQTL likelihood &#x0003e;2.5) to either <italic>CAT5</italic> or <italic>CRD1</italic>.

Importantly, it also provides insights into the mechanisms by which genotypes underlie expression changes.</p><p>In our method, the regulatory signatures are gene expression profiles that were measured in rich medium under standard conditions on yeast cells carrying a single perturbation. The same methodology can be expanded to handle additional regulatory signature resources. For example, gene expression data measured under a variety of conditions may be included, disclosing modules that are inactive under standard conditions but active under particular extracellular stimuli. Furthermore, protein-DNA binding data, and data from double mutants might provide additional powerful information on ReL modules.</p><p>The ReL modules should be interpreted with caution. Genetic linkage does not necessarily imply causality. Two of the three criteria used for identifying the causal regulator are aimed to select among plausible hypotheses but do not demonstrate causality (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s007">Text S2</xref> for details). Additionally, the linkage interval might contain more than one causal polymorphism, whereas ReL analysis assumes a single causal regulator. In the case of two causal polymorphisms located at the same genomic region, ReL analysis might unify them into the same module or fail to detect one of them. Another point to consider is that the ReL modules do not provide an unbiased view of genome-wide genetic linkage. Since the modules are detected based on co-regulation in at least one regulatory signature, the resulting modules depend on the particular signatures included in the compendium. Further, some regulatory relations might be specific to a single regulatory signature, a short linkage interval, or a small number of target genes. ReL analysis may not have enough statistical power to generalize those focused relations into a module. Finally, our modules currently contain only a single linkage interval. Hence, ReL analysis might fail to detect the prevalent case where the target genes are influenced by a combination of multiple interacting loci. It might be possible to extend our framework to detect such interactions automatically. For all these reasons, our method may fail to identify certain correct modules despite a detectable causal polymorphism.</p><p>ReL analysis is likely to succeed in organisms other than yeast, including mouse and human.

It would be of great interest to explore whether the regulatory mechanisms uncovered here are conserved in other fungal genomes. The discovery here of previously uncharacterized modules and interactions in the well-studied segregating yeast population underscores the importance of large-scale integrated methods in genetic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Data preparation</title><p>We calculated the linkage (an eQTL likelihood score) of genotypic and expression data measured for 112 individuals in a yeast segregating population, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Brem1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The linkage matrix represents genetic markers versus genes, where each entry corresponds to the eQTL likelihood score between a given genetic marker and the expression of a given gene. The analysis was applied to all 2956 markers that were genotyped, and all 6230 genes whose gene expression was measured across the segregating population.</p><p>We formed a compendium of 283 high-throughput expression profiles obtained from strains mutated in various regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Roberts1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Hu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The compendium includes only strains mutated in a single gene, and each mutant strain is represented by exactly one expression profile. The expression profiles are referred to as regulatory signatures.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>ReL test</title><p>Given a genetic marker and a regulatory signature, we evaluate whether genes that are tightly linked to the genetic marker are also over- or under-expressed in the regulatory signature. To that end, we partition the genes into two subsets: genes with high linkage to the genetic marker (denoted high-linkage genes), and the rest of the genes. The difference in the distribution of the regulatory signature values between the two subsets is evaluated using a t-test. The ReL score is the &#x02212;log<sub>10</sub> P-value of this t-test (all reported ReL scores are Bonferroni corrected). In our analysis, 11,166 of the 836,548 ReL scores (1.3&#x00025;) were significant at P&#x0003c;0.001 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s006">Text S1</xref>). Given that the high-linkage (the rest) genes tend to have high (respectively low) regulatory signature values, the group of hit genes includes all those high-linkage genes whose values are above (respectively below) the average regulatory signature value. The hit genes are later used to calculate the target genes of the ReL modules.</p><p>The eQTL likelihood threshold, which distinguishes the high-linkage genes from the rest of the genes, was identified as follows: First, genes that are over-expressed and genes that are under-expressed in the regulatory signature are identified. For every possible eQTL likelihood threshold, we test for the over-representation of high-linkage genes in one of these expression groups using a hyper-geometric score (we consider all observed eQTL likelihood values as thresholds). The best score determines the eQTL likelihood threshold. The combination of hyper geometric score and the t-test is important for a robust evaluation. Unlike a t-test, the hyper-geometric test takes into account the amount of high-linkage genes, making sure that the eQTL likelihood threshold is not too high; on the other hand, unlike the hyper-geometric test, the t-test estimates the significance of difference between two distributions. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s010">Text S5</xref> demonsrates the robustness of ReL analysis to small changes in the eQTL likelihood threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Biclustering analysis and ReL modules</title><p>The ReL matrix summarizes the ReL scores across all genetic markers and regulatory signatures. We set out to construct a group of co-regulated genes whose common transcription regulation involves both regulatory proteins and a causal regulator. In the ReL matrix, such an event appears as a sub-matrix with significant over-representation of high ReL scores. To identify those sub-matrices, the ISA biclustering algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Ihmels1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> was adapted to work on the ReL matrix. ISA looks for any subset of columns and any subset of rows whose sub-matrix has high scores; the sub-matrix is subject to iterative improvements by adding or removing any column or row. Here we seek sub-matrices with a single range of consecutive genetic markers rather than any subset of markers. To that end, we modified the original ISA so that only markers at the boundaries of the current genetic marker range can be added or removed. On each ISA step, the genetic marker range is optimized efficiently using a dynamic programming algorithm. We start from all possible single entries as seed sub-matrices, and optimize each such seed independently of all others (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s011">Text S6</xref> for details). The resulting sub-matrix is called a ReL module. The ReL score of a module is the average ReL score of its entries.</p><p>A ReL module specifies a single range of genetic markers (referred as a linkage interval) and a set of regulatory signatures. For each ReL module, we further compiled the following information:</p><p>(i)&#x02003;Each module is associated with a set of regulatory proteins corresponding to the deletion mutants in the module's regulatory signatures. The ReL score of a regulatory protein is its average ReL score over the linkage interval.</p><p>(ii)&#x02003;As defined above, each entry of the ReL matrix is associated with a set of hit genes. The module's target genes are all hit genes included in at least 60&#x00025; of the sub-matrix entries. Here we aim to investigate trans-acting regulation, and therefore, to avoid biases related to cis-acting regulation, genes residing within the linkage interval or less than 30 genes away from it were excluded from the set of target genes. In all thirteen modules under analysis, the original fraction of cis-linked genes was relatively small (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s003">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Next, the function of the set of target genes is characterized by a hyper-geometric enrichment test using the GO biological process annotation (computed using the EXPANDER software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Shamir1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>; all reported P-values are corrected for multiple testing). Given one or more significantly enriched biological processes for the same set of target genes, the best scoring process is termed the primary biological process of the module.</p><p>(iii)&#x02003;A causal regulator is a gene carrying a polymorphism in its promoter or coding region, which has a trans-acting effect on expression variation of other genes. For each ReL module, we aim to find one or a few putative causal regulators &#x02013; genes contained within the linkage interval that are highly likely to be the causal regulators of the target genes. Following Tu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000800-Tu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, we predict a putative causal regulator based on the following rules: The causal regulator either plays a role in the primary biological process of the module, or the yeast protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction network contains at least one direct link between the causal regulator and the module's regulatory proteins. Alternatively, the module shows statistical significant enrichment for targets of the causal regulator (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000800.s007">Text S2</xref> for details).</p><p>Taken together, a full description of a module includes a set of regulatory proteins, a (small) set of putative causal regulators, and a set of target genes characterized by a primary biological process.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Additional information</title><p>A program implementing our framework is available on the website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/ReL/">http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/ReL/</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000800.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>The effect of deletion in respiration transcription regulators on expression in modules #5 and #12.
