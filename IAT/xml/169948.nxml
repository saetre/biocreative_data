The enzyme has been implicated in antioxidative defense, but its high expression level in testicular tissue suggests a more specific function during sperm maturation. The phGPx is encoded for by a joint sperm nucleus&#x0002f;phGPx gene (sn&#x0002f;phGPx) and can be expressed as a mitochondrial or cytosolic isoform. Although sn&#x0002f;phGPx genes have been cloned from various mammalian species expression regulation of the enzyme has not been studied in detail. We investigated the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the murine sn&#x0002f;phGPx gene and observed basic promoter activity in a 200 bp region localized immediately upstream of the translational initiation site of the cytosolic isoform (3&#x02032;-ATG). DNase protection assays indicated the presence of five distinct protein-binding regions and electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift experiments revealed binding of stimulating protein 1 (SP1), nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) and members of the SMAD family. Site-directed mutagenesis of the consensus binding sequences abolished <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription factor binding. Expression of reporter genes was most effectively impaired when SP1&#x0002f;SP3 and NF-Y binding site-deficient constructs were tested. Chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of these transcription factors. Our data indicate that the basic phGPx promoter constitutes a 200 bp oligonucleotide, which is localized immediately upstream of the 3&#x02032;-ATG and involves functional SP1&#x0002f;SP3, NF-Y and SMAD binding sites. The corresponding <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory proteins may contribute to differential expression regulation of the mitochondrial and cytosolic phGPx isoforms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases (GPx) constitute a family of anti-oxidative enzymes that are capable of reducing organic and inorganic hydroperoxides to the corresponding hydroxy compounds utilizing glutathione or other hydrogen donors as reducing equivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c2">2</xref>). Five different selenium GPx sub-types have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c4">4</xref>), but there are only four seleno GPx genes. Among the seleno GPx isoforms the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (phGPx) is unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c6">6</xref>) because of its capability of reducing ester lipid hydroperoxides even if they are incorporated in biomembranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c8">8</xref>) or lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c10">10</xref>). The phGPx cDNAs of various species contain two in-frame translational initiation sites (5&#x02032;-ATG and 3&#x02032;-ATG, Scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650s1">1</xref>), both of which are functional under certain conditions. <italic>In vitro</italic> translation of the rat full-length phGPx mRNA is initiated predominantly at the 5&#x02032;-ATG. However, translation did start at the 3&#x02032;-ATG when the 5&#x02032;-ATG was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c11">11</xref>). The sequence between the two translational initiation sites was suggested to encode for a signal peptide required for mitochondrial import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c11">11</xref>). In fact, experiments in which this targeting sequence was fused to a green fluorescence protein indicated predominant mitochondrial localization of the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c12">12</xref>). More detailed investigations of phGPx expression at the mRNA level indicated a high degree of variation of transcriptional initiation. Two major phGPx mRNA populations appear to exist and both of them are heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c11">11</xref>). (i) One mRNA family lacks the mitochondrial insertion peptide and utilizes the 3&#x02032;-ATG for translational initiation. These messengers are translated to the cytosolic isoform. (ii) The second mRNA population contains both the 5&#x02032;- and the 3&#x02032;-ATG as well as the complete mitochondria targeting sequence. Translation of these transcripts is initiated at the 5&#x02032;-ATG and leads to the formation of the mitochondrial phGPx (Scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650s1">1</xref>). After mitochondrial import the targeting peptide is cleaved off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c13">13</xref>) so that the two phGPx isoforms cannot be distinguished on the basis of their protein chemical properties. The existence of two mRNA populations suggests differential transcription mechanisms of the ph&#x0002f;sperm nucleus (sn) GPx gene utilizing various transcription initiation sites. Alternatively, a joint primary transcript may be processed differentially at post-transcriptional levels. Expression of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene is tissue specifically regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c14">14</xref>). In most cells the enzyme is expressed at relatively low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c16">16</xref>) but in testis it constitutes a major protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c17">17</xref>). Unfortunately, the regulatory mechanisms involved in high-level expression of the enzyme in germinative cells and its repression in somatic tissues are largely unknown. The previous observation that expression of the enzyme is strongly down-regulated in testis of hypophysectomized rats and that this defect can partially be reversed by gonadotropin administration, suggested a role of testosterone in the regulation of phGPx expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c18">18</xref>). However, more recent data suggested that testosterone does not directly activate transcription of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c19">19</xref>).</p><p>The gene encoding for the porcine phGPx was cloned in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c20">20</xref>) and more recently the complete genomic sequences of the human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c21">21</xref>) and the murine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c22">22</xref>) orthologs became available. Comparison of the 5&#x02032;-flanking regions suggested the existence of conserved consensus binding sequences for several transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c22">22</xref>). However, the functionality of these binding motifs has never been studied in detail. Only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c23">23</xref>), experiments on the human ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene suggested the regulatory importance of a conserved CCAAT box that binds transcription nuclear factor Y (NF-Y). This binding motif was localized &#x02013;156 to &#x02013;151 bp upstream of the 5&#x02032;-ATG (Scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650s1">1</xref>). Other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, which have been identified structurally in various mammalian phGPx genes, have not been studied for their functionality. Moreover, it remained unclear whether the synthesis of the two phGPx isoforms (mitochondrial and cytosolic) is regulated by a uniform mechanism or whether their expression is under the control of different <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements.</p><p>The lack of detailed experimental data on the regulation of phGPx expression and the interesting biological functions of the enzyme prompted us to investigate the functionality of putative transcription factor binding sites present in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the murine ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene. DNase protection assays suggested the existence of at least five protein-binding sites and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), which included supershift studies, identified stimulating protein 1 (SP1), NF-Y and members of the SMAD family as regulatory proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The chemicals used were from the following sources: trisodium citrate dihydrate, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, Triton X-100, bovine serum albumin (BSA), penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin solution and FBS were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany); sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); PWO DNA polymerase, agarose, ampicillin, AMV reverse transcriptase and proteinase inhibitor cocktail tablets (complete, Mini) were from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany); restriction endonucleases and the DNA molecular weight markers (100 bp, 1 kb) were from New England Biolabs GmbH (Schwalbach, Germany); PanScript DNA Polymerase was from Pan Biotech GmbH (Aidenbach, Germany); Advantage 2 Polymerase was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA); Bacto yeast extract, Bacto agar and Bacto tryptone were from Difco (Detroit, MI); Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) was from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany); rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-Y antibody (H209), rabbit anti-SP1 antibody (PEP2) and rabbit anti-SP3 antibody (D-20) X were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

The long messengers that contain both the 3&#x02032;- and the 5&#x02032;-ATG are translated to the mitochondrial phGPx isoform. Here, the 5&#x02032;-ATG is utilized as a translational initiation site. In contrast, the family of short phGPx messengers, which contain the 3&#x02032;-ATG only, encodes for the cytosolic phGPx isoform and translation of this messenger is initiated at the 3&#x02032;-ATG. This interesting genomic constellation (for direct sequence information see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material) is of dual consequence for the regulatory mechanisms of transcription: (i) if the cytosolic (short) and the mitochondrial (long) mRNA species are differentially transcribed there must be at least two separate transcriptional initiation sites (Scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650s1">1</xref>) for the two isoforms; (ii) if separate transcriptional initiation sites exist the potential regulatory sequences for transcription are likely to be different and for the cytosolic enzyme the region between the 3&#x02032;- and the 5&#x02032;-ATG might contribute to transcriptional regulation. To shed light on the relative contribution to the promoter activity of the different parts of the 5&#x02032;-flanking region a comprehensive set of reporter genes was constructed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f1">1</xref>A) covering a 1000 bp region immediately upstream of the translational initiation site of the mitochondrial isoform (5&#x02032;-ATG). After transient transfection of HEK293 cells with these constructs, the enzymatic activity of the reporter gene (&#x003b2;-galactosidase) was assayed. The data summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f1">1</xref>B indicate that the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene located immediately upstream of the transcriptional initiation site of the mitochondrial isoform (A-set) exhibits only a weak promoter activity (relative galactosidase activity of &#x0223c;0.61). However, it was significantly higher than that of the negative control (relative galactosidase activity of 0.1). The different reporter genes of the A-set did not exhibit major differences in their promoter activities although the shortest construct appeared to be most active. The second set of reporter genes (B-set) contained the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the mitochondrial messenger and variable sections of the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene. The average activity of this set of reporter gene constructs was almost one order of magnitude higher than that of the A-set indicating significant promoter activity in the region of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene, which is transcribed as the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the mitochondrial messenger. This conclusion is also supported by two other observations: (i) if only the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the mitochondrial messenger was fused to the reporter gene (construct 0 of the B-set) the activity was higher than that for all constructs of the A-set; (ii) the relative promoter activity of each B-set member was almost one order of magnitude higher than the activity of the corresponding A-set counterpart. Interestingly, as in the A-set (A1), construct B1, which contains only a 100 bp fragment of the 5&#x02032;-flanking region, exhibited the highest promoter activity.</p><p>Next, we addressed the question of whether or not there is significant promoter activity in the region of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene encoding for the mitochondrial targeting peptide. This region is completely transcribed for both the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms, and contributes to the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the cytosolic phGPx. The average promoter activity of this set of reported genes (C-set) was almost twice as high as that of the B-set suggesting significant promoter activity in this region. As in the other sets, construct C1 containing the complete sequence of exon 1 and a &#x02013;100 bp fragment of the 5&#x02032;-flanking region exhibited the highest promoter activity.</p><p>Taken together these data indicate that the &#x02013;100 to &#x02013;900 bp part of the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene may not exhibit major promoter activity. Only the first 100 bp located immediately upstream of the 5&#x02032;-Cap may contribute to the basic promoter. However, the majority of the promoter activity was mapped to exon 1 of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene, which is comprised of the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the mitochondrial messenger as well as the sequences encoding for the mitochondrial targeting peptide.</p></sec><sec><title>DNase protection studies</title><p>As indicated above, reporter gene construct C1 exhibited the highest promoter activity. Thus, the 326 bp region immediately upstream of the 3&#x02032;-ATG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f1">1</xref>) may constitute the basic phGPx promoter. Interspecies sequence alignments indicated that this fragment contains several conserved transcription factor binding sequences including the recently identified CCAAT box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c23">23</xref>). To find out whether there are additional protein-binding sites in this region, DNAse protection assays were carried out. From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f2">2</xref> it can be seen that four distinct protein-binding regions (footprints 1&#x02013;4, FP-1 to FP-4) have been detected and three of them were observed using sense and anti-sense strands as templates. Two footprints (FP-1, FP-2) were mapped to the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene; the others (FP-3, FP-4) were located in the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the long phGPx messenger. FP-1, FP-2 and FP-3 were of similar size (20&#x02013;30 bp), but FP-4 was comprised of 50 bp. This size suggested the existence of two or more protein-binding regions. A very similar footprint pattern has recently been reported for the human phGPx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c23">23</xref>), suggesting a high interspecies conservation of the regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays</title><p>To identify the DNA-binding proteins involved in foot printing we first inspected the corresponding DNA regions for the presence of consensus binding sequences for known transcription factors using the MatInspector program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c24">24</xref>). These data (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material) suggested that FP-1, FP-3 and FP-4 contain high core SP1&#x0002f;SP3 binding regions. In FP-2 and FP-4 the consensus sequence for the binding of NF-Y was found. In addition, a binding sequence for the SMAD family member forkhead activin signal transducer (FAST1) was observed in FP-4, although its core value was not particularly impressive. To identify the functionality of these <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements EMSAs were carried out using the nuclear extracts of HEK293 cells and murine macrophages (J774) as a source of nuclear proteins. When a digoxygenin-labeled oligonucleotide of FP-1 was incubated with these nuclear extracts two strong shift signals were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f3">3</xref>, lanes b and d). Both signals were competed off with a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor (data not shown) and by a SP1&#x0002f;SP3 consensus probe (lanes c and e). In contrast, when an unlabeled probe containing the sequence of FP-4A (contains a NF-Y binding site only; see below) was added, the two shift signals were not influenced (data not shown). The upper shift band migrated in a molecular weight region of an SP1&#x0002f;SP3-oligonucleotide complex, whereas the lower signal exhibited a higher electrophoretic mobility. These data suggest that the upper shift band may be due to SP1&#x0002f;SP3 binding whereas the lower band was caused by an unknown transcription factor.</p><p>Sequencing of FP-2 indicated the presence of a NF-Y binding site and EMSA studies with nuclear extracts of HEK293 (lane b) and J774 cells (lane f) indicated single shift signals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f4">4</xref>), which were competed off by unlabeled probes (lanes c and g) and by a NF-Y consensus oligonucleotide (lanes e and h). Mutagenesis (see Table S2 in the Supplementary Material) of the NF-Y consensus sequence abolished transcription factor binding and competition with an unlabeled FP-4A probe also eliminated the shift signal (lane d). In contrast, when a mutated FP-4 oligonucleotide was used the signal remained unaltered (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that FP-2, but also FP-4A (see below), contain functional NF-Y binding sites. The FP-2 sequence indicated a CCAAT box, which is conserved among all mammalian species.</p><p><italic>In silico</italic> analysis of FP-3 suggested the existence of a single SP1&#x0002f;SP3 binding site (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Material). Incubation of nuclear extracts of HEK293 and J774 cells with a labeled FP-3 oligonucleotide indicated strong shift signals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f5">5</xref>A, lanes b and d), which were competed off with an unlabeled SP1&#x0002f;SP3 consensus oligonucleotide (lanes c and e). To confirm the specificity of SP1&#x0002f;SP3 binding we used unlabeled oligonucleotides of FP-1, FP-2, FP-3, FP-4A and FP-4B as competitors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f5">5</xref>B) and found that the shift band disappeared with FP-1, FP-3 and FP-4B oligonucleotides (lanes d, b and f). In contrast, the signal remained unchanged when the experiment was carried out with unlabeled probes of FP-2 and FP-4A, which only contain NF-Y binding sequences (lanes c and e).</p><p>FP-4 is comprised of 50 nt and because of this size it was divided into two overlapping parts (FP-4A and FP-4B) for functional promoter studies. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of FP-4A suggested the presence of single NF-Y and SMAD binding sites. EMSA with nuclear extracts of HEK293 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f6">6</xref>A) revealed two shift signals (lane b), which were quenched when unlabeled FP-4A competitor was added (lane c). The upper shift band disappeared when NF-Y consensus oligonucleotide or unlabeled FP-2 oligonucleotide (contains the NF-Y consensus sequence) were added (lanes f and d). In contrast, a FP-2 oligonucleotide, in which the NF-Y consensus sequence was mutated (see Table S2 in the Supplementary Material), did not influence NF-Y binding but abolished the lower shift band (lane e). More detailed <italic>in silico</italic> promoter analysis suggested the additional occurrence of a binding site for SMAD transcription factors. In fact, after addition of a SMAD3&#x0002f;4 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f6">6</xref>B, lane b) the lower shift signal disappeared. After combined addition of unlabeled SMAD and NF-Y competitors no shift bands were observed at all (data not shown). These data suggested that the upper shift signal was caused by NF-Y and the lower one by a SMAD protein.</p><p>FP-4B contains a single SP1&#x0002f;SP3 binding site and EMSA experiments with HEK293 and J774 nuclear extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f6">6</xref>C) indicated strong single shift signals (lanes b and d), which were competed off by unlabeled SP1&#x0002f;SP3 consensus oligonucleotides (lanes c and e). Moreover, we found (data not shown) that the signals disappeared after addition of unlabeled FP-1 competitor (contains a SP1&#x0002f;SP3 site). In contrast, a FP-4A oligonucleotide (contains a NF-Y and SMAD binding site) or a mutated FP-4B probe (see Table S2 in the Supplementary Material) did not induce any alterations in the shift pattern (data not shown). These data suggest that FP-4B may be due to the binding of a SP1&#x0002f;SP3 family member.</p><p>To obtain more detailed information on the identity of the <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory proteins, supershift experiments were carried out in which specific antibodies against SP1, SP3 and NF-Y were added to the incubation mixture. From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f7">7</xref>A it can be seen that the SP1&#x0002f;SP3 shift signal obtained for FP-1 was not detectable when SP1 antibody was added. In contrast, addition of SP3 and NF-Y antibodies did not alter the shift pattern. Similar results were obtained for FP-3 and FP-4B. Our failure to alter the shift pattern by addition of SP3-specific antibodies suggests that SP1 but not SP3 belongs to the dominant promoter binding protein. The NF-Y shift signal obtained with an oligonucleotide representing FP-2 was quenched by the addition of an NF-Y antibody. In contrast, the SP1 antibody did not impact the shift pattern. Similar results were obtained for the NF-Y signal in FP-4A. It should be noted that the SMAD shift signal in FP-4A was not impacted either by the SP1 or the NF-Y antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional promoter studies with mutated reporter gene constructs</title><p>To quantify the relative contribution of the various <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements we constructed reporter genes, in which the consensus binding sequences were mutated (see Table S2 in the Supplementary Material). For the reporter gene constructs only mutations that did not bind the corresponding transcription factors were used. To investigate separately the regulatory elements for the mitochondrial and cytosolic phGPx isoform (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f8">8</xref>) we mutated the most active reporter gene constructs from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f1">1</xref> (construct B1 for the mitochondrial isoform and construct C1 for the cytosolic isoform). Mutation of the SP1&#x0002f;SP3 binding site in FP-1 caused a strong inhibition in the promoter activity of both constructs (B1a versus B1b and C1a versus C1b). These data suggest that this binding site may be of major importance for expression regulation of both the mitochondrial and cytosolic phGPx isoforms. It has been reported before that mutation of the NF-Y binding site of FP-2 of the human ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene impaired the promoter activity of corresponding reporter genes by &#x0223c;40&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c23">23</xref>). We also observed a decreased promoter activity when the NF-Y binding site of the murine gene was mutated (B1a versus B1c and C1a versus C1c). However, this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.07, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3). Mutation of the SP1&#x0002f;SP3 binding site in FP-3 (B1a versus B1d and C1a versus C1d) did not induce a major alteration in the promoter activity for either construct. Inactivation of the consensus binding sequences in FP-4A (B1a versus B1e) and FP-4B (B1a versus B1f) slightly reduced the promoter activity of the B1 constructs (residual promoter activity of 89 and 78&#x00025;), whereas inhibition observed with C1 mutants (C1a versus C1e and C1a versus C1f) was more pronounced (47 and 48&#x00025;).</p><p>To test the regulatory interplay of different <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements we carried out simultaneous mutations of different consensus sequences and with this strategy we observed remarkable differences between the two sets of constructs. When the two functional binding sequences present in FP-1 and FP-2 were mutated simultaneously, no promoter activity was detectable at all with the B1 construct (B1g). In contrast, a residual promoter activity of &#x0003e;80&#x00025; was measured when the same mutations were introduced into the C1 reporter gene (C1g). Thus, preventing NF-Y binding to FP-2 further impaired the promoter activity of the FP-1-deficient B1 construct (B1b versus B1g) but reversed inhibition of the promoter activity of the FP-1-deficient C1 reporter genes (C1b versus C1g). Since the mutated B1 constructs lack the mitochondrial insertion sequence (between 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ATG) and the mutated C1 reporter genes contain it (the only structural difference between the B1 and C1 constructs) one may conclude that the inverse regulatory effect must be related to this stretch of nucleotides. It might be possible that NF-Y may interact directly or indirectly with the mitochondrial insertion sequence and depending on this interaction its regulatory impact may be modified. Additional experiments are required to further elucidate this interesting regulatory effect.</p><p>When the transcription factor binding sites of FP-2 &#x0002b; FP-3 (B1h) and FP-2 &#x0002b; FP-4A (B1i) were simultaneously mutated in B1 the inhibition of the promoter activity was somewhat more pronounced when compared with the separate mutations, suggesting additive effects of the two regulatory elements. In the C1 construct simultaneous mutation of FP-2 and FP-3 (C1h) was without additive effects on promoter activity when compared with the separate mutations (C1c and C1d). Similarly, no additive effect was observed for this construct when FP-2 and FP-4A were mutated jointly (C1i) or separately (C1 c and C1e). In contrast, when the consensus binding sequences in FP-3 &#x0002b; FP-4A (C1k) and FP-4A &#x0002b; FP-4B (C1m) were simultaneously mutated we observed an additive reduction of the promoter activity. For the corresponding B1 constructs (B1k, B1m) such an additive effect was not observed.</p><p>Taken together these data allow the following conclusions: (i) the SP1&#x0002f;SP3 binding site in FP-1 is of major regulatory importance for expression of both the mitochondrial and cytosolic phGPx isoform; (ii) simultaneous mutation of this sequence in connection with the NF-Y site of FP-2 completely wiped out the promoter activity of the B1 construct (mitochondrial isoform) and strongly reduced the inhibitory effect of separate mutations of the SP1&#x0002f;SP3 site in reporter gene C1 (cytosolic isoform); (iii) simultaneous mutations of the distal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (FP-1, FP-2, FP-3) impaired the promoter activity of the mitochondrial phGPx constructs more severely than that of the cytosolic isoform. In contrast, mutation of the proximal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (FP-4A and FP-4B) preferentially inhibited the activity of the cytosolic constructs (C1).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> binding of SP1 and NF-Y to the FP-1&#x02013;FP-2 region</title><p>The EMSA experiments including the supershift assays indicated that SP1 and NF-Y are present in the nuclei of testis and HEK293 cells and that they bind <italic>in vitro</italic> to the corresponding <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences in the phGPx promoter. To find out whether they also bind under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out. For this purpose DNA-binding proteins were covalently linked to genomic DNA by treatment with formaldehyde. The DNA&#x0002f;protein complexes were then sheared by sonication, and specific DNA&#x0002f;protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the two transcription factors. Covalent linkage was reversed and the precipitated double-stranded DNA was amplified by PCR using binding-site-specific primers. From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f9">9</xref>B it can be seen that PCR signals were obtained when the DNA&#x0002f;protein adducts were immunoprecipitated. In contrast, the corresponding controls, in which immunoprecipitation was performed without specific antibodies, did not show any PCR signal.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Regulation of expression of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene is a complex process, which involves transcriptional and post-transcriptional events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c14">14</xref>). Unfortunately, to date their mechanisms remain largely elusive. In mature rat testis the enzyme is expressed at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c21">21</xref>) but in prepuberal testicular tissue only small amounts can be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c19">19</xref>). These biological dynamics suggested a causal relation between phGPx expression and sperm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c25">25</xref>). In fact, there is a striking burst of phGPx expression during the transition of round to elongated spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c19">19</xref>), but it remains unclear which regulatory mechanisms might contribute. One reason for this lack of information may be the fact that the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory elements involved in phGPx expression have not been investigated in detail. The only information currently available was the description of a CCAAT box in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the human ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene, which binds NF-Y <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c23">23</xref>). Here we characterized several <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in the putative promoter of the murine ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene and characterized the corresponding <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory proteins. Interestingly, we found that the SP1&#x0002f;SP3 binding site detected in FP-1 appears to be of higher regulatory importance than the above-mentioned CCAAT box, which is also conserved in mice.</p><p>According to the conventional view of the structure of mammalian genes <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences are localized in the non-transcribed 5&#x02032;-flanking region. However, there is an increasing number of reports describing identification of functional transcription factor binding sites in intronic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c27">27</xref>) or even exonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c29">29</xref>) sequences and recently, the existence of regulatory sequences has been reported in intron 1 of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c30">30</xref>). The transcription factor binding sites identified here for the murine phGPx are localized in both, the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the mRNA (exonic sequences) and&#x0002f;or in the non-transcribed 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the gene. Their exact location relative to the transcriptional initiation site (Cap) is rather variable because several Cap sites have been described. As indicated above, there are two major phGPx mRNA populations (a mitochondrial and a cytosolic mRNA family) and both of them are heterogeneous with respect to their 5&#x02032; termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c11">11</xref>). The cytosolic transcript family lacks the mitochondrial insertion sequence and utilizes the 3&#x02032;-ATG for translational initiation. In contrast, mitochondrial mRNA population contains both, the 5&#x02032;- and the 3&#x02032;-ATG as well as the complete mitochondrial targeting sequence. Translation of the latter mRNA species is initiated at the 5&#x02032;-ATG. Our reporter gene assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f1">1</xref>) revealed significant promoter activity in the DNA region encoding for the mitochondrial insertion peptide. However, in this study we did not address the question of whether or not functional transcription factor binding sites can be found. This might be the subject of a follow-up study.</p><p>Transcriptional regulation of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene is highly complex since at least three different proteins can be synthesized. Apart for the cytosolic and mitochondrial phGPx isoforms the gene also encodes for the snGPx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c31">31</xref>) and there appear to be tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. The 34 kDa snGPx is predominantly expressed in the nuclei of late spermatids of various mammals. Protein chemical characterization indicated that the cytosolic phGPx is identical with the C-terminal two thirds of the snGPx. However, the N-terminal peptide of the snGPx carries an arginine-rich nuclear targeting sequence, which is responsible for nuclear import of the mature protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c31">31</xref>). Interestingly, this N-terminal peptide is encoded for by an alternative exon located in intron 1 of the joint ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c31">31</xref>). Recently, it was reported that the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of alternative exon 1, which constitutes the potential snGPx promoter, lacks major promoter activity but strongly suppresses the activity of the ph&#x0002f;snGPx promoter suggesting the existence of negative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in the first intron of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c30">30</xref>). EMSAs and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the <italic>in vitro</italic> (e.g. CRE-binding proteins) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (e.g. Egr1 and SREBP1) binding of several transcription factors suggesting their involvement in transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c30">30</xref>). The question as to whether the transcripts encoding for the snGPx are generated by transcriptional initiation at an alternative promoter or by alternative splicing of a joint precursor is currently discussed in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c32">32</xref>). However, the experimental data available at the moment are not sufficient to answer this mechanistic question and more work is needed to finally resolve it.</p><p>The relative lack of information on the structural basis of transcriptional regulation of the joint ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene on the one hand and the functional importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg650c14">14</xref>) of the enzyme in anti-oxidative defense and spermatogenesis on the other, prompted us to study the regulatory mechanisms in more detail. Our attempts at designing an experimental strategy for this purpose were aggravated by the complex expression pattern (at least three different proteins originate from the ph&#x0002f;snGPx gene), which is due to the existence of multiple transcription initiation sites and&#x0002f;or to alternative splicing mechanisms. Since for each transcriptional initiation site regulatory sequences were supposed to exist in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region, a complex pattern of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements was expected in the putative promoter. When we investigated the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the sn&#x0002f;phGPx gene starting at the 3&#x02032;-ATG (translational initiation of the cytosolic enzyme) we observed five functional protein-binding sites (FP-1 to FP-4B) and site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg650f7">7</xref>) suggested a clustering of these <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. Separate mutation of FP-1 reduced the promoter activity of mitochondrial and cytosolic constructs. Thus, this SP1&#x0002f;SP3 binding site appears to be essential for expression regulation of both isoforms. Simultaneous inactivation of the transcription factor binding sites localized in FP-1 and FP-2 induced a complete loss in promoter activity of the B1 construct (block of transcription of the mitochondrial isoform). In contrast, the C1 construct that contains the regulatory elements for transcription of the cytosolic messenger exhibited a residual promoter activity of &#x0223c;80&#x00025;. These data suggest that simultaneous functional silencing of the distal protein-binding sites (5&#x02032;-cluster containing FP-1 and FP-2) abolished the promoter activity for the mitochondrial isoform but hardly impacts that for the cytosolic enzyme. Inversely, simultaneous mutation of the proximal protein-binding sites (3&#x02032;-cluster containing FP-4A and FP-4B) strongly reduces the promoter activity of construct C1 (cytosolic isoform) but had only minor effects on construct B1 (mitochondrial isoform).</p><p>It should be stressed at this point that this scenario might be an oversimplification of the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation since it does not consider the interactions of the identified <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory elements with other regulatory proteins. Moreover, nothing is known about spatial arrangements of the initiation complexes and the existence of far distal enhancer and silencer sequences cannot be excluded. Finally, covalent modification (phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, etc.) of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory elements may impact their regulatory importance and this aspect has not been addressed in our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_31_15_4293__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_31_15_4293__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg650s1"><caption><p><bold>Scheme 1.</bold> Multiple transcription initiation sites in mouse and rat tissues.
