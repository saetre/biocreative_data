First, proximal epiblast cells acquire germ cell competence at E6.5, partly in response to extraembryonic ectoderm-derived signalling molecules. A subset of these competent cells then acquire a primordial germ cell (PGC) fate and a population of approximately 45 founder germ cells are detected in the posterior proximal region of the embryo at the base of the incipient allantoic bud on E7.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The secreted signalling molecules, BMP4, BMP8b and BMP2 as well as components of the BMP signal transduction pathway, including Smad1 and Smad5, appear to be involved in the specification of PGCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, <italic>in vitro </italic>culture studies and analysis of <italic>BMP4</italic>-deficient mice suggest that an additional signal may also be required for the acquisition of PGC fate, but its identity is yet unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>We recently identified <italic>fragilis</italic>, a putative interferon-inducible gene, which codes for a transmembrane protein that is apparently associated with the acquisition of germ cell competence by epiblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Extraembryonic ectoderm is able to induce <italic>fragilis </italic>expression in epiblast tissue, and BMP4 is required for this induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>fragilis </italic>is expressed in proximal epiblast at E6.5, the region in which PGC-competent cells reside according to clonal analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As these proximal cells move to the posterior proximal region during gastrulation, <italic>fragilis </italic>expression increases within a community of cells at the base of the incipient allantoic bud. Cells with the highest expression of <italic>fragilis </italic>initiate the germ cell-characteristic expression of <italic>TNAP </italic>and <italic>stella/PGC-7 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These nascent founder PGCs with high expression of <italic>fragilis </italic>also show repression of <italic>Hox </italic>genes, including <italic>Hoxb1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In view of the strong association of <italic>fragilis </italic>with PGC specification, we have started to investigate further how this gene may be regulated and what precise function it serves during germ cell development. Towards this objective, we now report that <italic>fragilis </italic>belongs to a novel murine gene family, comprising five members, which code for five highly similar transmembrane proteins. Importantly, the genes are clustered within a 68 kb genomic region. As we found several homologues of the Fragilis family in human, cow and rat, they seem to be evolutionarily conserved amongst mammalian species. Most if not all homologous genes have been reported to be responsive to interferon signalling, which is in agreement with the presence of conserved interferon stimulable response elements (ISREs) within at least the murine and human loci. Furthermore, our in situ hybridisation and single cell expression analysis reveal that the two members located close to <italic>fragilis</italic>, <italic>fragilis2 </italic>and <italic>fragilis3</italic>, are also expressed in founder PGCs, although their overall expression pattern in post-implantation embryos in other respects is distinct. Studies on the Fragilis family of genes could therefore be crucial for our understanding of PGC specification, especially since their homologues have been implicated in mediating homotypic cell adhesion and lengthening of the cell cycle time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These studies may also show how interferons act as signalling molecules, which has hitherto not been considered in the context of embryonic development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The Fragilis gene family</title><p>Using the cDNA sequence of <italic>fragilis </italic>as a template to search the Ensembl genome browser <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org"/>, we identified eight mouse genes with moderate to high DNA sequence similarity to <italic>fragilis </italic>(45&#x02013;74%). ESTs from a variety of embryonic and adult tissues have been reported for five of these genes, of which four possess a two-exon structure similar to <italic>fragilis</italic>. Analysis of the genomic location of the latter revealed that the four genes cluster around the <italic>fragilis </italic>locus within a 68 kb region on the distal tip of mouse Chr 7 (F5). We therefore named the four novel genes <italic>fragilis2-5</italic>, reflecting their genomic location, their similarity to <italic>fragilis </italic>and their germ cell associated expression pattern (see below; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The four remaining putative genes that we detected have few or mostly no reported ESTs and are coded by a single exon unlike <italic>fragilis</italic>. We therefore consider them to be pseudogenes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The Fragilis family cluster on mouse Chr7, and the human homologues in the syntenic region on Chr11. In the mouse, the five Fragilis genes are clustered within a 68 kb region. All genes are encoded by two exons, and apart from <italic>fragilis2</italic>, they are located on the minus strand. In human, the four homologous genes, <italic>ENSG142056</italic>, <italic>Ifitm1 </italic>(9&#x02013;27), <italic>Ifitm2 </italic>(<italic>1-8D</italic>) and <italic>Ifitm3 </italic>(<italic>1-8U</italic>), are clustered within a 26.5 kb stretch. No sequence information is currently available for the genomic region downstream the <italic>Ifitm2 </italic>gene (blank bar), although a mapped genomic DNA clone containing the three Ifitm genes has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The four human homologues are each encoded by two exons, but the length of the intronic sequence for <italic>Ifitm1 </italic>and <italic>Iftm3 </italic>is not known.

Three of these genes, <italic>Ifitm1 </italic>(9&#x02013;27), <italic>Ifitm2 </italic>(<italic>1-8D</italic>) and <italic>Ifitm3 </italic>(<italic>1-8U</italic>), share 58&#x02013;65% similarity to the fragilis gene cluster and are located within an 18 kb genomic stretch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. They are responsive to type1/2 interferons and code for <underline>i</underline>nter<underline>f</underline>eron <underline>i</underline>nduced <underline>t</underline>rans<underline>m</underline>embrane (Ifitm) proteins, involved in antiproliferative signalling and homotypic cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The fourth gene, <italic>ENSG142056</italic>, a novel gene with two exons, is highly similar to mouse <italic>fragilis4 </italic>(83% DNA sequence similarity) and neighbours <italic>Ifitm2</italic>. The human Fragilis family homologues hence form a similar genomic cluster as the five Fragilis genes in the mouse (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Phylogenetic tree analysis suggests however, that only two Fragilis genes, <italic>fragilis4 </italic>and either <italic>fragilis</italic>, <italic>fragilis2 </italic>or <italic>fragilis3</italic>, have been conserved from mouse to human (data not shown). Subsequent gene duplications may therefore have occurred independently in both species. We also identified two Fragilis family-like genes in cow (bovine <italic>1-8U</italic>, bovine 9&#x02013;27) and four genes in rat (<italic>P26376</italic>, <italic>JC1241</italic>, <italic>NP110460</italic>, <italic>AAD48010</italic>). While the rat genes have been annotated as putative interferon-inducible, the two bovine genes that are similar to the human Ifitm genes, have been reported to respond to interferon signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Due to limited mapping information of the cow and rat genomes, we cannot, at this stage, deduce whether these homologous genes are also organised in a cluster. Interferon stimulable response elements (ISREs, GGAAAN(N)GAAAC) within the human Ifitm locus confer the responsiveness of the three human Ifitm genes to interferons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similar ISRE consensus sequences are also found within the Fragilis family cluster in the mouse, associated in particular with <italic>fragilis</italic>, <italic>fragilis2 </italic>and <italic>fragilis5 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>The murine family of <italic>fragilis </italic>and related genes code for five highly similar transcripts of 104 to 144 amino acids, each containing two predicted transmembrane domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The sequence similarity to human, cow and rat <italic>fragilis</italic>-like genes is equally high (overall 68% amino acid similarity). It should be noted, that the first transmembrane domain as well as the following stretch to the beginning of the second transmembrane domain constitute the regions of highest intra- and inter-species conservation.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Protein alignment of the Fragilis family and their homologues in human, cow and rat.

These probes show no significant cross-hybridization between members of the Fragilis family as judged by dotblot analysis (data not shown). As reported, we saw expression of <italic>fragilis </italic>restricted to the epiblast at E5.5 and E6.5. More importantly, around E7.5, expression of <italic>fragilis </italic>is intense within a population of cells at the base of the allantois in the region where PGC specification occurs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a,3b,3c</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>fragilis2 </italic>and <italic>fragilis3 </italic>are also expressed within the epiblast of E5.5 embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3g</xref>, data not shown). While expression of <italic>fragilis2 </italic>is thereafter significantly downregulated, <italic>fragilis3 </italic>remains expressed at a similar level in the embryonic tissues. At E7.5, <italic>fragilis2 </italic>is detected in the posterior mesoderm, while <italic>fragilis3 </italic>expression is seen throughout the epiblast. More significantly, like <italic>fragilis</italic>, both <italic>fragilis2 </italic>and <italic>fragilis3 </italic>show high expression in the region where the cluster of founder PGCs originates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i/i',3n/n'</xref>). Thus, these three members of the Fragilis family show significant expression at the time and site of PGC specification.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Expression analysis of <italic>fragilis </italic>(a-f), <italic>fragilis2 </italic>(g-l) and <italic>fragilis3 </italic>(m-r) by whole mount in situ hybridisation.

Additionally, a signal is detected in the latero-anterior aspects of the developing brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>). At this stage, <italic>fragilis2 </italic>is expressed in the mesoderm in the caudal half of the embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3j,3k</xref>), whereas <italic>fragilis3 </italic>appears present throughout the entire embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3p,3q,3r</xref>). It is noteworthy, that expression seems significantly stronger in cells at the base and within the proximal third of the allantois at this stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3q</xref>). At E9.5, <italic>fragilis </italic>signal is seen in the mesoderm and the pharyngeal arches (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f</xref>).

This confirmed the pattern seen in whole mount preparations, namely presence of staining in the presomitic, somatic and bodywall mesoderm in the caudal regions of the embryo at E9.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a,4b,4c,4d</xref>). It appears that <italic>fragilis2 </italic>expression is lost in differentiating mesodermal or somatic tissue, hence explaining the caudal-to-rostral gradient of staining seen in the caudal region of the whole mount embryos (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3l</xref>). In addition, the sections show expression in the ventral neural tube, as well as in single cells within the wall of the hindgut. As the sagittal sections of E10.5 embryos demonstrate, these latter cells seem to belong to a population of <italic>fragilis2 </italic>mRNA positive cells, which are migrating along the hindgut and ventral to the dorsal aorta (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e,4g</xref>). Their location suggests strongly that these cells are at least in part PGCs, migrating from their site of origin into the developing genital ridges. Furthermore, <italic>fragilis2 </italic>expression is seen in the developing lung tissue posterior to the embryonic heart and ventral to the dorsal aorta (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e,4f</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Expression analysis of <italic>fragilis2 </italic>by in situ hybridisation on sections.

While their expression pattern is distinct, there is a striking overlap within the region where founder germ cells are located. This could suggest that the three neighbouring genes, <italic>fragilis, fragilis2 </italic>and <italic>fragilis3</italic>, may share regulatory elements that might be present within the cluster. Such regulatory elements may be responsible for the genes' overlapping expression pattern specifically around the region of PGCs specification.</p></sec><sec><title>Single cell analysis of <italic>fragilis, fragilis2 </italic>and <italic>fragilis3 </italic>in PGCs and somatic neighbours</title><p>To obtain more precise information on the expression of the new Fragilis family members in the context of germ cell specification, we tested single cell cDNAs from PGCs and surrounding somatic cells sited at the base of the incipient allantoic bud in E7.5 embryos.

This mimics the pattern seen for <italic>fragilis</italic>, although expression of the latter is more specific to germ cells. Combined with the in situ hybridisation data, these observations further support the notion that certain common control elements may be involved in the upregulated expression of the three Fragilis genes in the founder PGCs.</p><p>During the developmental stages directly subsequent to PGC specification, all three Fragilis family genes are expressed in a population of cells associated with the allantois and in a location where premigrating PGCs are thought to reside (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3,3d,3k,3q</xref>). The precise gene expression during migration of PGCs is not clear at this stage from our analysis.

Three members of the Fragilis family, <italic>fragilis, fragilis2 </italic>and <italic>fragilis3</italic>, exhibit expression, which is associated with germ cell specification and development. Located at the cell membrane, the Fragilis proteins may be important for mediating interactions amongst germ cells and their surrounding neighbours. While the three genes are expressed earlier at E5.5 and thereafter to a varying extent, they all show upregulation of expression within nascent PGCs. It is possible that a cis control element exists within the locus that is required for this expression, which continues within gonadal PGCs. Future studies will elucidate whether such control elements exist, where they are located and how they could regulate expression of the <italic>fragilis</italic>-related genes.</p><p>Although the five Fragilis family members are clustered within a small genomic region, it appears that neither <italic>fragilis4 </italic>nor <italic>fragilis5 </italic>show expression in early embryos or embryonic germ cells. It is striking that these two members are located at the periphery of the cluster in contrast to the centrally located <italic>fragilis</italic>, <italic>fragilis2 </italic>and <italic>fragilis3 </italic>genes. This lack of expression may be due to the presence of boundary elements, which might restrict the action of control elements to genes present within the centre of the cluster. The four human homologues of the Fragilis family are also arranged in a genomic cluster. However, sequence comparison suggests that gene duplications at the mouse Fragilis and the human Ifitm locus may have occurred independently in the two species. Hence, it appears that a certain evolutionary constrain may exist on duplication and maintenance of the duplicated genes within immediate neighbourhood. Since the human homologues are clustered in the syntenic region and are highly similar to the family genes, it is tempting to speculate that they may also serve similar functions as in mouse and man.</p><p>The presence of several interferon stimulable response element (ISRE) consensus sequences within the Fragilis locus, together with the similarity of the genes to their interferon-inducible human and bovine counterparts, suggest very strongly that <italic>fragilis </italic>and the <italic>fragilis</italic>-related genes are responsive to interferons or possibly other cytokines. Indeed, the ISRE tandem repeat present in the 5' flanking region of human <italic>Ifitm1</italic>, <italic>Ifitm2 </italic>and <italic>Ifitm3 </italic>genes is also present in the 5' flanking region of <italic>fragilis </italic>exon 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Interferons, as secreted signalling molecules, have so far been implicated mainly in the process of immune response, the inhibition of cellular growth and the control of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although interferons are expressed in the post-implantation embryo, their role during development has not been addressed in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our studies have pointed to a possible involvement of interferons in germ cell development. Future work will determine whether the Fragilis genes respond to interferon signals in all or some instances where the genes are expressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified the Fragilis family of interferon-inducible genes, which code for transmembrane proteins. The five members are arranged in a cluster within a genomic region of 68 kb in the mouse that also contains ISRE elements. The centrally located <italic>fragilis</italic>, <italic>fragilis2 </italic>and <italic>fragilis3 </italic>genes are of particular interest, because they are expressed in the region and at the time where germ cell specification occurs. The family is evolutionarily conserved amongst mammalian species where it may serve similar functions. Detailed studies of the Fragilis family may also show what role interferons have in embryonic development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Accession numbers</title><p>Nucleotide sequence data reported are available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases as primary sequences under the accession numbers: AY082484 (<italic>fragilis</italic>), AY082486 (<italic>fragilis3</italic>), AY247203 (<italic>fragilis5</italic>); and in the Third Party Annotation Section under the accession numbers: BK001123 (<italic>fragilis2</italic>), BK001124 (<italic>fragilis4</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Database searches and animals</title><p>Ensembl and partly NCBI genome browsers have been used for data retrieval.
