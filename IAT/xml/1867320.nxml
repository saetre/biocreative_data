We have determined crystal structure of the high-affinity zinc transporter ZnuA from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> at 1.8 &#x000c5; resolution. This structure represents the first native (non-recombinant) protein structure of a periplasmic metal binding protein. ZnuA reveals numerous conformational features, which occur either in Zn<sup>2+</sup> or in Mn<sup>2+</sup> transporters, and presents a unique conformational state. A comprehensive comparison of ZnuA with other periplasmic ligand binding protein structures suggests vital mechanistic differences between bound and release states of metal transporters. The key new attributes in ZnuA include a C-domain disulfide bond, an extra &#x003b1;-helix proximal to the highly charged metal chelating mobile loop region, alternate conformations of secondary shell stabilizing residues at the metal binding site, and domain movements potentially controlled by salt bridges.

However, structures of metal binding PLBPs of cluster 9 family display a distinct fold wherein a rigid &#x003b1;-helix connects the two terminal domains.

Interestingly, an additional helix LH is found in the N-domain of ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Further, the charged loop L7 (residues 144-148) has moved &#x0223c;2-3 &#x000c5; away from the bottom of the metal binding cleft and this reflects slight movement of helix d in the N-domain as well as a &#x0223c;4 &#x000c5; movement of helix h in the C-domain. These structural movements may be due to closed conformation of loop L16 (residues 282-291).

There is a large separation found at the C-terminal end of strands E and G in ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic>. Interestingly, in the case of ZnuA-<italic>Syn</italic>, the gap between E and G strands is bridged by three bound water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6(c)</xref>), of which one water molecule is conserved in all three structures PsaA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> TroA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> and MntC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> These features suggest that water is likely to play key roles during the small conformational changes that occur during metal coordination and release. Further, Glu256 (strand G) is conserved in all the five proteins (TroA, PsaA, MntC, ZnuA-<italic>Syn</italic> and ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic>) and this residue is involved in side-chain mediated interactions with backbone N atoms of strand E (in which one of the residues is the metal chelating His/Glu). In addition, one of the side-chain oxygen atoms of Glu256/248 hydrogen bonds to sidechain N<sup>&#x003b4;1</sup> of metal binding His207/199 in the case of ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic> and TroA. However, the corresponding active site His243 in ZnuA-<italic>Syn</italic> is flipped 180&#x000b0; in a trapdoor-like fashion compared to ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic> and TroA structures. This histidine flipping is likely to correspond to metal bound and release states of metal transporting PLBPs, as discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Salt bridges and conserved hydrogen bonding networks</title><p id="P14">ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic> structure reveals two important salt bridges occurring in the N-domain metal binding arm (which comprises of strand B, loop L3 and helix b) and the long linker helix d&#x02019;. In the metal binding arm region, a conserved hydrogen bond is observed between side-chains Tyr-Asp/Gln for ABC-type PLBPs of cluster 9 family structures. The interaction distances range from 2.5 &#x000c5; to 3.2 &#x000c5;, except in molecule B of ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic> (3.9 &#x000c5;) and PsaA (4.1 &#x000c5;). These differences are significant, and most likely provide snapshots of transitional states during metal binding and release. Superimposition of molecules A and B of ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic> reveals small but significant deviations near the helix b region. In the metal binding arm of ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic>, there is a salt bridge network (between Arg65, Arg71, Asp50 and Asp68), which extends to form the metal binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7(a)</xref>). These salt bridge linkages restrict the movement of residues Glu59 and His60 and lock the active site amino acid cluster in a defined state. The metal binding residue His143 is located at the base of mobile loop L7. This residue is also stabilized by a secondary shell hydrogen bonding network (Supplementary Data, Figure SF7c). The termini of loop L7 residues are close to each other and are linked by backbone hydrogen bonds between Met115 and Asn141. These interactions are further reinforced by the strictly conserved residue Tyr212 side-chain hydrogen bond. Asn141 is a secondary shell stabilizing residue and in close interaction with active site His143. Interestingly, in A and B representations of ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic>, the side-chain of Asn141 adopts different conformations. This residue position is conserved in all the cases of ABC-type metal binding PLBPs and occurs either as Asn or as Asp.</p><p id="P15">At the bottom of the metal binding cleft, the N-domain Trp145 is strictly conserved amongst most metal binding PLBPs of cluster 9 family. Trp145 is involved in a hydrogen bonding network with C-domain Pro280 and Tyr292 (Supplementary Data, Figure SF7d). The conservation of this hydrogen bond network may hold the bottom portion of the N and C-domain tightly upon binding and releasing stages. In addition, in the middle of the long helix d&#x02019; residue Leu184 is strictly conserved in all for metal binding PLBPs, suggesting that this hydrophobic lock may restrict movement of the N-domain. A salt bridge is found between N-domain residues Arg152 and Glu149 and the helix d&#x02019; residues Glu181, and Glu188 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7(b)</xref>). In molecule A, Arg152 adopts a double conformation suggesting flexibility. This salt bridge extends to form a hydrogen bond network with C-domain residues. The side-chain oxygen atom of Glu188 forms a hydrogen bond with N<sup>&#x003b5;2</sup> of Gln216 (2.6 &#x000c5;) in molecule A while O<sup>&#x003b5;1</sup> is involved in water mediated interactions with Ser147. However, in molecule B, the distance between O<sup>&#x003b5;2</sup> of Glu188 and N<sup>&#x003b5;2</sup> of Gln216 is large (4.1 &#x000c5;), while Ser147 again adopts a double conformation. Hence, movement of the C-domain helix e is likely to act like a relay bar in a &#x0201c;seesaw&#x0201d; mechanism of conformational change.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Conformational differences within ABC-type PLBPs</title><p id="P16">Crystal structures of metal transporting PLBPs indicate that their N-terminal domains are highly conserved. For example, the backbone hydrogen bonding pattern between N-domain &#x003b2;-strands are very similar to one another for all structures analyzed from this protein family. There are also no large deviations found in the long linker helix in metal binding PLBPs either in metal bound and free forms, indicating rigidity of this linker segment. However, the C-terminal domains seem more flexible in these metal-binding PLBPs.

It is also becoming clear that the metal binding PLBPs utilize a different mechanism for ligand binding and release than the PLBPs which target larger size ligands (the so-called &#x0201c;Venus fly-trap&#x0201d; mechanism). Our structural analysis suggests that the Venus fly-trap mechanism, which is based on significant motion of the hinge linker between N and C-domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8(a)</xref>) seems unlikely to be applicable for the metal transporting PLBPs. Instead, we propose a &#x0201c;partial domain slippage&#x0201d; mechanism which stems from small yet significant conformational changes in multiple locations of ZnuA, which together potentially drive binding and release of zinc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8(b)</xref>).

This hydrogen bonding network is conserved regardless of whether the metal binding PLBP is in a bound state (ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic>) or in a potential release state (ZnuA-<italic>Syn</italic>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> This network therefore restricts movement of N and C- domain bottoms thereby making the Venus fly-trap mechanism unlikely for metal binding PLBPs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P21">The conserved main-chain (Ile/Val42) and side-chain (Asn/Arg176) hydrogen bonds between N-domain helix a and long helix d&#x02019;, along with the salt bridge between Arg152, Glu49, Glu181, Glu188 together lock the N-domain with the hinge back-bone helix d&#x02019;. This imposes bending restrictions on the backbone helix, and disallows opening of the N-domain. Once again, this conformational restriction makes the Venus fly-trap mechanism for metal binding PLBPs unlikely. Therefore, the &#x0201c;seesaw&#x0201d; mechanism of C-domain helix e detailed earlier may facilitate slippage of the bottom part of the C-domain, which is necessary prerequisite for flipping of His207, which in turn may initiate early steps in metal release.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P22">In ZnuA-<italic>Syn<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></italic> (and also in PsaA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> TroA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> and MtnC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), which we believe represents metal binding PLBP in a release state, there is a conserved water molecule between C-domain strands E and G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6(c)</xref>). However, in ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic>, which we propose presents a snapshot of the bound state, there is no equivalent water. Entry of water in the C-domain is likely to break a series of backbone hydrogen bonds between strands E and G (as observed in ZnuA-<italic>Syn</italic>), which in turn may facilitate slippage of the top portion of the C-domain.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P23">The C-domain metal binding His207 from ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic> and the equivalent His243 of ZnuA-<italic>Syn</italic> are flipped 180&#x000b0; relative to each other, without any obvious conformational changes in other N-domain metal binding residues. This histidine conformation in ZnuA-<italic>Syn</italic> is likely to correspond to the metal release step. A particular trigger is required to cause conformational movements, which lead to the flipping of His207/His243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8(b)</xref>). Movement of the metal binding arm towards the metal binding cleft along with breakage of backbone hydrogen bonds between &#x003b2;-strands E and G in the C-domain (the hydrogen bonding network here is again different between ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic> and ZnuA-<italic>Syn</italic>) may together provide such a trigger.</p></list-item></list><p id="P24">Therefore, chain of events that are by binding of loaded ZnuA to ZnuB. Clearly, docking of ZnuB on to ZnuA may provide energy for triggering domain movements and conformational changes, which will eventually lead to the release of bound zinc. Complexing of ZnuA with ZnuB may move the N-domain metal binding arm closer to the zinc binding cleft. Then, water may enter the C-domain sheet regions and lead to slippage of the C-domain top part. This conformational alteration may translate into flipping of the active site His207 and subsequent steps of metal release. The cycle of binding and release will then be completed when the collapsed C-domain moves away from the active site due to import of a new zinc ion. In summary, the structure of ZnuA from a native, non-recombinant source has allowed us to compare and analyze various modes of metal chelation and release within the PLBP cluster 9 family. Our analyses provide evidence for step-wise release of bound zinc from ZnuA which stems from small conformational changes in the C-terminal domain of ZnuA. In this light, we assign the present ZnuA-<italic>Ec</italic> complex with zinc as the metal &#x0201c;bound&#x0201d; state while other previous structures like ZnuA-<italic>Syn</italic> may represent initial conformational steps of the metal &#x0201c;release&#x0201d; state. The series of small structural changes required for egress of metal form part of our proposed partial domain slippage mechanism, which is in sharp contrast to the Venus fly-trap mechanism, which seems unlikely to be applicable to high-affinity metal transporters.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S11"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Protein purification and crystallization</title><p id="P25"><italic>E. coli</italic> strain B834 (DE3) (derivative of K-12) was grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glucose, 50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>-1</sup> of each amino acid including selenomethionine (except Met and Cys) according to the standard selenomethionine labeling protocol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> The culture was centrifuged after 24 h of growth and the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris -(pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl) and lysed by sonication.

The N-terminal metal binding arm of ZnuA has strictly conserved Tyr62 and Asp68 which hydrogen bond. The salt bridge networks between Arg65, Arg71, Glu50 and Asp68 are also shown.

The N and C-domains are held by a flexible linker which acts as a hinge. Bending of the flexible linker allows opening of the two domains so that the trapped ligand can escape. (b) Our proposed partial domain slippage mechanism for capture/release of zinc by cluster 9 family of PLBPs. The conserved hydrogen bonding networks and salt bridges restrict movement of the metal binding arm, and upon metal release a water and Glu59 will occupy the vacant metal site. The alternate conformation of Arg152 and a seesaw mechanism of C-domain helix e may cause the slippage of the bottom part of the C-domain. The breakage of backbone hydrogen bonds between strands G and E in the C-domain may trigger flexibility that leads to flipping of the active site His207, which was seen in the ZnuA-<italic>Syn</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6(c)</xref>). Flipping of His207 may be the first conformational step towards release of bound metal. The marked labels are as follows: (i) hydrogen bonding network at the metal binding arm; (ii) domain movement controlling the hydrogen bonding network and salt brides; (iii) metal binding site.
