It is postulated that different tertiary or quaternary structures of infectious PrP provide the information necessary to code for strain properties. We show here that different light microscopic types of abnormal PrP (PrP<sup>d</sup>) accumulation found in each of 10 sheep scrapie cases correspond ultrastructurally with abnormal endocytosis, increased endo-lysosomes, microfolding of plasma membranes, extracellular PrP<sup>d</sup> release and intercellular PrP<sup>d</sup> transfer of neurons and/or glia. The same accumulation patterns of PrP<sup>d</sup> and associated subcellular lesions were present in each of two scrapie strains present, but they were present in different proportions. The observations suggest that different trafficking pathways of PrP<sup>d</sup> are influenced by strain and cell type and that a single prion strain causes several PrP<sup>d</sup>&#x02013;protein interactions at the cell membrane. These results imply that strains may contain or result in production of multiple isoforms of PrP<sup>d</sup>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>prion disease</kwd><kwd>scrapie</kwd><kwd>stroin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Scrapie of sheep is the prototype of a group of fatal neurological diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases that include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cattle and Creutzfeldt&#x02013;Jakob disease of man. The cause of the TSEs or prion diseases is still a matter of some debate, but most investigators now favor the prion hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), which postulates that the cause of prion diseases is an abnormal form of a host-coded, cell surface, sialoglycoprotein called prion protein (PrP). For many years, a major challenge to the prion hypothesis has been to explain how an abnormal protein could code for the existence of numerous, stable, well-characterized rodent scrapie strains. According to this hypothesis, strain-specific information is encoded within the conformation of different tertiary or quaternary structures of an infectious isoform of PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>).</p><p>Murine scrapie strains are characterized according to their relative incubation periods in different inbred mouse lines, different patterns of pathology and immunochemical forms of abnormal PrP accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). A smaller number of experimental sheep scrapie strains have been recognized by their relative incubation times in different PrP genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Biochemical methods are not readily able to distinguish between natural scrapie sources, although two experimental strains, CH1641 and BSE, have distinctive molecular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>); however, both experimental and naturally occurring scrapie sources may be distinguished by pathological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The specific parameters of the pathological phenotype that permit differentiation of strains differs for sheep and mice: different murine strains show marked variation in vacuolation and neuroanatomic targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), but sheep scrapie strains and sources mainly affect the same brain areas and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Following immunohistochemical labeling, individual sheep strains and sources show highly diverse morphological types of disease-associated PrP (PrP<sup>d</sup>) accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), whereas cloned murine strains have fewer types of PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation. Although the PrP genotype may affect the magnitude of PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation in sheep, the patterns and types of PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation are not influenced by breed or route of inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). From studies of the proportions of different types of PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation (the PrP<sup>d</sup> profile), we have proposed that the pathology phenotype of sheep strains are partly the result of differences in the relative affinity of different sheep scrapie agents for different cell types and by differences in the cellular processing of PrP<sup>d</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In the present study, we have sought to determine the nature of these putative processing or trafficking pathways of PrP<sup>d</sup> in different sheep scrapie sources.</p><p>In previous electron microscopy immunogold studies of rodent scrapie, we have shown that PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulates in the extracellular space and at the plasma membrane of neurons, glial cells and follicular dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The degree to which the plasma membrane and extracellular forms show a tendency to aggregate and form fibrils differs between strains and tissues, but no differences in the nature of the changes in neurons of different brain areas were found. In contrast, variation in neuronal pathology both within and between neuroanatomic sites may be found for different sheep scrapie sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). To determine whether there are different processing pathways for PrP<sup>d</sup> sheep scrapie strains, we first determined the <italic>in vivo</italic> sites of accumulation and processing of PrP<sup>d</sup> in different naturally occurring sheep scrapie sources and then investigated possible molecular mechanisms for some of these changes in brain and in lymphoid tissues (the latter is reported separately in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Our results suggest that varying proportions of several functional conformers are present in the brains of different sheep scrapie strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The sheep included in the study and the methods of tissue fixation have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).

One of these slices was used for electron microscopy. The second slice and additional brain slices from representative brain areas were taken and processed into paraffin wax for PrP<sup>d</sup> profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Sections were mounted, dried overnight, dewaxed and immersed in 98% formic acid, then washed and autoclaved in 0.2% citric acid for 30 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase was inhibited with freshly prepared 3% hydrogen peroxide and slides were washed and blocked with 1:20 normal horse serum for 60 minutes. All slides were incubated with the rat monoclonal antibody R145. The wax-embedded medulla tissue sections were also immunolabeled using the technique described previously with the following antibodies: monoclonal anti-clathrin heavy chain (BD biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), monoclonal anti-clathrin light chain con1 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK), monoclonal anti-dynamin Hudy 1 (Upstate, Dundee, Scotland), monoclonal anti-dynamin D5 (Santa Cruz, York, UK), monoclonal anti-amphiphysin VAM-SV030 and VAM SV031 (Bioquote Ltd., Heidelberg, Germany), and polyclonal anti-ubiquitin (Dako UK Ltd., Ely, UK). Tissues were immunolabeled using these antibodies both with and without formic acid and autoclave steps.</p><p>Tissues for electron microscopy were selected under a dissecting microscope and embedded in araldite. Light microscopic labeling of 1-&#x000b5;m-thick plastic-embedded tissues for PrP was performed as described previously, but tissue sections were first etched using saturated sodium ethoxide immersed in 98% formic acid. Ubiquitin labeling was carried out as described previously; however, both labeling and section quality were improved with the omission of the formic acid step.</p><p>For electron microscopy, 55 nm sections were placed on 600-mesh gold grids and etched in sodium periodate for 60 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked and sections de-osmicated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in distilled water for 10 minutes followed by enhancement of antigen expression with 98% formic acid for 10 minutes. Primary antibody (523.7, a gift from Jan Langeveld) at a 1:250 dilution was then applied for 15 h at 27&#x000b0;C and incubated with Auroprobe&#x02122; 1 nm colloidal gold (Amersham Ltd., Amersham, UK). Sections were then postfixed with 2.5% gluteraldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and labeling enhanced with Goldenhance&#x000ae; (Nanoprobes Ltd.) for 10 minutes. Grids were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate as described previously. In order to have exact correlation for individual cells and specific PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation types, serial 1-&#x000b5;m- and 55-nm-thick sections were labeled for PrP by light and electron microscopy, respectively. Ubiquitin labeling was carried out using Dako anti-ubiquitin&#x000ae; antibody at a 1:50 dilution without formic acid.</p><p>Sections stained for PrP<sup>d</sup> were initially examined blind and the number of PrP<sup>d</sup>-positive structures were recorded as negative, sparse, few, moderate or marked.

PrP<sup>d</sup> labeling was found within these connecting twisted tubules and in the associated coated structures and pits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B,C</xref>).

The bizarre extensions and branching of the necks of coated pits led us to consider the possibility that molecular abnormalities of the endocytosis and recycling of PrP<sup>d</sup> might be involved in these changes. We therefore investigated proteins involved in the formation of coated pits and in their excision from the plasma membrane in several light microscopic studies. Immunohistochemistry of clathrin, dynamin and amphiphysin showed no significant changes (data not shown). However, ubiquitin, which is involved in tagging proteins for proteolysis in endosomal-lysosomes was increased.</p><p>By light microscopy, punctate ubiquitin immunolabeling was present in neuropil of varying intensity in scrapie-affected sheep but not in controls.

When sheep were allocated to strain type, two distinct groups were evident. Thus, the two scrapie strains present differed according to discrete differences in the proportions of lesions present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>At the level of the DMNV or olivary nuclei, there were few differences in the light microscopic patterns of PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation when each of the 10 scrapie-affected sheep was examined. A semiquantitative analysis of electron microscopy lesions present in the DMNV and in olivary nuclei was performed on coded grids. When the magnitude of selected features are tabulated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), the 10 scrapie-affected sheep can be divided into two distinct groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) that correspond with the strains identified by light microscopic PrP<sup>d</sup> profiling. The first group showed marked formation of PrP<sup>d</sup>-associated abnormal coated pits and associated membrane irregularity and invaginations, increased lysosomes in neurons (mostly PrP<sup>d</sup> positive) and had more readily detectable spiral membrane inclusions. The five remaining sheep also had each of these features but in much less abundance. However, this second group of sheep had marked PrP<sup>d</sup>-associated proliferative and microfolding membrane changes in astrocytes. These changes are morphologically distinct from classical reactive astrocytosis. Thus, when the light microscopy strain typing approaches and the electron microscopy changes are considered together, the same groupings are present and show that interanimal differences in PrP<sup>d</sup>-related pathological changes differ only in magnitude and not in nature. Nevertheless, these magnitude changes segregate according to the strain of infection.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study informs on the <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular and subcellular location of PrP<sup>d</sup> and its relationships to subcellular morphological changes. From these observations, we can infer the sites of conversion of PrP<sup>c</sup> to PrP<sup>d</sup> and the inter and intracellular trafficking of PrP<sup>d</sup> in two strains of sheep scrapie.</p><sec><title>PrP<sup>c</sup> to PrP<sup>d</sup> conversion occurs at the cell membrane</title><p>In agreement with conventional murine scrapie models that show lysosomal, cell membrane and extracellular PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), this study shows that PrP<sup>d</sup> of scrapie-affected sheep is also associated with endosomes, lysosomes and plasma membranes of neurons and glia. In previous studies of sheep scrapie and experimental ovine BSE, we have shown that intracellular PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulations are N-terminally truncated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), but all other neuropil types of PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulations are full length. When compared with these data, the present results suggest that PrP<sup>d</sup> first accumulates at the cell surface of neurons and dendrites from where it is either released or internalized and then digested. <italic>In vitro</italic> pulse-chase experiments first suggested that the transformation of normal to abnormal PrP probably takes place at the cell surface or at some later stage in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Our results therefore agree with this data insofar as the first site of the cell cycle at which inferred full-length PrP<sup>d</sup> is visualized is at the cell membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>PrP<sup>d</sup> is internalized by an abnormal classical endocytotic mechanism</title><p>Consistent with other glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, some studies suggest that PrP<sup>c</sup> is internalized by one of the noncoated pit mechanisms for raft-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), but others show that PrP<sup>c</sup> is internalized from N2a cells via coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). In N2a cells, PrP<sup>c</sup> resides within the lipid-rich fragments of the membrane but leaves these regions to be endocytosed within nonraft regions by a clathrin-coated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). As GPI-anchored proteins do not have a transmembrane domain, they cannot directly interact with clathrin-associated proteins to elicit endocytotic vesicle formation; basic residues within the N terminus of PrP<sup>c</sup> are necessary to link between it and other membrane ligands that possess cytoplasmic domains recognized by clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). The present study suggests that PrP<sup>d</sup> on neuronal cell membranes is also internalized via a coated-pit mechanism.</p><p>The bizarre tubules connecting coated pits to the cell surface suggest that the excision of the PrP<sup>d</sup>-containing coated pits from the plasma membrane of scrapie-infected neurons occurs inefficiently. We hypothesized that PrP<sup>d</sup> might interfere with the excision of pits from the cell surface and attempted to identify potential molecular defects using antibodies directed at proteins involved in vesicle excision, but we were unable to find any consistent changes in the abundance of amphiphysin, dynamin or clathrin (data not shown). We therefore propose that PrP<sup>d</sup> alters endocytosis by interfering with one of the vesicle excision proteins, which then elicits excess ubiquitin amplification prior to endosomal degradation of such complexes. Similar features are found in the scrapie-infected TG3 PrP<sup>0/0</sup> mouse, which generates PrP<sup>d</sup> from astrocytes and lack neuronal PrP<sup>c</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). This suggests that astrocyte-derived PrP<sup>d</sup> can be transferred to neuronal membranes and drive abnormalities of endocytosis of abnormal PrP<sup>d</sup>. Abnormal endocytosis may therefore be an acquired toxic change of PrP<sup>d</sup> and may not require any alteration in cytoplasmic expression of proteins associated with clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In the present study, astrocytes of scrapie-infected sheep showed PrP<sup>d</sup> internalization by normal coated pits. We have also shown, in lymphoid tissues of the same sheep described here, that abnormal endocytotic mechanisms are present in macrophages internalizing PrP<sup>d</sup>. However, the macrophages internalize the PrP<sup>d</sup> via a noncoated (probably caveolin) mediated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that membrane processing of PrP<sup>d</sup> is independent of PrP<sup>c</sup> expression and is influenced by cell type.</p><p>Scrapie-associated alterations of the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteosomal system are reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>), with one study proposing that neurodegeneration may be caused by abnormally trafficked PrP<sup>c</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). In these scrapie-infected sheep, PrP<sup>d</sup> and ubiquitin were present together at the cell surface, in abnormal coated pits, in fused subplasmalemmal tubular networks and in a proportion of lysosomes but not in association with the endoplasmic reticulum or the cytosol adjacent to Nissl or Golgi bodies, suggesting that ubiquitin-associated trafficking of PrP<sup>d</sup> does not involve the proteosome. Rather, these results suggest that PrP<sup>c</sup> conversion or PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation signals to a cytosolic protein that can instigate the clathrin endocytotic process, either directly&#x02014;as a consequence of an abnormal location within the membrane&#x02014;or more probably by complexing with another ligand as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). This protein complex is not recycled but directed to the endosomal system for degradation by ubiquitin signaling, which appears to increase cellular catabolic activity as shown by increased lysosomes. Astrocyte membrane-associated PrP<sup>d</sup> was not detectably endocytosed with ubiquitin. Thus, mechanisms by which astrocytes and neurons deal with cell membrane-associated PrP<sup>d</sup> are different.</p></sec><sec><title>Intercellular transfer of PrP<sup>d</sup></title><p>Scrapie-infected cells <italic>in vitro</italic> demonstrate release of PrP<sup>d</sup> and/or infectivity into the culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), and we have previously shown that PrP<sup>d</sup> may also be released from the surface of scrapie-infected mouse neurons and dendrites <italic>in vivo</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Exosomes are 50&#x02013;90-nm-diameter vesicles of endosomal origins that are released into the extracellular environment and can transfer PrP<sup>c</sup> from neuroblastoma cells to PrP null cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). We were not able to identify exosome-like structures in routine preparations in this or in previous rodent studies. To eliminate the possibility that small numbers of exosomes might by chance escape detection in two-dimensional membrane representations seen at electron microscopy, we performed serial reconstructions of putative PrP<sup>d</sup>-containing membrane fragments but failed to detect any exosomes (data not shown).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that GPI-anchored proteins, including PrP, may be transferred between membranes, sometimes as a complex of molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Our observations suggest that a fraction of PrP<sup>d</sup> that reaches the cell membrane is then transferred to other membranes of adjacent processes. This transfer is indiscriminate and independent of cell type and also occurs in the lymphoid tissues of these sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). As the TG3 PrP<sup>0/0</sup> mouse also demonstrates PrP<sup>d</sup>-associated pathology on PrP null neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), we can also infer that the transfer of PrP<sup>d</sup> between cells is independent of PrP<sup>c</sup> expression. Because both ubiquitin and PrP<sup>d</sup> are seen on membranes adjacent to a scrapie-infected PrP<sup>d</sup>-releasing cell, we surmise that PrP<sup>d</sup> is moved between membranes as a multimeric protein complex.</p></sec><sec><title>PrP<sup>d</sup> largely accumulates on dendritic rather than axonal membranes</title><p>Most brain PrP<sup>c</sup> appears to be located in the neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), and previous light microscopic studies have sought to relate the diffuse neuropil accumulation of PrP<sup>d</sup> to synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Some studies have suggested a preferential synaptic membrane concentration of PrP<sup>c</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>), but others show generalized localization on plasmalemmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In these latter studies, PrP<sup>c</sup> was found to follow standard biosynthetic pathways for GPI-anchored proteins, with PrP<sup>c</sup> expressed in Golgi bodies and recycled through late endosomes after reaching the cell membrane.</p><p>At the cell surface, the GPI anchor and N-terminal domains direct PrP<sup>c</sup> to detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). However, when the DRM lipid content is experimentally altered, PrP<sup>c</sup> is redistributed from axons to dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). In the present study, as in previous studies of murine scrapie, we show that PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulations in sheep are primarily related not to axons or to synapses but to dendrites. The observed preference for PrP<sup>d</sup> accumulation and release from dendrites may therefore be related to altered trafficking of the abnormal protein within the membrane or to an altered distribution of PrP<sup>c</sup> and PrP<sup>d</sup> following changes in the raft domains of axonal and dendritic membranes.</p></sec><sec><title>Scrapie strains or sources differ in the proportion of functional PrP<sup>d</sup> conformers</title><p>When the 10 scrapie-infected sheep investigated in the present study were segregated according to strain or by their electron microscopy cytopathology features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), they segregate into the same two groups. The results therefore suggest that there are strain-directed cytopathological effects of scrapie infection. However, the differences in cytopathological changes observed between the two strain groups were not qualitative but quantitative; that is, the same PrP<sup>d</sup>-associated ultrastructural pathology was recognized for the two strains but in different proportions. This is in agreement with previous light microscopic immunohistochemical observations, suggesting that different strains may target some cell populations rather than others, giving rise to, for example, a more prominent neuron-associated rather than glia-associated morphological pattern of PrP<sup>d</sup> deposition, and that infection with different strains may lead to a different processing of PrP<sup>d</sup>, which is translated into, for example, more abundant intracellular rather than cell membrane aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>Different cell types, such as neurons, glial cells and follicular dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), can exhibit different cytopathological changes when infected with the same strain of TSE agent; this is most likely caused by biological differences between these cell types. However, diversity of ultrastructural morphological changes can also be found when a single strain of TSE agent infects a particular cell type. Thus, a neuron can internalize cell membrane PrP<sup>d</sup> via abnormal coated pits, show PrP<sup>d</sup>-associated plasma membrane microfolds and can release membrane PrP<sup>d</sup> to the extracellular space or transfer it to the membranes of adjacent cells. These different processing mechanisms result in the diversity of ultrastructural changes described, and the fact that these vary quantitatively, not qualitatively, in infections by different strains can be interpreted as follows: PrP<sup>d</sup> originating from infection with one particular strain interacts mainly with one cell membrane protein resulting in a main processing pathway and pathological change, and less so with other cell membrane proteins, resulting in different, secondary trafficking pathways and less pronounced cytopathology features. In this scenario, PrP<sup>d</sup> produced following infections by different strains would have distinct relative affinities for different cell membrane proteins, resulting in diverse proportions of processing mechanisms and pathological changes. It is conceivable that for this to happen, PrP<sup>d</sup> from a single strain would consist of several tertiary or quaternary isoforms, each of which would interact with a different cell membrane protein; different proportions of those isoforms in different TSE strains would result in relatively diverse trafficking mechanisms and different proportions of essentially the same cytopathological changes, as observed. Either through interaction with other cell membrane proteins or on its own, this notion of TSE strains being composed of several PrP<sup>d</sup> isoforms in varying proportions&#x02014;rather than consisting solely of single isoforms&#x02014;appears to fit better with the consistency of pathological changes observed for particular strains. If prion strains generated only single isoforms, the diversity of processing mechanisms and the different resulting cytopathological changes would be best explained as random events that would not lead to consistent pathological phenotypes for different strains.</p><p>The scrapie-infected TG3 PrP<sup>0/0</sup> mouse shows the same PrP<sup>d</sup>-associated neuronal coated pit and membrane changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) as found in sheep. Despite the astrocytic origin of infection in this transgenic model, these mice did not show the same level of astrocytic plasma membrane proliferation of the sheep. This indicates that the responses of both astrocytes and neurons are also directed by specific properties of PrP<sup>d</sup> and not simply by the presence of infectivity in different cell types. It further suggests that it is the nature of the PrP<sup>d</sup> isoforms that dictates the abnormal cytopathology and inferred trafficking and not the converse. In general, rodent scrapie infections release more PrP<sup>d</sup> to the extracellular space and internalize less than sheep sources; nevertheless, the nature of the tissue changes and sites of PrP<sup>d</sup> localization are similar for rodent and sheep scrapie strains. We therefore suggest that every TSE or prion infection produces a range of PrP<sup>d</sup> isoforms, each of which produces different cytopathological effects. The relationship between different forms of PrP<sup>d</sup> and infectivity, and the significance of certain prion disease-specific, PrP-negative cytological changes such as tubulovesicular structures have yet to be established.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Jim Hope for critical reading of the manuscript and to Janey Witz for morphometric studies of lysosomes.
