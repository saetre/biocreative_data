Autoantibody associations with both HLA DR3 and DR15 have been previously defined. There was an epistatic interaction (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.023) between RCA&#x003b1; AH1 and HLA DR3, and this genotypic combination was present in 48% of autoantibody-positive patients with pSS compared with 8% of controls. This epistasis is most simply attributable to an interaction between C4 and its receptor, CR1, encoded within the RCA&#x003b1; block. Both DR3 and a relative C4 deficiency are carried on the major histocompatibility complex 8.1 ancestral haplotype. Only four of 92 (4%) autoantibody-positive patients with pSS did not carry any risk RCA&#x003b1; or HLA haplotype, compared with 36 of 96 (38%) controls, and there were differences in haplotype frequencies within autoantibody subsets of pSS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Normal population variation in the RCA&#x003b1; block, in addition to the major histocompatibility complex, contributes genetic susceptibility to systemic autoimmune disease and the autoantibody response.

Seropositive Ro+La patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were further subdivided into non-precipitating La, ie, Ro+La (ppt&#x02013;), or precipitating, ie, Ro+La (ppt+), on the basis of a precipitin line formed by anti-La antibodies on CIEP. Therefore, in addition to a seronegative subset, seropositive patients with pSS were classified into one of three serological subsets: anti-Ro alone (19 of 115&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16%), anti-Ro+La(ppt&#x02212;) (22 of 115&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;19%) and anti-Ro+La(ppt+) (55 of 115&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;46%). These subgroups are characterised by increasing titre and a more polyclonal autoantibody response in addition to higher rheumatoid factor and IgG levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref></p><p>We, and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> have previously demonstrated that HLA-DR3 and DR15 frequencies differ between autoantibody subsets, and this question is also of interest in relation to the RCA&#x003b1; haplotypes.

There were 115 patients with pSS in the study: 19 were seronegative, 19 with anti-Ro only, 22 with anti-Ro+La (ppt&#x02212;) and 55 with anti-Ro+La (ppt+). The increased prevalence of HLA DR3 in autoantibody-positive pSS is largely B8-DR3 (the prevalence of B8-DR3 in the controls is not known) and there are genetic differences between the pSS autoantibody subgroups. </title></caption><graphic xlink:href="ARD-67-06-0849-f03"/></fig><p>The increased prevalence of HLA DR3 in autoantibody-positive pSS is largely B8-DR3, which is carried on the 8.1 ancestral haplotype. B8-DR3 is most strongly associated with the polyclonal Ro+La (ppt+) autoantibody response, whereas, as previously reported,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> DR15 is almost exclusively associated with the restricted Ro+La (ppt&#x02212;) response. The RCA&#x003b1; AH1 prevalence, although elevated, is relatively constant in autoantibody-positive patients. The basis for the epistatic interaction between RCA&#x003b1; AH1 and DR3 is most likely restricted to the 8.1 ancestral haplotype, rather than other DR3 containing haplotypes, and may exert a primary influence on the autoantibody response in pSS. Interestingly, 8.1 ancestral haplotype only one, rather than two or more C4 genes and is therefore associated with a relative C4 deficiency.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> However, there are clearly other genes on the MHC 8.1 haplotype that contribute additionally to regulation of the autoantibody response. The RCA&#x003b1; AH3 haplotype has the highest prevalence in patients with anti-La and may therefore potentiate diversification of the autoantibody response.</p><p>The genes for C2 are also in the extended MHC region and type 1 C2 deficiency is encoded within the 18.1 haplotype, which carries B18-DR15. There was no evidence of any epistatic interaction between RCA&#x003b1; block haplotypes and DR15. Further, only four B18-DR15 (from a total of 52 DR15) haplotypes were observed in patients with pSS and, as expected, there were no associations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The GMT haplotyping approach has been used in this study to identify AH of the RCA&#x003b1; block and their associations with pSS, a systemic autoimmune disease. Duplication and copy number variation reveal more genetic diversity than single nucleotide polymorphisms,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> yet for most haplotyping assays, interpreting the results and defining haplotypes in these regions is difficult. The GMT assay is useful in interrogating complex genomic regions, such as the MHC and RCA blocks, as it requires and utilises these features to efficiently define the genomic polymorphism and AH within the region. The GMT RCA&#x003b1; block haplotyping has revealed extensive haplotypic polymorphism in this region (which also includes CR1-L, MCP and MCP-L genes), with more than 20 AH defined,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> although the majority are rare.</p><p>In this study we report that relatively frequent RCA&#x003b1; block haplotypes, AH1 and AH3, are associated with pSS, an autoimmune disease with a high prevalence of antinuclear Ro/La autoantibodies, and which shares both clinical and genetic susceptibility overlap with SLE.</p><p>The RCA&#x003b1; block contains CR1, CR1-L, MCP and MCP-L genes, and possibly also CR2, although the boundaries of the block have not been precisely defined. Erythrocyte CR1 in humans provides an important mechanism for the non-inflammatory clearance of immune complexes opsonised with C3a and C4b, and genetic variation in CR1 expression and/or function may influence both the predisposition to autoantibody-mediated disease (the clearance hypotheses)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and self-perpetuating autoimmune reactivity resulting from prolonged, immune complex-mediated, type I interferon production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> Although an acquired loss of erythrocyte CR1 expression has been observed in diseases such as SLE and pSS, the phenotypic high/low CR1 expression polymorphism is not associated with SLE,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> although the genetic basis for this is not well defined. CR1 expression is downregulated by immune complexes and upregulated by interferon &#x003b3; in SLE,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and in the mouse, CR1/CR2 expression (encoded by the same gene) is upregulated by BAFF.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> Therefore, genetic differences in the compound regulation of CR1 expression are likely to be strongly influenced by the complex inflammatory disease milieu.</p><p>In addition to clearance of immune complexes, CR1 and CR2 play a direct, instructive role in setting the threshold for B cell responses to antigen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and potentially, the loss of B cell tolerance,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> a fundamental step in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. Further, cross-linking of MCP (CD46) with the TCR on na&#x000ef;ve CD4+ T cells induces regulatory T cells,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> which are critical in the balance between autoimmunity and tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref></p><p>Finally, complement control proteins may function as receptors for ligands other than complement components. The CR2 receptor is of particular interest in this regard, and a recent study has demonstrated an association between a common CR2 single nucleotide polymorphism based haplotype and SLE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. CR2 is not only a functional receptor for interferon &#x003b1;,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> but is also the Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus (EBV) receptor. There has long been a strongly suspected link between EBV infection and systemic autoimmunity. Intriguingly, molecular mimicry between the EBNA-1 epitope of the EBV virus and the Ro autoantigen has been demonstrated in initiation of the anti-Ro response in patients who ultimately developed SLE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref></p><p>Similar to HLA haplotypes, RCA&#x003b1; block haplotypes exert an influence on Ro/La autoantibody responses in patients with pSS. Importantly, there was an epistatic interaction between RCA&#x003b1; AH1 and HLA B8-DR3 in patients with pSS with Ro/La autoantibodies, which is indicative of a biological relationship between gene products of these haplotypes and disease pathways. The most likely basis for this epistasis is an interaction between the CR1 receptor and C4, one of its ligands. The genes for C4 are in the extended MHC region. HLA B8-DR3 and a relative C4 insufficiency (C4A*Q0,C4B*1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> are both part of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype. The genetic structure of the C4 region is itself complex and highly polymorphic with both allelic and copy number variation of C4A and C4B genes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> Genetic variation in C4 is known to contribute to disease susceptibility associated with MHC haplotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, but other MHC genes are also likely to be involved.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> In addition to systemic diseases such as pSS and SLE, the MHC 8.1 haplotype is associated with a number of organ-specific autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto&#x02019;s thyroiditis, Graves&#x02019; disease, myasthenia gravis and multiple sclerosis. Evaluation of RCA&#x003b1;/MHC interactions in these diseases, and their association with susceptibility, autoantibody production and clinical phenotype would clearly be of great interest.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating the utility of the GMT approach for interrogating polymorphism in complex genomic regions, this study has also demonstrated that normal population variation in the RCA&#x003b1; block contributes substantially to susceptibility to systemic autoimmune disease. This is therefore direct evidence of the importance of regulation of complement activation in disease pathogenesis. The differing functional effects of the RCA&#x003b1; block haplotypes have not yet been defined and will be the focus of future research. These are likely to be pleiotropic and may well involve further epistatic genetic interactions. Although the task of unravelling these effects will be highly complex, we predict they will provide important insights into underlying autoimmune disease mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Professor Tom Gordon and Ms Dimi Beroukas from the Department of Allergy, Immunology and Arthritis, Flinders Medical Centre, for CIEP autoantibody screening of patient sera.
