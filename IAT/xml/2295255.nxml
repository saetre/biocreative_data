NOS-2 mRNA levels in the infected mouse brain was greater than in control mice in all brain regions examined, particularly in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus by 1&#x000a0;day p.i. On the contrary, no differences in NOS-1 or NOS-3 mRNA levels were found between infected and control mice. There was also a marked increase in the levels of metabolites of nitric oxide in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for anti-NOS-2 primarily in the hippocampus of infected mice. Further, anti-NOS-2 and GFAP staining was mostly found around capillary blood vessels of the hippocampus starting early in the course of the disease. These results indicate that the NWS enhances the activation of astrocytes and NOS-2 expression which in turn enhances NO production and the expansion of capillary blood vessels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Influenza A/NWS/33 virus</kwd><kwd>BALB/c mouse</kwd><kwd>NO</kwd><kwd>NOS-2</kwd><kwd>Astrocyte</kwd><kwd>Olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd>Hippocampus</kwd><kwd>Brain capillary blood vessels</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza associated encephalopathy (IE) is one of the most severe neurological diseases amongst children, mostly under the age of 5. It is marked by rapid progression and the mortality rate is estimated to range from 27 to 44% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Recently, we reported that production of the biological free radical gas, nitric oxide (NO), in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with IE was increased in the initial stages and correlated with disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Yokota et&#x000a0;al. hypothesized that the influenza virus activates the limbic system followed by glial cell activation which in turn produces NO and inflammatory cytokines which flood the brain and cause a cytokine storm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent in&#x000a0;vitro studies by Imanishi et&#x000a0;al. showed that a mouse lung-adapted strain of influenza virus could induce inducible NO synthase (NOS-2) mRNA expression and NOS-2-mediated NO production in murine macrophage cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, Ino et&#x000a0;al. studied five autopsies cases of IE patients. They reported that four out of the five patients showed degenerated astrocytic spines in the cortex, by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. They suspected that the IE was largely due to these altered glial cells (Ino et&#x000a0;al. unpublished).</p><p>Taken together, it is likely that IE is related to both the influence of NO and glial cells changes. Nevertheless, there have been no reports on a relationship between NOS-2 and glial cells within the brain after infection with the influenza virus. Thus, the aim of these studies is to better understand the clinical state of IE by focusing on NO and astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) after influenza virus infection. By using the A/NWS/33 influenza virus infected BALB/c model mouse, we were able to demonstrate that influenza virus infection leads to an up regulation of NOS-2 and astrocytes, mostly around capillary blood vessels of the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, starting at an early stage of the disease.</p><p>Although IE has been reported for more than a decade, a therapy for IE has not yet been defined. We expect that our results will provide evidence which will aid in the development of a novel IE therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Virus</title><p>Influenza A/NWS virus, which is a mouse brain adapted type of human influenza A/NWS/33 virus was used.

(Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Since bodyweight changes are an indicator of the overall condition of the mice, this bear out that the mice was infected to the virus. More over, we have checked that RT-PCR for A/NWS/33 virus were positive in all brain regions expect medullar oblongata on day 1 p.i. (data not shown).</p><p>The reason why we determined the amounts of influenza virus in this experiment is as followed. During the past experiment, we had experienced that the mice die within 3&#x000a0;days p.i. when inoculating any more than the virus we used this time and when we use fewer viruses, there were hardly any difference in the non-infected and infected behavioral change.</p><p>Our results show that an enhancement NO biosynthesis was induced in the NWS virus infected mouse brain. Over-production of NO was substantiated by determining an increase in the expression of NOS-2 mRNA as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and increased immuno-histochemical staining for anti-NOS-2 as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. At 1&#x000a0;day p.i., the amount of NOS-2 mRNA within the infected mouse brain was greater than that seen in control mice in all brain regions studied. Above all, the olfactory bulb showed the greatest increase. On the basis of these results, we compared NOS-2 mRNA expression in the olfactory bulb on days 1, 3, and 6 p.i., respectively. This showed that the NOS-2 mRNA ratio was greater in the infected mouse brain at all experimental times studied (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). On the contrary, there was no difference in NOS-3 or NOS-1 mRNA levels between infected and control mice (data not shown). These results are important since these three isoforms of NOS, NOS-2 the inducible form of NOS, is capable of producing a continuous flux of NO and a large amount of NO generated by NOS-2 over a sustained period is implicated in the pathogenesis of various disorders and with the response to infectious organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In regards to the immuno-histochemical analysis, positive staining for anti-NOS-2 was mostly detected in the hippocampus of infected mouse brains, whereas hardly any staining was seen in control brains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Furthermore, positive staining had spread to the hippocampus and striatum by 6&#x000a0;days p.i., which correlated with the transition of NO levels.</p><p>NOS-2 has been shown to play a role in the defense against bacteria, parasites and viruses. However, it seems that NO induced by the influenza virus has a dual role. Rimmelzwaan et&#x000a0;al. reported an inhibitory effect of NO on virus growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], whereas Akaike et&#x000a0;al. reported that NO played a pathological role in the influenza virus-induced pneumonia in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The fact that the influenza virus can induce NO has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Yao et&#x000a0;al. reported that the mRNA&#x02019;s of both NOS-2 and NOS increased in the brain after the intranasal infection with influenza A virus of newborn mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Further, Imanishi et&#x000a0;al. pointed out that a mouse lung-adapted strain of influenza virus could induce NOS-2 mRNA expression and NOS-2-mediated NO production in murine macrophage cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Our study has demonstrated that the NWS virus can induce NOS-2 expression in the infected mouse brain, especially in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. These results may relate to the fact that intranasally administered NWS virus can invade the brain through the olfactory pathway as has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recently, Yossi et&#x000a0;al. reported that astrocytes are capable of rapid and massive NOS-2-dependent NO production in brains of normal mice in situ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. According to the report by Ino et&#x000a0;al. on the brain autopsy of patients who had died of IE, four out of five IE patients showed degenerated astrocytic spines in the cortex by GFAP staining. They suspected that the IE was largely due to altered glial cells (Ino et&#x000a0;al. unpublished). Takahashi et&#x000a0;al. also made a statement on the autopsied case of a 2-year-old girl with encephalopathy associated with influenza A virus infection and according to their report; reactive astrocytes were seen in the vicinity of blood vessel in the brain but astrocytosis was not seen anywhere, including the areas where virus antigen-positive neurons were abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additionally, Yokota et&#x000a0;al. hypothesized that the influenza virus activates the limbic system followed by the activation of glial cells which produce NO and other inflammatory cytokines which together flood the brain and cause a cytokine storm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Astrocytes are the major glial cell in the CNS and have important physiological properties in terms of CNS homeostasis. Astrocytes also influence the formation and maintenance of the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB). The importance of astrocytes is demonstrated by a study from Bush et&#x000a0;al. According to their report, an astrocyte ablation led to failure of BBB repair and vasogenic edema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. There have been several reports related to glial cells and NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, there has not been a report considering the relationship between influenza virus infection, NOS-2 and astrocytes together. By determining an increase in GFAP staining as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, our results show that astrocytes are activated in the infected mouse brain and especially in hippocampus. Interestingly, we noticed that both the increased NOS-2 and GFAP staining were mostly found around capillary blood vessels of the hippocampus starting at an early stage. Our results suggest that since NOS-2 and astrocytes became activated around capillary blood vessels after viral infection, this may lead to brain capillary blood vessels break down. However, we were unable to determine whether the NOS-2 measured is derived from vascular endothelial cells or macrophages which will be an issue for future experiments.</p><p>Although IE has been mostly reported in Asian countries, influenza infection occurs in epidemics in both the northern and southern hemispheres and is a pandemic disease throughout the year. Recently, influenza virus which is resistant to anti-influenza drugs has been shown to emerge and there is real concern in regards to a new type of influenza pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, no standardized therapy for the treatment of IE has yet been defined. In this paper, we suggest that the influenza virus causes the activation of astrocytes and NOS-2 in the brain. Thus it is likely that our results will add supportive evidence for the development of a novel IE therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the kind donation of influenza A/NWS/33 virus by Prof. Hayashi (Toyama University, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences) and active discussions throughout this study with Prof. J.
