The isolated clone pAU157 contained the cDNA insert of 2.7 kb in length. Sequence analysis of the cDNA insert revealed that the amino acid sequence of cytochrome P-450MC was composed of 523 amino acid residues, including the initial 22 N-terminal amino acids whose sequence was determined with the purified protein. The primary structure was found to contain two highly conserved regions as pointed out from comparisons of the reported amino acid sequences of cytochrome P-450 species. The predicted molecular weight of the apoprotein was 59,300 daltons. Therefore, we concluded that the amino acid sequence determined here is for cytochrome P-450MC, probably corresponding to cytochrome P-450c.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0340.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2929"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0341.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2930"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0342.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2931"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0343.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2932"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0344.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2933"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0345.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2934"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0346.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2935"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0347.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2936"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0348.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2937"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00324-0349.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2938"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
