We found two mRNA species in the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse: approximately 90&#x00025; of the mRNA represents a transcript with an in-frame stop codon within exon 2 of CACNA1F, while approximately 10&#x00025; of the mRNA represents a transcript in which alternative splicing within the ETn element has removed the stop codon. This latter mRNA codes for full length Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein, detectable by Western blot analysis that is predicted to differ from wild type Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein in a region of approximately 22 amino acids in the N-terminal portion of the protein. Electrophysiological analysis with either mouse Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>wt</sup> or Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>nob2</sup> cDNA revealed that the alternatively spliced protein does not differ from wild type with respect to activation and inactivation characteristics; however, while the wild type N-terminus interacted with filamin proteins in a biochemical pull-down experiment, the alternatively spliced N-terminus did not. The <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse electroretinogram displayed reduced b-wave and oscillatory potential amplitudes, and the retina was morphologically disorganized, with substantial reduction in thickness of the outer plexiform layer and sprouting of bipolar cell dendrites ectopically into the outer nuclear layer. Nevertheless, the spatial contrast sensitivity (optokinetic response) of <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mice was generally similar to that of wild type mice. These results suggest the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse is not a <italic>CACNA1F</italic> knockout model. Rather, alternative splicing within the ETn element can lead to full-length Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein, albeit at reduced levels, and the functional Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 mutant may be incapable of interacting with cytoskeletal filamin proteins. These changes, do not alter the ability of the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse to detect and follow moving sine-wave gratings compared to their wild type counterparts.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) leads to excitation-contraction coupling, excitation-transcription coupling, neurotransmitter release, and programmed cell death.

The alternatively spliced protein did not differ from the wild type protein with respect to activation and inactivation characteristics in an expression system; however, unlike the wild type protein N-terminus, the alternatively spliced N-terminus did not bind to cytoskeletal filamin proteins.

We attempted to detect Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channel protein in sections of mouse retina; however our antibody is directed against the C-terminus of the human protein, which shares only &#x0223c;50&#x00025; sequence homology with the mouse protein (rendering the antibody only weakly cross-reactive and therefore unsuitable for immunohistochemistry in mouse). Therefore, it was necessary to use concentrated protein lysates from spleen on Western blots, where Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein appears to be greatly enriched <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-McRory1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. While it is possible no functional Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein is present in the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse retina, the reduced protein levels in the retina may have accounted for the apparent background labeling in previous reports (for example, the faint labeling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002538-g001">Figure 1b</xref> from Chang et al., 2006). Thus, the CSNB2 phenotype in the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse could arise simply from reduced Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein levels, rather than complete knockout of protein. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies, which have shown that R508Q and L1364H mutations of <italic>CACNA1F</italic> linked to CSNB2 reduce the amount of functional protein in the membrane, without significantly altering the biophysical properties of the channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Hoda2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since our findings differ substantially from those reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Chang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, it was necessary to ensure that the <italic>CACNA1F</italic> gene mutation in the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse line that we were testing was the same as that originally described. Therefore, we sequenced genomic DNA, obtained both from our in-house colony and as supplied by the Jackson Laboratory. In both cases the genomic sequence confirmed the presence of the ETn element inserted into exon 2 of the <italic>CACNA1F</italic> gene.

Taken together, these results suggest that the <italic>CACNA1F</italic> gene mutation in the mice we were testing was identical to that in the line originally described, and that the inherited defect in our colony was not the result of a random genetic mutation or a deletion of the ETn element from exon 2.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002538-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse retina is characterized by a functional defect that selectively affects the light-driven activation of neurons in the inner retinal layers; this is supported by the depression of the ERG b-wave (reflecting diminished modulation of activity in depolarizing bipolar cells), while the a-wave amplitudes are unaffected (indicating that photoreceptor activity is relatively unaffected). The partial preservation of the b-wave in these mice is reminiscent of the incomplete form of CSNB (CSNB2 due to <italic>CACNA1F</italic> mutations), in contrast to the complete absence of a recordable b-wave in the complete form of CSNB (CSNB1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Miyake1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Tremblay1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. As previously reported in <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mice, <italic>CACNA1F</italic> mutations in humans cause ERG b-wave reductions under both dark-adapted (scotopic) and light-adapted (photopic) conditions. Another similarity between <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mice and CSNB2 patients is the depression of the OPs under scotopic conditions. Finally, both humans with <italic>CACNA1F</italic> mutations and <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mice have normal photopic and scotopic a-wave amplitudes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Miyake1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Tremblay1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002538-g005">Figure 5</xref>). There is evidence that decreases in b-wave amplitude might lead to increases in a-wave amplitudes. For instance, pharmacological blockade of mGluR6 receptors (with intravitreal injections of L-glutamate or APB) does completely abolish the b-wave (also known as PII) and reveal photoreceptor activity (also known as PIII) over its full time course, and does increase the amplitude of the a-wave/PIII. However, in cases of complete b-wave loss due to nyctalopin mutations, a-wave amplitudes are normal under both scotopic and photopic adaptation. So the outcome, whether b-wave reductions affect a-wave amplitudes, might depend on the mechanism by which the b-wave is abolished or decreased in amplitude. The possibility that the mutated Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channel might lead to reduced a-wave amplitudes, and that these reductions might be compensated by the indirect effect of increased a-wave amplitudes due to reduced b-wave amplitudes, does exist, but we have no experimental evidence to verify whether this is the case.</p><p>Previously, <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mice were found to have a reduced b-wave, and morphological studies of the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> retina showed a reduced OPL thickness and sprouting of second-order neurons into the ONL. Therefore, we expected that the visual performance of <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mice would be greatly reduced or absent, as in <italic>Cacna1f<sup>G305X</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Bonfield1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Quite unexpectedly, our <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mice responded robustly to a full range of sine-wave gratings, showing only slight differences from the optokinetic performance of WT-C57/BL6 mice. The major difference in visual performance of the best-performing <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mice was that their CS functions cut off more sharply than those of <italic>Cacna1f<sup>wt</sup></italic> mice at spatial frequencies &#x02265;0.2 c/d, resulting in an optokinetic acuity of 0.275 c/d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002538-g006">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002538-t002">Table 2</xref>). As a result, the spatial acuity of <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mice is about two-thirds of the acuity of C57BL6 mice, which is 0.4 c/d <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Bonfield1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Thus, our behavioral results show that the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse has good vision (at least for the optokinetic response), despite its severe ERG phenotype and morphologically abnormal outer retina. The relatively good vision of <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mice contrasts starkly with the lack of optokinetic responses in a targeted <italic>CACNA1F</italic> knockout, the G305X mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Bonfield1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> phenotype is not due solely to a truncation or loss-of-function mutation. Since our <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> animals perform nearly as well as wild type controls, it is clear that in spite of the histological and electroretinographic evidence of severe retinal dysfunction, the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse maintains at least some nearly normal visual processing in proximal levels of the retina. Our finding that about 10&#x00025; of whole-retinal <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mRNA is expected to encode a full-length channel protein similar to the wild type (whereas 90&#x00025; carries the in-frame stop codon) raises the question whether every photoreceptor cell makes 10&#x00025; WT-like protein, or 10&#x00025; of photoreceptor cells make 100&#x00025; wild type-like protein (or some combination of these). On the one hand, the loss of synapses in the OPL and the sprouting of dendrites into the ONL point to significant defects in the synthesis of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein, and consequently of transmitter release, in the vast majority of photoreceptor cells; this suggests that nearly all <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> photoreceptor cells are making insufficient amounts of functional channel protein. On the other hand, the retention of normal contrast sensitivity and near-normal optokinetic acuity under photopic conditions indicates that cone pathways are only minimally affected. We suggest, therefore, that the wild type-like transcript is expressed mainly or exclusively in cone photoreceptors, accounting for the relative sparing of cone transmission as seen in the optokinetic response, and that the mutant transcript is expressed mainly or exclusively in rod photoreceptors, accounting for the striking loss of synaptic terminals and consequent thinning in the OPL. The discrepancy, between retention of cone function in the optokinetic response and loss of cone signals in the ERG, may be due to differential processing of cone information or mutation-dependent changes in the retinal circuits responsible for the OKR and ERG. The experiments that would be required to test this hypothesis are beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>While full-length Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein is produced (albeit at presumably reduced levels) in the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse, the encoded amino acid sequence differs from that in the wild type by approximately 20 residues in the N-terminus of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002538-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002538-g006">Figure 6</xref>, the electrophysiological properties of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>nob2</sup> are not significantly different from those of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>wt</sup> when expressed in tsA-201 cells, with either 20 mM Ba<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or 2 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> as charge carrier, suggesting that the differences between <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> and <italic>Cacna1f<sup>wt</sup></italic> mice do not arise from changes in the activation or inactivation characteristics of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels. Interestingly, within the span of amino acids that differ between the mutant and wild type proteins, the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>nob2</sup> channel sequence lacks a putative MAP kinase phosphorylation site that is present in the wild type protein. PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPKK, did not have a differential effect on the biophysical properties of either Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>nob2</sup> or Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>wt</sup>, suggesting that the difference in biophysical properties of these channels is not due to a difference in phosphorylation within these 20 amino acids.</p><p>However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002538-g007">Figure 7</xref>, the mutant and wild type N-terminal regions do differ in that they interact with different proteins, since the N-terminal GST-fusion protein for the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>wt</sup> sequence pulls down filamin protein, whereas the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>nob2</sup> peptide does not. Filamins are a family of cytoskeleton proteins (200&#x02013;300 kDa) that regulate and crosslink filamentous actin.

Additionally, several previous studies have demonstrated that interactions of ion channels with filamin proteins result in enhanced targeting of the ion channels to the plasma membrane accompanied by increased current densities, specifically for Kir2.1 (binds to C-terminus of FLNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Sampson1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>), Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Petrecca1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, and CFTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Cantiello1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Thelin1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of Kv4.2, a proline-rich region of the channel was identified as necessary for the interaction, with only four amino acids (PTPP) required for binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Petrecca1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In our case, the wild type sequence of the 20 amino-acid region unique to the N-terminus of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>wt</sup> contains six proline residues, while that of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>nob2</sup> only contains one; furthermore, at the boundary of this region with the downstream N-terminal sequence, the wild type clone has a PGPP motif (recall PTPP motif for Kv4.2), while the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4<sup>nob2</sup> construct has an NRPP motif. While we did not map the exact residues in this 20 amino acid region necessary for this interaction, these data suggest that the CSNB2-like phenotype of the <italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> mouse may result not only from lower Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4-mediated calcium-current densities, due to the diminished production of full-length protein, but also to a failure of targeting of the mutant protein to the plasma membrane, due to its inability to interact with filamin. Since filamin proteins are present in most cell types, any effects on current densities may be masked in our overexpression (transfected cell) system, but such effects could be profound in the highly regulated environment of photoreceptor cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><p><italic>Cacna1f<sup>nob2</sup></italic> (AXB6/pgnJ, stock #001678) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).

Pipettes (BF-150-86 borosilicate glass, Sutter Instruments, Novato CA) were pulled on a P-87 microelectrode puller (Sutter Instruments) and fire-polished with an MF-830 microforge (Narishige, Japan) to a resistance of 1&#x02013;4 M&#x003a9; when filled with recording solution (in mM: 108 CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 9 EGTA, 9 HEPES pH 7.20 with CsOH).</p><p>Current-voltage relations were obtained by holding cells at &#x02212;100 mV before stepping to various test potentials for 150 ms, typically at a frequency of 0.2 Hz.

Briefly, after overnight dark-adaptation, mice were prepared for bilateral recordings under dim red light. While under anesthesia (xylazine 10 mg/kg i.p; ketamine 150 mg/kg i.p.) the mouse body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 38&#x000b0;C using a homeothermic blanket. Both pupils were dilated using 1&#x00025; tropicamide. A drop of methylcellulose, applied on each cornea, prevented dehydration and allowed electrical contact with the recording electrode (gold wire loop). A pair of 25-gauge platinum needles inserted subdermally behind each eye served as reference electrodes. Amplification (1&#x02013;1000 Hz bandpass), stimulus presentation, and data acquisition were provided by the Espion E 2 ERG system (Diagnosys LLC, Lowell, MA). First, scotopic intensity-response functions were determined using single flashes (6500K, 10 &#x000b5;s duration) presented to dark-adapted animals at nineteen increasing intensity steps from &#x02212;5.22 to 2.86 log cds/m<sup>2</sup>. The inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) was increased progressively from 5 sec (at the lowest stimulus intensity) to 2 minutes (at the highest stimulus intensity), so as to minimize rod photopigment bleaching and desensitization. The amplitude of the b-wave was measured from the a-wave negative peak to the b-wave positive apex, and not to the peak of oscillatory potentials (OPs), which can exceed the b-wave apex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002538-Nusinowitz1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. After 10 min photopic adaptation (30 cd/m<sup>2</sup> background), cone-driven intensity-response functions were obtained, using single flashes (6500K, 10 &#x000b5;s duration) presented at eleven increasing intensity steps from &#x02212;1.63 to 2.86 log cds/m<sup>2</sup>. The time interval between steps was 10 seconds, and each stimulus was presented 6 times at 5 sec intervals. Responses were averaged for the six flashes at each intensity.

We observed head-following responses by means of a digital video camera mounted above the platform in the lid of the chamber. Horizontally drifting sine-wave gratings, drifting to either the left or right, were presented at various spatial frequencies (0.019 cycles/degree (c/d) to 0.3 c/d) and drift velocities (6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 degrees/second (d/s), for most spatial frequencies). Contrast threshold, defined as the lowest contrast at which the animal could follow the moving grating reliably (Michelson contrast: Equation 3, where L<sub>max</sub> and L<sub>min</sub> are the maximum and minimum luminances of the monitors), was determined by a modified staircase procedure and a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm. Contrast sensitivity was defined as the inverse of contrast threshold (100/threshold &#x00025; contrast), and acuity was defined as the highest spatial frequency at which the animal could follow the drifting grating at 100&#x00025; contrast.<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002538.e003.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p><p>Contrast, spatial frequency, and rotation velocity are expressed here as the computer settings. True contrast and luminance at the center of the animal's viewing platform were measured with a Minolta LS-110 Luminance Meter, operating as a spot photometer with a 1 degree acceptance angle. The mean luminance was 55 cd/m<sup>2</sup> for a 1.0 c/d sine-wave grating of maximum contrast moving at 12 d/s, and the mean luminances of &#x0201c;black&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;white&#x0201d; (i.e., the maximum and minimum luminances), determined with a stationary 0.011 c/d grating at 100&#x00025; contrast, were 3.98 cd/m<sup>2</sup> and 104.2 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Thus, the actual Michelson contrast range was 3.8&#x02013;100&#x00025;; contrast thresholds, and the related contrast sensitivities reported in this paper, were not corrected for this small discrepancy from the instrument's contrast settings of 0&#x02013;100&#x00025;. Mean luminance of the gratings varied from 27.5 to 110 cd/m<sup>2</sup> with distance from the monitor screens, as the animal moved freely on the platform.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using either SigmaStat2.03 (SSI, Richmond, CA), or Prism&#x02122; or InStat&#x02122; (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
