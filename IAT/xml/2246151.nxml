Some human cancers exhibit a hypermethylator phenotype, characterized by concurrent DNA methylation-dependent silencing of multiple genes. To determine if a hypermethylation defect occurs in breast cancer, the expression profile and promoter methylation status of methylation-sensitive genes were evaluated among breast cancer cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The relationship between gene expression (assessed by RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR), promoter methylation (assessed by methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite sequencing, and 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine treatment), and the DNA methyltransferase machinery (total DNMT activity and expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b proteins) were examined in 12 breast cancer cell lines. Unsupervised cluster analysis of the expression of 64 methylation-sensitive genes revealed two groups of cell lines that possess distinct methylation signatures: (i) hypermethylator cell lines, and (ii) low-frequency methylator cell lines. The hypermethylator cell lines are characterized by high rates of concurrent methylation of six genes (<italic>CDH1, CEACAM6, CST6, ESR1, LCN2, SCNN1A</italic>), whereas the low-frequency methylator cell lines do not methylate these genes. Hypermethylator cell lines coordinately overexpress total DNMT activity and DNMT3b protein levels compared to normal breast epithelial cells. In contrast, most low-frequency methylator cell lines possess DNMT activity and protein levels that are indistinguishable from normal. Microarray data mining identified a strong cluster of primary breast tumors that express the hypermethylation signature defined by <italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>CEACAM6, CST6, ESR1, LCN2</italic>, and <italic>SCNN1A</italic>. This subset of breast cancers represents 18/88 (20%) tumors in the dataset analyzed, and 100% of these tumors were classified as basal-like, suggesting that the hypermethylator defect cosegregates with poor prognosis breast cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These observations combine to strongly suggest that: (a) a subset of breast cancer cell lines express a hypermethylator phenotype, (b) the hypermethylation defect in these breast cancer cell lines is related to aberrant overexpression of DNMT activity, (c) overexpression of DNMT3b protein significantly contributes to the elevated DNMT activity observed in tumor cells expressing this phenotype, and (d) the six-gene hypermethylator signature characterized in breast cancer cell lines defines a distinct cluster of primary basal-like breast cancers.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Inappropriate gene silencing resulting from aberrant DNA methylation significantly contributes to neoplastic transformation, tumorigenesis, and tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], contributing to some of the hallmarks of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. While abnormal DNA methylation affecting a variety of genes occurs in nearly every type of cancer that has been evaluated, some tumors exhibit aberrant concurrent hypermethylation of numerous genes, a phenomenon known as the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). CIMP was first described in a distinct subset of human colorectal carcinomas that displayed high rates of concordant methylation of specific genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Subsequently, CIMP has been described in other human neoplasms, including tumors of the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], esophagus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], as well as neuroblastomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and leukemias and lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. While tissue type is important in determining which genes are targeted for methylation in a given neoplasm, CIMP-positive tumors in each of these tissue types exhibit gene silencing that is due to cancer-specific (rather than age-specific) hypermethylation of epigenetically-regulated genes. Definitive evidence for a hypermethylation defect (similar to CIMP) among human breast cancers has not emerged, and some investigators have suggested that such a hypermethylator phenotype does not occur in breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless numerous epigenetically-regulated genes are known to be directly silenced by DNA methylation in breast cancer including cell cycle control genes (<italic>APC, RASSF1, RB, TFAP2A</italic>), steroid receptor genes (<italic>ESR1, PGR, RAR&#x003b1;</italic>), tumor suppressor genes (<italic>BRCA1, CDKN2A, CST6</italic>), and metastasis-associated genes (<italic>CDH1, CEACAM6, PCDHGB6</italic>), among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, we analyzed 12 breast cancer cell lines for differential expression of 64 methylation-sensitive genes, to determine if subsets of breast cancer cell lines methylate genes at disparate frequencies, and subsequently confirmed that lack of gene expression was attributable to methylation-dependent silencing. Unsupervised cluster analysis of gene expression patterns reveals two distinct groups of breast cancer cell lines that possess different methylation signatures: (i) hypermethylator cell lines, and (ii) low-frequency methylator cell lines. The hypermethylator cell lines are characterized by high rates of concurrent methylation of six genes (<italic>CDH1, CEACAM6, CST6, ESR1, LCN2</italic>, and <italic>SCNN1A</italic>), whereas the low-frequency methylator cell lines typically lack methylation of these genes. Analysis of the enzymes responsible for human DNA methylation reveals aberrant DNMT3b protein expression and elevated total DNA methyltransferase activity in hypermethylator cell lines. These observations combine to suggest the existence of a distinct subset of human breast cancer cell lines that possess novel biological properties related to dysregulation of the methylation machinery resulting in the acquisition of a hypermethylator phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Analysis of Epigenetically-regulated Genes Reveals Two Distinct Expression</title><sec><title>Patterns Among Breast Cancer Cell Lines</title><p>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a panel of 64 methylation-sensitive genes in each of 12 breast cancer cell lines (BT20, BT549, Hs578T, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-415, MDA-MB-435S, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, SKBR3, and ZR-75-1), as well as the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF12A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Epigenetically-regulated genes that are predictive of CIMP in other tumor systems, as well as genes known to be aberrantly methylated in breast cancer, were selected for expression analysis (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Levels of expression for each gene in each breast cancer cell line were scored relative to the levels of expression in MCF12A cells: undetected (no expression), low (detectable, but &#x0003c;MCF12A), normal (equivalent to MCF12A), or high (&#x0003e;MCF12A). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a subset of epigenetically-regulated genes (n = 6) to confirm the RT-PCR expression results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation (R = 0.76, p &#x0003c; 0.0001) between the quantitative real-time PCR and RT-PCR results. Gene expression results from the 12 breast cancer cell lines as well as those of MCF12A cells were subjected to an unsupervised cluster analysis, which revealed two distinct groups of six cell lines that differ in their expression of methylation-sensitive genes: cluster I is composed of cell lines (MDA-MB-436, BT549, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-435S, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-231) that express a putative hypermethylator phenotype, and cluster II consists of cell lines (ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-468, SKBR3, BT20, MDA-MB-415, and MCF7) that express a putative low-frequency methylator phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The separation of these two groups is driven predominately by the differential expression of six methylation-sensitive genes (<italic>CDH1, CEACAM6, CST6, ESR1, LCN2</italic>, and <italic>SCNN1A</italic>), which are largely unexpressed by the cell lines in cluster I (putative hypermethylator group), and typically expressed by the cell lines in cluster II (putative low-frequency methylator group).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression analysis of methylation-sensitive genes in human breast cancer cell lines</bold>.

Genes</title><p>To confirm that lack of gene expression of known methylation-sensitive genes among this panel of breast cancer cell lines reflects true methylation-dependent epigenetic silencing, a number of methods were employed to assess gene promoter methylation: (i) methylation-specific PCR (MSP), (ii) bisulfite sequencing, and (iii) response to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza) treatment. MSP analysis of the six genes (<italic>CDH1, CEACAM6, CST6, ESR1, LCN2</italic>, and <italic>SCNN1A</italic>) that are differentially expressed between hypermethylator and low-frequency methylator cell lines revealed differences in the methylation status of specific CpGs within regulatory regions of each gene's promoter, in accordance with a given cell line's methylator status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The relationship between gene promoter methylation (as assessed by MSP) and loss of gene expression is strong across all hypermethylator cell lines for the genes examined. For example, the hypermethylator cell lines express <italic>SCNN1A </italic>at undetectable or diminished levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), and MSP analysis of this gene revealed that 5/6 (83%) of these cell lines produce only a methylated MSP product, while MSP analysis of <italic>SCNN1A </italic>in MDA-MB-231 cells produced unmethylated and methylated products. Conversely, all of the low-frequency methylator cell lines (of which 5/6, 83% express <italic>SCNN1A </italic>at normal levels) produced an unmethylated <italic>SCNN1A </italic>MSP product, and only two of these cell lines (BT20 and MDA-MB-468) produced a detectable methylated MSP product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Methylated MSP products were detected for at least 50% (3/6) of the genes examined in each of the hypermethylator cell lines. MDA-MB-436 cells produced methylated MSP products for three of the genes analyzed, while BT549 and MDA-MB-435S cell lines displayed methylated MSP products for each of the six genes evaluated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast, unmethylated MSP products were detected for at least 83% (5/6) of the genes examined in each of the low-frequency methylator cell lines, with MDA-MB-415 cells exhibiting unmethylated products for each of the genes examined.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Methylation analysis of <italic>CST6, LCN2, SCNN1A, CDH1, CEACAM6</italic>, and <italic>ESR1 </italic>among putative hypermethylator and low-frequency methylator cell lines</bold>.

Furthermore, BT549, MDA-MB-453S, and Hs578T cells do not express any of the indicator genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

The average DNMT activity level for the hypermethylator cell lines (2.9 &#x000b1; 0.6) is greater than that of the low-frequency methylator cell lines (1.4 &#x000b1; 0.5), but the difference does not reach significance (p = 0.095, NS). This is due to the level of DNMT activity in ZR-75-1 cells (3.8 &#x000b1; 0.2), which is much higher than MCF12A cells, making it unlike the other five cell lines in the low-frequency methylator group. When ZR-75-1 cells are excluded, the collective DNMT activity level of the low-frequency methylator group becomes indistinguishable from that of MCF12A cells and significance emerges between the total DNMT activity levels of the hypermethylator and low-frequency methylator groups (p = 0.027).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of DNA methyltransferase enzymes among putative hypermethylator and low-frequency methylator cell lines</bold>.

The average DNMT1 protein level for the hypermethylator cell lines (0.8 &#x000b1; 0.15) and the low-frequency methylator cell lines (0.88 &#x000b1; 0.29) are indistinguishable from those of MCF12A cells (p = 0.82, NS, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). MDA-MB-415 cells overexpress DNMT1 (2.3-fold compared to MCF12A), but the other cell lines exhibit a DNMT1 protein level of 1.3-fold or lower regardless of their methylation status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Likewise, the average DNMT3a protein level for the hypermethylator cell lines (1.24 &#x000b1; 0.17) and the low-frequency methylator cell lines (1.39 &#x000b1; 0.2) are indistinguishable from that of MCF12A cells (p = 0.59, NS, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In contrast to DNMT1 and DNMT3a, the average DNMT3b protein levels for the hypermethylator cell lines are higher (2.5 &#x000b1; 0.67) than those of the low-frequency methylator cell lines (1.5 &#x000b1; 0.64, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), but this difference was not statistically significant. Among the hypermethylator cell lines, 5/6 (83%) express &#x02265; 1.7-fold MCF12A levels of DNMT3b protein. In contrast, among the low-frequency methylator cell lines, only ZR-75-1 cells (which also displays high DNMT activity) exhibit an elevated level of DNMT3b protein level expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). While ZR-75-1 cells display a similar methylation defect to the hypermethylator cells (elevated DNMT3b protein and total DNMT activity), they fail to silence the same methylation-sensitive genes that are methylated in the hypermethylator phenotype cell lines. Thus, ZR-75-1 is more similar to the low-frequency methylator cell lines with respect to gene expression and methylation of the six indicator genes. When the cell line ZR-75-1 is excluded from the low-frequency methylator group, the average DNMT3b protein level for the low-frequency methylator cells is 0.91-fold that of MCF12A cells, approaching significance when compared to the hypermethylator cell lines (p = 0.069).</p><p>A correlation analysis was performed to identify significant relationships between DNMT protein levels and DNMT activity among the hypermethylator and low-frequency methylator cell lines. No significant association was found between DNMT activity and DNMT1 or DNMT3a protein levels (R&#x0003c;0.3, NS). However, a strong association (R = 0.79, p = 0.0007) between DNMT activity and DNMT3b protein levels was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Statistically significant correlation coefficients were determined for the relationship between DNMT3b protein and DNMT activity for both hypermethylator cell lines (0.71, p = 0.0036), and the low-frequency methylator cell lines (R = 0.90, p = 0.0028). This observation suggests that DNMT3b significantly contributes to total DNMT activity among breast cancer cell lines. Consistent with this suggestion, in cell lines with DNMT activity &#x02265; 1.8-fold higher than MCF12A cells (n = 7), 86% (6/7) exhibit elevated (&#x02265; 1.7-fold higher than MCF12A) DNMT3b levels. With the exception of ZR-75-1 cells, all of these cell lines belong to the hypermethylator group (MDA-MB-436, BT549, MDA-MB-453, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-231). Significant associations were recognized between DNMT activity and the additive values of (i) DNMT1 and DNMT3b (R = 0.74, p = 0.002), (ii) DNMT3a and DNMT3b (R = 0.74, p = 0.002), and (iii) DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b (R = 0.70, p = 0.004). However, these relationships primarily reflect the contribution of DNMT3b to DNMT activity rather than a true additive effect of the various DNMT enzymes.

Unsupervised cluster analysis of these data identified four strong clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Eighty-eight of 92 primary breast tumors clustered in this analysis, while four tumors did not cluster and were excluded from further analysis. The 88 breast cancers that clustered in this analysis reflect the following molecular classification: 34/88 (39%) luminal A, 23/88 (26%) basal-like, 16/88 (18%) luminal B, 13/88 (15%) Her2+, and 2/88 (2%) normal-like. Of the four major clusters (designated A-D), Cluster D is composed of 18 tumors that express a hypermethylation signature, characterized by lack of or low expression of the six genes analyzed. Strikingly, 100% (18/18) of these putative hypermethylator tumors are of the basal-like subtype, and this cluster contains 75% (18/24) of basal-like tumors in the dataset.

The results of the present study suggest that a subset of human breast cancer cell lines express a hypermethylator phenotype that is characterized by concurrent methylation-dependent silencing of a number of genes, including a specific set of genes with excellent predictive power (<italic>CDH1, CEACAM6, CST6, ESR1, LCN2</italic>, and <italic>SCNN1A</italic>) that are involved in a wide range of neoplastic processes. <italic>CEACAM6 </italic>is a tumor-related gene that is involved in adhesion, migration, invasion, metastasis, apoptosis, and chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], although the implications of its loss in breast cancers is not well understood. Cystatin M (<italic>CST6</italic>) is a recognized breast cancer tumor suppressor gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] that was recently reported to be silenced due to promoter hypermethylation in numerous breast cancer cell lines, as well as primary breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. E-cadherin (<italic>CDH1</italic>) is a well-known suppressor of invasion/metastasis that functions in the maintenance of cell-cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. <italic>CDH1 </italic>and <italic>ESR1 </italic>are frequently concurrently methylated in breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], a relationship also discernible in the present study. The nuclear hormone receptor <italic>ESR1</italic>, which is silenced by methylation in the majority of estrogen-negative breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], may be the foremost important methylation-sensitive gene in breast carcinogenesis, holding important implications for sensitivity to hormone therapy and clinical outcome. Much less well understood is the role of ion transport gene <italic>SCNN1A </italic>in breast carcinogenesis, although its epigenetic regulation in MCF7 cells has previously been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. <italic>LCN2 </italic>is involved in invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and its expression has been linked to poor prognosis in ER/PR-negative breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, methylation-sensitive genes function in various aspects of the normal biology of the breast epithelium. Therefore, concurrent methylation-dependent silencing of multiple genes in neoplastic breast epithelium (as observed in hypermethylator cell lines) is likely to significantly contribute to tumor biology and behavior.</p><p>A previous study that examined methylation patterns of primary breast tumors in search of a hypermethylator phenotype found frequent but essentially equally distributed methylation events at 12 genes among different histologic subsets of neoplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These authors concluded that a CpG island methylator phenotype does not occur in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The difference in conclusions about the existence of a hypermethylator phenotype in breast cancer between the current study and the earlier report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] is likely attributable to the number and choice of genes examined in the two studies, as well as the analysis of primary breast tumors versus established cancer cell lines. The previous study did not examine many of the genes that we found to be highly predictive of a hypermethylator phenotype (<italic>CEACAM6, CST6, LCN2</italic>, and <italic>SCNN1A</italic>), but did include several genes (including <italic>GSTP1, RAR&#x003b2;, RB</italic>, and others) which were less useful for predicting the hypermethylator phenotype. Thus, our results are consistent with the previous findings: when the genes are analyzed by Bae et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], no distinct hypermethylator phenotype is detectible. It is only through a survey of numerous methylation-sensitive genes that evidence for a hypermethylator phenotype emerges. Additionally, we examined not only genes with conventionally defined CpG islands, but also those with atypical CpG features (such as <italic>CEACAM6</italic>), which have only recently been reported as epigenetically-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, we use the term "hypermethylator phenotype" rather than "CpG island methylator phenotype" to describe the hypermethylation defect in breast cancer cell lines, since the targets of aberrant methylation are not restricted to genes with large CpG islands.</p><p>The results of the current study suggest that the mechanism that accounts for the hypermethylator phenotype in human breast cancer cell lines is elevated DNMT activity secondary to overexpression of DNMT3b. DNMT3b protein is significantly elevated in hypermethylator cell lines, and these cells exhibit aberrantly increased DNMT activity and correspondingly high rates of methylation-dependent gene silencing compared to both low-frequency methylator cells and non-neoplastic counterparts. These results are in agreement with those of other recent studies, in which aberrant DNMT3b overexpression was implicated in the methylation abnormalities of breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Tumor cells exhibiting DNMT3b overexpression are likely to exhibit methylation-based aberrant gene expression; one study showed that breast tumors that overexpress DNMT3b are more likely to be <italic>ESR1</italic>-negative, display increased proliferation, and be associated with poor patient prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, it seems reasonable to expect that aberrant expression of DNMT3b protein may produce significant differences in tumor biology for breast tumors of the hypermethylator phenotype. In addition to the six hypermethylator cell lines which had elevated DNMT3b protein and total DNMT activity, one low-frequency methylator cell line (ZR-75-1) exhibited a similar hypermethylation defect. However ZR-75-1 cells retain expression of a number of epigenetically-regulated genes, making it functionally similar to other low-frequency methylator cell lines. A number of explanations may account for this apparent discrepancy: ZR-75-1 cells may methylate other epigenetically-regulated genes which were not surveyed in the present study; alternatively ZR-75-1 cells may possess the same functional defect in the DNMT machinery as cells of the hypermethylator phenotype but express additional repressor proteins which block the methylation capacity of the overabundant DNMT3b protein. Additional studies will be required to resolve these possibilities. The detection of a hypermethylator phenotype in breast cancer cell lines constitutes a first step towards determining if a hypermethylation defect can be identified in primary breast neoplasms in vivo. If a subset of primary breast cancers express a hypermethylator phenotype, we would predict these tumors to differentially express other important characteristics related to tumor biology/behavior and patient outcome. This is the case in colorectal cancer, where CIMP status is associated with various clinical features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Likewise, CIMP-positive neuroblastomas, esophageal tumors, and leukemias tend to have poorer prognosis and are associated with significantly higher relapse and mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Our findings suggest that breast cancer cell lines that express the hypermethylation defect correspond to estrogen-receptor negative tumors, suggesting that the hypermethylator phenotype cosegregates with a subset of breast cancers (ER-negative) that tend to have poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. A number of molecular subtypes of breast cancer have been described (including luminal A, luminal B, HER2+ and basal-like), and these different subtypes correlate with important differences in tumor biology, clinical behavior, and patient survival. Luminal A and luminal B tumors are ER-positive and respond better to treatment, resulting in better long-term patient outcome compared to the ER-negative basal-like and HER2+ subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our microarray data mining analysis of primary breast cancer gene expression suggests that the hypermethylation defect observed in breast cancer cell lines can also be identified in primary tumors. Preliminary investigation of a limited dataset (n = 88 tumors) identified a strong cluster of tumors that express the hypermethylator signature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), with low levels of expression of the six genes of interest (<italic>CDH1, CEACAM6, CST6, ESR1, LCN2</italic>, and <italic>SCNN1A</italic>). All of the tumors in this cluster were classified as basal-like, and 75% of the basal-like tumors in the dataset expressed the hypermethylation signature. This observation suggests that the hypermethylator defect represents a biological property of basal-like breast cancers. Basal-like breast tumors make up ~25% of all breast cancers but contribute disproportionately to breast cancer deaths as they tend to display more aggressive tumor characteristics such as increased size, rapid tumor growth, increased rate of metastasis, higher incidence of relapse, and lower overall patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In has also been observed that this subtype of breast cancer is overrepresented in young, African-American women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. These tumors lack expression of the hormone growth factor receptor genes (ER and PR) that are targeted by some drug regimens, eliminating options for targeted therapy. While further studies are needed to understand fully the relationship between basal-like breast cancers and the hypermethylator phenotype, recognition of this fundamental biological property of the basal-like breast cancers may present new molecular targets for development of novel treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Unraveling the complexities of this hypermethylation defect in neoplastic breast disease holds important implications for cancer diagnosis, identification of new targets for therapy, and development of new strategies for clinical management. Since overexpression of DNMT is thought to be an early event in carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], elevated DNMT3b protein (which characterizes the hypermethylator phenotype in vitro) may constitute an important biomarker for early detection in patients developing breast tumors of the hypermethylator phenotype. Furthermore, the various proteins and enzymes of the DNA methylation machinery may represent novel targets for breast cancer therapy. It follows that patients with breast cancer of the hypermethylator phenotype may benefit significantly from a targeted demethylation treatment as an adjunct to standard chemotherapeutic regimens. Epigenetic chemosensitization has been shown to improve the efficacy of standard chemotherapeutics against tumor cells with known methylation defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and evidence suggests that chemotherapeutic resistance can be overcome with demethylating treatment in certain cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. While more research needs to be done to fully understand the clinicopathological implications of the hypermethylator phenotype in primary breast tumors, the existence of a subset of breast cancer cells with aberrant DNA methylation and other epimutations that are potentially reversible holds promise for better diagnosis and improved treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture, RNA, and DNA Preparation</title><p>Human breast cancer cell lines BT20 (ATCC# HTB19), BT549 (HTB122), Hs578T (HTB126), MCF7 (HTB22), MDA-MB-231 (HTB26), MDA-MB-415 (HTB128), MDA-MB-435S (HTB129), MDA-MB-436 (HTB130), MDA-MB-453 (HTB131), MDA-MB-468 (HTB132), SKBR3 (HTB30), and ZR-75-1 (CRL-1500) were obtained from the Tissue Culture Core Facility of the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (Chapel Hill, NC), and the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF12A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] (CRL-10782) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].
