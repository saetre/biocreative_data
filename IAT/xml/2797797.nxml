However, fruits such as grapes do not accumulate exceptionally high quantities of Asc. Grapes, unlike most other cultivated fruits do however use Asc as a precursor for the synthesis of both oxalic (OA) and tartaric acids (TA). TA is a commercially important product in the wine industry and due to its acidifying effect on crushed juice it can influence the organoleptic properties of the wine. Despite the interest in Asc accumulation in fruits, little is known about the mechanisms whereby Asc concentration is regulated. The purpose of this study was to gain insights into Asc metabolism in wine grapes (<italic>Vitis vinifera </italic>c.v. Shiraz.) and thus ascertain whether the developmental demand for TA and OA synthesis influences Asc accumulation in the berry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We provide evidence for developmentally differentiated up-regulation of Asc biosynthetic pathways and subsequent fluctuations in Asc, TA and OA accumulation. Rapid accumulation of Asc and a low Asc to dehydroascorbate (DHA) ratio in young berries was co-ordinated with up-regulation of three of the primary Asc biosynthetic (Smirnoff-Wheeler) pathway genes. Immature berries synthesised Asc <italic>in-situ </italic>from the primary pathway precursors <sc>D</sc>-mannose and <sc>L</sc>-galactose. Immature berries also accumulated TA in early berry development in co-ordination with up-regulation of a TA biosynthetic gene. In contrast, ripe berries have up-regulated expression of the alternative Asc biosynthetic pathway gene <sc>D</sc>-galacturonic acid reductase with only residual expression of Smirnoff-Wheeler Asc biosynthetic pathway genes and of the TA biosynthetic gene. The ripening phase was further associated with up-regulation of Asc recycling genes, a secondary phase of increased accumulation of Asc and an increase in the Asc to DHA ratio.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrate strong developmental regulation of Asc biosynthetic, recycling and catabolic genes in grape berries. Integration of the transcript, radiotracer and metabolite data demonstrates that Asc and TA metabolism are developmentally regulated in grapevines; resulting in low accumulated levels of the biosynthetic intermediate Asc, and high accumulated levels of the metabolic end-product TA.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ascorbate (Asc) is the most abundant soluble antioxidant found in plant cells and is present at various concentrations in nearly all fresh food. Since humans have, through evolution, lost the ability to synthesise their own ascorbate, it must be obtained from their diet [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]]. Asc, along with flavonoids, polyphenolics and lipophilic antioxidants, is often used as an indicator of the nutritional value of foodstuff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Asc has been the focus of much attention due to the versatility of its cellular functions and its impact on plant growth and development, as reviewed by Smirnoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], De Gara [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and Noctor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Asc metabolism is also evident in the cytosol and in non-photosynthetic organelles including the mitochondria and peroxisomes. The enzyme <sc>L</sc>-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase, which is capable of synthesising Asc from <sc>L</sc>-galactono-1,4-lactone, is in fact bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane, in association with Complex I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This enzyme is part of the Smirnoff-Wheeler Asc biosynthetic pathway, which is now widely accepted as the major pathway contributing to Asc accumulation in plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The proposed pathways of <sc>L</sc>-ascorbate (Asc) metabolism in plants</bold>. Single arrowed lines indicate one enzymatic step whilst dashed lines indicate multiple metabolic steps not shown in detail here. Black arrows represent steps in the primary Smirnoff-Wheeler Asc biosynthetic pathway, green arrows represent steps in the alternative 'carbon salvage' Asc biosynthetic pathway, blue arrows represent steps in Asc recycling and red arrows represent steps in Asc catabolism. Intermediates are represented by circles. Closed circles representing intermediates investigated in this study. The abbreviated names of enzymes catalysing individual steps are displayed in rectangular boxes. Shaded boxes highlight the genes encoding the enzymes investigated in this study. The Smirnoff-Wheeler primary Asc biosynthetic pathway enzymes include GDP-<sc>D</sc>-mannose-3,5-epimerase (GME), EC 5.1.3.18; GDP-<sc>L</sc>-galactose phosphorylase (VTC2), EC unassigned; <sc>L</sc>-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase (VTC4), EC unassigned; <sc>L</sc>-galactose dehydrogenase (L-GalDH), EC unassigned; <sc>L</sc>-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GLDH), EC 1.3.2.3. The alternative Asc biosynthetic pathway enzymes include <sc>D</sc>-galacturonic acid reductase (GalUR), EC 1.1.1.203 and aldono-lactonase, EC 3.1.1-. Enzyme catalysed steps involved in recycling Asc include monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), EC 1.6.5.4 and L-dehydroascorbate (DHAR), EC 1.8.5.1. C4/C5 cleavage of Asc in <italic>Vitaceous </italic>plants proceeds via the intermediates 2-keto-<sc>L</sc>-gulonic acid, <sc>L</sc>-idonic acid, 5-keto-<sc>D</sc>-gluconic acid, <sc>L</sc>-threo-tetruronate and <sc>L</sc>-tartrate. The only characterised enzyme of this pathway is L-idonate dehydrogenase (L-IdnDH), EC 1.1.1.264. C2/C3 cleavage of Asc or <sc>L</sc>-dehydroascorbate generates oxalate and <sc>L</sc>-threonate: this pathway may occur enzymatically or non-enzymatically.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-9-145-1"/></fig><p>Wheeler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] demonstrated that <sc>D</sc>-mannose and <sc>L</sc>-galactose were effective precursors of Asc, interconverted by the activity of GDP-<sc>D</sc>-mannose-3,5-epimerase, an enzyme which has since been characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

The <italic>VTC2 </italic>gene was more recently identified by two independent groups and described as a GDP-<sc>L</sc>-galactose/GDP-<sc>D</sc>-glucose phosphorylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and a GDP-<sc>L</sc>-galactose:hexose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>For many years, evidence has demonstrated the existence of an alternative Asc biosynthetic pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) whereby <sc>D</sc>-galacturonic acid is converted to Asc by an inversion of the carbon chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Interest in this alternative pathway was revived by the cloning and characterisation of <sc>D</sc>-galacturonic acid reductase from strawberry fruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In this pathway, pectin derived <sc>D</sc>-galacturonic acid is reduced to <sc>L</sc>-galactonic acid. This intermediate is readily converted to the Smirnoff-Wheeler Asc biosynthetic pathway intermediate <sc>L</sc>-galactono-1,4-lactone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which is in both pathways converted to Asc by the activity of <sc>L</sc>-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Another pathway for the synthesis of Asc has been demonstrated to occur from <sc>D</sc>-glucuronic acid, which is produced by the activity of <italic>myo</italic>-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], but a recent report using <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>over-expressing <italic>Miox </italic>demonstrates that this pathway plays an insignificant role in Asc accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Intracellular Asc concentration varies between species and between tissues of the same species. For example, ascorbate concentration tends to be high in meristematic tissue such as in germinating seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and in root apex cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The Asc content in fruit is also dependent on the tissue and the species [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]].</p><p>The biosynthesis of Asc is not the only factor regulating its cellular Asc concentration, Asc is also influenced by external stimuli such as nutrition [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]], light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and ambient ozone concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These stresses promote the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are removed by the plant's antioxidant system. The antioxidant system includes catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidases and enzymes involved in the ascorbate-glutathione cycle. This cycle includes ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glutathione reductase (GR) and the antioxidants Asc and glutathione (GSH) [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]]. MDAR and DHAR specifically catalyse oxido-reductase reactions, which alter the balance of Asc to DHA (Asc recycling), Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The protective functions provided by ascorbate and related antioxidant enzymes against photo-oxidative stress in chloroplasts are reviewed in Noctor and Foyer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and in Foyer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Investigating Asc accumulation in sink tissues such as fruit is further complicated by growing evidence that Asc translocation occurs to meet the demand for Asc in rapidly growing non-photosynthetic tissue. Franceschi and Tarlyn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] demonstrated long-distance translocation of Asc from leaves to root tips, shoots and floral organs in the model plants <italic>A. thaliana </italic>and <italic>Medicago sativa</italic>. Further support for Asc translocation via the phloem from leaves to fruits or tubers has since been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Ziegler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] originally reported the presence of ascorbate in the phloem, and Hancock et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] identified ascorbic acid conjugates in the phloem of zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.), which may play a role in phloem loading. However, the relative contribution of import on Asc accumulation in heterotrophic tissue has only been quantified in blackcurrants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and species differences are likely to exist.</p><p>Asc is not a stable metabolic end-product nor is it limited to oxido-reductase reactions that alter the balance of Asc to DHA; it can be catabolised to oxalic acid, <sc>L</sc>-threonic acid and <sc>L</sc>-tartaric acid [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]], Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. In geraneaceous plants, Wagner and Loewus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] demonstrated that cleavage of Asc between carbon atoms 2 and 3 results in the formation of OA from carbon atoms 1 and 2, and L-threonic acid (which may be further oxidised to form TA) from carbon atoms 3 to 6. The conversion or turn-over of DHA to oxalate/L-threonate via the intermediate 4-O-oxalyl-L-threonate was more recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In <italic>Vitaceous </italic>species, cleavage of the Asc catabolic intermediate 5-keto-<sc>D</sc>-gluconic acid between carbon atoms 4 and 5 leads to TA formation, with the two-carbon fragment of atoms 5 and 6 putatively recycled into central metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Conversion of <sc>L</sc>-[1-<sup>14</sup>C]ascorbic acid to TA in young grapes has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In a pathway distinct from TA biosynthesis, Asc is also cleaved in <italic>Vitaceous </italic>species between carbon atoms 2 and 3 leading to OA formation from carbon atoms 1 to 4. A more detailed review of the species differences between Asc catabolic pathways can be found in Loewus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>Unlike the oxido-reductase reactions that rely on Asc redox enzymes and non-enzymatic reactions to recycle Asc, catabolic reactions require continued Asc biosynthesis to replenish Asc lost to the synthesis of further compounds. In <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>leaves the loss or turnover of Asc is only about 2.5% of the pool per hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] whilst in embryonic axes of pea seedlings, the turn-over is about 13% per hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In flowers and early fruits, Asc turnover was low at 1.41% of the total Asc pool per hour and was increased with fruit maturity to 3% per hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The rate of Asc turnover in high oxalate or tartrate accumulators, such as in grapevines is yet to be established.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate Asc accumulation and metabolism in grapevines, which unlike other higher plant species used in similar investigations, is an accumulator of both Asc degradation products, TA and OA. Genetic, biochemical and metabolite approaches were taken to study the various facets of Asc metabolism including Asc biosynthesis, Asc recycling and Asc turnover. In the present study, we demonstrate that both grapevine fruit and vegetative tissue can use <sc>D</sc>-mannose and <sc>L</sc>-galactose for the synthesis of Asc and for further metabolism to TA and OA. A quantitative analysis of the developmental fluctuations of Asc and its degradation products OA and TA in grape berries is presented here. Furthermore, we investigate developmental regulation of genes involved in Asc metabolism, and from this we highlight developmental differences between primary and alternative Asc biosynthetic pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Developmental accumulation of metabolites</title><p>Recently, a method for the simultaneous quantification of Asc, TA and OA was described and accumulation of each across four developmental stages was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In this present study, the scope of the metabolite profile was extended to identify key physiological stages from pre-bud-break to harvest where correlative accumulation of the precursor and its catabolism products was evident: this was performed across two developmental seasons. The following berry analysis parameters enabled characterisation of specific physiological stages of development: fresh weight, sugar accumulation (total soluble solids) and malic acid accumulation.</p><p>Development of season 1 (2005-2006) berries was delayed compared to season 2 (2007-2008) berries. This was evident by the initial delayed increase in fresh berry weight (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), a slight delay in the onset of sugar accumulation (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) and a 3 week delay in the berry accumulation of maximum levels of malic acid (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Ripening was also delayed in season 1 berries, as the inception of ripening, known as veraison, was approximated at 75 DAF in season 1 and at 60 DAF in season 2. Delayed development may be attributed to the typical seasonal climatic differences such as the cooler maximum and cooler minimum temperatures experienced in mid-November 2006 (season 1) compared to the same period in 2007 (season 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. A net rate of increase in the accumulation of Asc, TA and OA was evident across c.v. Shiraz berry development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Berries of season 2 accumulated greater maximal quantities of Asc, approximately 1.8 times the content of season 1 berries (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In both seasons, a decrease was evident after the maximum quantity of accumulated Asc was reached. During the latter stages of berry ripening (after 100 DAF in season 1 and after 70 DAF in season 2) a secondary phase of Asc accumulation occurred, restoring the maximum quantity of Asc in the berry by harvest. A comparison of the results of Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> clearly demonstrated that berries do not accumulate significant quantities of Asc, particularly when compared to the quantities of accumulated TA and OA, suggesting that compartmental storage of Asc in berries does not occur.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Accumulation of total ascorbate (tAsc) and the ascorbate catabolites tartaric (TA) and oxalic acids (OA)</bold>.

Berry accumulation of TA was quite stable thereafter in season 2 yet some post-veraison fluctuations were evident in season 1. Berries also accumulated OA in early berry development, however, seasonal differences in the accumulated levels of OA was evident (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The altered sampling strategy of season 2, as detailed in the methods, assisted in minimising the variation of all metabolites investigated in season 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolism of Asc and of Asc biosynthetic precursors</title><p>To identify the existence of a functional Smirnoff-Wheeler Asc biosynthetic pathway in grapevines, the incorporation of radiolabeled carbon from the precursors <sc>D</sc>-[U-<sup>14</sup>C]mannose, <sc>L</sc>-[1-<sup>14</sup>C]galactose and <sc>L</sc>-[1-<sup>14</sup>C]ascorbic acid (<sc>L</sc>-[1<sup>14</sup>C]Asc) into the products Asc, TA or OA was investigated.

For example Davey <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] reported that blackcurrants (11.2-11.8 &#x003bc;mol/g f.w.), strawberries (3.37 &#x003bc;mol/g f.w.) and kiwifruits (3.41 &#x003bc;mol/g f.w.) are particularly rich in Asc. The results of this current report demonstrated that ripe wine grapes of cultivar Shiraz accumulated Asc (0.43-0.69 &#x003bc;mol/g f.w.) at levels similar to those reported in cranberry (0.67 &#x003bc;mol/g f.w.), apple (0.11-0.56 &#x003bc;mol/g f.w.) and apricots (0.39-0.56 &#x003bc;mol/g f.w.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It is not known whether low Asc accumulators have a lower rate of Asc biosynthesis, or an increased turnover capacity.</p><p>In some species, and at specific physiological stages, Asc catabolism to OA and TA occurs. Oxalate is a common organic acid synthesised in plant tissues to regulate tissue calcium content and to provide protection from herbivory [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]]. Unlike OA, TA does not commonly accumulate in plants. <italic>V. vinifera </italic>berries rapidly synthesise TA during the early cell expansion and growth phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], and accumulate TA in the vacuole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Despite this knowledge, the <italic>in-planta </italic>function of TA is still unclear.</p><p>The synthesis of OA and TA in plants involves irreversible breakdown of the carbon chain of Asc; however some of the carbon may be recovered in central metabolism. Analysis of TA biosynthesis in Virginia creeper leaves provided evidence that the C2 fragment, possibly as glycoaldehyde, is recycled into products of hexose phosphate metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In OA biosynthesis, <sc>L</sc>-threonate is recovered from carbons 3 to 6, which is likely to be remetabolised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].</p><p>The results of infiltrating the primary Asc biosynthetic pathway intermediates <sc>D</sc>-[U-<sup>14</sup>C]mannose and <sc>L</sc>-[1-<sup>14</sup>C]galactose into the excised stem indicate that grapevines have a functional Asc biosynthetic pathway operating <italic>in-planta</italic>. This biochemical evidence was further supported by transcriptional analysis of the grapevine genes homologous to those functioning in the primary Asc biosynthetic pathway in higher plant species. The results of this study demonstrated a positive correlation between the rapid pre-veraison accumulation of Asc in the berries and up-regulation of the Smirnoff-Wheeler Asc biosynthetic genes <italic>vvGME</italic>, <italic>vv<sc>L</sc>-GalDH </italic>and <italic>vvVtc2</italic>. It is of interest to note the comparatively small changes in transcript levels of some of these major Asc synthetic genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This suggests the onset of berry TA accumulation is not marked by large-scale synthesis of the respective Asc synthesis enzymes. The subsequent diversion of Asc into a catabolic fate may occur at a generally low rate, but over a sufficient period that TA levels accumulate as seen in the pre-veraison berry, since the TA thus formed is essentially metabolically inert. The correlated expression of <italic>Vtc2 </italic>(referred to as <sc>L</sc>-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase) with fruit ripening was also recently demonstrated in tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Integration of the biochemical and molecular evidence from this present study indicates that the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway supports Asc biosynthesis in immature berries.</p><p>Despite the developmental evidence of correlative gene expression and Asc accumulation presented here, the mechanisms regulating expression of these Asc biosynthetic genes and activity of the encoded enzymes is yet to be determined in grapevines. Research into the Smirnoff-Wheeler biosynthetic pathway in other higher plants has revealed specific points of regulation. Mieda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] demonstrated reverse inhibition of spinach <sc>L</sc>-galactose dehydrogenase by Asc. The concept of feedback regulation at this step in the Asc biosynthetic pathway was also supported by Gatzek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] who reported that over-expression of the gene encoding <sc>L</sc>-galactose dehydrogenase in tobacco plants did not result in an increase in leaf Asc content.</p><p>Contrary to the developmental regulation of <italic>vvGME</italic>, <italic>vvVtc </italic>and <italic>vv<sc>L</sc>-GalDH </italic>we demonstrated that <italic>vvGLDH </italic>was not developmentally regulated in berries. Contradictory reports about the correlation of <italic>GLDH </italic>gene expression, its enzyme activity and the Asc content exist. For instance, Tamaoki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] demonstrated that <italic>GLDH </italic>transcription and <italic>GLDH </italic>activity correlated with the diurnal changes in Asc content of <italic>A. thaliana </italic>leaves. It was also reported that both tAsc content and GLDH activity of potato leaves decreases with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. However, Bartoli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] reported that in a range of species there was no clear correlation between Asc content and leaf GLDH protein and activity. In the same report they also demonstrated that wheat leaf Asc content and GLDH activity was relatively constant over the day-night cycle, suggesting that species differences in the diurnal regulation of <italic>GLDH </italic>may exist. The influence of GLDH on Asc was also explored by Alhagdow et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] showing that <italic>GalLDH </italic>silencing of <italic>Solanum lycopersicum </italic>plants did not affect the total Asc content but did affect the Asc redox state.</p><p>In addition to investigating the primary Asc biosynthetic pathway, we determined a developmental transcription profile of <italic>V. vinifera </italic><sc>D</sc>-galacturonic acid reductase, which is homologous to the strawberry NADPH-dependent <sc>D</sc>-galacturonate reductase gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Up-regulated expression of <italic>vvGalUR </italic>was demonstrated in post-veraison berries, in agreement with the earlier report of a ripening-associated expression of <italic>GalUR </italic>in strawberry fruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The post-veraison expression of <italic>GalUR </italic>correlated with a second phase of increased Asc accumulation during berry development, and is suggestive of the existence of a carbon salvage pathway in which Asc is synthesised from a methyl derivative of <sc>D</sc>-galacturonic acid released during pectin degradation as fruits ripen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Further research into the association between pectin degradation and Asc biosynthesis via this 'salvage' pathway is required. Furthermore, a comparison of the enzymatic rate of GalUR activity with that of the Smirnoff-Wheeler biosynthetic pathway gene-products will provide an insight into the consequences of the comparatively low levels of expression of GalUR as well as the comparatively high levels of <italic>Vtc2 </italic>expression.</p><p>There is some evidence to suggest that regulation of the Asc content can occur at the biosynthetic level [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]]. Manipulation of the alternative pathway gene <sc>D</sc>-galacturonic acid reductase by over-expression in strawberry fruit resulted in a two- to three-fold increase in the total ascorbate content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Attempts to increase the Asc pool size in whole plants via the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway genes <italic><sc>L</sc>-GalDH </italic>and <italic>GLDH </italic>have not been equally successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. However, recent studies over-expressing the upstream Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway genes <italic>phosphomannosemutase</italic>, <italic>GME </italic>and <italic>Vtc2 </italic>have resulted in a 2- to 4-fold increase in the foliar Asc content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>], which now paves the way for similar transgenic approaches in fruit-bearing plants. In addition, over-expression of the gene encoding the Asc recycling enzyme dehydroascorbate reductase, resulted in a two to four-fold increase in ascorbic acid levels and a significant increase in the redox state of the ascorbate pool in transgenic maize and tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Surprisingly, there have been no studies on the influence of genetic manipulation of <italic>MDAR </italic>despite molecular cloning of plant isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] and purification of a chloroplastic MDAR isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>].</p><p>Here we describe significant up-regulation of <italic>MDAR </italic>and <italic>DHAR </italic>transcripts in post-veraison berries. The Asc to DHA ratio also increases in berries during this phase of berry development. Increased contribution of the reduced form of Asc to the tAsc pool of berries at the latter stages of ripening could be the result of an increased rate of Asc recycling via the activity of MDAR and DHAR and/or an up-regulation of the alternative 'salvage' pathway. The high DHA content in immature berries of this study may support TA formation in the early physiological stages of development; indeed we have shown a timely up-regulated total expression of the TA biosynthetic gene <italic><sc>L</sc>-IdnDH</italic>. Developmental expression pattern of <italic><sc>L</sc>-IdnDH </italic>reported here supports that originally reported by DeBolt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The more frequent time-point analysis of <italic><sc>L</sc>-IdnDH </italic>transcription presented here enabled us to determine that <italic><sc>L</sc>-IdnDH </italic>was up-regulated from 7 DAF. This transcription profile of <italic><sc>L</sc>-IdnDH </italic>indicates that TA biosynthesis may occur as early as bud-break. Hancock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] demonstrated that blackcurrant (<italic>Ribus nigrum L</italic>.) flowers have the capacity to synthesise Asc; the potential for Asc biosynthesis and degradation to TA in floral organs of grapevines must therefore be explored.</p><p>In this report we have demonstrated that in immature berries turnover of <sc>L</sc>-[1-<sup>14</sup>C]Asc to TA and OA and recycling of Asc is evident after 12 hours of metabolism. Franceschi and Tarlyn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] demonstrated that 75 to 80% of the label of <sc>L</sc>-[1-<sup>14</sup>C]Asc could be recovered in the form of Asc after 12 hours in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and <italic>Medicago</italic>. Their results suggest that whilst some turnover of Asc is apparent, the majority of Asc is recycled. In grapevines, however, the turnover is more rapid than the recycling of Asc, visualised by the recovery of more than twice the proportion of <sup>14</sup>C label from <sc>L</sc>-[<sup>14</sup>C]Asc in the catabolic forms of TA and OA compared to that in Asc. Research into the involvement of Asc in multiple parallel metabolic pathways is some-what limited by the current <sup>14</sup>C radiotracer techniques available. <sup>13</sup>C metabolic flux analysis may prove to be a more effective tool for quantification of the flux of complex metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>], and should in the near-future be employed to the study of Asc metabolism in fruit.</p><p>In previous research we have shown that leaves accumulate higher quantities of Asc and have a higher Asc to DHA ratio than berries at any stage of maturation investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Translocation of these ample Asc pools to support TA and OA accumulation in berries is presently unsubstantiated. It is however well established that grape berries accumulate assimilates translocated from the leaves during post-veraison development; for example sucrose produced by photosynthesis in the leaf is translocated to the berry via the phloem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. Translocation of Asc from leaves to fruits or tubers via the phloem has been demonstrated in other plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However, the total Asc accumulation in blackcurrant fruits was shown to be the result of a high biosynthetic capacity and low rate of Asc turnover rather than import via the phloem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It therefore remains to be determined if foliar Asc contributes to the accumulation of Asc in grape berries, and if the secondary rate of Asc accumulation observed in post-veraison berries is an indicator of long-distance Asc translocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we report developmental regulation of the biosynthetic genes <italic>vvGME</italic>, <italic>vvVtc2 </italic>and <italic>vv<sc>L</sc>-GalDH</italic>, the recycling genes <italic>vvDHAR </italic>and <italic>vvMDAR </italic>and of the catabolic gene (or TA biosynthetic gene) <italic><sc>L</sc>-IdnDH </italic>in berries. The results demonstrated that immature berries have up-regulated expression of Asc biosynthetic genes, a rapid rate of Asc accumulation, and are capable of <italic>in-situ </italic>Asc biosynthesis via the primary Smirnoff-Wheeler Asc biosynthetic pathway. The generally low level of change in transcript abundance seen during berry development may be explained by proposing that the diversion of L-Asc metabolism to support TA synthesis is small, and that the 'terminal' nature of TA as a metabolite leads to its gradual accumulation. Further radiotracer studies may in the future provide the quantitative metabolite data to back-up this molecular work. In contrast to this early diversion of Asc metabolism, ripe berries were shown to have up-regulated expression of the recycling genes, and of the alternative 'salvage' pathway gene <italic>GalUR</italic>, which correlated with both the secondary rate of Asc accumulation and an increased contribution of reduced Asc to the total Asc pool. Turn-over of <sc>L</sc>-[1-<sup>14</sup>C]Asc to TA in immature berries was observed, with some Asc recycling. We propose that the flux of Asc during early berry development is diverted towards the synthesis of TA and OA, and thereafter returns to non-synthetic, redox-associated roles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Vitis vinifera </italic>cultivars Shiraz clone BVRC12 on Shwarzmann rootstock were grown at the University of Adelaide Coombe vineyard in the Adelaide plains (South Australia) at 123 m elevation and latitude of 34&#x000b0;58'S.

However, some variability was observed between the physiological development of bunches. Therefore, the selection regime was improved in the 2007-2008 season (season 2) by sampling from bunches at the same physiological stage of development. This was achieved by tagging individual bunches across all vines at 50% cap-fall. In season 2, bunches from four vine replicates were tagged. These four vine replicates were repeated across five rows, i.e. sampling of replicate 1 was the pooled berries from five vines, each randomly positioned across five separate rows. Since ripening berries represent a major carbohydrate sink, minimising the number of berries removed from a bunch reduces variability of the sink-strength of the bunch.</p><p>The first sampling point in season 1 was 7 days after flowering (DAF) and then once the berries were large enough, sampling was conducted 3 times per week. After veraison, sampling was reduced to once per week due to an observed reduction in the accumulation of the metabolites of interest. In season 2, grape berries were sampled twice per week throughout the season. The sampling season was shortened from 139 DAF in season 1 to 105 DAF in season 2 due to the accelerated rate of development and ripening of season 2 berries.</p></sec><sec><title>Berry developmental parameters</title><p>Sampled berries (10 berries at the pre-veraison and 50 at the post-veraison time-points) were thawed at room temperature and blot dried to remove excess liquid before weighing.

After 12 hours of metabolism, bunches were removed from the tubes and 2 cm of the infiltrated stem was excised and discarded. The berries were collected, weighed and snap-frozen. The rachis and 1 cm of the remaining stem were weighed and snap-frozen together. Asc, TA and OA were extracted and analysed from 1 g of tissue using the same methods as for the extraction of unlabelled metabolites described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] with all changes and additions described here. A 2 ml aliquot of the extract was concentrated to 1 ml in a rotary evaporator (LABCONCO Centrivap concentrator, Missouri, USA) under reduced pressure at 35&#x000b0;C for 18 hours. The metabolites were separated by HPLC using a System Gold HPLC with the software 32 Karat (Beckman Coulter, NSW, Australia). Aliquots of the post-column eluate were collected into 5 ml scintillation vials according to the peaks observed on a flatbed recorder (Kipp and Zonen, Delft, The Netherlands) directly connected to the photodiode array detector. The successful collection of individual products according to visualization from the chart recorder was confirmed by injection of a mixed non-radioactively-labeled standard of 20 &#x003bc;M Asc, 0.15 mM TA and 0.11 mM OA, and collecting the post-column eluate for re-analysis and visualization of a single peak on the chromatogram output (data not shown). The radioactivity of each grapevine extract eluate was determined using a Canberra Packard TriCarb 2100TR (Canberra-Packard, USA) liquid scintillation counter, each sample was counted over 5 min with the average recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p><bold>Asc</bold>: ascorbate; <bold>c.v</bold>.: cultivar; <bold>DAF</bold>: days after flowering; <bold>DHA</bold>: dehydroascorbate; <bold>DHAR</bold>: dehydroascorbate reductase; <bold>EDTA</bold>: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; <bold>FW</bold>: fresh weight; <bold>GLDH</bold>: <sc>L</sc>-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase; <bold>GalUR</bold>: <sc>D</sc>-galacturonic acid reductase; <bold>GME</bold>: GDP-mannose-3,5-epimerase; <bold>HPLC</bold>: high performance liquid chromatography; <bold><sc>L</sc>-GalDH</bold>: <sc>L</sc>-galactose dehydrogenase; <bold><sc>L</sc>-IdnDH</bold>, <sc>L</sc>-idonate dehydrogenase; <bold>MA</bold>: malic acid; <bold>MDAR</bold>: monodehydroascorbate reductase; <bold>OA</bold>: oxalic acid; <bold>qRT-PCR</bold>: quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; <bold>TA</bold>: tartaric acid; <bold>tAsc</bold>: total ascorbate; <bold>Vtc2</bold>: GDP-<sc>L</sc>-galactose-phosphorylase; <bold><italic>vv</italic></bold>: <italic>Vitis Vinifera L</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VJM designed and conducted all research experiments, analysed the data, and drafted/constructed the manuscript.
