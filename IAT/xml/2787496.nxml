The ER&#x003b1; is a transcriptional activator and regulates gene transcription either by directly binding to the estrogen-responsive element (ERE) or by interacting with other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Gene amplification or overexpression of ER&#x003b1; was found in some breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Approximately 70% of breast cancers are ER&#x003b1; positive and estrogen dependent. ER&#x003b1; has become an important prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to estrogens, which induce proliferation of breast cancer cells, transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) inhibits the growth of human breast cancer cells in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; is the prototypic inhibitor of cell cycle progression and appears to directly antagonize the effects of many different mitogenic growth factors. A well-characterized TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway is initiated by the association between TGF-&#x003b2; and its two cell surface receptors, resulting in the formation of the receptor heterocomplex and activation of the type I receptor, which in turn activates the cytoplasmic receptor regulated-Smad (R-Smad: Smad2 and Smad3) proteins via phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Phosphorylated R-Smad associates with Smad4. The resulting heteromeric Smad complexes then translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate gene transcription in collaboration with other factors. The importance of the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway in cancer development is underscored by the presence of downregulation or inactivating mutations in genes encoding TGF-&#x003b2; receptors and Smads in human carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>While the role of TGF-&#x003b2; in breast cancer is ambiguous, as it was shown to display both tumor-suppressing and -enhancing effects, loss of responsiveness to TGF-&#x003b2; is believed to be a major factor in tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Activation of TGF-&#x003b2; represents one of the physiological countermeasures that are invoked to protect transformed cells against ER&#x003b1; excessive mitogenic stimulation. Additionally, inhibition of some breast cancer cell growth by tamoxifen appears to be mediated by TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Inhibition of T&#x003b2; RII expression abolished antiestrogen-dependent growth inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It has been shown that Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 all have physical interactions with ER&#x003b1; and that Smad4 acts as a transcriptional co-repressor for ER&#x003b1; and inhibits tumor growth by inducing apoptosis in ER&#x003b1;-positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although the regulated gene targets of Smads/ER&#x003b1; have not been identified, these findings imply that Smads-mediated cross-talk with the estrogen receptor plays an important role in development and/or progression of breast cancer.</p><p>In this study, we investigated how TGF-&#x003b2; regulates ER&#x003b1;-induced gene transcription and potential mechanisms of frequent TGF-&#x003b2; resistance in breast cancer. We demonstrated that Smad4 is essential for TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated inhibition of ER&#x003b1; estrogenic transcription activity. Either overexpression of Smad3 or inhibition of Smad4 expression switches TGF-&#x003b2; to an activator for ER&#x003b1; transactivation in breast cancer cells. In addition, we found that the expression of Smad4 was downregulated with increased cytoplasmic localization in ER&#x003b1;-positive human infiltrating breast cancer tissue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture, Transient Transfection and Reporter Assays</title><p>MCF-7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions.

We have demonstrated that the expression of Smad4 without TGF-&#x003b2; treatment inhibited ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Both Smad3 and Smad2 were shown to interact with ER&#x003b1;, thereby having a direct impact on both TGF-&#x003b2; and estrogen signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We therefore examined how the complexes of Smad4 and R-Smads mediate estrogen signal transduction through their interactions with ER&#x003b1; in breast cancer cells. We first performed a reporter assay using a construct bearing two repeats of the estrogen response element (ERE) and luciferase cDNA (2&#x000d7; ERE-TATA-LUC). MCF-7 breast cancer cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids of Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, or Smad4 in combination with either Smad2 or Smad3. The cells were then treated for 16 hours with either &#x003b2;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) alone or E<sub>2 </sub>in combination with TGF-&#x003b2;1. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, expression of either Smad2 or Smad3 enhanced E<sub>2</sub>-induced luciferase transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Smad2 had a limited effect. Overexpression of Smad4 alone or with Smad3 strongly attenuated E<sub>2</sub>-induced luciferase activity, whereas Smad2/4 only showed moderate inhibition. These results clearly indicate that Smad3 and Smad4 act as ER&#x003b1; coactivator and corepressor, respectively, and that Smad4 overrides Smad3/4 in the repression of ER&#x003b1;-induced transcription. Apparently, Smad2 is not a potent ER&#x003b1; coactivator, nor is the Smad2/4 complex an effective repressor. To confirm this observation, we performed a similar experiment in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 which lacks endogenous ER&#x003b1; and Smad4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. By transient expression of a small amount of ER&#x003b1;, we reconstituted ER&#x003b1;-mediated signaling. Overexpression of Smad3 enhanced ER&#x003b1;-induced transcription, while Smad4 alone or in complex with Smad3 inhibited ER&#x003b1; transcription activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). These results are similar to those observed in MCF-7 cells.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The Smad3/4 complex confers TGF-&#x003b2; repression on ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcription</bold>.

The cells were treated with (+) or without (-) E<sub>2 </sub>and/or TGF-&#x003b2; as indicated for 16 hours prior to lysis, and analyzed for luciferase activity.

To determine whether Smad4 and R-Smads also regulate ER&#x003b1; downstream genes, we measured the endogenous mRNA levels of <italic>PS2 </italic>and <italic>C-MYC</italic>, using endogenous &#x003b2;-actin mRNA as a control. The MCF-7 hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line was transiently transfected with Smad2/4 or Smad3/4 and treated with TGF-&#x003b2;1 for 8 hours. Total mRNA was extracted followed by reverse transcription and semi-quantitative real time PCR. As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>, TGF-&#x003b2; downregulated the expression levels of <italic>PS2 </italic>and <italic>C-MYC </italic>mRNA stimulated by E<sub>2</sub>. Transient expression of Smad3/4 repressed the transcription of these two genes, while overexpression of Smad2/4 did not significantly alter the transcriptional activity. These results clearly indicate that, in breast cancer cell lines, Smad4 can either function as an ER&#x003b1; transcriptional co-repressor on its own or mediate TGF-&#x003b2; suppression by forming a complex with Smad3.</p></sec><sec><title>Smad4 Is Essential For TGF-&#x003b2;-Mediated Repression of ER&#x003b1; Transactivation</title><p>Our next objective was to investigate how Smad3 and Smad4 can act differently in regulating ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity. Smad3 is known to form a complex with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus upon TGF-&#x003b2;-induced phosphorylation. Similarly, the estrogen receptor, upon binding an estrogenic ligand such as E<sub>2</sub>, dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus. Therefore, we employed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay to determine whether TGF-&#x003b2; and E<sub>2 </sub>can regulate the interaction of ER&#x003b1; with Smad3 and Smad4. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with either E<sub>2 </sub>alone or E<sub>2 </sub>together with TGF-&#x003b2;1. The whole cell lysates were subjected to co-IP assays using anti-Smad4 or anti-Smad2/3 antibodies. The results demonstrated that the interaction between Smad2/3 and ER&#x003b1; was enhanced within 1 hr of TGF-&#x003b2; addition, while Smad4 binding ER&#x003b1; was not dependent upon either E<sub>2 </sub>or TGF-&#x003b2;1 stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Immunoprecipitation with a control mouse or rabbit IgG revealed no detected product (data not shown). The canonical transcriptional activation of ER target genes is attributable to the direct binding of ER to the estrogen responsive element in the promoter region of ER target genes. In our previous studies with chromatin immunoprecipitation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we demonstrated the Smad4 expression did not inhibit ER&#x003b1; binding to the chromatin. To further examine if Smad3/Smad4/ER&#x003b1; complex can bind to the ERE, we performed a sequential DNA precipitation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. FLAG-tagged Smad3 and Smad4 were co-transfected into COS-1 cells with HA-tagged ER&#x003b1; expression plasmids. The cells were then treated with E<sub>2</sub>, TGF-&#x003b2; or E<sub>2 </sub>+ TGF-&#x003b2;. HA-tagged ER&#x003b1; was precipitated from cell extracts with anti-HA antibody. The precipitates were eluted with an HA peptide and subjected to DNA precipitation (DNAP) with either biotinylated ERE double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (wild-type) or a disrupted sequence (mutant) as a control for the experiment. The precipitated protein complexes were examined by anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and control IgG antibodies. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, the wild-type ERE probe precipitated ER&#x003b1;, Smad4 and a noticeable amount of Smad3.

These data suggest that Smad4 can function as an ER&#x003b1; corepressor independent of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, whereas Smad3 acts as a TGF-&#x003b2;-regulated cofactor for ER&#x003b1;.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The EREaccommodates Smad3/4 and ER&#x003b1; complexes in the nucleus</bold>.

In addition, in breast T47D cells with undetected Smad4, ectopic expression of Smad4 resulted in inhibition of endogenous ER&#x003b1; direct response genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To further examine the essential role of Smad4 in the cross-talk between TGF-&#x003b2; and estrogen signaling, we reduced the expression level of endogenous Smad4 using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene silencing technique. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, Smad4 protein was almost non-detectable in the MCF-7 cells treated with Smad4-specific siRNA (siRNA-Smad4), while treatment of the MCF-7 cells with a non-specific siRNA (siRNA-Control) did not change the protein level of Smad4 or other control genes.

Our findings indicate that the reduction of Smad4 protein attenuates the inhibitory effect of TGF-&#x003b2; on estrogen-induced gene transcription.

Our findings suggest that Smad4 is required for TGF-&#x003b2; to inhibit ER&#x003b1;-induced transcription, which provides important information regarding TGF-&#x003b2; resistance in breast cancer cells. It has been reported that altered expression levels or/and abnormal cellular distribution of biologically active proteins are associated with some human neoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We set to assess smad4 expression in human breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer tissue. While most breast cancer cell lines (e.g., MDA-MB-231) are essentially refractory to the growth inhibition, the MCF-7 cell line responds to TGF-&#x003b2; by suppression of cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We employed both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 to determine whether there is any difference in the expression of Smad4 protein. TGF-&#x003b2; stimulated translocation of Smad2/3 with Smad4 into the nucleus of MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). In the MDA-MB-231 cells, however, Smad4 did not translocate into the nucleus with Smad2/3 in response to TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). These data suggest that cytoplamic retaining of Smad4 upon TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation contributes to the resistance of MDA-MB-231 to TGF-&#x003b2; growth inhibition. We then examined Smad4 expression in benign human breast and ER&#x003b1;-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma tissue. Smad4 was strongly expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus of benign breast ductal epithelial cells from 4 individuals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). In contrast, Smad4 are weekly expressed and largely restricted in the cytoplasm of cancer cells from 8 of 12 cases with infiltrating ductal carcinoma (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). The variable cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of Smad4 was detected in the remaining 4 cases. To further investigate the significance of Smad4 expression in breast cancer, we examined the specimen with both benign ductal epithelial and cancer cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e-g</xref>, the residual benign ductal epithelial cells surrounded by infiltrating ductal carcinoma highly expressed Smad4 in both cytoplasm and nucleus, while the expression of Smad4 was markedly decreased and largely restricted to cytoplasm in ER&#x003b1;-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma. These results demonstrate that the reduced expression and abnormal cytoplasmic retaining of Smad4 protein are present in some of ER&#x003b1;-positive infiltrating breast ductal carcinoma. The data also clearly indicate a dynamic change of Smad4 expression from benign breast ductal tissue to infiltrating ductal carcinoma.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Smad4 in breast cancer cell lines and ER&#x003b1;-positive infiltrating beast carcinoma</bold>.

TGF-&#x003b2; is a natural negative growth regulator of epithelial cells during both development and tumorigenesis of the mammary gland. Most breast carcinomas are refractory to the suppressive effect of TGF-&#x003b2; with elevated TGF-&#x003b2; expression, suggesting an important role of TGF-&#x003b2; in breast cancer tumorigenesis.</p><p>In previous studies, we have demonstrated that Smad4 can act as a transcriptional corepressor for ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Smad3, on the other hand, has been shown to act as a coactivator for ER&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Since TGF-&#x003b2; activation leads to the formation of an active Smad3/4 complex which directly binds to the promoter of many TGF-&#x003b2; responsive genes, it is conceivable that the Smad3/4 complex, rather than Smad3 or Smad4 alone, plays a major role in the crosstalk between TGF-&#x003b2; and estrogen. Our data clearly indicate that the Smad3/4 complex plays the same role as Smad4 alone, i.e., inhibiting ER&#x003b1;-mediated gene transcription. This observation is not surprising since TGF-&#x003b2; treatment alone suppresses estrogen-induced ER target gene expression. However, it adds to the complexity of the question why Smad3 and Smad4 act in opposite ways in the regulation of estrogen signaling, while they have the same effect on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. One possible explanation is that, in the context of ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcription, Smad3 and Smad4 <italic>per se </italic>may recruit functionally different cofactors such as histone acetylases and histone deacetylases. The protein complex(es) recruited by Smad3 or Smad4 might determine the role of Smad3 or Smad4 as a transcriptional cofactor in estrogen signaling. In breast epithelial cells that have intact TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad and estrogen signaling networks, the "net effect" of TGF-&#x003b2; may be determined by the protein complex that incorporated both Smad3 and Smad4. In breast carcinoma cells that lack one component of the Smad3/4 complex, Smad3 or Smad4 may act as a coactivator or corepressor for ER&#x003b1; that confers a TGF-&#x003b2; activating or suppressing signal on the estrogen signaling pathway. The high frequency of Smad4 mutations in human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] suggests a role for Smad4 as a tumor suppressor independent of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. Smad4 mutations in breast carcinoma have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In addition, the work on Smad4 conditional knockout mice also indicates that Smad4 is required for the suppression function of TGF-&#x003b2; in the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>We have shown that, in the presence of Smad4, TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional activity. A decrease in Smad4 expression partially or completely abrogates TGF-&#x003b2; suppression of ER&#x003b1;-target genes, and TGF-&#x003b2; can further activate ER-target genes since Smad3 acts as a transcriptional coactivator for ER&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). It seems that TGF-&#x003b2; can regulate ER&#x003b1; estrogenic transcriptional activity in both a negative and positive manner, and apparently, that the absence of Smad4 can switch TGF-&#x003b2; from a suppressor to an activator of ER signaling. TGF-&#x003b2; dual regulation of ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity may also explain the biphasic effect in tumors: suppression of tumor growth at the early stages and promotion of tumor spreading during the later stages. Further investigations are needed to identify the target genes that are specifically regulated by R-Smads and/or Smad4, especially in the context of tumor cells. Hopefully, the results from future studies will lead to a better understanding of the dual role of TGF-&#x003b2; in cancer development.</p><p>Loss of TGF-&#x003b2; inhibition can be due to mutations or deletions of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling components. Indeed, mutations of TGF-&#x003b2; receptor or Smads-encoding genes have been reported in different forms of cancers, such as colon cancer and pancreatic cancer. Abnormal expression level and cellular distribution of biologically active proteins have been implicated in the tumorigenesis. Aberrant cytoplasmic localization of nucleophosmin in primary acute myeloid leukemia has been implicated in disrupting ARF-MDM2-p53 signal pathway and contributed to leukemogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Significant reduced expression of Smad4 protein was found in some human carcinoma including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that, in TGF-&#x003b2;-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, Smad4 failed to translocate into the nucleus with Smad2/3, therefore losing the function of Smad4 as a repressor in the nucleus and probably contributing to decreased growth inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2; in this cell line. In addition, the expression of Smad4 are decreased and largely restricted in the cytoplasm of some of ER&#x003b1;-positive infiltrating human breast cancer cells in contrast to the benign breast tissue in which Smad4 was strongly expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus of ductal epithelial cells. Moreover, the marked difference of Smad4 expression is noted between carcinoma cells and surrounding residual normal ductal tissue from same specimen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e-g</xref>). These data indicate that the dysregulation of Smad4 protein expression may play a role in the development and progression of ER&#x003b1;-positive breast carcinoma. The fact that aberrant expression of Smad4 is only seen some of ER&#x003b1;-positive infiltrating breast cancer is consistent with the heterogeneity of human breast carcinoma in biological features, development and progression, and therapy response. It is likely that in an ER&#x003b1;-positive breast carcinoma with aberrant expression of Smad4, TGF-&#x003b2; not only is unable to inhibit tumor growth, but also promote tumor progression through enhancing the estrogen-ER&#x003b1; mediated cell proliferation. The mechanism for dysregulation of Smad4 expression in ER&#x003b1;-positive infiltrating breast cancer is still unknown. It could be due to mutations or deletion of Smad4, or aberrant expression of certain oncoproteins. Our findings may provide a basic mechanism to explain the lack of TGF-&#x003b2; responsiveness and anti-estrogen-dependent growth inhibition in some of ER&#x003b1;-positive infiltrating breast carcinoma, support an idea of both tumor suppressing and enhancing effects of TGF-&#x003b2; in the development and/or progression of breast cancer, and open a path to further investigate the cause of aberrant expression of Smad4 in ER&#x003b1;-positive infiltrating breast carcinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that TGF-&#x003b2; can regulate ER&#x003b1; estrogenic transcriptional activity in both negative and positive manners. Smad4 is essential for TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated inhibition of ER&#x003b1; estrogenic transcription activity, and the inhibition of Smad4 expression switches TGF-&#x003b2; from a repressor to an activator for ER&#x003b1; transactivation in breast cancer cells. We have demonstrated that down-regulation and relatively increased cytoplasmic localization of Smad4 were associated with some ER&#x003b1;-positive infiltrating human breast carcinoma. These results suggest that aberrant expression of Smad4 or disruption of Smad4 activity be one of mechanisms for loss of TGF-&#x003b2; negative regulation on ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YR and LW carried out the molecular and cell biology and immunohistochemistry studies, and wrote the manuscript.
