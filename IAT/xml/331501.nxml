Overexpression of Pim-1 predisposes to lymphomagenesis in mice. To develop a further understanding of Pim-1 in molecular terms, as well as in terms of its potential role in hematopoietic development, we have generated mice deficient in Pim-1 function. Pim-1-deficient mice are ostensibly normal, healthy and fertile. Detailed comparative analyses of the hematopoietic systems of the mutant mice and their wild-type littermates showed that they are indistinguishable for most of the parameters studied. Our analyses revealed one unexpected phenotype that correlated with the level of Pim-1 expression: Pim-1 deficiency correlated with a erythrocyte microcytosis, whereas overexpression of Pim-1 in E mu-Pim-1-transgenic mice resulted in erythrocyte macrocytosis. In order to confirm that the observed decrease in erythrocyte Mean Cell Volume (MCV) was attributable to the Pim-1 deficiency, we developed mice transgenic for a Pim-1 gene construct with its own promoter and showed that this transgene could restore the low erythrocyte Mean Cell Volume observed in the Pim-1-deficient mice to near wild-type levels. These results might be relevant to the observed involvement of the Pim-1 gene in mouse erythroleukemogenesis. The surprising lack of a readily observed phenotype in the lymphoid compartment of the Pim-1-deficient mice, suggests a heretofore unrecognized degree of in vivo functional redundancy of this highly conserved proto-oncogene.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0104-a" xlink:role="4752"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0104-b" xlink:role="4752"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4750"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4751"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4752"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4753"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4754"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4755"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
