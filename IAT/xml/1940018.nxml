SFRP1 (the secreted frizzled-related protein 1), a putative tumor suppressor gene mapped onto chromosome 8p12-p11.1, the frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) region in human HCC, encodes a Wingless-type (Wnt) signaling antagonist and is frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in many human cancers. However, whether the down-regulation of SFRP1 can contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis still remains unclear.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We investigated the expression of SFRP1 through real time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry staining. The cell growth and colony formation were observed as the overexpression and knockdown of SFRP1. The DNA methylation status within SFRP1 promoter was analyzed through methylation-specific PCR or bisulphate-treated DNA sequencing assays. Loss of heterozygosity was here detected with microsatellite markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>SFRP1 was significantly down-regulated in 76.1% (35/46) HCC specimens at mRNA level and in 30% (30/100) HCCs indicated by immunohistochemistry staining, as compared to adjacent non-cancerous livers. The overexpression of SFRP1 can significantly inhibit the cell growth and colony formation of YY-8103, SMMC7721, and Hep3B cells. The RNA interference against the constitutional SFRP1 in the offspring SMMC7721 cells, which were stably transfected by ectopic SFRP1, can markedly promote cell growth of these cells. LOH of both microsatellite markers D8S532 and D8SAC016868 flanking the gene locus was found in 13% (6 of 46 HCCs) and 6.5% (3 of 46 HCCs) of the informative cases, respectively, where 5 of 8 HCC specimens with LOH showed the down-regulation of SFRP1. DNA hypermethylation within SFRP1 promoter was identified in two of three HCC specimens without SFRP1 expression. Moreover, the DNA methylation of SFRP1 promoter was significantly reduced, along with the re-expression of the gene, in those HCC cell lines, Bel7404, QGY7701, and MHCC-H, as treated by DAC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggested that the down-regulation of SFRP1 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene, triggered by the epigenetic and/or genetic events, could contribute to the oncogenesis of HCC.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world, in particular in Sub-Sahara Africa and South-eastern Asia, with an estimation of 600,000 deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The higher incidence rate of HCC has been continuing to increase in China and other countries over the past decades years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The factors of susceptibility, such as the infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and chronic exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and alcoholic cirrhosis, have been well identified and characterized as contributors to hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to hepatocarcinogenesis are still unclear.</p><p>In past years, some transcriptomic approaches, such as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and cDNA or oligonucleotide microarray, were employed to figure out the gene expression profile of HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The comprehensive data will contribute to the understanding of oncogenesis and identification of some biomarkers related to the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. Our previous transcriptomic data on HCC disclosed some deregulated genes in hepatocarcinogenesis as compared to that of the corresponding non-cancerous livers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], of which some genes could contribute to the oncogenesis of HCC as HCC-associated genes, whatever activated oncogenes or silenced tumor suppressor genes. Among them, SFRP1 (secreted frizzled-related protein 1 gene), a putative tumor suppressor gene mapped onto chromosome 8p12-p11.1, a frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) region in human HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], was found to be down-regulated in HCC. As known, some groups have reported that SFRP1 as a Wingless-type (Wnt) signaling antagonist is frequently inactivated owing to the promoter methylation in many human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although SFRP1 can regulate the vascular cell proliferation, postnatal skeletal muscle growth and hypertrophy and the growth of retinal ganglion cell axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], whether the down-regulation of SFRP1 could contribute to the hepatocarcinogenesis should be further clarified.</p><p>In this study, we found that SFRP1 was significantly down-regulated in HCC specimens through epigenetic and/or genetic events, as compared to adjacent non-cancerous livers. Furthermore, the resulting data from RNA interference and cell transfection of exogenous SFRP1 indicated that the down-regulation of SFRP1 could contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue specimens</title><p>All HCC specimens were obtained from those patients who underwent surgical resection of their diseases and were informed consent before operation on their liver. The primary tumor specimens were immediately frozen at -80&#x000b0;C until DNA/RNA extraction. Both tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues were sampled respectively, with approximate 1 cm<sup>3 </sup>size of each specimen, and were proved by pathological examination. Those HCC specimens in this presenting work were grouped as the differentiation grades II-III according to the Edmondson grading system. The clinical characteristics of patients and tumors are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. In addition, two adult liver tissues were obtained from two patients who were resected surgically due to hemangioma in liver. The samples were obtained from the portion unaffected by the hemangioma and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately. The samples were sectioned and confirmed histologically. Two fetal livers were obtained from aborted fetus as the pregnancy between 4&#x02013;6 months. All procedures and risks were explained verbally and in a written consent form. This project and protocol for the investigation involving human and animals were approved by the ethics committee of the Chinese National Human Genome Center at Shanghai.</p><table-wrap

The immunohistochemical staining showed that SFRP1 was mostly anchored in cytoplasm and extracellular matrix (ECM) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), in coincidence with the character of SFRP1 as a secreted protein. Furthermore, we evaluated the expression level of SFRP1 in available HCC cell lines by RT-PCR.

The interesting results showed that exogenous SFRP1 can significantly inhibit the cell growth of YY-8103 cells as compared to the vector alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), suggested that SFRP1 as a Wnt pathway antagonist could play important roles in regulating negatively the cell growth of HCC-derived cells. To further test the negative effect of SFRP1 on the cell growth of HCC cells, the colony formation assay was performed on another HCC cell line, Hep3B, without the significant expression of endogenetic SFRP1, through the transient cell transfection with the same plasmids, pcDNA3.0 with full ORF of SFRP1 and empty vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). After cultured in G418 for 21 days, few colonies can be formed when the cell transfection using pcDNA3.0 with SFRP1, whereas the colony formation was still obvious as the cell transfection with empty vector alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The dramatic reduction of colony formation from Hep3B cells further suggested that SFRP1 could be a potent inhibitor for negatively regulating the cell growth, possibly through the opposed effect of Wnt-&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, which was well-known as an important contributor to the oncogenesis of HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. To further observe the long-term effect of SFRP1 on the cell growth of HCC cells, the same plasmids were stably transfected into SMMC7721 cells, also a HCC cell line. After screening the transfected cells by western blotting assay, five stable offspring subclones were picked up and maintained. Among them, two stable subclones (SMMC7721Z and SMMC7721Y) with significant expression of exogenous SFRP1 were further evaluated by this study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The resulting data showed that SMMC7721Z and SMMC7721Y with stable expression of SFRP1 exhibited the depressed cell growth as compared to parent SMMC7721 cells without endogenous expression of the gene (p &#x0003c; 0.01, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These transient and long-term effects of SFRP1 on different HCC cells support the notion that SFRP1 as a candidate tumor suppressor genes could be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. To eliminate the artificial growth suppression induced by the overexpression of various genes, we compare the expression level of SFRP1 in SMMC7721Z containing exogenous SFRP1 with that of normal liver through RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The resulting data showed that the mRNA level of exogenous SFRP1 in SMMC7721Z was not higher than that of human normal liver, implying that the growth suppression of SMMC7721Z could be induced by SFRP1 itself, not by the artificial overexpression of ectopic gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The overexpression of SFRP1 can significantly inhibit the cell growth and colony formation of HCC cells</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Plasmid pcDNA3.0-SFRP1 was transiently transfected into YY-8103 cells, confirmed by immunoblotting assay, where empty vector was used as control and &#x003b2;-actin was used as an internal reference. <bold>(B) </bold>Cell growth curve of YY-8103 cells with the exogenous SFRP1, which cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS.

To test the efficacy of these siRNAs, the siRNAs were transiently transfected into SMMC7721Z cells with exogenous SFRP1 because the endogenetic SFRP1 was difficult to be detected by using western blotting assay, where siRNA-NC was used as a reference control. The resulting data indicated that these two siRNAs can significantly knockdown the exogenous SFRP1, as compared with siRNA-NC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Afterward, these siRNAs were further transiently transfected into some HCC cell lines, such as MHCC-L and Sk-hep-1 cells, with the endogenetic SFRP1. However, the growth of these cells had no significant alteration, whatever promotion or suppression of cell growth, implying that those HCC cell lines could be inappropriate to evaluate the effect of SFRP1 on cell growth.</p><p>Furthermore, we still chose SMMC7721 cells to evaluate the efficiency of these siRNAs, because the above data indicated that SMMC7721 cells exhibited the response to the exogenous SFRP1. Here, these siRNAs were transiently transfected into stable offspring SMMC7721Z cells with constitutional expression of exogenous SFRP1. Interestingly, both siRNA-SFRP1_888 and siRNA-SFRP1_1094 could obviously promote cell growth of SMMC7721Z cells as compared to siRNA_NC (p &#x0003c; 0.05, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), indicated that the suppressive cell growth of exogenous SFRP1 could be rescued by the RNA interference. The data also further supported that the frequent down-regulation of SFRP1 could contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis via promoting the cell growth of given HCC cells, since the cell growth of some HCC cells was indeed negatively regulated through the expression level of SFRP1.</p></sec><sec><title>LOH at the SFRP1 locus in HCCs</title><p>To address whether the genetic aberrations could contribute to the down-regulation of SFRP1, genomic imbalance of the SFRP1 locus was evaluated in 46 pairs of HCC specimens with or without SFRP1 expression by using the microsatellite markers D8S532 and D8SAC016868, which were found on chromosome 8p11.2 flanking the SFRP1 locus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Among these 46 pairs of HCCs examined, LOH of these two microsatellite markers was identified in 13% (6 of 46) and 6.5% (3 of 46) HCC specimens (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), respectively, where a total of 8 (17.4%) HCCs was considered as involving LOH. Interestingly, SFRP1 was down regulated in seven of eight HCC specimens. However, the overall resulting data suggested that low frequency of LOH at the SFRP1 locus could not be a crucial genetic event in HCCs, although epimutation could occur by the DNA methylation on the remaining allele in those HCC samples when an allele was lost.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis on HCC samples</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Schematic representation of the microsatellite markers of D8S532 and D8SAC016868 located on chromosome 8p11.2 flanking the SFRP1 locus. <bold>(B)</bold>The microsatellite markers, D8S532 and D8SAC016868, flanking the SFRP1 locus were employed to analyze the LOH on 46 pairs of HCC samples.

Similarly, as a control, we here evaluated the expression of SFRP1 and DNA methylation level within SFRP1 promoter in both fetal and adult livers. The resulting data demonstrated that the obvious DNA hypomethylation of the promoter was significant in the livers, in consistence with the high expression of SFRP1. The findings implied that the methylation status of SFRP1 promoter could be associated with the expression of the gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>The correlation between the expression of SFRP1 gene and DNA methylation status of SFRP1 promoter</bold>.

Interestingly, the resulting data showed that SFRP1 was significantly upregulated in Bel7404, QGY7701, MHCC-H cells through the treatment by DAC, not by TSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), implying that the DNA methylation status of genomic DNA could be correlated with the dysregulation of SFRP1. To further address the relationship between the methylation status on SFRP1 promoter and the expression of the gene, MSP was performed on these three HCC cell lines to detect the methylation levels of CpG islands within SFRP1 promoter. Expectedly, MSP data suggested that the CpG islands within SFRP1 promoter could be in DNA hypermethylation in all parent cell lines, whereas the unmethylated CpG islands occurred in the cell lines as the treatment of DAC, not TSA, along with the re-expression of endogenetic SFRP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). These findings indicated that the DNA hypermethylation of SFRP1 promoter might be responsible for the silence of SFRP1 transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA methylation of the SFRP1 promoter in primary HCCs</title><p>To quantify the DNA methylation status of SFRP1 promoter in clinical HCC samples, bisulfite-treated genomic DNA sequencing was employed to analyze the methylation level of CpG islands in three pairs of HCC specimens with the down-regulation of SFRP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The DNA sequencing on PCR products revealed that the methylation levels of CpG islands around the transcription start site (TSS) of SFRP1 was significantly increased in two HCC specimens, 11C and 38C, as compared to that of non-cancerous livers (p &#x0003c; 0.01) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), whereas the methylation status in one HCC sample was not significantly changed. The resulting data suggested that the DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands around TSS of SFRP1 can partially contribute to the down-regulation of SFRP1 in some HCC specimens, although other mechanisms, such as LOH and/or other epigenetic alterations, may also contribute to the down-regulation of SFRP1 in HCCs.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>DNA hypermethylation of SFRP1 promoter in primary HCC samples</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Transcriptional expression of SFRP1 was analyzed by RT-PCR in two pairs of HCCs and corresponding non-cancerous livers, where &#x003b2;-actin was used as an internal control. <bold>(B) </bold>The bisulfite-treated DNA sequencing was preformed on the genomic region (-160 ~ + 200) around TSS of SFRP1, where the extent of methylation of the promoter was evaluated through DNA sequencing on 8 random clones inserted by PCR products.

Interestingly, SFRP1 encodes a soluble Wnt antagonist and is located on chromosome 8p12-p11.1, which is a frequently affected region involving genetic alterations in some tumors, including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], colorectal carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Moreover, the down-regulation of SFRP1 has been observed in many tumors, including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], mesothelioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and non-small cell lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Recently, the frequent down-regulation of the gene was also reported in HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], where 43 of 47 HCC (91.5%) exhibited the depressed SFRP1 as compared with non-cancerous livers through quantitative RT-PCR. In this study, we also found that SFRP1 was significantly downregulated in 76.1% (35/46) in HCCs by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The lower frequency of SFRP1 down-regulation than the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] could be ascribed to the heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma due to etiology, ethnics, etc. Moreover, SFRP1 was found to be significantly decreased in 30 (30%) of 100 HCC specimens on tissue array at protein levels. These findings suggested that the down-regulation of SFRP1 could be involved in some HCCs, although the down-regulation of the gene was not correlated with the etiology, gender, and tumor size. In general, our findings above implied that the frequent down-regulation of SFRP1 mapped onto chromosome 8p12-p11.1, a major LOH region in human HCC, could be an important event in oncogenesis of HCC.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the DNA methylation status of SFRP1 promoter in many HCC cell lines and primary HCC specimens through MSP and bisulfite-treated genomic DNA sequencing. In these HCC cell lines examined, the unmethylated CpG islands within SFRP1 promoter was found in Sk-Hep1 and Bel-7405 cells with the expression of SFRP1 via MSP, whereas the significant hypermethylation of the region occurred in Bel7402, SMMC7721, Bel7404, YY-8103, QGY7701, and MHCC-H cells without SFRP1 transcription. The results supported that the DNA methylation status of SFRP1 promoter can correlate with the transcriptional expression of the gene. Actually, two of three HCC specimens indeed exhibited the significant hypermethylation of SFRP1 promoter, in consistency with the previous description [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], suggesting that the hypermethylation of SFRP1 promoter could be an important event for the down-regulation of the gene in HCC.</p><p>However, epi-mutation on a remaining allele as an allele was lost in HCC specimens could not be crucial event in hepatocarcinogenesis, because low frequency of LOH occurred at the SFRP1 locus. In this study, we used additional microsatellite markers D8S532 and D8SAC016868 that are proximal to the SFRP1 locus, not D8S505 and D8S1722 used in the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], to evaluate allelic imbalance of the SFRP1 locus. The two microsatellite markers (D8S532 and D8SAC016868) were closer to the SFRP1 locus in both flank, not one flank, than others reported by Shil YL <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] based on the genomic information (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Both D8S532 and D8SAC016868 are located in the upstream or downstream of SFRP1, only a 378 kb or 153kb distance from SFRP1 locus, respectively. Our result showed that only 13% (6 of 46 HCCs) and 6.5% (3 of 46 HCCs) exhibited the allelic imbalance, where seven of eight HCC specimens with LOH showed the depressed expression of SFRP1. As known, the ideal reference for LOH analysis is a non-pathologic tissue of the same patients, such as blood cells. In this study, it is possible that the under-estimation of LOH ratio could occur when non-tumor livers with pathological lesion were used as control.</p><p>Interestingly, it is known that SFRP1 could control vascular cell proliferation, skeletal muscle growth and retinal ganglion cell axons growth <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, whether the silencing of SFRP1 could contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown. Significantly, in this study, our data indicated that the expression level of SFRP1 as a negative regulator was crucial to the cell growth of some HCC cells. The overexpression of SFRP1 can obviously inhibit the cell growth and colony formation of YY-8103, Hep3B and SMMC7721 cells, whereas RNA inference on the exogenous SFRP1 can induce the growth of the given cells (SMMC7721), indicating that the cellular behaviors of some HCC cells could be sensitive to the expression level of SFRP1, and the significant reduction of SFRP1 could contribute to oncogenesis of HCC through promoting cell growth. On the other hand, our data also implied that SFRP1 as a tumor suppressor gene and secreted protein for inhibiting Wnt-&#x003b2;-catenin could be employed for cancer therapy through transfecting the gene into tumor, and injecting the active protein as surroundings niche.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggested that the down-regulation of SFRP1 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene, triggered by the epigenetic and/or genetic events, could contribute to the oncogenesis of HCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SFRP1, secreted frizzled-related protein 1; HCC, Hepatocellular carcinoma; MSP, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction; LOH, loss of heterozygosity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZGH and JH design the study.
