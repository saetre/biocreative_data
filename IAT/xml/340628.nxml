We report the cloning and sequencing of the melA gene. The nucleotide sequence data showed that melA codes for a 450 amino acid long protein with a molecular weight of 50.6 kd. The sequence data also supported the assumption that the mel locus forms an operon with melA in proximal position. A comparison of MelA with alpha-galactosidase proteins from yeast and human origin showed that these proteins have only limited homology, the yeast and human proteins being more related. However, regions common to all three proteins were found indicating sequences that might comprise the active site of alpha-galactosidase.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0330.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2213"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0331.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2214"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0332.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2215"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0333.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2216"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0334.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2217"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0335.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2218"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0336.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2219"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0337.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2220"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
