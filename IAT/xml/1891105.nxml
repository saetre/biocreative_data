The cyclinD/CDK4/6 complexes induce the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and the release of E2F, which trigger G1 cell cycle progression. Normally, Rb binds to the members of the E2F family of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The expression and location of cyclin D1 and CDK4 in G1 cell cycle acts as the primary sensors of positive and negative environmental signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Studies report that the expression and translocation of cyclinD1-CDK4 are regulated by several signaling molecules, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], Rho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and NF-kappaB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. All of them are present in the hippocampus, where they participate in the regulation of synaptic functionality and gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the expression of cell cycle markers in the postnatal or adult brain is still a matter of controversial debate. Ectopically expressed cyclinD1 sequestered in the cytoplasm of post-mitotic neurons, whereas it efficiently entered the nucleus of proliferating progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Even in the adult mouse hippocampus, cyclinD1-CDK4 were found in terminally differentiated pyramidal and granule neurons, and also were found in dendrites and mossy fibers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Paradoxically, increasing evidence suggests that, cell cycle arrest and terminal differentiation of neurons may not be necessarily incompatible with CDK activity but raise the possibility that CDKs and cyclins have physiological impact general effects, such as metabolic regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], basal transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or mechanisms of neuronal and synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

Our observations of a significant reduction of PPF in slices pretreated with CDK4 inhibitor from neonatal animals (P8-P15) suggested a role of cyclinD1-CDK4 in neurotransmitter release at the early development stage. But there was no significant decrease in PPF when applied to slices from adolescence animals (P21-P35). PTP, another form of short-term synaptic plasticity, was also impaired in CDK4 inhibitor pre-incubated slices from both neonatal and adolescent animals. All these data suggested that cyclinD1-CDK4 mediated short-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices.</p><p>Distinct transmitter release properties determine differences in short-term plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This form of synaptic enhancement is caused by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in release probability and releasable vesicle pool size[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], the residual elevation in pre-synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>i acting on one or more molecular targets that appear to be distinct from the secretory trigger responsible for fast exocytosis and phasic release of transmitter to single action potentials. Previous studies suggested that silent synapses are not only exist post-synaptically but also pre-synaptically[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] in developing hippocampal neurons. The available silent synapses can often be rapidly activated, in many instances. These properties enable silent synapses to participate in short-term plasticity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. CDK4 inhibitor had dramatic effects on PPF and PTP at the early development stage (P8-15) in our experiments, which is apparent involved in calcium release or the activation of pre-synaptic silent synapse. On the other hand, it was surprised to see such different effect on PPF by CDK4 inhibitor during the development; these findings demonstrating that cyclinD1-CDK4 have a developmental effect change that modulates pre-synaptic function. One hypothesis to consider is that this difference might be due to the developmental change of silent synapse in hippocampal neurons. However, the exactly mechanism interfered with needs further study.</p><p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase(PI3K) is required for the expression but not for the induction or the maintenance of Long-Term Potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, there is still lack of information concerning the involvement cyclinD1-CDK4 long term synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Our observations found that cyclinD1-CDK4 inhibitor did not affect the induction or the maintenance of LTP both at P8-P15 and at P21-35. Future studies are aimed at determining whether the expression phase of this form of LTP or other forms of LTP are affected.</p><p>Two mechanistically distinct forms of LTD coexist in synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Induction of one form depends on activation of NMDA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], while induction of the other depends on activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The locus of mGluR-LTD expression is unclear. Several studies have reported that mGluR-LTD is associated with increases in paired-pulse facilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and changes in miniature EPSC frequency[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], suggesting that the expression of mGluR-LTD is pre-synaptic. In addition, it was reported that the pre-synaptic vesicle release and cycling are altered during mGluR-LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. However, these findings do not eliminate the possibility of a postsynaptic contribution to mGluR-LTD. For example, it has been shown that mGluR-LTD is dependent on postsynaptic protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, Nosyreva and Huber (2005) found that there is a developmental switch in synaptic mechanisms of hippocampal mGluR-dependent LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In adolescent animals (P21-P35), mGluR activation induces LTD require protein synthesis, whereas in neonatal animals (P8 -P15), mGluR-LTD is independent of protein synthesis, instead, results in pre-synaptic function. A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] reported that activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is required for mGlu-LTD, and is known to be required for dendritic protein synthesis, although cannot exclude the possibility of an additional pre-synaptic function. Determination of downstream effectors of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway will be necessary for mGluR-LTD to begin to elucidate the identities of the proteins that are synthesized in dendrites during this type of synaptic plasticity.</p><p>In this study, we found that mGluR-LTD was impaired in slices from CDK4 inhibitor pretreated slices both from neonatal animals (P8 &#x02013; P15) and adolescent animals (P21-P35), and the similar effect was present in PPF-LFS-induced LTD. However, the effect of the CDK4 inhibitor at slices from adolescent animals was not as robust as slices from neonatal animals on this form of LTD. This difference may be due to the distinct role of cyclinD1-CDK4 at the two developmental stages during this form of LTD. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that cyclinD1-CDK4 are required for mGluR-LTD, and the complex may have two different roles during the developmental stage in synaptic mechanisms of hippocampal mGluR-dependent LTD. A more likely possibility is that PI3K is an important regulator of the protein synthesis dependent phase of LTP and regulates neuronal protein synthesis in response to different extracellular stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. As a downstream effecter of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, at P21-35, cyclinD1-CDK4 may be required for mGluR-dependent LTD through activate the Rb/E2F1 pathway to partly initiate some dendritic protein synthesis that are necessary for the expression of mGluR-LTD, The incomplete blockage of mGluR-LTD, suggest that other signaling pathways may play an other or additional role in mGluR-LTD. Whereas at P8-15, may be due to its pres-synaptic function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we observed the expression and sub-cellular localization of cyclinD1-CDK4 during the postnatal development stage, and cyclinD1-CDK4 may mediate STP but not basal synaptic transmission. The induction or the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in response to a strong tetanus and NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD) are normal in hippocampus, whereas mGluR-dependent LTD is significantly inhibited in slices that pre-incubated by CDK4 inhibitor during the postnatal development. These findings demonstrate a function role for cyclinD1-CDK4 in short-term plasticity and in mGluR-dependent synaptic depression in the hippocampus, and suggest that this cyclin-dependent kinase may have different roles during the postnatal development in mice hippocampus area CA1. Future studies aimed at the exactly mechanism interfered with, and the role of activation of cyclinD1-CDK4 in the effect of lead on synaptic plasticity and cell death in hippocampus following development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Care of animals and experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used. All mice were of the C57B6/129 genetic background. Most of the experiments were conducted in the brain slices of mice at postnatal day8 (P8) to 15 (P15), and day21 (P21) to 35 (P35).

Sections of 30 &#x003bc;m thickness were cut on freezing microtome and collected in 0.1 M TBS, pH 7.4. Antigen unmasking was performed by treating sections with 0.05% trypsin for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing in PBS, sections were blocked with 5%bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST + BSA) for 30 min. Afterwards, sections were incubated with anti-CDK4 antibody (1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Section-bound antibodies were revealed by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (1:1000, 1h, Amersham). All incubation steps were separated by intense washing with TBS. Specificity of labeling was tested by omitting primary antisera. After such incubation, tissue was devoid of immunoreactivity as expected.

Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded with glass microelectrodess (1&#x02013;3 M&#x003a9;) filled with ACSF and positioned in stratum radiatum of area CA1. Synaptic responses were reliably evoked every 20sec in the CA1 region of the hippocampus by stimulating Schaffer collaterals with 0.1 ms pulses. A full input-output (I/O) curve was constructed at the beginning of each experiment, the stimulus intensity (0.2 ms duration, 0.033 Hz) selected for baseline measurement was adjusted to elicit about 40% of the maximal slope. Paired pulse facilitation (PPF) was tested by applying two pulses at different intervals (30&#x02013;300 ms). LTP was induced using high frequency stimulation (HFS; 100 Hz for 1 s), after 20 min of stable baseline recordings. mGluR-LTD was induced by application of 100 &#x003bc;M DHPG (Tocris Cookson) for 5 min or by pairs of stimuli (interstimulus interval, 50 ms) delivered at 1Hz for 15 min (1800pulses; PPF-LFS).</p><p>D, L-AP-5 (Sigma) was prepared fresh in ACSF.
