They are also able to hydrolyse DNA and RNA substrates from the 5&#x02032;-end, liberating mono-, di- and polynucleotides terminating with a 5&#x02032; phosphate. Exonuclease IX is a paralogue of the small fragment of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA polymerase I, a FEN with which it shares 66% similarity. Here we show that both glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase-tagged and native recombinant ExoIX are able to interact with the <italic>E. coli</italic> single-stranded DNA binding protein, SSB. Immobilized ExoIX was able to recover SSB from <italic>E. coli</italic> lysates both in the presence and absence of DNA. <italic>In vitro</italic> cross-linking studies carried out in the absence of DNA showed that the SSB tetramer appears to bind up to two molecules of ExoIX. Furthermore, we found that a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exodeoxyribonuclease activity previously associated with ExoIX can be separated from it by extensive liquid chromatography. The associated 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exodeoxyribonuclease activity was excised from a 2D gel and identified as exonuclease III using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The flap endonucleases (FENs) are a family of structure-specific nucleases capable of cleaving a variety of branched DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). These enzymes recognize substrates containing at least one duplex and a single-stranded 5&#x02032; overhang such as flaps and pseudo Y structures. The major activity involves cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone one nucleotide into the double-stranded region at the junction of single-stranded bifurcation with duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). They also display 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonucleolytic activities on substrates with free 5&#x02032;-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and can attack gaps in duplex DNA and covalently closed-circular DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). These latter activities appear to be very similar to the gap endonuclease activities described recently in human FEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). A functional FEN seems to be essential for all organisms. For example, the FEN activity present within the <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> DNA polymerase I N-terminal region is essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), haploinsufficient mice rapidly develop tumours while <italic>FEN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/FEN<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutants show embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>The striking similarity of the structures of FEN enzymes from a diverse range of organisms has been revealed through crystallographic structure determination. For example, <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanococcus jannaschii, Pyrococcus furiosus</italic>, T5 exonuclease (T5FEN), <italic>Thermus aquaticus</italic> DNA polymerase I FEN domain and human FEN1 enzymes share a central beta sheet feature adorned by a number of helices and interconnecting loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16">11&#x02013;16</xref>). All possess binding sites for two divalent metal ions composed of conserved glutamyl and aspartyl residues and a DNA-binding feature known as a helix-three-turn-helix motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Based on the observation of two manganese binding sites in <italic>Taq</italic> Pol, Steitz and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) proposed a two-metal-ion mechanism for FEN-mediated phosphate ester cleavage similar to that of the Klenow 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; proof-reading exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The roles of the divalent metal ions include substrate binding by metal ions I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) with the site I metal generating a hydroxide ion essential for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). It also appears that just one metal binding site is required for the structure-specific endonuclease activity of the T5FEN enzyme, whereas it requires both metal binding sites to be occupied for exonucleolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>The DNA polymerase I protein present in eubacteria possesses FEN activity carried within the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Two groups independently reported the identification of a previously uncharacterized <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA polymerase I (Pol I) paralogue by interrogation of sequences deposited in the public databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The putative gene, originally designated <italic>exo</italic>, was identified based upon up to 60% sequence identity with part of the 5&#x02032; region of <italic>polA</italic>, the gene encoding Pol I. The <italic>exo</italic> gene appeared to have a suitable ribosomal binding site with a GUG start codon but the open reading frame consisted only of 753 nucleotides, with no homology to <italic>polA</italic> detectable beyond this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In comparison, <italic>polA</italic> encodes a much larger protein, consisting of the FEN domain or 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease domain also known as the small fragment and the larger, Klenow fragment carrying the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; proofreading and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Overall, the 251 amino-acid protein encoded by the <italic>exo</italic> open reading frame displayed 66% similarity with the <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA Pol I protein and most importantly, it appeared to contain most of the residues characteristic of the FENs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Interestingly, these include conserved acidic residues involved in binding to one of the essential divalent metal ions usually required for catalysis (site I) but lacks three acidic residues corresponding to site II in T5FEN. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the crystal structure of the T5FEN with the residues in common with ExoIX identified. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Structure of T5FEN showing residues in common with ExoIX. The residues conserved in ExoIX and T5FEN are shown coloured in red or blue are mapped onto the T5FEN crystal structure (pdb code 1exn). Residues in red are the ligands forming the binding site for metal ion I (site I ligands) and are common to both proteins. Left hand panel shows a ribbon representation of the T5FEN backbone and the three metal site II ligands (yellow spacefill) that are absent in ExoIX. In T5FEN, these are aspartates (155, 201 and 204) whereas in ExoIX they are glycine 130, isoleucine 175 and serine 178. A space-filled representation is shown on the right.

A 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exodeoxyribonuclease activity was reported for the <italic>xni</italic>-encoded protein and it was renamed exonuclease IX (ExoIX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In addition to this principal exodeoxyribonucleolytic function the protein possessed a deoxyribophosphodiesterase (dRPase) activity on abasic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and was able to remove 3&#x02032; phosphoglycolate end groups from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). These activities are difficult to reconcile with the strong sequence homology ExoIX shares with the FEN family of nucleases, since they are structurally dissimilar from the apurinic/pyrimidinic endonucleases, which generally perform these types of reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). We were intrigued by the reported 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonucleolytic activity of ExoIX as it appeared to display the reverse of the normal polarity of action seen in the FENs i.e. 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032;. In the work reported here, we over-produced native ExoIX and found that by using both one and two-dimensional activity gels, we were able to monitor the protein and nuclease activity during fractionation. Contrary to earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), the ExoIX protein could be separated from a contaminating 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. We were able to identify the associated 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity as being due to low levels of initially co-purifying exonuclease III (ExoIII). Once free of contaminating ExoIII, the ExoIX protein displayed no apparent exodeoxyribonuclease activity under conditions typical for FENs. We also investigated whether ExoIX was able to interact directly with ExoIII or any other proteins present in <italic>E. coli</italic> cell-free extracts. Amongst others, ExoIX bound to single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB). The interaction was confirmed using <italic>in vitro</italic> chemical cross-linking. The interaction took place even in the absence of nucleic acids. The SSB tetramer was able to bind up to two monomers of ExoIX.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning and expression of the native <italic>exo</italic>/<italic>xni</italic> gene</title><p>The <italic>xni</italic> gene was amplified by PCR from <italic>E. coli</italic> XL-1Blue genomic DNA (Stratagene) using standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) with <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase (Promega).

The nature of the contamination was confirmed by direct identification of the spurious nuclease from a 2D substrate gel.</p><p>We have previously observed contaminating nuclease activity initially copurifying with overexpressed proteins. Though weak, such contaminating activities are readily detected using sensitive radioisotopic assays such as those deployed in the previous ExoIX study. We repeated the purification of a GST&#x02013;ExoIX fusion protein using a column format rather than the originally employed batch recovery method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Extensive washing and affinity elution resulted in a protein that lacked any detectable DNase activity as was the case with the unmodified ExoIX protein. These results are intriguing given that the amino acid sequence of ExoIX possesses the ligands equivalent to those responsible for binding the catalytically essential metal ion in the FENs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>We investigated whether ExoIX interacted directly with any other <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins such as exonucelase III. Using a pull-down format or column chromatography approaches we were unable to reproducibly show any strong interaction with exonuclease III however, several <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins did appear to be able to bind to ExoIX. Both the native and the GST&#x02013;ExoIX fusion proteins were able to bind to <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB. SSB forms a tetramer and is known to bind tightly to single-stranded DNA within the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell. ExoIX appears to be able to bind to the SSB tetramer as two extra species are observed in the cross-linking mixture of SSB and ExoIX compared with SSB or ExoIX alone. Both the slowest migrating species in the ExoIX-SSB reaction reacted with the anti-ExoIX polyclonal antibodies. It should be noted that it is difficult to accurately determine the stoichiometries of binding of cross-linked proteins by SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis. However, as two slower migrating SSB&#x02013;ExoIX complexes can be observed, the simplest explanation is that each SSB tetramer can bind two ExoIX molecules. We were also able to detect binding of ExoIX to the H-NS protein, a molecule with a preference for binding to curved duplex DNA and G/C-rich single-stranded nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). These results indicate that ExoIX is involved in someway with the replication machinery, though despite our extensive efforts we have been unable to identify any substrate on which ExoIX displays hydrolytic activity. We also identified chaperones GroEL, GroES and Skp but these may have been binding to ExoIX that had become partially denatured during the immobilization process, as a common role for chaperones is to bind disordered peptides. The presence of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphorylase was almost certainly due to co-migration on SDS&#x02013;PAGE of this protein with the chaperone GroEL as they share very similar molecular masses.</p><p>This study reveals that ExoIX is not a 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), yet it does seem to interact intimately with the DNA binding proteins SSB and H-NS. The homology of the protein with the FEN family of structure-specific nucleases suggests a role in processing of nucleic acids. Studies on an <italic>xni</italic> null mutant failed to identify any obvious defects in a range of DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). However, as ExoIX is a paralogue of the FEN domain of DNA Pol I, perhaps it functions as a back-up for this enzyme, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Further studies are needed to determine the biological role of this cryptic DNA Pol I paralogue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The support of the BBSRC for studentships to LMA, MRGH and DPT and a project grant (50/19466) is gratefully acknowledged.
