The N-terminal half of FMBP-1 has a weak similarity to the DNA-binding domain of several transcriptional regulatory factors in higher plants. The C-terminal half contains four tandem repeats of a novel 23 amino acid motif, which we named the score and three amino acid peptide (STP). Other genes containing STP repeats were found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, mouse and human. Mutational analysis of FMBP-1 showed that the STP repeats form a novel DNA-binding domain. Sequences flanking STP repeats modulated DNA-binding activity. The FMBP-1 gene was expressed during the fourth to fifth instar. FMBP-1 activity appeared to be regulated at the transcriptional level and by the post-transcriptional modification.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The larval silk gland of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> is distinctly divided into anterior, middle and posterior regions, based on structural and functional criteria. Several silk protein genes are expressed in a spatial- and temporal-specific manner in the silk gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Fibroin-H-chain (usually fibroin), fibroin-L-chain and fibrohexamerin (previously P25) genes are expressed in the posterior region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), while the sericin-1 and -2 genes are expressed in the middle region with sublocal specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). These silk genes are expressed at every feeding stage, but not at every molting stage, during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>Several protein factors that bind the transcriptional regulatory elements of silk genes have been detected and characterized in <italic>B.mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Fibroin-modulator-binding proteins (FMBP)-1, FMBP-2 and FMBP-3 were first detected as factors bound to the intronic elements of the fibroin gene, but it was later found that all these FMBPs also bind to the upstream elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). cDNAs for the FMBP-2 and FMBP-3 were isolated and identified as Bm fork head (Bm Fkh) and POU-M1, respectively, the transcription factors having a winged-helix type and a POU-homeodomain type DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Bm Fkh was expressed in both PSG and MSG, and bound to the regulatory elements of both the fibroin and sericin-1 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Bm Fkh is thought to be a common regulatory factor for the fibroin and sericin-1 genes. Expression of the fibrohexamerin gene is also regulated by Bm Fkh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). POU-M1 is expressed in many organs during the organogenesis of the <italic>Bombyx</italic> embryo, and the silk gland is one of the organs that expresses POU-M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Though POU-M1 binds to the transcriptional activation element of the upstream region of the sericin-1 gene, and was first thought to be an activator for the sericin-1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), POU-M1 might function as a repressor or, in coordination with another factor, as an activator. POU-M1 is highly expressed in ASG, and the expression is complementary to that of the sericin-1 gene in MSG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>The FMBP-1 activity detected by a DNA-binding assay closely correlated with the specificity of the fibroin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). FMBP-1 was abundant in PSG at the fourth and fifth feeding stages, but barely detectable in MSG and PSG at the fourth molting stage. FMBP-1 might play an important role in the regulation of the tissue- and stage-specificity of the fibroin gene. In the present study, we purified FMBP-1 protein, isolated its cDNA and analyzed the structure and expression. We found that FMBP-1 contains a novel DNA-binding domain composed of tandem repeats of the score and a three amino acid long peptide (STP), conserved from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p><italic>B.mori</italic> eggs, hybrids of Kinshu x Showa, were purchased from Ueda Sanshu (Ueda, Japan).

The column was washed, and bound proteins were fractionated sequentially with N500 (500 mM NaCl instead of 500 mM KCl in the K500 buffer), N700, N900, N1200 and N2000 buffer. Each fraction was analyzed for protein components by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and FMBP-1 activity by an electrophoresis mobility-shift assay (EMSA). The FMBP-1 eluted in the N1200 fractions was pooled, diluted with N0 buffer below 0.9 M NaCl and reloaded on the poly(dA&#x02013;dT)&#x02013;Cellulofine.

Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA (2 &#x003bc;g) was denatured in glyoxal/dimethyl sulfoxide solution, fractionated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to a nylon membrane using standard methods. The entire coding region of FMBP-1 was labeled with the megaprime DNA-labeling system (Amersham Bioscience) and used for hybridization.

Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (BioRad) by electroblotting at 50 mA for 90 min in a transfer buffer (20 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris and 20% methanol) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus. Blots were blocked by treatment with 5% (W/V) skim milk (Difco) in 1&#x000d7; TBS-T (2 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.6, 13.7 mM NaCl and 1% Tween20) for 1&#x02013;2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-FMBP-1 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After three rinses with TBS-T, the blots were treated with a second antibody (goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) for 1 h.

Cells were broken by sonication and the addition of 10% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation was mixed with glutathione&#x02013;Sepharose at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Sepharose beads bound with the fusion protein were washed with PBS and then with 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.0.

High concentrations of any of these polynucleotides with ssDNA or tRNA did not compete efficiently in binding of FMBP-1 to the +290 region probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but poly(dA&#x02013;dT) did compete at least as effectively as the specific probe (data not shown). Accordingly, we decided to use poly(dA&#x02013;dT) for the purification instead of the FMBP-1-binding elements of the fibroin gene, and prepared poly(dA&#x02013;dT)&#x02013;Cellulofine.</p><p>PSG extracts were loaded on the poly(dA&#x02013;dT)&#x02013;Cellulofine column, and fractionated with increasing concentrations of NaCl. The eluates were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, for protein composition, and an EMSA for FMBP-1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of the FMBP-1 activity was eluted at 1.2 M NaCl in two cycles of DNA affinity chromatography. In these fractions, two bands at &#x0223c;32 kDa were detected in almost equal amounts by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We repeated the affinity purification on a large scale, and using these purification processes only one band of 32 kDa was obtained (see Discussion). The 32 kDa band was recovered from a preparative gel, and the binding specificity was examined in an EMSA with oligonucleotides of the FMBP-1-binding elements and their point mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The recovered 32 kDa protein showed the same binding specificity as FMBP-1 in crude PSG extracts (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and sequence analysis of FMBP-1 cDNA</title><p>The internal amino acid sequence of the 32 kDa protein was analyzed, and a total of 65 amino acids of four peptides were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, a search of various databases using the BLAST program found no amino acid sequence homologous to the peptides of FMBP-1. Therefore, we isolated a cDNA clone using PCR to determine the nucleotide sequence excluding degeneracy. The PCR was performed using primers containing degeneracy based on the amino acid sequence of peptide 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The products were separated on a polyacrylamide gel, and those having the appropriate size were cloned. The inserted DNA was sequenced and a unique sequence of the internal region surrounded by the degenerated primers was used as a probe for library screening. As a result, we isolated several clones from the cDNA library of PSG at 12 h after the fourth ecdysis. The longest cDNA was 1481 nt, and included an open reading frame (ORF) that was 218 amino acids long with a predicted molecular mass of 25 kDa. The starting ATG codon was predicted at nucleotide position 111, and a poly(A) signal was found at position 1449 (AB163434). Southern blotting using the entire cDNA probe with genomic DNA demonstrated that FMBP-1 is encoded by a single copy gene in <italic>Bombyx</italic> (data not shown).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the deduced amino acid sequence of the putative protein encoded by these cDNAs. The protein contains all the peptides (P1&#x02013;P4) whose amino acid sequences had been determined. The region from amino acid 55 to 84 is rich in acidic residues, while the region from 85 to 192 is rich in basic residues. The N-terminal region of the protein showed weak similarity to the AP2 domain, which is thought to be a DNA-binding domain of transcription factors in higher plants, such as APETALA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), EREBP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) and RAV1 and RAV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The similarity to RAV1 and RAV2 extends to the C-terminus outside the AP2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). At the N-terminal end of the basic region, there is a stretch rich in basic amino acids. In the C-terminal half of the predicted protein, there is a unique structure composed of four tandem repeats of 23 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We again searched for sequences homologous to this unique repeat in various databases, and found similar repeated structures of the score and three amino acids in humans, mouse, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We named this repeated structure the STPR (score and three amino acid peptide repeat) domain.</p></sec><sec><title>FMBP-1 is the STPR protein</title><p>The predicted molecular mass of the STPR protein is &#x0223c;25 kDa, but FMBP-1 purified from PSG extracts was found to be 32 kDa on SDS&#x02013;PAGE. We examined whether the STPR protein is FMBP-1. The ORF region was amplified by PCR and subcloned into an expression vector, and expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST). The rabbit antibody anti-FMBP-1 was prepared against the deletion protein del. 12 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and added to the EMSA reaction. The bands shifted by FMBP-1 in crude PSG extract, the purified fraction and the fusion construct, the recombinant GST&#x02013;STPR protein, were further shifted to the top of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), showing that the STPR protein is FMBP-1.</p><p>We compared nucleotide sequences recognized by FMBP-1 and the STPR protein, using various single point mutants of the +290 probe as competitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). FMBP-1 and the STPR protein competed for binding to the +290 probe in completely the same manner. On the other hand, Bm Fkh in crude extract, which bound to the same probe, competed differently from FMBP-1 with the same mutant oligonucleotides. From these experiments, the recognition sequence of FMBP-1 was determined as ATNTWTNTA, whereas Bm Fkh is known to recognize overlapping but different nucleotides, TNTGTAAATA (the complementary sequence is usually described), in the same DNA element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue-specificity and developmental changes of the activity and expression of FMBP-1 from the fourth to fifth instar</title><p>FMBP-1 activity was detectable by an EMSA in PSG at the fourth and fifth feeding stages but rarely in MSG and the fourth molt in PSG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Using extracts from PSG at the fourth feeding, fourth molting and fifth feeding stages, and from MSG at the fourth molting and fifth feeding stages, western blotting was performed with anti-FMBP-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Though the antibody reacted with some protein bands, the 32 kDa band was clearly detected in the extracts from PSG at the fourth and fifth feeding stages, and a very faint signal at the same position was observed in the extracts from MSG and PSG at the fourth molting stage.</p><p>To trace the activity of FMBP-1 at the early stages of the fifth instar precisely, PSG extracts were prepared at 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 h after the fourth ecdysis, and used for the EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Though the FMBP-1 activity was scarcely detectable at the fourth molting stage, it suddenly became detectable at only 2 h after the fourth ecdysis, reached a peak at &#x0223c;6 h, and then decreased gradually.</p><p>Northern blotting was performed to clarify whether the expression of the FMBP-1 gene corresponds with the DNA-binding activity. Total RNA was extracted from the staged PSG, and poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA was extracted from PSG and MSG at day 1 of the fifth instar, and used for northern blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, long bands of 7, 5, 2.4, 1.6 and 1.35 kb were detected in poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA from both PSG and MSG. FMBP-1 RNA was also detectable in PSG during the fourth molting stage. While it was difficult to detect RNAs of 2.4 kb and longer in the total RNA, the amount of 1.6 and 1.35 kb FMBP-1 RNA consistently increased from 48 h after the third ecdysis to 6 h after the fourth ecdysis and then decreased from 12 h after the fourth ecdysis.</p></sec><sec><title>STPR is a novel DNA-binding domain</title><p>To map the DNA-binding domain of FMBP-1, various deletion proteins were prepared, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>, and used for the EMSA. Clearly, the deletion proteins still completely covering the STPR domain bound to the +290 probe, while the proteins lacking even part of the STPR domain lost most of their DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The protein that covered only the STPR domain (del. 13) still had &#x0223c;50% of the DNA-binding activity of the complete FMBP-1. Accordingly, the STPR domain conserved from <italic>C.elegans</italic> to humans is a novel DNA-binding domain.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Competition of the binding of FMBP-1 with poly(dA&#x02013;dT) was consistent with the recognition sequence of FMBP-1 as ATNTWTNTA. FMBP-1 binding sites of the fibroin gene and poly(dA&#x02013;dT) contain the FMBP-1-recognizing sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Thus, poly(dA&#x02013;dT) was used for DNA affinity chromatography of FMBP-1, and a 32 kDa protein was purified. Though two bands of &#x0223c;32 kDa were detected in a preliminary purification, only one major band was recovered in the large-scale purification. Western blotting detected the band at &#x0223c;32 kDa, and so FMBP-1 was probably modified or decomposed by proteolysis during the first purification.</p><p>The predicted molecular mass encoded by the cDNAs for FMBP-1 was &#x0223c;25 kDa, but recombinant protein produced from the cDNA showed the same DNA-binding specificity as that of native FMBP-1 in crude PSG extracts. An antibody against the recombinant protein reacted with protein bands, including 32 kDa band in western blotting. These proteins might be produced by differential splicing of mRNA and/or modification of the protein; however, the 32 kDa protein alone was purified with DNA affinity chromatography.</p><p>FMBP-1 possesses an acidic region similar to a region in the plant proteins RAV1 and RAV2, and a basic region including a unique repeated structure. Acidic regions often function as activation domains in transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). On the N-terminal side of the basic region, at about the center of FMBP-1, there is a span that is especially rich in basic amino acids. Such hyper-basic regions can function as nuclear localization signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). The N-terminal region of FMBP-1 did not show any significant homology to other animal proteins, but we found that the region has a weak similarity to the AP2 domain observed in several transcription factors of higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The AP2 domain is thought to be a part of the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factors, APETALA2, EREBPs, and RAV1 and RAV2. APETALA2 is a factor involved in the regulation of flower development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), and EREBPs are known to be involved in the regulation of ethylene response genes in tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The function of RAVs has not yet been elucidated, but these proteins are partly homologous to factors ABI3 and VP1, which control the expression of abscisic acid-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Though the significance of this weak similarity between FMBP-1 and the plant transcription factors is unclear at present, the possibility exists that some of the chemical components in plants ingested by insects regulate the expression of insect genes. FMBP-1 might be involved in such a process.</p><p>Genes encoding homologous repeats, such as the STPR of FMBP-1, have been found in humans, mouse, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C.elegans</italic>, but the functions of these genes have not been reported. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are two genes encoding STPR. One of the <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mouse and human genes contain a tetrad of the STP, as does FMBP-1. However, in the other <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene, the STP is repeated six times at the N-terminus and three times at the C-terminus. Furthermore, the unit is repeated seven times in the gene of <italic>C.elegans</italic>. STP is likely conserved as a basal motif constructing a larger protein domain. The homology of the 23 amino acids is greater between each unit of the same protein than between STPR proteins of different species. Functional and evolutionary pressures may select to maintain each unit of STPRs of the same protein.</p><p>We prepared a series of deletion constructs of FMBP-1 as GST-fusion proteins and examined the DNA-binding activity of these mutants. The STPR domain alone showed sufficient DNA-binding activity, whereas the proteins lacking the STPR domain lost almost all binding activity. Accordingly, the unique structure of FMBP-1, STPR, is a novel DNA-binding domain conserved in animals. Though the N-terminal region has similarity to the DNA-binding domain of transcription factors in higher plants, DNA-binding activity by the specific probe for FMBP-1 was never observed. However, the N-terminal region (amino acid 51&#x02013;95) stimulated the DNA-binding activity of STPR. This effect was remarkable when the C-terminal end of FMBP-1 beyond the STPR domain was present (del. 3 versus the entire protein and del. 13 versus del. 7). The C-terminal region seems to prevent the binding activity of the STPR domain, and the N-terminal region seems to release the effect of the C-terminal region. The physical and functional interaction between these two regions surrounding the STPR should be elucidated.</p><p>In the transcription regulatory elements of the fibroin gene, there are multi-elements that bind BmFkh, POU-M1 and SGF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The binding sites of FMBP-1 overlap with the sites of those transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The coordination of FMBP-1 with these factors possibly raises its specificity as well as that of the fibroin gene. Besides the fibroin gene, sequences corresponding to ATNTWTNTA are observed in the promoter-proximal regions of other PSG specific genes, such as in the &#x02212;33 and &#x02212;55 regions of the fibroin light chain gene and &#x02212;70 of the fibrohexamerin gene. Whereas the corresponding sequence was not observed in such promoter-proximal regions in the MSG-specific sericin-1 and &#x02212;2 genes.</p><p>The DNA-binding activity of FMBP-1 was clearly detectable at 2 h, peaked at 6&#x02013;12 h after the fourth ecdysis, and then decreased gradually. Northern blot analyses showed that the expression of the FMBP-1 gene continued during the fourth instar and increased up to 6 h after the fourth ecdysis, and then decreased gradually. The decrease in FMBP-1 mRNA is consistent with the decrease in FMBP-1 activity from 12 h after the fourth ecdysis. This time point also coincides with when the expression of the fibroin gene reached its highest level, although the level is maintained during the fifth instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). On the other hand, the continuous expression of the FMBP-1 gene during the fourth ecdysis was inconsistent with the absence of FMBP-1 activity. mRNA for FMBP-1 was also present in MSG in similar amounts and with the same sizes as the mRNA from PSG. We examined the FMBP-1 activity of four different batches of MSG extracts in an EMSA. In these extracts, the FMBP-1 activity (judged by the mobility on the EMSA) was detectable, but the activity per unit protein was consistently very low compared with the activity in PSG extracts, although the activity in PSG extracts varied from batch to batch, probably reflecting the delicate differences of larval developmental stages (data not shown). Taken together, the DNA-binding activity of FMBP-1 seems to be regulated through post-transcriptional and/or post-translational modification as well as transcription. In this regard, it is of interest that the change in the amount of the 28 kDa band complemented that in the amount of 32 kDa FMBP-1 band, and that the antibody against FMBP-1 detected some other bands commonly found in PSG and MSG.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs Bando and Sahara of the Laboratory of Applied Molecular Entomology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University for supplying the silkworms.
