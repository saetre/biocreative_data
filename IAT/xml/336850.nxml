The 5,677 nucleotide genome contains five large open reading frames (ORFs). The genes for the coat protein (1) and the putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were identified. The latter shows a striking degree of similarity to that of carnation mottle virus (CarMV). By comparison with corona- and retrovirus RNAs, it is proposed that a translational frameshift is involved in expression of the polymerase. An ORF encoding an Mr 49,797 protein (50K ORF) may be translated by in-frame readthrough of the coat protein stop codon. The coat protein, an overlapping 17K ORF, and a 3'6.7K ORF are likely to be expressed via subgenomic mRNAs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0388.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6097"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0389.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6098"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0390.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6099"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0391.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6100"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0392.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6101"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0393.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6102"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0394.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6103"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0395.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6104"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0396.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6105"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0397.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6106"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0398.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6107"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0399.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6108"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0400.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6109"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0401.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6110"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00156-0402.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6111"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
