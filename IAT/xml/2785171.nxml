Human &#x003b3;D-crystallin (H&#x003b3;D-Crys) is a monomeric, two-domain protein of the lens central nucleus. Both domains of this long lived protein have double Greek key &#x003b2;-sheet folds with well packed hydrophobic cores. Three mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions in the &#x003b3;-crystallin buried cores (two in the N-terminal domain (N-td) and one in the C-terminal domain (C-td)) cause early onset cataract in mice, presumably an aggregated state of the mutant crystallins.

WT H&#x003b3;D-Crys unfolds <italic>in vitro</italic> through a three-state pathway, exhibiting an intermediate with the N-td unfolded and the C-td native-like. L5S and V75D in the N-td also displayed three-state unfolding transitions, with the first transition, unfolding of the N-td, shifted to significantly lower denaturant concentrations. I90F destabilized the C-td, shifting the overall unfolding transition to lower denaturant concentrations. During thermal denaturation, the mutant proteins exhibited lowered thermal stability compared with WT. Kinetic unfolding experiments showed that the N-tds of L5S and V75D unfolded faster than WT. I90F was globally destabilized and unfolded more rapidly. These results support models of cataract formation in which generation of partially unfolded species are precursors to the aggregated cataractous states responsible for light scattering.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">GM17980</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">EY015834</award-id><award-id rid="CS100">GM68762</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human lens is a tissue composed of onion-like layers of fiber cells. The lens core, or nucleus, is formed <italic>in utero</italic> and is composed of primary fiber cells. These cells are enucleated and devoid of all organelles, presumably to assist in maintaining transparency to visible light. During an individual's lifetime, lens epithelial cells, found in a single layer on the anterior portion of the lens, differentiate to become secondary fiber cells that surround the lens nucleus in layers, thus forming the lens outer cortex. Secondary fiber cells maintain their organelles and some level of protein synthesis and turnover.</p><p>The primary fiber cells of the lens have no protein synthesis or turnover. Thus, proteins translated <italic>in utero</italic> must maintain their native structure and remain soluble throughout the lifetime of the individual. The &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;-crystallins together account for 90% of lens proteins, present in concentrations of up to 450 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). &#x003b1;-Crystallin provides both structural and chaperone functions in the lens, whereas the &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-crystallins appear to function solely as structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The continuous exposure of these proteins to environmental stresses, such as UV light and oxidizing agents, leads to the build-up of covalent damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This can result in loss of native conformation and the generation of partially unfolded species that participate in aberrant protein-protein interactions. The resulting protein aggregation is likely to be a major pathway to cataract.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, cataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Age-related cataract affects at least 50% of people in the United States over age 80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Comparison of age-related cataractons lenses with normal lenses identifies some significant differences between the two. The most obvious difference is the increase in accumulation of high molecular weight aggregates. Proteins isolated from cataractous lenses were found to be highly oxidized at cysteine and methionine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Additional covalent modifications have been identified in aged lenses in general, including truncations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), deamidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), glycation of lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and oxidation of tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). It is unclear whether these modifications, particularly the extensive oxidation, initiate the aggregation process or whether they are later effects, due to the trapping of partially unfolded species in the aggregate that are susceptible to damage. It is very plausible that accumulation of these various modifications destabilize lens crystallins, leading to their partial unfolding and exposure of hydrophobic core regions. Intermolecular interactions between these exposed regions could lead to aggregate formation, for example through a domain-swapping mechanism.</p><p>Since primary lens fiber cells lack nuclei and are terminally differentiated, they have not been propagated in tissue culture. In addition, studies of the initiation and growth of cataract within the intact lens have been very limited. As a result, it has not been possible to directly identify the state of crystallin precursors to cataract within lens fiber cells or the intact lens. We have attempted to circumvent this by examining the effects of mutations that cause cataracts in mice on the properties of human crystallin proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Human &#x003b3;D-crystallin (H&#x003b3;D-Crys)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> is a monomeric, two-domain protein whose structure has been determined at 1.25 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), revealing two structurally homologous domains, each consisting of intercalated double Greek key motifs. H&#x003b3;D-Crys is one of the most abundant &#x003b3;-crystallins found in the lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). It is primarily located in the central lens nucleus, the oldest region of the lens, and is therefore one of the longest lived proteins in that tissue as well as the entire human body. The two domains of H&#x003b3;D-Crys are connected by a short linker and interact through a set of hydrophobic interdomain contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Systematic studies of the unfolding and refolding of H&#x003b3;D-Crys have identified a partially folded intermediate with the N-terminal domain (N-td) unfolded and the C-terminal domain (C-td) folded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Rare mutations associated with juvenile onset cataracts have been identified in the human &#x003b3;-crystallin genes. Those identified in H&#x003b3;D-Crys primarily affect charged surface residues, including R14C, R36S, R58H, and E107A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>); the non-surface mutation P23T has also been identified in families with inherited cataract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Truncations of human &#x003b3;-crystallins also result in inherited, early onset cataract in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Previous studies with surface residue mutations have revealed that thiol-induced aggregation occurs in the case of R14C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), whereas drastic decreases in solubility lead to crystallization of R36S and R58H mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The P23T protein had reduced solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), although the thermodynamic stability was not affected, and structural studies at the atomic level revealed the altered conformation of an adjacent histidine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The human &#x003b3;C-crystallin T5P and R168W mutant proteins and human &#x003b3;S-crystallin G18V are three more amino acid substitutions affecting &#x003b3;-crystallins that are associated with cataract formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>The crystallins are characterized by two classes of hydrophobic buried cores: the predominantly hydrophobic side chains within the &#x003b2;-sheets of the Greek Key motifs and the buried residues at the interface of the duplicated domains. Substitution of any of the six residues forming the hydrophobic domain interface of H&#x003b3;D-Crys resulted in a sharp destabilization of the native state and increased population of a partially folded intermediate with an unfolded N-td and folded C-td (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Human families carrying mutations at sites in the tightly packed hydrophobic core of these proteins have not yet been reported. However, hydrophobic core mutations have been identified in murine crystallin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Murine &#x003b3;D-crystallin and H&#x003b3;D-Crys are closely related proteins of the same length with 83% sequence identity and 91% sequence similarity. Murine &#x003b3;S-crystallin (M&#x003b3;S-Crys) is more distantly related to H&#x003b3;D-Crys, because the vertebrate &#x003b3;S-crystallin lineage is believed to have diverged from other &#x003b3;-crystallins earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Even considering this more distant relationship, M&#x003b3;S-Crys and H&#x003b3;D-Crys share 50% sequence identity and 70% sequence similarity.</p><p>Integrity of the hydrophobic core is generally vital for maintenance of a protein's tertiary structure. Studies on the N-terminal domain of the &#x003bb; repressor showed that a wide range of amino acid substitutions in the protein core altered both structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). In particular, substitution of hydrophobic core residues with polar or charged residues resulted in large thermodynamic destabilizations <italic>in vitro</italic>. Dramatic decreases in biological activity were also observed, indicating that the structure was perturbed <italic>in vivo</italic> as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). In the case of SNase, the introduction of buried charges in the hydrophobic core was less disruptive due to local conformational changes that helped to stabilize the charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). A complete set of alanine substitutions in the P22 Arc repressor protein identified many destabilizing mutations. Five key residues, when substituted, resulted in polypeptide chains that did not appear to fold or adopt the native dimeric structure of the Arc repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Four of these five residues have hydrophobic side chains. In the 13-rung, parallel &#x003b2;-helix P22 tailspike adhesin, substitution with alanine of each of 140 residues in the elongated buried core resulted in folding defects for more than 100 of the mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).</p><p>The importance of the hydrophobic core has also been illustrated in the opposite sense, by stabilizing proteins through the introduction of hydrophobic residues. The concurrent substitution of three charged residues (Arg<sup>31</sup>, Glu<sup>36</sup>, and Arg<sup>40</sup>) with the hydrophobic residues Met<sup>31</sup>, Tyr<sup>36</sup>, and Leu<sup>40</sup> (MYL) in the Arc repressor resulted in a mutant protein that refolded with an apparent rate constant &#x0223c;150-fold faster than the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Investigations on the hydrophobic core of T4 lysozyme found that compensatory &#x0201c;size switch&#x0201d; mutations destabilized the protein to a lesser extent than expected for additive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). X-ray crystal structures of these mutants showed that the surrounding residues shifted to some extent to help accommodate the altered side chains. Hydrophobic protein cores appear to be quite sensitive to substitutions, and maintenance of ideal packing and geometries contribute greatly to protein stability.</p><p>The three amino acid substitutions, F9S in M&#x003b3;S-Crys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) and V76D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and I90F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) in murine &#x003b3;D-crystallin, are associated with congenital or early onset cataract in mice. Sinha <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) previously identified the F9S substitution in M&#x003b3;S-Crys as causative for the murine <italic>Opj</italic> cataract phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Opacities, which increased in severity over time, were observed in the lenses of both <italic>Opj</italic>/+ and <italic>Opj/Opj</italic> mice, although the phenotypes of the homozygotes were more severe. As a function of temperature <italic>in vitro</italic>, the F9S mutant displayed a loss of secondary structure and increased propensity for aggregation, both at lower temperatures than wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) found that lenses from mice homozygous for the V76D mutant allele contained intranuclear &#x003b3;-crystallin protein aggregates and that the water-soluble &#x003b3;-crystallin fraction of lens proteins was diminished. In transfection studies, the V76D mutant protein aggregated in both the nuclei and cytosol of cultured lens epithelial cells.</p><p>To further explore the effects of mutations to residues found in the hydrophobic core of H&#x003b3;D-Crys, we prepared a set of three H&#x003b3;D-Crys proteins carrying the murine amino acid replacements. All proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified to study their overall conformation and thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities. Their significant destabilization highlights the importance of the tightly packed hydrophobic core of the &#x003b3;-crystallins and sheds light on the possible mechanisms of congenital cataract formation associated with these mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant H&#x003b3;D-Crys</title><p>Constructs containing each of the three mutations, L5S, V75D, and I90F, were made by site-directed mutagenesis.

(Numbering of residues is based on that of the wild-type H&#x003b3;D crystal structure, Protein Data Bank code <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1HK0">1HK0</ext-link>.) The residues Val<sup>75</sup> and Ile<sup>90</sup> are conserved and occur at identical positions in mouse and human &#x003b3;D-crystallins. The mutant alleles encoding V75D and I90F were constructed by site-specific mutagenesis of the human cDNA sequence cloned into the vector pQE1. The third mutation, encoding L5S, was constructed in a manner similar to that of the above mentioned mutations; however, this amino acid substitution was based on the cataract-associated F9S mutation in M&#x003b3;S-Crys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). M&#x003b3;S-Crys has a four-residue N-terminal extension not found in mouse or human &#x003b3;D-crystallins. The homologous position in H&#x003b3;D-Crys to M&#x003b3;S-Crys F9S, based on protein sequence alignment, is Leu<sup>5</sup>; thus, the nucleotides corresponding to this residue were changed to mimic this third mutation. Although this mutation is based on one described in M&#x003b3;S-Crys, this region in the first &#x003b2;-strand of the first Greek key motif appears to be important in other crystallins as well. The T5P substitution in &#x003b3;C-crystallin resulted in congenital cataract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have found that the mutant protein had an altered conformation and lowered thermal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>).</p><p>All proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> with N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tags.

H&#x003b3;D-Crys has four buried tryptophan residues, arranged symmetrically between the two domains. It also contains 14 tyrosine residues, and an excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used to selectively excite the tryptophans. Trp fluorescence is strongly quenched in the native state of H&#x003b3;D-Crys compared with the unfolded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Therefore, Trp fluorescence can be used as a sensitive indicator of tertiary structure for this protein. For the quenching to be maintained in mutant proteins, the tertiary structure of the native state cannot be greatly altered from that of WT. Otherwise, loss of quenching would be expected, due to the change in geometries of both the backbone and water molecules.</p><p>In agreement with previous experiments, native wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys had an emission maximum at about 326 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). H&#x003b3;D-Crys unfolded in 5.5 <sc>m</sc> GdnHCl had a shifted emission maximum at 350 nm, which increased in intensity due to the loss of fluorescence quenching and energy transfer that is present in the native state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Native L5S and I90F proteins both had fluorescence maxima at about 326 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The peak fluorescence intensity of the native L5S protein was about 10% less than that of wild type, whereas that of I90F was very similar.

These differences could be due to slight variations in solution conditions, or they may have been caused by slight structural perturbations around the Trp side chains. Quenching of native state Trp fluorescence was observed for all mutants, further indicating that their structure was similar to that of WT.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Fluorescence spectra of native wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys (<italic>solid black line</italic>) and mutant proteins L5S (<italic>dashed line</italic>), V75D (<italic>dotted dashed line</italic>), and I90F (<italic>dotted line</italic>).</bold> Normalized tryptophan fluorescence spectra of native wild-type protein and mutants is shown with fluorescence spectra of unfolded wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys (+) for comparison.

Tryptophan fluorescence was used to probe the conformation of proteins, and changes in fluorescence intensities at 360 and 320 nm were used for data analysis.

These values are very similar to those calculated for wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys. Thus, it appears that this substitution does not affect the stability of the C-td. Like the wild-type protein, L5S appeared to aggregate upon refolding into buffer as evidenced by the increase in fluorescence due to scattering from these refolding samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Unlike WT, this mutant protein was too destabilized to refold to a native-like conformation over the range of conditions present in these experiments.</p><p>The V75D substitution is located in the loop region between the fifth and sixth &#x003b2;-strands of the protein's N-td.

This suggests that there is not a significantly populated intermediate in this transition. In agreement with this, the transition regions of the unfolding/refolding curves were clearly steeper than either transition region for the wild type, L5S, and V75D proteins.

In contrast, the thermal unfolding of the L5S and I90F proteins were best fit by three-state models.

The temperature and pH were maintained as for the wild-type protein. The kinetic unfolding transitions for the two mutant crystallins L5S and V75D were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). They both exhibited an extremely rapid increase in fluorescence, which then reached a plateau over the course of 3 h. This plateau did not correspond to the fully unfolded protein but to &#x0223c;40% of the chain existing in the unfolded state. The final fluorescence emission spectra of the unfolding samples were similar to the spectra for partially unfolded samples in equilibrium unfolding experiments (data not shown). This was consistent with the previous observation that neither wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys nor its isolated C-td unfolded completely in 3.5 <sc>m</sc> GdnHCl, pH 7.0, at 18 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Therefore, the rapid initial increases in fluorescence observed for both proteins most likely corresponded to the unfolding of the highly destabilized N-td, whereas the C-td remained folded. The observed unfolding transitions for L5S and V75D were fit by single exponentials, with <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> values of 2.5 and 2.0 s, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). In contrast, the mutant protein I90F unfolded completely under the same denaturant and temperature conditions utilized for the N-td mutants. The kinetic unfolding transition exhibited a rather rapid, steady rise in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This transition was best fit by a single exponential with a <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> value of 338 s (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).

The C-td mutant protein, I90F, did not appear to populate such an intermediate in the experiments described here.

Wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys incubated under the same sets of conditions was only observed to aggregate when diluted out of 4 <sc>m</sc> GdnHCl, conditions under which the protein is fully unfolded.

The aggregate was visible by eye, and the protein solution appeared cloudy. This was the only sample among all proteins and denaturant concentrations for which this was observed. Because an obvious folding intermediate was not detectable by other methods, it is difficult to speculate on the mechanism of aggregation. When diluted 20-fold, the aggregates remained intact, and significant scatter was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The level of scatter remained constant over the entire length of the experiment; there was no initial increase as observed for the fully unfolded samples that were diluted to induce aggregation.

Thus, direct evidence linking the aggregation reactions documented <italic>in vitro</italic> with cataract formation <italic>in situ</italic> has been lacking. We have attempted to bridge this gap by characterizing the effects of mouse crystallin cataract-causing mutations on human lens crystallins.</p><p>For a number of protein aggregation diseases, partially unfolded chains are thought to be the precursors in the aggregation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). The &#x003b3;-crystallins appear to have an extremely rigid three-dimensional structure with tight side chain packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). The three cataract-associated mutations were chosen to investigate the effects of mutation on the tightly packed hydrophobic core of H&#x003b3;D-Crys. All three mutations investigated dramatically destabilized H&#x003b3;D-Crys in equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments. Overall &#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sup>0</sup> values were decreased by 4.6 and 5.0 kcal/mol for L5S and V75D mutant crystallins, respectively. For I90F, the &#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sup>0</sup> value decreased by 7.2 kcal/mol in comparison with wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys. The site of the substitution was directly related to the domain destabilization. For the two N-td mutants, L5S and V75D, only the stability of the N-td was affected, in that its unfolding transition midpoint was lowered. The C-td unfolding transition midpoint was not affected in either case. For the I90F substitution, which is found in the C-td, a steep two-state transition was observed with no discernible intermediates. This indicates that both domains are destabilized and the entire protein is globally unfolding without significantly populated intermediates. Previous work showed that H&#x003b3;D-Crys folds through a three-state pathway with the C-td folding first, followed by the N-td (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Destabilization of the C-td may result in global protein destabilization because the domain interface, which is known to play a role in H&#x003b3;D-Crys stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), may not be in its native conformation.</p><p>Wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys is resistant to thermal denaturation; its melting temperature is &#x0223c;83 &#x000b0;C. The three amino acid replacements lowered the melting temperatures, and the melting curves for all mutant proteins indicated a population of partially unfolded intermediates. However, because these data are based on CD measurements of overall secondary structure, decreases in melting temperature and appearance of possible intermediates cannot be attributed to specific regions of the protein's three-dimensional structure. This is in contrast to the tryptophan fluorescence unfolding data, which reports on the regions of the protein surrounding the buried tryptophans.</p><p>In kinetic experiments, all three mutant proteins unfolded faster than wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys. Previously, it was shown that wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys requires 1 h in 5.5 <sc>m</sc> GdnHCl at 37 &#x000b0;C to unfold completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Under these conditions, all three mutant proteins unfolded within the dead time of the experiment (&#x0223c;1 s). Experimental conditions were altered to 3.5 <sc>m</sc> GdnHCl and 18 &#x000b0;C to slow unfolding and enable observation of the unfolding transition(s) by changes in tryptophan fluorescence. Under these altered conditions, the wild-type protein will not fully unfold. This fact alone attests to the dramatic destabilizing effects of these substitutions on H&#x003b3;D-Crys.</p><p>Similar to the results of the equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments, the location of the mutation corresponded with the observed kinetic destabilization. For both N-td substitutions L5S and V75D, the single kinetic transition observed for each mutant protein most likely corresponded to the unfolding of the N-td. Our results further support the observation that mutations in the N-td, even at different locations within the domain, appear to solely affect that domain's stability. Mills-Henry and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>) found that the extrapolated <italic>in vitro</italic> unfolding half-time of wild-type H&#x003b3;D-Crys in the absence of denaturant was &#x0223c;19 years. This number is probably greatly reduced for all of the mutants investigated here. A hysteresis was observed in previous equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments, particularly for the unfolding of the N-td of full-length H&#x003b3;D-Crys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). It was concluded that the domain interface contributed substantially to the kinetic stability of the protein. The large destabilization of the N-td for both the L5S and V75D proteins disrupts the interactions at the domain interface, and this may contribute to an overall destabilization of the protein. Further kinetic analysis could address this issue.</p><p>In contrast, the C-td mutant I90F completely unfolded through a single observable kinetic transition, most likely the simultaneous unfolding of both domains. In agreement with equilibrium data, the disruption of the C-td by I90F resulted in destabilization of the entire protein. The N-td cannot remain folded if the C-td is unfolded in the full-length protein. However, Mills <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the isolated N-terminal domains of H&#x003b3;D-Crys and human &#x003b3;S-crystallin fold into distinct structures that exhibit the fluorescence quenching characteristic of the &#x003b3;-crystallins and tryptophan fluorescence spectra similar to the full-length proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). Therefore, the N-td of H&#x003b3;D-Crys in isolation is capable of folding. Nonetheless, in the context of the full-length protein, the C-td must be fully folded with its domain interface contacts available for proper folding of the N-td. The simplest model to explain these data is that the interface formed by the C-td is used as a template for folding of the N-td.</p><p>The effects of these mutations on the kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities of H&#x003b3;D-Crys are in line with studies of other proteins, as described in the Introduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44 B45">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The introduction of a charged side chain into the protein core with the V75D substitution was extremely destabilizing, and a slight increase in native state fluorescence measurements indicates possible local perturbations in structure, particularly around the Trp residues in the N-td. The L5S substitution also introduces a polar residue into the core and most likely creates a cavity due to the introduction of a much smaller side chain. This could be very destabilizing due to the loss of favorable van der Waals interactions. Filling of cavities in the hydrophobic protein core has been shown to be stabilizing in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). The experimental results presented here for L5S support and complement the work previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). The destabilization resulting from the substitution of phenylalanine for isoleucine at position 90 is probably due to the introduction of a large bulky aromatic residue. Although this substitution retains the hydrophobic nature of the side chain, the increase in volume may introduce strain or disrupt other favorable interactions that are stabilizing the protein structure.</p><p>In contrast to the surface substitutions linked to congenital and early onset cataract, the effect of these mutations is destabilization of the native state of H&#x003b3;D-Crys. The mutant proteins also unfolded significantly faster under less denaturing conditions than wild type. This implies that their unfolding half-life in non-denaturing conditions may also be significantly shortened. Lens proteins are synthesized early in life, and there is no protein turnover after birth in the central, innermost regions of the lens. The accumulation in the lens of partially or fully unfolded crystallins at extremely high concentrations may saturate the finite &#x003b1;-crystallin population, which is the only mechanism present in the lens nucleus for binding and sequestering partially unfolded or misfolded proteins.</p><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Aggregation of H&#x003b3;D-Crys Requires Partial Unfolding of C-terminal Domain</title><p>For proteins with duplicated domains, the simplest pathway to polymerization would be a domain swap mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). This type of interaction is naturally occurring for &#x003b2;B2-crystallin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>), whose crystal structure was found to be a dimer. Aggregation by a domain swap mechanism has not yet been observed for the crystallins but has been documented for cystatin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). Models of aggregation by domain swapping have been hypothesized for the human prion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>) and &#x003b2;2-microglobulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>) based on a wide range of structural analysis.</p><p>Contrary to the simplest form of the domain swap hypothesis, the partially folded intermediates investigated here did not form aggregates under these experimental conditions. For all proteins, both wild-type and mutant, it seems that at least partial unfolding of the C-td was necessary for aggregation to occur. This hints at a possible &#x003b2;-strand insertion mechanism of aggregation, where at least one &#x003b2;-strand from one molecule of H&#x003b3;D-Crys is inserted into the domain of a second molecule. This may be somewhat similar to the &#x003b2;-sheet expansion modeled for serpin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). (Yamasaki <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>) refer to this mechanism of polymerization as domain swapping. For our discussion of the crystallins, we have used &#x0201c;domain swapping&#x0201d; to refer to the exchange of the entire N-terminal or C-terminal domains.) The aggregation of the mutant protein I90F even at intermediate GdnHCl concentrations emphasizes the strength of the intermolecular interactions occurring in these polymeric species.</p><p>The cloudiness and precipitation observed for this sample was most likely not a result of phase separation. Pande <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) showed that phase separation occurs for the inherited cataract mutant P23T H&#x003b3;D-Crys. P23T separated into two phases, one consisting of monomers and the other consisting of clusters of protein that precipitated out of solution. It was demonstrated that this phase change occurred without changes in protein structure and furthermore shown that this mutant does not have altered thermal stability compared with WT. In contrast, I90F had decreased stability, and the observed aggregation only occurred when the protein was subjected to partially denaturing conditions. The protein remained soluble under native conditions.</p><p>Both bovine and human &#x003b3;-crystallins have been shown to form amyloid fibrils under partially denaturing, acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>). Fibrillar structures have been observed by thin section transmission electron microscopy in both the <italic>Opj/Opj</italic> mouse lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and the OXYS rat lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>), from a strain that generates excessive reactive oxygen species. Although the <italic>Opj</italic> and OXYS phenotypes lead to cataract, they may affect lens development as well as lens opacity and function. Due to the high &#x003b2;-sheet content of the &#x003b3;-crystallins, there may be underlying similarities between their mechanisms of amyloid formation and the aggregation pathways observed in both our and the aforementioned studies. The molecular basis of &#x003b3;-crystallin aggregation is an area that warrants further investigation. The correlation between the cataract phenotype of the single amino acid substitutions in the mouse crystallins and the <italic>in vitro</italic> thermodynamic and kinetic destabilization of the purified human mutant proteins supports models of cataract formation following from protein conformational change and aggregation.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grants GM17980 and EY015834 (to J.
