Phosphoinositide-dependent serine-threonine protein kinase Akt is one of the key players in the signaling of potent bone anabolic factors. This study initially showed that the disruption of Akt1, a major Akt in osteoblasts and osteoclasts, in mice led to low-turnover osteopenia through dysfunctions of both cells. Ex vivo cell culture analyses revealed that the osteoblast dysfunction was traced to the increased susceptibility to the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and the decreased transcriptional activity of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Notably, our findings revealed a novel role of Akt1/forkhead box class O (FoxO) 3a/Bim axis in the apoptosis of osteoblasts: Akt1 phosphorylates the transcription factor FoxO3a to prevent its nuclear localization, leading to impaired transactivation of its target gene Bim which was also shown to be a potent proapoptotic molecule in osteoblasts. The osteoclast dysfunction was attributed to the cell autonomous defects of differentiation and survival in osteoclasts and the decreased expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL), a major determinant of osteoclastogenesis, in osteoblasts. Akt1 was established as a crucial regulator of osteoblasts and osteoclasts by promoting their differentiation and survival to maintain bone mass and turnover. The molecular network found in this study will provide a basis for rational therapeutic targets for bone disorders.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone is continually remodeled according to physiological circumstances through bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts, and bone mass and turnover are maintained by their coordinated balance in healthy adults.

We first confirmed that both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Akt proteins were considerably decreased in cultured Akt1-/- osteoblasts without compensatory increase of Akt2 protein, indicating a substantial suppression of the total Akt signaling by depletion of an isoform Akt1 in osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001058-g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

However, this is dependent on post-transcriptional regulation by ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of Bim mediated by ERK pathway, but not on transcriptional regulation as seen in the case of osteoblast apoptosis. In addition, Bim in osteoclasts stimulates not only the apoptosis, but also the bone resorptive activity. If Bim is enhanced in Akt1-/- osteoclasts just as in the osteoblasts, the bone resorption parameters like eroded surface are assumed to increase. Hence, the mechanism by which Akt1 suppresses apoptosis in osteoclasts is likely to be different from that in osteoblasts.

Apoptotic osteoblasts were detected by TUNEL method using an ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon) on paraffin-embedded sections of neonate mice. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated by dividing the number of TUNEL-positive cells by the number of counted cells. A total of at least 400 osteoblasts were counted in each section, and five to seven sections per group were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Osteoblastic cell cultures and assays</title><p>For osteoblast cultures, calvariae of neonatal mice were digested by 0.1&#x00025; collagenase and 0.2&#x00025; dispase 5 times, and cells isolated by the last 3 digestions were combined and cultured in &#x003b1;-minimal essential medium (&#x003b1;-MEM) containing 10&#x00025; FBS. Mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in the same way. Immature mesenchymal C2C12 cells and C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS. Cell proliferation was determined using a BrdU Labeling and Detection Kit III (Roche Diagnostics). After 24 h culture in the presence and absence of insulin (100 nM), IGF-I (10 nM), or FGF-2 (1 nM), the cells were labeled with BrdU for an additional 4 h, and BrdU uptake was detected following the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the osteoblast apoptosis, the culture medium was changed to a serum-free one with and without insulin or IGF-I, and total RNA or protein was collected after designated times for subsequent assays. Cell survival was determined by counting viable cell numbers using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies). Apoptotic osteoblasts were further detected by TUNEL staining as described above. Caspase-3 activity was measured via colorimetric detection of the cleavage of caspase-specific substrates using an APOPCYTO Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay Kit (MBL International Co.). For ALP activity measurement, primary osteoblasts were inoculated at a density of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in a 24-multiwell plate and cultured in &#x003b1;-MEM containing 10&#x00025; FBS and 50 &#x000b5;g/ml ascorbic acid. After 14 d of culture in the presence and absence of insulin (100 nM), IGF-I (10 nM), or BMP-2 (30 ng/ml), cells were sonicated in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5&#x00025; Triton X-100. ALP activity in the lysate was measured using an ALP Kit (Wako Pure Chemical). Protein concentrations of cell lysates were measured with a Protein Assay Kit II (BIO-RAD). For ALP staining, cells were fixed in 70&#x00025; ethanol and stained for 10 min with a solution containing 0.01&#x00025; naphthol AS-MX phosphate, 1&#x00025; <italic>N,N</italic>-dimethyl formamide, and 0.06&#x00025; fast blue BB (Sigma-Aldrich). For Alizarin red S and von Kossa staining, osteoblasts were inoculated at a density of 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 12-multiwell plate in &#x003b1;-MEM containing 10&#x00025; FBS and 50 &#x000b5;g/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mM &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich). On day 21 after confluency, cultured cells were fixed in 10&#x00025; buffered formalin and stained for 10 min with 2&#x00025; Alizarin red S (pH 4.0) (Sigma-Aldrich). For von Kossa staining, cells were fixed with 100&#x00025; ethanol at room temperature for 15 min, stained with 5&#x00025; silver nitrate solution under ultraviolet light for 10 min, and incubated for 5 min with 5&#x00025; sodium thiosulfate solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Assays for osteoclastic cells</title><p>To study the role of Akt1 intrinsic to osteoclastic cells, we used a coculture of osteoblasts and bone marrow cells and the M-CSF-dependent BMM culture system as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001058-Akune1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

After 6 d, cells positively stained for TRAP containing more than three nuclei were counted as osteoclasts. In the M-CSF-dependent BMM culture system, bone marrow cells from WT or Akt1-/- mice were seeded at a density of 3&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 24-multiwell plate and cultured in &#x003b1;-MEM containing 10&#x00025; FBS with M-CSF (R&#x00026;D Systems, 100 ng/ml) for 3 d. To generate mature osteoclasts, adherent cells (BMM) were further cultured with M-CSF (10 ng/ml) and soluble RANKL (Wako Pure Chemical, 100 ng/ml) for 3 additional days, then the number of TRAP-positive osteoclasts was counted. To determine the survival, the mature osteoclasts were deprived of M-CSF/soluble RANKL and cultured for an additional 48 h. After 8, 24, and 48 h, the number of TRAP-positive and trypan blue-negative osteoclasts was counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Real-time quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted with ISOGEN (Wako Pure Chemical), and an aliquot (1 &#x000b5;g) was reverse-transcribed using a PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara Bio) to make single-stranded cDNA.
