The nature of the antibody-producing cell influences the duration of the antibody response as well as the affinity and isotype of the antibody that is made, all of which constitute important parameters of protective immunity. The phenotype of the autoreactive B cell producing the autoantibody in patients with autoimmune disease may also influence both the pathogenicity of the autoantibody and the response to therapy. Antibody responses that include a memory cell compartment may be important in protective immunity, but as autoantibody responses they may be more difficult to eradicate. Thus, understanding the conditions that lead to the generation of either short-lived plasma cells or long-lived plasma cells and memory cells may be of considerable clinical importance.</p><p>We have previously described a model of antigen-induced autoimmunity in which we can examine the inductive phase of the autoreactive humoral response. BALB/c mice immunized with a peptide mimotope of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) will develop antibodies that are cross-reactive with dsDNA and peptide. These antibodies deposit in renal glomeruli and cause proteinuria. Because there is minimal cellular infiltrate in the kidney, probably because of a lack of renal vulnerability to antibody-mediated disease in this strain, the model is one of nephrotic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). The autoantibody response in these mice is T cell&#x02013;dependent, with antigen-specific T cells producing Th1 cytokines on antigen challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p><p>Our understanding of the immunological function of &#x003b3; chain&#x02013;associated FcRs has been facilitated by studies from Takai et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) on FcR-associated &#x003b3; chain&#x02013;null mice (Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>). The Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have a selective defect in the expression of FcRs on the cell surface as well as in the FcR-mediated signal cascade. Interestingly, disruption of the FcR &#x003b3; chain in NZB/NZW mice uncouples immune complex formation from the inflammatory response in the kidney, implying a pathogenic role of FcR &#x003b3; chain in autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>There are several factors involved in determining the phenotype of antigen-experienced B cells, including BCR signal strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), expression of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), and costimulatory influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In the course of studying renal pathology in peptide-immunized mice deficient in the FcR &#x003b3; chain (Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), we made the surprising observation that Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice preferentially develop short-lived plasma cells and fail to develop a germinal center response. We show that this altered B cell response is a consequence of increased IL-12 production by DCs.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice display a distinct humoral response to antigen</title><p>Immunization of BALB/c mice with a peptide mimotope of dsDNA, DWEYSVWLSN, octamerized on a polylysine backbone (multiple antigenic peptide [MAP] peptide) induces antibodies that cross-react with peptide and dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). We immunized Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT mice i.p. with MAP peptide in CFA and boosted with antigen in IFA on days 7 and 14. By day 28, Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice generated significantly higher serum titers of both antipeptide (approximately fivefold) and anti-dsDNA antibody (approximately sevenfold; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). The difference in serum antibody reactivity did not reflect a difference in the kinetics of the response, as both strains exhibited a similar timing of antibody production (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). An antigen-specific IgM response was induced in WT and Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052437f01"></graphic></fig><p>One explanation for the greater IgG serum reactivity in Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice would be an increased affinity of antipeptide antibodies. We, therefore, performed inhibition ELISAs with soluble peptide and calculated apparent affinities by determining the molar concentration of soluble antigen that led to 50% inhibition of the antibody reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Contrary to our initial expectation, antipeptide antibodies from Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had a log lower apparent affinity than antipeptide antibodies from WT mice (1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> vs. 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>; P &#x02264; 0.01), demonstrating that the increased titers resulted from the production of more antigen-specific antibody.</p><p>Furthermore, although IgG1 was the predominant isotype observed in both the antipeptide and anti-dsDNA response in WT mice, Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice produced both IgG1 and IgG2a antipeptide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (not depicted). This did not reflect an intrinsic bias toward increased IgG2a, as the isotype distribution for total serum IgG was similar in both mouse strains (not depicted).</p><p>Because the difference in antibody titer between strains was &#x0223c;5&#x02013;10-fold, we believed it was important to ask whether this increase in serum antibody titer might be of pathological significance. Kidneys from MAP peptide&#x02013;immunized Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, analyzed 13 wk after the initial antigen challenge, had significantly more glomerular IgG deposition than WT kidneys, and the mice displayed increased proteinuria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>). Thus, the antibodies from Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, although of lower affinity than the antibodies in WT mice, were still of sufficient affinity to cause glomerular dysfunction. This observation is consistent with clinical experience where a four- to eightfold increase in autoantibody titer may correlate with the onset of disease or with increased disease activity. For example, an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:40 is normal, whereas an eightfold increase to 1:320 is highly significant for disease. Likewise, a four to eightfold increase in anti-DNA antibody titer in a patient with SLE will often precede a clinical flare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>High affinity antibody responses are generated by a germinal center reaction in which B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and there is selection for survival of B cells making the highest affinity antibodies. These cells mature to become long-lived plasma cells and memory cells. To determine if the lack of a high affinity antibody response reflected a failure of B cells to undergo germinal center maturation, we questioned whether Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice developed a memory response. WT and Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were immunized and boosted with MAP peptide. 8 wk later, mice were challenged with 100 &#x003bc;g MAP peptide. 5 d later, blood was collected to measure the antipeptide response in serum. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref> shows that WT mice have a rapid increase in the serum antipeptide response, which was not observed in Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. These data suggest a significant reduction in the population of memory B cells in Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>To determine whether Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice immunized with a nonself antigen would also develop an enhanced serum response, we examined the response of Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to 10&#x02013;2, a peptide mimotope of phosphorylcholine, conjugated to BSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). As seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 e</xref>, Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice made significantly more anti&#x02013;10-2 antibodies (an approximately threefold increase in titer) than WT mice. In addition, although WT mice made predominantly IgG1 anti&#x02013;10-2 antibodies, Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also produced antigen-specific IgG2a antibodies (unpublished data). Thus, the strain-specific difference in antibody response was not limited to an autoreactive response.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential humoral response in Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is not determined by B cells</title><p>The increased antipeptide and anti-DNA response in Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice might reflect either a B cell&#x02013;intrinsic phenotype or, alternatively, a different response to immunization in non-B cells. To test whether the difference was B cell intrinsic, splenic B cells from WT or Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were transferred to B cell&#x02013;deficient BALB/c mice (muMT). Both WT B cell&#x02013;reconstituted and Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cell&#x02013;reconstituted muMT mice were immunized with MAP peptide. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, there was no statistically significant difference in serum antipeptide response between WT and Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cell&#x02013;reconstituted mice. Moreover, analysis of splenic B cell subsets (mature vs. immature and transitional vs. follicular vs. marginal zone) confirmed that there was no difference in B cell differentiation between Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT BALB/c B cells. The expression of several cell surface markers (CD22, CD40, CD43, CD79b, CD27, MHC II, Fas, CD80, and CD86) also was not different between Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT BALB/c B cells. B cell function, assayed by IgM-mediated apoptosis and B cell proliferation to anti-IgM plus anti-CD40 antibody or anti-CD40 antibody plus IL-4, was also similar between both strains (unpublished data). Thus, the phenotype and function of naive B cells of both strains were indistinguishable.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Antipeptide response of muMT mice reconstituted with either WT B cells or Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells.</bold> Spleens were taken from 6&#x02013;8-wk-old WT and Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

Short-lived plasma cells develop in T cell&#x02013;dependent responses but do not display affinity maturation and are not associated with a clonally related memory B cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). After activation with antigen, short-lived plasma cells reside primarily in the extrafollicular foci of the spleen, whereas long-lived plasma cells preferentially migrate to the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). First, we determined the number of antibody-secreting cells (including plasmablasts, short-lived plasma cells, and long-lived plasma cells) in the spleen.

To determine the location of B220<sup>lo</sup> and CD138<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells within the spleen, immunohistochemistry was performed on spleens of immunized mice. The majority of CD138<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were positioned outside the B cell follicles where short-lived plasma cells reside (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>).

To address this question, we generated antigen-specific hybridomas from WT and Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice immunized with MAP peptide. We examined the number of mutations in the region downstream of the rearranged J<sub>H</sub> in B cells making antipeptide antibody. We chose to enumerate mutations in this region because it has been shown to undergo hypermutation. Because it is not a coding region, it is not subject to the pressures of selection. As seen in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref>, hybridomas from Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had many fewer mutations.

B cells from WT and Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also produced equal amounts of IL-12 p40 after upon LPS and LPS plus anti-CD40 antibody stimulation.

After 5 d in culture, B cells proliferated in the presence of Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMDCs, whereas little or no BMDC-dependent proliferation was seen in the presence of WT BMDCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 a</xref>).

Because anti&#x02013;IL-12 antibody recognizes both the p35 and the p40 subunits of IL-12 and p40 is also a subunit of IL-23, there is a possibility of inhibition of both cytokines by the anti&#x02013;IL-12 antibody. To address this problem, IL-12a (p35)&#x02013;specific siRNA was used. Transfection efficiency was determined and specificity of IL-12a siRNA was confirmed using control siRNA and analyzing gene expression of IL-12b (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070731/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070731/DC1</ext-link>).

Memory cells can proliferate extensively upon secondary challenge, and long-lived plasma cells can secrete antibody for long periods of time without antigen contact. Therefore, the prevalence of autoreactivity in the memory population may result in a chronic antibody-mediated disease. In contrast, short-lived plasma cells may generate large amounts of a pathogenic antibody that, as shown in this study, does not necessarily need to be of the highest affinity to cause organ damage.</p><p>Through the analysis of Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we have demonstrated that DCs participate in determining B cell differentiation in vivo. Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells became predominantly splenic plasma cells upon activation instead of forming the more heterogeneous population of short-lived and long-lived plasma cells and memory cells seen in WT mice. Current data suggest that the majority of splenic plasma cells are short lived, whereas plasma cells in the BM can be either short lived or long lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). In our study, Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had a transient surge of plasma cells in the spleen, while displaying a diminished rise in plasma cells in the BM and a reduced memory B cell response. In contrast, WT mice had a smaller population of splenic plasma cells and an increase in BM plasma cells after immunization and demonstrated B cell memory upon secondary challenge with antigen. Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice produced significantly higher serum titers of specific antibody than WT mice and displayed class switching to IgG2a as well as IgG1. The increase in serum antipeptide and anti-DNA response appears to be an FcR-dependent phenomenon because Fc&#x003b3;RI<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> immunized with MAP peptide showed a similar phenotype (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070731/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070731/DC1</ext-link>). These features of the response may account for the increased glomerular dysfunction. Interestingly, antibodies from Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> displayed less affinity maturation. This serologic data were confirmed by the demonstration of reduced GL-7&#x02013;positive cells in splenic B cells of Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (unpublished data) and less somatic mutation in antigen-specific hybridomas. Because some studies suggest that short-lived and long-lived plasma cells arise from completely separate precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), we are currently studying the B cells responding to antigen in WT and Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to determine if the same clones are activated or whether the plasma cell precursors differ between the strains.</p><p>DCs have previously been shown to mediate a critical function in B cell activation by transporting antigen from the periphery to T and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). The altered B cell phenotype we observed in Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> could also be traced to the influence of Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs and IL-12. Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs had a more mature phenotype and produced at least twofold more IL-12 than WT DCs. Several studies have established a role for IL-12 in B cell differentiation and function. IL-12 can induce plasma cell formation and B cell heavy chain class switching to IgG1 and IgG2a. The switch to IgG2 is IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;dependent, whereas the promotion of differentiation to plasma cells and the switch to IgG1 does not require IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Studies in human primary B cells have also shown that IL-12 up-regulates IL-12R&#x003b2;2 expression and IFN-&#x003b3; production by B cells, possibly allowing them to function as B effector cells and promote the activation of Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Notably, although IL-12 promotes short-lived plasma cells, perhaps in synergy with CD40L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), memory B cell differentiation occurs independently of IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In our study, when IL-12 was administered to WT mice, the mice responded to antigen immunization with the generation of more splenic plasma cells and fewer BM plasma cells, a pattern mimicking that seen in immunized Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Therefore, IL-12 produced by DCs seems to be highly influential in directing B cell differentiation. It is possible that this difference in differentiation pathway reflects a change in the environment in which the B cell resides rather than a direct effect on the B cell. We do not favor this explanation, as chemokine expression in the spleen is similar in both strains (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070731/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070731/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, IL-12 has been shown by others to act directly on B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Interestingly, CR2 (CD21/CD35) has also been reported to diminish the development of long-lived plasma cells while leaving intact the generation of short-lived plasmablasts, germinal center, and memory B cells. This effect is mediated through the regulation of Blimp-1 and XBP-1, which are critical transcription factors in plasma cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). CR2, like FcR, appears to function through a B cell&#x02013;intrinsic pathway that specifically arrests the differentiation of long-lived plasma cells. We should note, however, that antigen-specific T cell proliferation was enhanced in Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The enhanced number of antigen-specific T cells expressing CD40L and available to interact with antigen-specific B cells may also contribute to the preferential generation of short-lived plasma cells. Thus, both the direct action of DCs on B cells as well as the action of T cells in Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may contribute to skewing the B cell response.</p><p>Although the differences in IL-12 production between the mouse strains may seem small, we have previously shown in studies of hormonal effects on B cells that a 20% change in expression of CD22 can affect B cell receptor signaling and alter negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Recently, McGaha et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) have shown that a 50% increase in Fc&#x003b3;RIIb expression in B cells can prevent disease in lupus-prone mice. Thus, it should not be surprising that a twofold increase in IL-12 production by DCs can affect B cell differentiation. In fact, a study of experimental myasthenia gravis in mice also demonstrated that exogenous IL-12 given in a similar protocol led to increased serum antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).</p><p>A previous study reported no alteration in humoral response to the hapten NP in Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This study was performed on C57BL/6 mice deficient in the FcR &#x003b3; chain and may reveal a strain-dependent difference in FcR &#x003b3; chain function. It is also possible, however, that the force of selection for high-affinity antibodies in the NP model is so strong that differences in B cell differentiation were obscured. Some effects were seen that were similar to those we report. For example, in the reported study that Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had fewer splenic germinal centers after immunization.</p><p>We do not yet fully understand why the absence of the &#x003b3; chain leads to the observed DC phenotype. Studies on &#x003b3; chain&#x02013;deficient mice have focused on alterations in expression and function of FcRI, FcRIII, and FcRIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). To confirm that the serological changes were mediated through FcR engagement, we have immunized FcRIII-deficient mice with MAP peptide. These mice show increased serum antipeptide antibodies (fivefold increase) and an activated phenotype of BMDCs. Similarly, DCs derived from BM cells under serum-free conditions also display an activated phenotype, which is, again, consistent with FcR engagement modulating DC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). The activated phenotype was abrogated by addition of purified IgG to the culture. Although &#x003b3; chain&#x02013;containing Fc receptors have been demonstrated to be activating receptors, we speculated that engagement of these receptors may diminish the response to other activating receptors. Such reciprocal regulation of toll-like receptor 9 and IgE receptor signaling has already been demonstrated. Production of type I IFN by plasmacytoid DC is inhibited by preexposure of Fc&#x003b5;RI to IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). These two signaling pathways counterregulate the development of Th1 and Th2 immune response. Park-Min et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) recently demonstrated that immune complexes binding to Fc&#x003b3;RIII suppresses LPS-mediated IFN&#x003b3; signaling in both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived macrophages and murine peritoneal macrophages. A recent publication reported that human peripheral monocyte-derived DC cultures exposed to immune complexes show diminished differentiation. Furthermore, in response to TLR-mediated stimulation, they produced less IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). This inhibition was mediated mainly through Fc&#x003b3;RI but, to a lesser extent by Fc&#x003b3;RII. Thus, there is precedent for an absence of engagement of activating FcRs permitting an enhanced response in other activation pathways. Although the mechanism for the altered function of Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DC requires further confirmation, it is apparent that the difference in IL-12 production by DCs affects B cell differentiation. This study reports the first in vivo manipulation that leads to differential formation of short-lived and long-lived plasma cells. Understanding how to modulate B cell differentiation will facilitate an appreciation of the role of both short-lived and long lived plasma cells. Furthermore, knowledge of the B cell phenotype responsible for the production of antiself or antimicrobial antibodies will help in the design of therapeutic strategies in autoimmune disease, as well as in optimizing vaccine development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>5&#x02013;10-wk-old female Fc&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Fcer1g(BALB/cBy)) on the BALB/c background and WT BALB/c mice were purchased from Taconics.
