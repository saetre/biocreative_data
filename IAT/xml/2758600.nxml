In a wide variety of organisms, meiotic HORMA-domain proteins are required to direct DSB repair towards homologues. This inter-homologue bias is required for efficient homology search, homologue alignment, and crossover formation. HORMA-domain proteins are also implicated in other processes related to crossover formation, including DSB formation, inhibition of promiscuous formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC), and the meiotic prophase checkpoint that monitors both DSB processing and SCs. We examined the behavior of two previously uncharacterized meiosis-specific mouse HORMA-domain proteins&#x02014;HORMAD1 and HORMAD2&#x02014;in wild-type mice and in mutants defective in DSB processing or SC formation. HORMADs are preferentially associated with unsynapsed chromosome axes throughout meiotic prophase. We observe a strong negative correlation between SC formation and presence of HORMADs on axes, and a positive correlation between the presumptive sites of high checkpoint-kinase ATR activity and hyper-accumulation of HORMADs on axes. HORMADs are not depleted from chromosomes in mutants that lack SCs. In contrast, DSB formation and DSB repair are not absolutely required for depletion of HORMADs from synapsed axes. A simple interpretation of these findings is that SC formation directly or indirectly promotes depletion of HORMADs from chromosome axes. We also find that TRIP13 protein is required for reciprocal distribution of HORMADs and the SYCP1/SC-component along chromosome axes. Similarities in mouse and budding yeast meiosis suggest that TRIP13/Pch2 proteins have a conserved role in establishing mutually exclusive HORMAD-rich and synapsed chromatin domains in both mouse and yeast. Taken together, our observations raise the possibility that involvement of meiotic HORMA-domain proteins in the regulation of homologue interactions is conserved in mammals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Generation of haploid gametes in most organisms requires that homologues become connected via crossovers during meiosis. Efficient formation of crossovers depends on HORMA-domain proteins in diverse taxa. These proteins ensure that programmed meiotic DSBs are preferentially repaired from homologues, rather than from sister chromatids. This inter-homologue bias is crucial for homology search and crossovers formation. HORMA-domain proteins have been also implicated in DSB formation, in suppression of synaptonemal complex formation between non-homologous chromosomes, and in the meiotic prophase checkpoint that monitors DSB repair. Despite the importance of HORMA-domain proteins in various organisms, a role for these proteins in mammalian meiosis hasn't been reported. We examined the behaviour of meiotic mouse HORMA-domain proteins&#x02014;HORMAD1 and HORMAD2&#x02014;in wild-type and meiotic mutants. HORMAD1/2 preferentially accumulate on unsynapsed chromosome axes. Our data suggest that HORMAD1/2 depletion from chromosomes is a response to synaptonemal complex formation and it that is a conserved process supported by TRIP13/Pch2 AAA-ATPase. Assuming that HORMA-domain functions are conserved in mammals, we speculate that depletion of HORMADs from axes might contribute to the down-regulation of inter-homologue bias and the prophase checkpoint once homology search is completed and synaptonemal complexes form between aligned homologues.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="28"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Faithful segregation of chromosomes during the first meiotic division requires that parental homologous kinetochores are physically connected until all pairs of homologous kinetochores attach to microtubules and orient toward opposite spindle poles during metaphase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Page1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

DSBs can be repaired using either homologues (inter-homologue repair) or sister chromatids (inter-sister repair) as a recombination/repair template.

These proteinaceous structures consist of three parallel elongated elements, two axial elements (AEs) and a central element, which are linked by transverse filaments. The axial element comprises the shared axes of a sister chromatid pair. During SC formation, AEs of homologous chromosomes become connected via the central element/transverse filaments along their entire lengths. AEs begin to form during leptotene prior to the formation of SCs, which starts in zygotene. SCs are fully assembled during pachytene and disassemble as cells progress through diplotene.</p><p>SC dynamics and the DSB repair process are coordinated with progression in meiosis.

Several mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, could underlie this inverse correlation between HORMAD localization and the SC. First, SC formation and HORMAD1/2 depletion could be promoted concurrently and independently by another process, such as progression through meiosis, homologue alignment, and/or early DSB repair steps. Alternatively, there may be a causal relationship between SC formation and localized HORMAD1/2 depletion. In this case, either SC formation promotes HORMAD1/2 depletion (directly or indirectly), or axis-associated HORMADs antagonize SC formation.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the HORMA-domain protein HTP-1 and the SC component SYP-1 acquire an almost mutually exclusive, reciprocal localization pattern at the end of pachytene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-MartinezPerez2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, and HTP-1 is also required to prevent premature SC formation between non-homologous chromosomes, which suggests that HTP-1 may inhibit SC formation under some conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-MartinezPerez1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Couteau1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar relationship might exist between SCs and axis-associated HORMADs in mice, but such putative inhibition of SC formation does not provide a straightforward explanation for HORMAD1/2 behaviour in the mutants examined in this study. For example, HORMADs are not depleted from axes in the absence of SC central element components SYCE1 and -2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000702-g012">Figure 12</xref>). If HORMAD depletion is a necessary upstream precondition for SC formation, it is not obvious why HORMAD depletion would be blocked by the absence of central element components, which presumably would cause a relatively late block in SC formation.

Indeed, SYCP1 staining is relatively weak in <italic>Dmc1&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> and <italic>Spo11&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mutants, most similar to the SYCP1 staining of freshly formed SCs in WT zygotene cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000702-g011">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000702.s006">S6</xref>). Thus, non-homologous SCs might be qualitatively different from normal pachytene SCs (e.g., immature, or unstable). Moreover, we find a negative correlation between SYCP1 levels and residual HORMAD1/2 levels on synapsed axes in WT, which indicates that SC maturation might influence the efficiency of HORMAD1/2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000702-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, an alternative way to account for the correlation between recombination progression and the efficiency of HORMAD1 depletion is to propose that both SC formation and the production of late recombination intermediates promote HORMAD1 dissociation independently from each other. Although we can not exclude this possibility, behaviour of HORMADs on sex chromosomes argues against this idea. Even though DSBs are repaired on unsynapsed regions of sex chromosomes during late pachytene in WT cells (as judged by the disappearance of axis associated foci of RAD51 and RPA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Ashley1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Plug1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Moens1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, HORMAD1/2 levels nonetheless remain high on these unsynapsed axes during pachytene and diplotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000702-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000702-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000702-g004">4</xref>).

Thus, we propose that the reciprocal distribution of SYCP1 and HORMADs on axes in normal meiosis is a consequence of HORMAD1/2 depletion from chromosome axes in response to SC formation. In contrast, DSB formation and repair are not absolutely required for depletion of HORMADs, although DSB repair steps downstream of SC formation may increase the efficiency of SC-promoted HORMAD1 depletion.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Conserved relationship between PCH2/TRIP13 AAA-ATPases and HORMA-domain proteins</title><p>We show here that TRIP13 is required for depletion of HORMADs from synapsed axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000702-g014">Figure 14</xref>).

Instead, it is more likely that TRIP13 promotes depletion of HORMADs from synapsed axes independently from DSB repair. TRIP13 activity could mediate depletion of HORMADs from axes in response to SC formation or, alternatively, TRIP13 could modify properties of SCs in a manner that promotes HORMAD1/2 depletion from axes.

The conservation of this phenomenon suggests that removal of HORMA-domain proteins from synapsed axes may play an important role during meiosis. The cytological studies presented here do not allow us to definitively determine the functions of mammalian HORMADs. Nevertheless, our results in combination with published analyses of HORMA-domain proteins in other organisms allow us to speculate about the possible roles of HORMADs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000702.s008">Figure S8</xref>). We discuss here four possible functions that might no longer be needed, or that might need to be actively down-regulated, after SC formation.</p><sec id="s3d1"><title>DSB formation</title><p>First, HORMADs might promote efficient DSB formation similarly to budding yeast Hop1 and <italic>C. elegans</italic> HTP-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Schwacha1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Goodyer1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-MaoDraayer1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. The formation and repair of meiotic DSBs are strictly regulated to achieve proper homologue pairing and crossover formation. In particular, DSB repair must be directed toward homologues (IH bias) during meiosis. Thus, DSB formation is coordinated with establishment of the IH bias enforcing machinery. In budding yeast, DSB formation is promoted by axis component proteins Red1 and Hop1, which are also required for IH bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Schwacha1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Hollingsworth1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results thus place HORMADs at the right time and place to potentially facilitate DSB formation. If HORMADs do play such a role, it is also interesting to note that, since homologous recombination in mice promotes homology search and homologue alignment, generation of new DSBs is most probably not needed after homology search is finished and SCs have formed. Thus, depletion of HORMADs from synapsed axes may contribute to down-regulation of DSB formation late in meiotic prophase.</p></sec><sec id="s3d2"><title>Inhibiting promiscuous SC formation</title><p>Second, HORMADs could destabilize nascent SCs, thereby helping to ensure that mature, stable synapsis does not occur between inappropriate partners.

Thus, either HORMADs cannot inhibit SC formation between homologues, or TRIP13 is required together with HORMADs for SC destabilization. Another issue that argues against this function for HORMADs is that HTP-1 may not be as closely related to mouse HORMADs as other HORMA-domain proteins are.

Thus, we would argue that IH bias is no longer required once homologues have aligned and SCs have formed. At this point, cells have three important tasks: crossover-designated strand invasion events must be fully processed into mature crossovers and chiasmata; all remaining DSBs that have engaged with homologous DNA sequences must be repaired without reciprocal exchange (i.e., as noncrossovers); and, importantly, DSBs that did not find a partner on the homologue must be repaired from the sister chromatid in order to avoid either permanent arrest/apoptosis or entry into meiotic divisions with unrepaired DNA damage. Depletion of HORMADs from synapsed AEs might couple completion of homologue alignment and SC formation with down-regulation of the homology search and IH bias, and it may allow inter-sister repair of DSBs that might have failed to engage with homologous chromosomes during the homology search process.</p><p>The mechanism of IH bias is not yet well understood in any organism. The roles of axis associated HORMA-domain proteins in this process are thus not clear, but it has been suggested that they function in part by interfering with at least some kinds of DSB repair, e.g., DSB repair specifically from sister chromatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Schwacha1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Niu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, it is interesting to note that our findings suggest that persistence of HORMADs on synapsed axes might cause delayed DSB repair in mice. Specifically, we find that <italic>Trip13<sup>hypo</sup></italic> mutants, which are known to have delays in completing DSB repair as judged by persistence of RAD51 foci and other recombination markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Li1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, also are defective for HORMAD1/2depletion from synapsed axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000702-g014">Figure 14</xref>).

It is tempting to speculate that the failure to displace HORMADs (or Hop1) from synapsed axes contributes directly to the delay in progression of homologous recombination, and that the normal TRIP13-dependent depletion of HORMADs from synapsed chromosome axes may facilitate the rapid repair of DSBs that are not committed to inter-homologue repair. Importantly, if the above hypothesis is correct, it further implies that HORMA-domain proteins may have a previously unrecognised role in regulating the progression of DSB repair from all homologous templates, not just their proposed role in inhibiting DSB repair from sister chromatids.</p><p>Nonetheless, even if HORMADs do serve this function, their depletion from axes is unlikely to be the only way to down-regulate IH bias because HORMADs accumulate and persist on the unsynapsed regions of sex chromosomes in pachytene spermatocytes, yet DSBs in these regions are eventually repaired despite the presence of high HORMAD1/2 levels. Thus, it may be that HORMADs and/or IH bias can be inactivated by some other means, such as changes in post-translational modifications.

To compare IF signal levels in WT and <italic>Dmc1&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mutant we prepared nuclear spreads parallel from mutant and control animals. Spread nuclei were co-stained with antibodies recognising SYCP3, SYCP1 and either one of the HORMADs. Mutant and WT spreads were stained at the same time with the same mixes of antibodies. Imaging of the cells in each experiment were carried out in the same day with the same microscope and camera settings and TetraSpeck Fluorescent Microspheres Size Kit, T14792 Molecular Probes, Invitrogen were used to control for possible changes in illumination during the course of imaging. Measurement of IF signal was carried out with the help of Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended version. SYCP3/axis staining was used to select synapsed and unsynapsed chromosome axes that belong to a single chromosome. In the second step, we measured total IF signal intensity of HORMADs and/or SYCP1 in identical-sized rectangles that were placed over straight stretches of the selected synapsed and unsynapsed chromosome axes. Signal intensities were also measured in four regions around examined chromosomes in each nucleus in order to estimate the background. Signal intensity values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000702-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000702-g011">11</xref> are background corrected. Whenever it was possible we measured signal intensities on at least two chromosomes in each nucleus. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 5. For statistical analysis Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used when paired signal intensities on unsynapsed and synapsed axes of WT zygotene chromosomes were compared. For the comparison of independent samples two-tailed non-parametric Wilcoxon&#x02013;Mann&#x02013;Whitney two-sample rank-sum test was used. We acknowledge that there are clear limitations to quantification of IF signal on nuclear spreads. Due to the nature of the spreading methodology variable amounts of soluble and axis associated proteins are removed from each spread nucleus. Therefore, there is considerable variation in IF signal intensities and background levels within the same sample preparation and in between sample preparations. Hence, we do not think that these measurements can be used to accurately determine fold changes in protein levels on chromosome axes. Nevertheless, we think that the presented quantifications are suitable to illustrate tendencies in the data. They also reconfirm conclusions we drew from the observation of larger number of cells in larger number of experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Phylogenetic analyses</title><p>HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 orthologs were identified by blastp alignments of HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 sequences of Genbank protein database.

Open block-arrows represent processes, flat-end red arrows represent inhibition (direct or indirect) and red arrows represent activation (direct or indirect). Possible functions of axis-associated HORMADs may include: promoting DSB formation, inhibiting inter-sister repair of DSBs, inhibiting promiscuous SC formation, and collaborating with ATR in promoting MSUC (see text for details). Inhibition of inter-sister repair permits the use of resected DSB ends for homology search. Stable strand invasion of DSB ends into homologous DNA sequences and chromosome alignment promotes legitimate SC formation. In turn, SC facilitates repair of DSBs as crossovers or noncrossovers in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Baudat2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. SC also promotes depletion of HORMADs from chromosome axes in collaboration with TRIP13 (SC and TRIP13 could act independently or in the same pathway). Because homology searching is no longer necessary after SC formation, it is plausible that synapsis is accompanied by down-regulation of DSB formation and of inhibition of inter-sister DSB repair. HORMAD depletion from synapsed axes may help to accomplish this down-regulation. Depletion of HORMADs from synapsed autosomes may be one mechanism to restrict MSUC to unsynapsed sex chromosomes, thereby promoting progression past the mid pachytene checkpoint in males. Even if HORMADs promote MSUC, SC formation is able to inhibit ATR activity independently from the depletion of HORMADs from chromosome axes: despite abnormal persistence of low levels of &#x003b3;-H2AX along synapsed autosomes in <italic>Trip13<sup>hypo</sup></italic> pachytene cells, &#x003b3;-H2AX preferentially accumulates on unsynapsed sex chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000702-Li1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>(0.15 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000702.s008.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000702.s009"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Genbank accession numbers of HORMA-domain proteins used for phylogenetic comparison in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000702.s002">Figure S2</xref>.</p><p>(0.22 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000702.s009.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Anett Hientzsch for general lab support and for antibody production, Ani Vardanyan for antibody purification, Rolf Jessberger for sharing ideas, antibodies and the <italic>SMC1&#x003b2;&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> mouse and for critical reading of the manuscript, Caroline Adelfalk for the anti-Scp3 antibody, Junjie Chen for TOPBP1 antibody, Mary Ann Handel for anti H1t antibody, Edyta Marcon for H1t and RPA antibodies and Titia de Lange for the anti TRF1 antibody.
