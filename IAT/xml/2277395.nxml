The AAA ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) contributes to protein degradation and cell cycle regulation, respectively, and it was of interest to study a possible role of VCP/p97 during this myelomonocytic differentiation and retrodifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Separation of autonomously proliferating human U937 myeloid leukemia cells by centrifugal elutriation demonstrated unaltered VCP/p97 expression levels throughout distinct phases of the cell cycle. However, phorbol ester-induced G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest in differentiating human U937 leukemia cells was associated with a significantly increased protein and mRNA amount of this AAA ATPase. These elevated VCP/p97 levels progressively decreased again when growth-arrested U937 cells entered a retrodifferentiation program and returned to the tumorigenic phenotype. Whereas VCP/p97 was observed predominantly in the cytosol of U937 tumor and retrodifferentiated cells, a significant nuclear accumulation appeared during differentiation and G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> growth arrest. Analysis of subcellular compartments by immunoprecipitations and 2D Western blots substantiated these findings and revealed furthermore a tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of VCP/p97 in the cytosolic but not in the nuclear fractions. These altered tyrosine phosphorylation levels, according to distinct subcellular distributions, indicated a possible functional involvement of VCP/p97 in the leukemic differentiation process. Indeed, a down-modulation of VCP/p97 protein by siRNA revealed a reduced expression of differentiation-associated genes in subsequent DNA microarray analysis.

During this differentiation process, the autonomously proliferating tumor cells become adherent, undergo a complete growth arrest and acquire a variety of morphological and functional changes typical for normal monocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The TPA-differentiated U937 cells remain and survive in a transient G<sub>0</sub>' growth arrest cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. After 2&#x02013;3 weeks in the absence of TPA, however, the differentiated population down-modulates all markers acquired during the previous differentiation process and re-enters the proliferative cell cycle by a retrodifferentiation program, which results in the undifferentiated phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recent studies on the mechanism of this retrodifferentiation process revealed the necessity of a tightly regulated protein modulation program, which involves the cellular proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and a variety of regulatory compounds, including the nuclear factor poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, since fundamental cellular functions are altered and reverted in this differentiation and retrodifferentiation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the precise signaling pathways for the coordination of this phenomenon remain unclear and may thus involve further regulatory compounds of the proteasome, including certain ATPases.</p><p>The valosin-containing protein (VCP), also termed p97, belongs to the AAA superfamily (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) and represents the mammalian homolog of Cdc48 in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. VCP/p97 is one of the most abundant proteins in cells and is ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic cells. Thereby, it is involved in multiple cellular effects and performs a large variety of different cellular functions, including transport mechanisms, protein degradation and cell cycle regulation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this context, previous work has demonstrated that VCP/p97 targets numerous ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome for subsequent degradation and may thus act as a general chaperone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This concept is also reflected during cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], whereby VCP/p97 is associated with the degradation of decisive cell cycle regulatory proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. For example, the mammalian cyclin E, which is required for the entry of cells into S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and the G<sub>1</sub>-CDK inhibitor Far1 are both affected in their stability by interference with VCP/p97 and subsequent proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the precise interaction of VCP/p97 and different signal cascades are unknown so far. Moreover, the activation process of VCP/p97 in distinct subcellular compartments and possible modifications, e.g. by phosphorylation, remains obscure.</p><p>VCP/p97 has been demonstrated to localize predominantly in the cytosol. However, according to its involvement in membrane fusion, this protein is also associated with various membranes of organelles such as the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Nuclear localization of VCP/p97 was determined by interactions with Werner protein, a RecQ helicase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and during spindle disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Phosphorylation of VCP/p97 on tyrosine residues is suggested to play a role in determining the appropriate subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, after DNA damage, VCP/p97 is phosphorylated at Ser784 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, the phosphorylation does not affect the VCP/p97 ATPase activity and therefore, the physiological relevance of these modifications remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>VCP/p97 has a variety of clinical implications and thus contributes to the pathogenesis of distinct human diseases. In this context, VCP/p97 plays a role in several neurodegenerative disorders, which may be associated with its chaperone-like function as a cell death effector molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, VCP/p97 is discussed to be involved in certain types of human tumors such as hepatocellular and colorectal carcinomas as well as breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, VCP/p97 may increase the metastatic potential in tumor entities, possibly by controlling the stability of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, an inhibitor of NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Up to now the role of VCP/p97 during a cancer development is poorly understood. We therefore aim to characterize this ATPase in an <italic>in vitro </italic>cancer model of differentiation and retrodifferentiation to provide additional information for a potential role and function during tumorigenesis.</p><p>The predominant focus of the present study was 1) to examine the VCP/p97 expression in distinct cell cycle phases of proliferating U937 cells; 2) to analyze the regulation of VCP/p97 during differentiation-associated G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle exit and subsequent retrodifferentiation of U937 cells; 3) to investigate a possible functional association of VCP/p97 with the differentiation process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated an essential role for VCP/p97 in cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In order to investigate the expression of VCP/p97 during the cell cycle, centrifugal elutriations of proliferating U937 cells were performed to separate cells within distinct phases of the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Western blot analysis of the elutriated U937 cell lysates demonstrated little if any difference in the 97 kDa protein VCP/p97 levels throughout the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Control of the elutriated cell cycle phases and quantification of the distribution was performed by flow cytometry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, 1C</xref>). A tyrosine phosphorylation of an approximately 97 kDa protein was present in the G<sub>1</sub>-enriched populations and remained undetectable in S phase-enriched cells and during G<sub>2</sub>/M phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). &#x003b2;-actin, which served as a loading control, was similarly expressed throughout the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>VCP/p97 expression during cell cycle distribution of synchronized U937 cells</bold>. <bold>A</bold>. U937 cells were separated by centrifugal elutriation and cell lysates of the appropriate fractions were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-VCP/p97 and an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, respectively. Expression of &#x003b2;-actin was used as a loading control. <bold>B</bold>. The cell cycle distribution of the appropriate elutriated cell fractions were analyzed by flow cytometry and histograms were generated by the FloMax software. <bold>C</bold>.

Treatment of U937 cells with 10 nM of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 72 h was associated with cell cycle arrest in G<sub>0</sub>' and subsequent differentiation along the monocytic/macrophage-like pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Long term culture of these growth-arrested and differentiated cells in the absence of TPA for approximately 3 weeks was accompanied by a retrodifferentiation process, whereby the differentiated cells down-modulate all previously acquired differentiation markers and re-enter the proliferative cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Indeed, TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells demonstrated a significant expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21<sup>Cip1/Waf1/sdi-1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] within 3 d, which was down-regulated during retrodifferentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Simultaneously, the differentiation-associated intermediate filament protein vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] also exhibited marked expression during differentiation in contrast to a very low detection level in U937 control and retrodifferentiated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Expression of VCP/p97 was significantly elevated after 3 d of TPA exposure and this expression continuously decreased until the cells entered retrodifferentiation to reach the same VCP/p97 protein levels observed in untreated control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Similar findings were observed for tyrosine-phorphorylated proteins at approximately 97 kDa, demonstrating a marked presence after 3 d of TPA incubation and a progressive decline thereafter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Western blots were normalized to the &#x003b2;-actin levels by densitometry using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Alteration of the VCP/p97 expression during differentiation and retrodifferentiation</bold>. <bold>A</bold>. U937 cells were treated initially with 10 nM TPA and then cultured in the absence of TPA until retrodifferentiation. At the time points indicated, cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-VCP/p97, anti-P-tyr, anti-p21<sup>Cip1/Waf1/sdi-1 </sup>and anti-vimentin antibody. The tyrosine phosphorylation pattern (p-tyr) is demonstrated by the complete range from 250-20 kDa. Staining with &#x003b2;-actin was used as a loading control. Densitometric analysis and normalization to &#x003b2;-actin was performed using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). <bold>B</bold>. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of VCP/p97 mRNA levels during differentiation and retrodifferentiation. Following total RNA isolation of undifferentiated U937 control cells (U937), differentiated populations (3d until 18d) and retrodifferentiated U937 cells (Retro), the amplification was performed in the LightCycler 2.0 System using the LightCycler Software 3.5. Results represent means &#x000b1; SD from three independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-9-12-2"/></fig><p>Following quantitative RT-PCR analysis of VCP/p97, the measurements were normalized to the uniformly transcribed mRNA of the TATA-binding protein (TBP). In agreement with the Western blot data, mRNA expression of VCP/p97 was significantly enhanced after 72 h of TPA induction and thereafter, the transcripts progressively decreased until the level of retrodifferentiated cells was indistinguishable to that observed in U937 control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Together, these data indicated a possible association of VCP/p97 with the differentiation process and the transient cell cycle arrest.</p><p>Phase contrast pictures clearly showed the distinct morphology of the differentiated U937 cells. Using staining with the DNA-intercalating dye Hoechst 33258, the appropriate compartments of the nuclei within these cells could easily be demonstrated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Subcellular localization of VCP/p97 during the differentiation process was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Undifferentiated and retrodifferentiated U937 cells revealed a predominant localization of VCP/p97 in both, the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane, whereas there was less evidence for VCP/p97 localization in the nucleus of these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In contrast, the differentiated cell populations demonstrated opposite effects: A localization of VCP/p97 in the cytoplasm as well as a membrane association was paralleled by a pronounced immunofluorescence in the nucleus of all differentiated populations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The specificity of the VCP/p97 antibody was tested using an appropriate neutralizing peptide (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These data suggested that a significantly increased expression and an enhanced nuclear localization of VCP/p97 accompany differentiation and cell cycle arrest, which is reverted during the retrodifferentiation program.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of VCP/p97 in undifferentiated controls (U937), differentiated populations (3d, 7d, 14d) and retrodifferentiated U937 cells (Retro) by immunofluorescence</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Predominant expression of GAPDH in the cytosol, clathrin in the membrane-associated fraction, and nucleoporin62 in the nucleus, respectively, demonstrated a successful enrichment of the appropriate subcellular fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed a different expression of VCP/p97 in distinct cellular compartments during differentiation and retrodifferentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Whereas little if any differences in the expression of VCP/p97 were detectable in the cytosol, VCP/p97 protein levels significantly increased in the membrane fraction after TPA induction, most predominantly at day 3, and returned back to control levels during the retrodifferentiation program (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Moreover, VCP/p97 expression in the nucleus was significantly elevated after TPA exposure most predominantly at day 11, and similarly returned to control levels at the time of retrodifferentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Whereby total amounts of VCP/p97 in the subcellular compartments were not quantified, an apparent inconsistency by comparison of these subcellular VCP distributions to the pattern observed in the time course of the total cell lysates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) may results from an unequal distribution, suggesting most of the VCP/p97 within the cytosol and membrane-associated as compared to the nuclear fraction.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular regulation of VCP/p97 during differentiation and retrodifferentiation</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

The Coomassie stain of the different fractions was used as a loading control.

In contrast, there was little if any tyrosine phosphorylation detectable at 97 kDa in the nucleus during differentiation and retrodifferentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Analysis of the Coomassie staining in the cytosol, membrane fraction and the nuclear compartment, respectively, served as an appropriate loading control.

VCP/p97 Western blot analysis of the phosphotyrosine-precipitated proteins revealed a distinct band in the molecular range of approximately 97 kDa in the cytosolic as well as in the membrane fractions of both, undifferentiated and differentiated cells. In contrast, little if any VCP/p97 was detectable in the nuclear fraction of either U937 control or differentiated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). These data were supported by anti-VCP/p97 cross-immunoprecipitations followed by phosphotyrosine Western blots with a signal at approximately 97 kDa in the cytosolic and membraneous fractions of U937 and differentiated cells but no detectable phosphorylation in either nuclear fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

In the nuclear fraction of U937 cells, the 2D VCP/p97 Western blot could not visualize any protein spot and accordingly, no phosphorylation was detectable at about 97 kDa, pH 5.1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In contrast, the nuclear fraction of TPA-differentiated U937 cells demonstrated a clear VCP/p97 protein spot at approximately 97 kDa, pH 5.1 and subsequent anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot did not reveal any phosphorylation of this protein spot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), which is in line with our previous data. Control exposure of the stripped blots and control hybridizations with the secondary antibody alone revealed no detectable signals, respectively (data not shown).</p><p>A possible functional role of VCP/p97 in differentiating U937 cells was addressed by a siRNA approach. The transfection method was tested with a FITC-conjugated control siRNA which revealed a transfection efficiency in U937 cells of &#x0003e;95% as evaluated by FACS analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The successful down-modulation of VCP/p97 protein in VCP-siRNA-transfected cells was demonstrated in appropriate Western blots for both, U937 control and TPA-differentiating cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Functional changes in VCP-siRNA-transfected cells following phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation have been examind by DNA microarray analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C, D</xref>). Thus, differentiation-associated genes, which are elevated during myelomonocytic maturation, including the cytokine receptor for interleukin-1, were expressed at significantly reduced levels in TPA-treated VCP/p97-siRNA-transfected U937 cells. According to the cell attachment as a consequence of differentiation along the monocytic/macrophage-like pathway, genes associated with the formation of the cytoskeleton (e.g. adducin1) and certain extracellular matrix related genes such as ADAM metalloproteinase 13 and the extracellular glycoprotein fibronectin showed a decreased expression due to VCP/p97 RNAi (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Moreover, previous work has demonstrated that TPA-mediated signals in U937 cells are relayed via activation of protein kinase C and downstream kinases to activate appropriate transcription factors for the induction of differentiation-associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this context, pleckstrin homology domain containing proteins, a MAP kinase interacting protein and phospholipase C were significantly down-modulated in TPA-treated VCP-siRNA-transfectants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). With respect to genes involved in protein metabolism and particularly in transport functions, sulfotransferase 2A, an ATPase (ATP8B3), a vesicle transport protein (SFT2D3) and a Golgi-associated gene (COG1) were reduced expressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). In contrast, the KDEL receptor was up-regulated, which is responsible for the retention of newly synthesized proteins during the quality control in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Moreover, metabolic compounds involved in post-translational modifications in the lysosome and microsome such as &#x003b2;-glucoronidase, arylacetamide deacetylase, phosphoserine aminotransferase and xylosysltransferase were increased expressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). TPA-induced differentiation is also associated with growth arrest and down-modulation of cell cycle-regulatory factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast, TPA treatment of VCP-siRNA-transfected U937 cells revealed an increased expression of the transcriptional regulator ETV6 and certain histones. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). However, siRNA-targeting in cells also involves off-target effects, which reflect VCP/p97-siRNA-independent modulations and some of these genes are listed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>siRNA transfection of U937 cells</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Previous studies suggested an unaltered expression of VCP/p97 throughout the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The results of the present study are in agreement with these findings. Moreover, an enhanced VCP/p97 phosphorylation of the yeast homolog Cdc48 was observed during spindle disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Cdc48 mutations revealed the requirement of this ATPase for the nuclear division process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the role of VCP/p97-associated phosphorylation patterns for regulatory processes within the cell cycle remains unknown.</p><p>Cell cycle arrest in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>by TPA induction was associated with a pronounced VCP/p97 accumulation both, in the membranes and in the nucleus, which might be related to enhanced protein turnover according to the functional restructure of U937 cells during the concomitant differentiation program. Supportive findings from recent work indicated an involvement of VCP/p97 in transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] as well as in proteasomal degradation during differentiation. This effect was accompanied by a membrane-association of VCP/p97 required for retrotranslocation of misfolded and unwanted proteins to the cytosol with subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Although previous work has suggested that elevated VCP/p97 expression is associated with increased metastatic potential and tumor recurrence in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular, colorectal and osteosarcomal carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the present findings demonstrate an up-regulation of VCP/p97 during differentiation and growth arrest. This differentiation process is accompanied by the development of secretory active cells requiring significant endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and thus VCP/p97 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Previous data revealed that a down-modulation of VCP/p97 results in a significant accumulation of ubiquitinated and thus degradation-designated proteins, which eventually promotes apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This is substantiated by microarray studies in HeLa cells transfected with VCP-siRNA, demonstrating a significant up-regulation of transcripts encoding for proteins associated with apoptosis, ER stress and oxidative stress, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Together, the findings may be limited to possible off-target effects due to sequence-independent cellular response to the siRNAs used.</p><p>The functions of VCP/p97 may contribute to the retrodifferentiation process with certain levels of nuclear-associated VCP/p97 before retrodifferentiation. Indeed, other work has demonstrated a simultaneous PARP-1-regulated activation of the nuclear proteasome with maximal proteolytic activity at the time point of retrodifferentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Whereby inhibition of either PARP-1 or the proteasome blocks the retrodifferentiation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], these effects substantiate the importance of an intact proteasomal regulation by factors such as VCP/p97 to restore the undifferentiated U937 phenotype.</p><p>The requirement of VCP/p97 within the nucleus may also involve other regulatory functions for the retrodifferentiation program, which concludes the transition of a growth-arrested differentiated population to autonomously proliferating undifferentiated tumor cells. Such nuclear function was demonstrated for the interaction of VCP/p97 with DNA unwinding factor (DUF) in nuclei of Xenopus egg extracts and suggested a role in DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. As a contribution to a tumor development, VCP/p97 has been demonstrated to directly bind to BRCA1 as one of the key regulatory genes in breast cancer pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since BRCA1 is involved in DNA damage repair, the interaction with the ATP transporter VCP/p97 altered the transcription-associated DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Together, these regulatory processes suggest a tightly controlled subcellular distribution of VCP/p97 according to the appropriate cellular requirements. However, the signals for VCP/p97 to be directed to distinct subcellular compartments remain unclear. In this context, it is interesting to note that tyrosine phosphorylated VCP/p97 was exclusively associated with the cytosol and the membrane fraction, indicating a possible role for compartmentalization. This is supported by previous findings which suggested a possible role for subcellular localization of VCP/p97 following tyrosine phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Finally, these effects are accompanied by the involvement of VCP/p97 in the TPA-mediated monocytic transition, affecting the expression of differentiation-associated and cell cycle-regulatory genes. Moreover, genes involved in the ER-associated metabolic pathway were expressed at a significantly reduced level, whereas expression of genes implicated in post-translational modifications in the lysosomes and microsomes was considerably increased, indicating a support and substitution of the protein biosynthesis and quality control in the ER. This is further substantiated by the enhanced expression of the KDEL ER protein retention receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, the present findings suggest that VCP/p97 expression is not altered during proliferation and cell cycle progression. However, significantly increased protein and RNA levels appeared during G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest and an associated differentiation process. A certain redistribution of VCP/p97 was observed in the membrane and the nuclear fractions, carrying a tyrosine phosphorylated form predominantly in the cytosolic and the membranous compartments. The altered expression levels of VCP/p97 during the TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells as well as the changes of certain differentiation-associated transcripts as a consequence of VCP/p97 RNAi suggested that this AAA ATPase accompanies the differentiation and retrodifferentiation process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human U937 myeloid leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Hannover, Germany) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA Laboratories GmbH, C&#x000f6;lbe, Germany).

The differentiation process of these four populations was initiated 48 h after transfection by treating the cells with 10 nM TPA for additional 24 h. Control cultures were maintained in medium for 72 h after transfection. Following RNA extraction, 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was linearly amplified using the MessageAmp aRNA Kit (Ambion, Huntington, UK). Quantification and validation for integrity was performed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Agilent Technologies, B&#x000f6;blingen, Germany). Three &#x003bc;g of amplified RNA from the different VCP/p97 siRNA transfected cells of both, the untreated and TPA-treated population, was labelled with Cy5-dUTP, whereas the amplified RNA from negative control siRNA transfected cells was similarly labelled with Cy3-dUTP according to the provided protocol (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. To evaluate off-target effects, we performed microarray analysis of pooled triplicates of transfected cells with each of the VCP/p97 siRNAs separately, and then compared these results to the microarray data of both VCP/p97 siRNAs together. The fluorescence-labelled RNA probes were comparatively hybridised on a spotted cDNA microarray (Stanford Functional Genomics Facility, Stanford, CA, USA) following the posted protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The fluorescence intensities of Cy5 and Cy3 were measured on a GenePix 4000 scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA) and analyzed using GenePix Pro 4.1 software (Axon Instruments). Areas of the microarray or spots exhibiting obvious damages due to technical failures were excluded from subsequent analysis. Single spots were only considered as well-measured and included in the further investigation, when the mean fluorescent intensity of Cy5 and Cy3 was &#x02265; 3-fold above the local background and the regression correlation was &#x02265; 0.8. Genes were classified as upregulated, when the corresponding spot met these quality criteria and a log (base 2) ratio of Cy5 relative to Cy3 revealed a value of &#x02265; 0.7. Thus, U937 control transfectants were compared to VCP/p97 transfectants and simultaneously TPA-treated control-transfectants were compared to the appropriate TPA-treated VCP/p97 transfectants to exclude those genes affected by the transfection itself. Thereafter, the regulated genes of untreated and TPA-treated populations were compared in order to exclusively evaluate transcripts affected by VCP/p97 during the differentiation process.
