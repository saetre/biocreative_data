Transcriptional activation of genes is a complex process, which involves the participation of many transcription coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). These coactivators bind directly to transcription factors and are involved in the remodeling of chromatin structures and/or in bridging transcription factors with RNA polymerase II and the general basal transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Many of these transcription coactivators along with other coregulatory molecules bind singly or as preformed multisubunit protein complexes to an activated transcription factor to enhance target gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Since the cloning of the first transcription coactivator steroid receptor coactivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) and corepressors nuclear receptor corepressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) and SMRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), over 300 coactivators/coregulators have been identified with new members still being added to this spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). This diversity raises issues about the versatility and complexity of the coregulatory molecules in orchestrating transcription and the need to delineate specific functional roles of individual coregulators in embryogenesis, development, differentiation and oncogenesis, as well as energy and xenobiotic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Limited studies involving gene knockout mouse models show that some of the coactivators/coregulators are essential for embryonic growth and survival, whereas others are not critical for mouse embryogenesis (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). For example, the disruption of a coactivator gene such as peroxisome proliferated-activated receptor (PPAR)-binding protein, which is also known as thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein (TRAP) 220, vitamin D3 receptor-interacting protein (DRIP) 205 or mediator subunit 1 (MED1), referred to here as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-binding protein (PBP)/MED1, results in embryonic lethality in the mouse around gestational day 11.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Likewise, germ-line deletion of coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-interacting protein (PRIP) (ASC-2/RAP250/TRBP/NRC/NCoA6) gene and PRIP-interacting protein with methyltransferase domain (PIMT/NCoA6IP) gene in the mouse also results in embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). On the other hand, null mutation of coactivators steroid receptor coactivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), SRC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), SRC-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), PPAR gamma coactivator 1 alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) or coactivator associated arginine methyl transferase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) results in viable phenotype with or without overt functional changes.</p><p>To analyze the roles of PBP/MED1 and PRIP in adult tissues, we generated mice for conditional gene disruption using the Cre-loxP strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Using the albumin enhancer and promoter-driven Cre recombinase transgene [Alb-Cre] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) to mediate hepatocyte-specific deletion of the PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> allele, we demonstrated that PBP/MED1 is essential for PPAR&#x003b1;-regulated gene expression in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Likewise, hepatocyte-specific deletion of the PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> allele resulted in near abrogation of the induction of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)-regulated genes in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In contrast, deletion of PRIP<sup>fl/fl</sup> allele in liver did not interfere with PPAR&#x003b1; and CAR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). The dependence of PPAR&#x003b1; and CAR-regulated gene transcription on coactivator PBP/MED1, but not on PRIP, attests to the existence of coactivator selectivity in nuclear receptor function at least in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Furthermore, PBP/MED1 null hepatocytes in PBP/MED1 liver conditional null (PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup>) mice did not develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when chronically exposed to a PPAR&#x003b1; ligand, indicating that PBP/MED1 is essential for this receptor-mediated liver tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). PPAR&#x003b1; ligands, such as ciprofibrate and Wy-14,643, are non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>) that differ from classical DNA-damaging mutagenic chemical carcinogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Typically, mutagenic chemicals and or their electrophilic metabolites interact with and damage DNA inducing mutations and initiating the neoplastic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Therefore, it would be of importance to ascertain whether the PBP/MED1 null hepatocytes function as targets for a potent genotoxic carcinogen such as diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Here, we used a DEN/phenobarbital (PB) liver tumor-induction protocol to demonstrate that PBP/MED1-deficient mouse hepatocytes fail to develop liver tumors in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice. Initiation by DEN, followed by PB promotion in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice, resulted in a failure of PBP/MED1 null hepatocytes to undergo proliferation. However, an occasional PBP/MED1 expressing hepatocyte with PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> genotype that escaped Alb-Cre-mediated deletion exhibited enormous proliferative potential and such cells gave rise to liver tumors following DEN initiation and PB promotion. PB exerts liver tumor promoting effects by activating the nuclear receptor CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) and since PBP/MED1 deficiency abrogates CAR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), it would appear that disruption of PBP/MED1 gene would have an impact on liver tumor development. Furthermore, we established a transplantable HCC with PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> genotype in athymic nude mice and show that intratumoral injection of Adeno-Cre-mediated deletion of PBP/MED1 allele in tumor cells caused necrosis. These studies suggest PBP/MED1 is essential for development of HCC and required for the proliferative expansion of liver cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of PBP/MED1 conditional null mutation in liver (PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup>) and treatment with PB and DEN</title><p>The homozygous mutant mice lacking the PBP/MED1 in hepatocytes (<italic>PBP/MED1</italic><sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup>) were generated and bred in our laboratory as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).

All the experiments involving PBP/MED1 liver nulls and wild-type mice were carried out using littermates. All animal procedures used in this study were reviewed and preapproved by the Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. At 14 days postnatal age, the entire mouse litter received a single intraperitoneal injection of the genotoxic tumor initiator DEN (5 &#x003bc;g/g body weight; catalog no.

This led us to conclude that absence of PBP/MED1 abrogates the response to PPAR&#x003b1; ligand signaling required for liver tumorigenesis with Wy-14,643 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, it was decided to ascertain whether PBP/MED1 null hepatocytes function as targets for tumor development following DEN-initiation and PB promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). DEN, in contrast to PPAR&#x003b1; ligand Wy-14,643, is a genotoxic chemical carcinogen and the DEN-initiated hepatocytes are readily promotable when exposed to liver tumor promoter PB, an activator of nuclear receptor CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). In the present study, following DEN initiation, PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> and PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice were given PB in drinking water and mice were killed at selected intervals to examine changes in the liver. Liver weight:body weight ratio was slightly lower in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice at 4 and 12 weeks on PB promotion and by 52 weeks, the ratios were similar and the increase in ratio at this interval is due to liver tumor burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In mice given PB for 52 weeks without DEN initiation, the liver weight:body weight ratio remained lower compared with DEN-initiated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It should be noted that 1 year of PB treatment had similar effect of liver weight:body weight ratio in normal and PBP/MED1 liver null mice and this is attributed to PB accelerated expansion of the residual PBP/MED1 expressing hepatocytes in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice. In PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, the histological appearance of liver was unremarkable at 0, 1 and 12 weeks of PB promotion following DEN initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). All hepatocytes revealed PBP/MED1 nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). In PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice, nuclear staining of PBP/MED1 was not present in hepatocytes at 0 day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and I</xref>), except for positive staining in a rare hepatocyte that apparently escaped Cre-mediated gene deletion. By 1 week of PB promotion, large hepatocytes begin to emerge in DEN-initiated PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mouse livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and J</xref>) and they revealed PBP/MED1 nuclear staining implying PBPMED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> genotype of these cells, in the background of PBP/MED1-deficient hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). The PBP/MED1 expressing large hepatocytes in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> livers increased in number and began to dominate the liver phenotype in that they formed large expanding colonies between 12 and 52 weeks of PB promotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H, K and L</xref>). The volume occupied by large PBP/MED1-positive hepatocytes in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice was estimated by using Scion Image software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The data on PBP/MED1 expressing large hepatocytes obtained at 52 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) represents only the proportion of these cells in non-neoplastic areas (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

It appeared that apoptosis contributed to the progressive reduction in PBP/MED1-deficient hepatocytes and this served as a stimulus for PBP-positive cells to proliferate.

Altered hepatic foci and hepatic adenomas were difficult to delineate due to proliferative expansion of hepatocytes, particularly in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice. Accordingly, grossly and histologically distinct HCC were evaluated and the HCC load appeared similar in both groups (9.63&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.69 in PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> versus 9.13&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.25 in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

Interestingly, all liver tumors developed in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice were PBP/MED1 positive, whereas the surrounding non-tumor portions of liver in these mice did not express this coactivator. Genotyping of microdissected non-tumorous areas confirmed PBP/MED1 gene deletion whereas tumors in these mice had intact gene. Large hepatocytes scattered in predominantly smaller PBP/MED1 gene deleted hepatocytes in non-tumorous areas show PBP/MED1-positive nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E and F</xref>).

Since HCC transplanted in nude mice express PBP/MED1 and the PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> gene in these cells can be disrupted by adeno-Cre, we injected adeno-Cre-GFP (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>11</sup> virus particles) intratumorally in a volume of 100 &#x003bc;l and the tumor harvested on the third day for histological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

PCR-based genotyping confirmed the deletion of floxed PBP/MED1 allele in HCC-1 and HCC-2 cell lines after infection with Ad/Cre-GFP virus resulting into a short band of &#x0223c;1.5 kb after the deletion of floxed exons 8&#x02013;10.

In these PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mice, hepatocytes that escaped Cre-mediated deletion of PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup>-targeted allele exhibited profound proliferative potential and these cells are responsible for liver tumor development in this DEN-initiation and PB promotion liver tumor model. Accordingly, all liver tumors expressed PBP/MED1 and none were PBP/MED1 negative. Previously, we reported that PBP/MED1-deficient hepatocytes failed to develop liver tumors when chronically exposed to a non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogen that acts by enhancing PPAR&#x003b1; signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Absence of PBP/MED1 abrogates PPAR&#x003b1; signaling in hepatocytes and accordingly abolishes the PPAR&#x003b1;-ligand-induced pleiotropic responses including peroxisome proliferation, induction of fatty acid oxidation enzymes and liver tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). The data presented here extend these observations to demonstrate that PBP/MED1-deficient hepatocytes are also resistant to tumorigenesis initiated by a potent genotoxic hepatocarcinogen DEN and promoted by PB.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the inability of PBP/MED1-deficient hepatocytes to give rise to HCC in response to DEN-initiation and PB promotion can reside at two or more levels. First, the metabolism of the genotoxic carcinogen DEN, which was used for initiation, could be defective in hepatocytes with PBP/MED1 deficiency as compared with PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> hepatocytes in the same PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mouse liver. Metabolic activation of DEN occurs in liver within hours after administration via cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent &#x003b1;-hydroxylation and oxidation to form reactive products capable of generating mutagenic DNA adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). CYPs involved in DEN metabolism include CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B1, CYP2B2 and CYP2E1 and several of these are regulated by the nuclear receptor CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). In PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mouse liver, the basal mRNA levels of these CYPs were lower than in PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Parenthetically, it should be noted that these genes are also not inducible in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mouse liver by CAR activators such as PB and the pesticide contaminant 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). The diminished basal levels of CYPs may account for a reduction in DEN metabolism and DNA alkylation contributing to lower number of &#x02018;initiated&#x02019; cells among PBP/MED1-deficient cells in comparison with PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> hepatocytes in the same liver. This can explain the absence of liver tumors with PBP/MED1-deficient genotype in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mouse liver. However, given that the mice received only a single injection of DEN while they were 14 day old, enzyme induction may not play a major role. Future studies on CYP levels and DEN-related DNA adducts may provide insights into the role of DEN metabolism in HCC development in PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mouse liver. Second, it has been suggested that the process of initiation, which follows the primary DNA alkylation reaction, may take several weeks because two or more rounds of cell division are needed to fix the &#x02018;initiation&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Fixation of critical mutation may not occur in PBP/MED1-deficient hepatocytes because of their diminished ability to undergo cell proliferation and this could account for a possible reduction in the initiated cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Third, initiated PBP/MED1-deficient cells may be highly susceptible to apoptotic cell death and extinction. We noted a higher incidence of apoptosis in PBP/MED1-deficient cells and attributed this to compressive pressure on hepatocytes with inherent defect to divide slowly. Fourth, in this DEN-initiation&#x02013;PB promotion liver carcinogenesis model, promotion of initiated cells is an integral part toward liver tumor development and evidence suggests that this may be defective in PBP/MED1-deficient hepatocytes. Promotion of mouse hepatocarcinogenesis by PB involves the selection of hepatocytes carrying activating mutations and such a population of initiated cells serves as a sensitive target for PB tumor promotion. Available evidence indicates that CAR is the molecular target of promotion by PB and that activation of this nuclear receptor is an essential requirement for liver tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).</p><p>The DEN-initiation and PB promotion studies in CAR knockout mice have established that CAR is necessary for liver tumor promotion by PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). CAR activation by PB and 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene increases hepatocellular proliferation and upregulates drug-metabolizing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). For CAR to exert its effects on gene expression in liver, PB and other activators of this receptor have to induce its translocation into hepatocyte nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Of interest is studies using PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup> mouse livers have clearly established that PBP/MED1 is essential for the nuclear translocation of CAR into hepatocytes and for the proper functioning of this xenobiotic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). In the absence of this coactivator, CAR remains in the cytoplasm and fails to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B10 and other CAR-regulated genes in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Absence of PBP/MED1 in liver cells results in the abrogation of hypertrophic and hyperplastic influences mediated by CAR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). DEN is a genotoxic chemical carcinogen capable of generating DNA adducts that contribute to mutational events necessary for initiation. In contrast, carcinogenesis by non-genotoxic mechanisms, for example PPAR&#x003b1;-and CAR-mediated carcinogenesis, generally involves receptor-mediated cell proliferation and other metabolic events. The DEN-initiated cells can be influenced by a variety of mechanisms that enhance the proliferative capacity of initiated cells. The studies with PBP/MED1 strongly suggest that this coactivator plays a major role in liver tumorigenesis, whether it is genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogenesis.</p><p>Finally, we have established a transplantable HCC in athymic nude mice that expresses high levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1, cyclin D and cyclin B1 and show that deletion of PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> allele using adeno-Cre results in tumor cell necrosis. Two HCC cell lines with PBP/MED1<sup>fl/fl</sup> allele have also been generated and preliminary studies suggest that adeno-Cre-mediated disruption of PBP/MED1 gene in these cells inhibits colony formation in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. We have previously reported that PBP/MED1 (<italic>PPARBP</italic>) gene, which is localized to chromosome 17q12, a region known to contain the oncogene erbB-2/HER-2, is amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that the loss of this coactivator inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). The available data indicate that PBP/MED1 is important for cell proliferation and neoplastic growth and the absence of this molecule adversely affects cell growth. In contrast, a recent study shows that downregulation of the expression of this coactivator in fact enhances the tumorigenic phenotype of human melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). It is possible that PBP/MED1 may exert different effects in different tumor cell types. Additional studies are needed to understand the function of PBP/MED1 and other essential coactivators such as PRIP (51) in tumor formation, growth and survival in liver and other types of cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source><?release-delay 12|0?> (<award-id>GM23750</award-id>, <award-id>DK083163</award-id> to J.K.R.).</p></sec></body><back><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>BrdUrd</term><def><p>bromodexoyuridine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAR</term><def><p>constitutive androstane receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CYP</term><def><p>cytochrome p450</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DEN</term><def><p>diethylnitrosamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMEM</term><def><p>Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EGFP</term><def><p>enhanced green fluorescent protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCC</term><def><p>hepatocellular carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MED1</term><def><p>mediator subunit 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mRNA</term><def><p>messenger RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PB</term><def><p>phenobarbital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBP</term><def><p>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-binding protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBP/MED1<sup>&#x00394;Liv</sup></term><def><p>PBP/MED1 liver conditional null</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p>polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPAR</term><def><p>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRIP</term><def><p>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor interacting protein</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p><italic>Conflict of Interest Statement:</italic> None declared.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mangelsdorf</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The nuclear receptor superfamily: the second decade</article-title><source>Cell</source><year>1995</year><volume>83</volume><fpage>835</fpage><lpage>839</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8521507</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sonoda</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Nuclear receptors: decoding metabolic disease</article-title><source>FEBS Lett.</source><year>2008</year><volume>582</volume><fpage>2</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18023286</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McKenna</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Combinatorial control of gene expression by nuclear receptors and coregulators</article-title><source>Cell</source><year>2002</year><volume>108</volume><fpage>465</fpage><lpage>474</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11909518</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lonard</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The expanding cosmos of nuclear receptor coactivators</article-title><source>Cell</source><year>2006</year><volume>125</volume><fpage>411</fpage><lpage>414</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16678083</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hermanson</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Nuclear receptor coregulators: multiple modes of modification</article-title><source>Trends Endocrinol.
