In this study, we show that Dsg1 is not only required for maintaining epidermal tissue integrity in the superficial layers but also supports keratinocyte differentiation and suprabasal morphogenesis. Dsg1 lacking N-terminal ectodomain residues required for adhesion remained capable of promoting keratinocyte differentiation. Moreover, this capability did not depend on cytodomain interactions with the armadillo protein plakoglobin or coexpression of its companion suprabasal cadherin, Dsc1 (desmocollin 1). Instead, Dsg1 was required for suppression of epidermal growth factor receptor&#x02013;Erk1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) signaling, thereby facilitating keratinocyte progression through a terminal differentiation program. In addition to serving as a rigid anchor between adjacent cells, this study implicates desmosomal cadherins as key components of a signaling axis governing epithelial morphogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Desmogleins (Dsgs) and desmocollins (Dscs) are transmembrane glycoproteins that anchor adjacent epithelial cells to one another in desmosomes via their five extracellular domains (EC1&#x02013;5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green and Simpson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrod and Chidgey, 2008</xref>). The cytoplasmic domains of these desmosomal cadherins integrate the keratin-based cytoskeleton at stable sites of cell&#x02013;cell contact by interacting with armadillo family members, including plakoglobin (PG) and the plakophilins, which, in turn, associate with the intermediate filament-binding protein desmoplakin. The resulting supracellular scaffolding gives tensile strength to tissues such as the heart and epidermis, which is required for effectively resisting the forces of mechanical stress.</p><p>The epidermis is a continually renewing stratified epithelium that forms the outer protective layer of the skin. During the epidermal life cycle, superficial cells lost through desquamation are replenished with a fresh population of keratinocytes entering the terminal differentiation program from the proliferating basal compartment. Desmosomal cadherin expression profiles are orchestrated with biochemical changes in growth factor signaling, cytoskeleton and cytoskeletal-associated proteins, and components required for establishing the epidermal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green and Simpson, 2007</xref>). Of the four Dsg and three Dsc subtypes, Dsg2/Dsc2 and Dsg3/Dsc3 are found in the basal layer. Conversely, Dsc1 is restricted to the postmitotic, upper cell layers, and Dsg4 is present only in the most terminally differentiated viable cell layers. Dsg1 exhibits a distinct expression pattern from other desmosomal cadherins in that it is first expressed at the interface between basal and suprabasal cells. Alterations in the normal expression pattern of desmosomal cadherins in mice disrupts epidermal structure and function, supporting the notion that these adhesion molecules also serve as key morphoregulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chidgey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elias et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merritt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kljuic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hardman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). For example, the lack of Dsc1 or Dsg4 in the suprabasal layers impairs adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of keratinocytes in interfollicular epidermis or hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chidgey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kljuic et al., 2003</xref>). The adhesive function of desmosomal cadherins is thought to be critical for this process, as the transgenic expression of an ectodomain-deleted Dsg3 interferes with desmosome formation and epidermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1996</xref>). A causal link between desmosomal adhesion and epithelial morphogenesis was further shown using inhibitory peptides that target amino acid residues present within EC1 of the adhesive cadherin ectodomain, which disrupt the positioning of luminal and myoepithelial cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Runswick et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Desmosomal cadherins are part of a larger gene family that includes epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), which is a critical orchestrator of intercellular junctional complexes and signaling pathways in epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lien et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it has been suggested that, in addition to serving as adhesion receptors, desmosomal cadherins might also contribute to epidermal morphogenesis by coordinating intracellular signaling responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green and Simpson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrod and Chidgey, 2008</xref>). In support of this possibility, the forced expression of Dsc3 into the suprabasal layers not only led to epidermal proliferation and differentiation defects but also increased &#x003b2;-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hardman et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, introducing the basally restricted Dsg2 into the suprabasal layers enhanced epidermal proliferation and survival in a manner that relied, at least in part, on EGF receptor (EGFR) and nuclear factor &#x003ba;B signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennan et al., 2007</xref>). However, these studies did not directly test whether the alterations in signaling were related to the adhesive function of desmosomal cadherins.</p><p>To define the adhesive and signaling contributions of desmosomal cadherins in epithelial tissue morphogenesis, we focused on the role of Dsg1 in epidermal development because it is essential for adhesion in the uppermost cell layers and can be found at the interface between cells in the basal and suprabasal layers in vivo, where keratinocytes commit to a terminal differentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green and Simpson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrod and Chidgey, 2008</xref>). Providing further rationale for focusing on this particular desmosomal cadherin, the Grhl1 (grainyhead-like 1) transcription factor directly regulates <italic>DSG1</italic> gene expression, and knockout of Grhl1 in mice leads to epidermal adhesive and differentiation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilanowski et al., 2008</xref>). Using a three-dimensional raft model of human epidermis combined with gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that Dsg1 regulates an early program of epidermal differentiation and morphogenesis that leads to an up-regulation of Dsc1 along with other suprabasal layer proteins. Interestingly, Dsg1 can promote keratinocyte differentiation in a manner that does not rely on its (a) suprabasal partner, Dsc1, (b) N-terminal ectodomain residues required for Dsg1-dependent adhesion, or (c) association with PG. Instead, our results demonstrate that Dsg1 is required for dampening EGFR&#x02013;Erk1/2 signaling in the suprabasal layers, thus allowing for the progression of keratinocytes toward a more differentiated phenotype. Collectively, these experiments reveal that desmosomal cadherin functions transcend adhesion by networking with cell surface receptors that control epithelial morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Dsg1 is required for suprabasal morphogenesis of organotypic human epidermal cultures</title><p>The analysis of Dsg1 function in vivo is complicated by the presence of two additional and highly homologous genes (<italic>dsg1-&#x003b2;</italic> and <italic>dsg1-&#x003b3;</italic>) with overlapping expression patterns to <italic>dsg1-&#x003b1;</italic> in the epidermis of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennan et al., 2004</xref>).

As expected, Dsg1 was primarily found in the suprabasal layers that formed after 9 d at an air&#x02013;liquid interface, whereas Dsg3 was immunolocalized between adjacent basal keratinocytes and was more abundant in the lower epidermal cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To test whether Dsg1 adhesive functions were conserved in these three-dimensional cultures, keratinocytes were matured on rafts for 9 d and then incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of recombinant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> exfoliative toxin A (ETA; acute ETA treatment), a Ser protease which specifically cleaves after a Glu residue (381) located between EC3 and EC4 of Dsg1 but does not target other cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amagai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanakawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagasaka et al., 2004</xref>). Similar to the phenotypic outcome in humans with ETA-induced bullous impetigo or Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, efficient removal of EC1&#x02013;3 from Dsg1 in mature rafts resulted in prominent areas of dissociation between adjacent keratinocytes in the uppermost cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). These regions corresponded to cell layers in which Dsg1 expression was most abundant and which further lacked Dsg3. Importantly, ETA had no effect on the protein levels or integrity of Dsg3 or the related Dsg2 and Dsg4, with the latter two found in lower abundance in raft cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and D</xref>). These observations helped validate the raft model for Dsg1 functional analysis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Differentiation-dependent Dsg1 maintains adhesion in the superficial layers of epidermal raft cultures.</bold> (A) IHC analysis of Dsg1 and Dsg3 in frozen sections prepared from 9-d-old rafts.

To address this possibility, we silenced Dsg1 expression in raft cultures using retroviruses engineered to express microRNA (miRNA)-like sequences specific for this desmosomal cadherin (miR DG1) or lamin A/C (miR Lmn) as a control. Unlike lamin A/C&#x02013;silenced rafts, there was a marked disorganization in the suprabasal layers that formed in Dsg1-deficient cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>).

Also, note that ETA-treated cultures retained a cleaved fragment (aa 382&#x02013;1,049) of Dsg1 at intercellular borders, as revealed by staining with an antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of Dsg1 (Dsg1 cyto), whereas the extracellular epitope (aa 1&#x02013;381) was effectively removed by ETA (inset).

Consistent with previous studies in which truncated desmosomal cadherins were introduced into epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serpente et al., 2000</xref>), EM analysis revealed adhesive defects in these ETA-treated rafts with a reduction in suprabasal desmosome density similar to that observed upon Dsg1 silencing (Fig. S3). In stark contrast to miR DG1 rafts, chronic removal of the Dsg1 EC1&#x02013;3 did not appreciably alter the cellular organization or size of suprabasal cells, which differentiated normally and remained grossly intact despite 6 d of constant exposure to ETA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;D</xref>). As in the case of acute ETA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), the other desmosomal cadherins remained intact in raft cultures chronically exposed to ETA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809044/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). However, similar to immature embryonic and neonatal human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2000</xref>), Dsg3 was more broadly distributed throughout all viable layers in the earlier 6-d-old raft cultures treated with ETA WT or ETA mut (Fig. S4) or silenced for Dsg1 expression (Fig. S1), perhaps contributing to the overall maintenance of tissue integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3 A</xref>) compared with acute ETA treatment at day 9, when the uppermost cell layers lack Dsg3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Collectively, these observations demonstrated that, in spite of comparable alterations in cell&#x02013;cell adhesion in both Dsg1 cleavage and Dsg1 knockdown conditions, differentiation was impaired only in cells lacking Dsg1 altogether, indicating that the residual cleaved Dsg1 (aa 382&#x02013;1,049) supported normal morphogenesis.</p><p>To establish that impaired progression through the differentiation program was a direct result of Dsg1 deficiency, a full-length Dsg1 cDNA with silent point mutations rendering it resistant to miR DG1 was simultaneously introduced along with retroviral miRNA into keratinocytes that were differentiated in rafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) as well as submerged cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The reconstitution of Dsg1 was capable of increasing the levels of Dsc1, K10, and loricrin in raft cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Importantly, ETA-mediated cleavage of the EC1&#x02013;3 domains of this Dsg1 rescue construct still allowed for restoration of these structural markers of keratinocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). These data provided direct evidence that Dsg1 can promote keratinocyte differentiation even when the N-terminal residues required for adhesion have been removed.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Reconstitution of Dsg1 restores epidermal differentiation despite ectodomain cleavage.</bold> (A) Western blot analysis of keratinocytes cotransduced with miR Lmn or miR DG1 (DG1 KD) and either EGFP (DG1 Resc &#x02212;) or silencing refractory WT or PG-binding mutant (AAA) Dsg1 constructs and then grown as raft cultures. Although Dsg1 was more efficiently silenced at day 3 (top), modest silencing was still evident at day 6 (bottom) with concomitant reduction of differentiation markers. Cotransduction with either miR-resistant Dsg1 WT or Dsg1 AAA was sufficient to increase Dsg1 levels and restore Dsc1/K10/loricrin levels to that of controls. (B) Similar rescue experiments were performed in submerged culture in which Dsg1 silencing was more efficient. Silencing of Dsg1 (DG1 KD) resulted in a decrease in Dsc1/K10 levels, and this deficiency was rescued by the silencing-resistant Dsg1 (DG1 Resc +; third lane) but not a susceptible WT Dsg1 construct (DG1 Resc &#x02212;; second lane).

Moreover, the low levels of Dsg4 protein in developing raft cultures did not change in response to Dsg1 silencing or cleavage (unpublished data). In addition, Dsg4 was limited to a single superficial cell layer in 6-d-old raft cultures, and this distribution did not change in ETA-treated or knockdown rafts (unpublished data). However, Dsg1 silencing led to a coordinate reduction in Dsc1, including at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>), and ectopic Dsg1 expression was capable of increasing Dsc1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Getsios et al., 2004</xref>). As Dsc1 plays an important role in epidermal integrity and differentiation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chidgey et al., 2001</xref>), it was possible that Dsg1 initiated a cascade of events leading to the induction of Dsc1, which, in turn, was responsible for differentiation. We tested this possibility by silencing Dsc1 expression and asking whether this desmosomal cadherin was required for Dsg1-mediated differentiation. Ectopic expression of Dsg1 in submerged keratinocyte cultures was sufficient to increase markers of terminal differentiation, including Dsc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>).

Although this receptor Tyr kinase continues to be expressed in the suprabasal epidermis, which is coordinated with the induction of Dsg1, it is no longer active upon stratification, allowing these cells to adopt a more differentiated phenotype. The inability of a soluble Dsg1 tail to regulate keratinocyte differentiation suggests that localization is important. This observation led us to speculate that Dsg1 might be required to suppress EGFR signaling in the suprabasal layers and allow for normal progression through the epidermal differentiation program. In support of this possibility, phosphorylated EGFR was largely restricted to the basal layer of control rafts, but sustained activation and expansion of this activated receptor into the suprabasal layers were found after Dsg1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). The reciprocal relationship between EGFR activity and Dsg1 was examined in more detail by ectopic expression of this desmosomal cadherin in submerged keratinocytes.

Our findings predict that shifting the balance toward Dsg1 would cause premature differentiation, whereas the absence of Dsg1 in the suprabasal epidermis is expected to limit differentiation via the sustained activity of EGFR&#x02013;Erk1/2. Consistent with animal models in which Dsg2 has been transgenically overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennan et al., 2007</xref>), increasing this desmosomal cadherin in the suprabasal layers can compete with Dsg1 function and promote persistent EGFR&#x02013;Erk1/2 signaling and impaired differentiation.

Although the activation of these downstream kinases were commonly elevated in Dsg1-deficient keratinocytes (shown for AKT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>), the inhibition of these signaling pathways was not sufficient to restore differentiation as in the case of Erk1/2 suppression (not depicted). These findings suggest that Erk1/2 suppression is specifically required for Dsg1-mediated differentiation, which is consistent with a recent study on EGFR-mediated effects on keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kolev et al., 2008</xref>). In particular, inhibition of p38 MAPK did not rescue differentiation or alter the Erk1/2 pathway other than the expected down-regulation of the common MAPK target c-Fos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). In contrast, U0126 restored differentiation and was shown to decrease the levels of activated Erk1/2 and a specific target of the EGFR&#x02013;Erk pathway, EphA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>), without changing the activation of other EGFR effectors such as AKT.

However, because Dsg1 is first expressed as keratinocytes transit into the suprabasal layers, we considered an additional function for Dsg1 in regulating the differentiated state of epidermal cells. To define the role of Dsg1, we used gain- and loss-of-function approaches in a simplified in vitro model of human epidermis. These experiments revealed that Dsg1 is not only required for maintaining epidermal tissue integrity but also plays a key role in morphogenesis. Importantly, Dsg1 promotes epidermal differentiation in a manner that involves proper down-regulation of EGFR&#x02013;Erk1/2 signaling but does not rely on ectodomain residues required for adhesion, the ability to bind PG, or coordinated Dsc1 expression. These experiments place Dsg1 in an early instructive pathway that directs the progression of keratinocytes through a terminal differentiation program.</p><p>Our data support a model in which Dsg1 acts as an important node in an epidermal adhesion and signaling network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Keratinocytes held together by desmosomal cadherins in the basal layer are capable of responding to signals from EGFR to maintain steady-state proliferation in the epidermis. We propose that induction of Dsg1 serves to facilitate progression into a terminally differentiated state, at least in part, by preventing the sustained activation of the EGFR&#x02013;Erk1/2 pathway in the suprabasal layers. However, basal layer desmosomal cadherins such as Dsg2 and Dsc3 might potentiate these growth promoting signals. In support of this possibility, transgenic misexpression of Dsg2 or Dsc3 in the suprabasal layers of mice results in elevated Erk1/2 signaling and impaired differentiation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hardman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennan et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, basal and suprabasal desmosomal cadherins with opposing signaling potentials could serve to balance keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation to maintain epidermal tissue homeostasis.</p><p>Dsg4 exhibits a highly differentiation-dependent expression pattern in the human epidermis, being expressed in the uppermost viable cell layers above Dsg1, Dsc1, and K1/10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazzi et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, the expression of these suprabasal proteins is unchanged in Dsg4 mutant mice that instead exhibit defects in hair follicle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kljuic et al., 2003</xref>). In the present study, Dsg4 levels and distribution also remained unchanged in 6-d-old raft cultures in response to Dsg1 silencing or cleavage. Thus, Dsg4 likely plays a temporally and functionally distinct role from Dsg1, which is active in earlier epidermal differentiation events. However, coordination of desmosomal cadherin expression and growth factor signaling may be in play during hair follicle differentiation, where loss of Dsg4 or EGFR leads to premature differentiation of these keratinocytes with resultant hair defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kljuic et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Directly interfering with desmosomal cadherin adhesion using small peptides that target EC1 of Dsg2 and Dsc2 disrupted epithelial positioning in an organotypic model of mammary alveolar morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Runswick et al., 2001</xref>). The possibility that, in addition, desmosomal cadherins play supra-adhesive roles in development is supported by the observation that Dsg2- and Dsc3-null mutant mouse embryos die before desmosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eshkind et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Den et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we show that ETA-cleaved Dsg1 supports normal epidermal morphogenesis, demonstrating that this transmembrane protein can orchestrate a key signaling pathway in a manner that does not depend on ectodomain residues required for adhesion. E-cadherin, which is present in all viable epidermal cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hirai et al., 1989</xref>) has also been found to inhibit EGFR signaling, although downstream Erk1/2 phosphorylation was largely unaffected upon direct ligation of its adhesive ectodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perrais et al., 2007</xref>).

Therefore, the necessity of Dsg1 to suppress EGFR&#x02013;Erk1/2 signaling and promote differentiation in a manner that does not require its adhesive ectodomain appears to be distinct from E-cadherin and represents a novel mechanism by which the activity of this receptor Tyr kinase can be regulated upon stratification.</p><p>The Dsg1 tail itself was unable to promote keratinocyte differentiation, although the cytoplasmic domain likely contributes to epidermal morphogenesis when anchored at the plasma membrane. Importantly, Dsg1's ability to recruit PG was not essential for triggering keratinocyte differentiation. This raises the possibility that the extended cytoplasmic tail of Dsg1, which harbors several additional regions outside of the catenin-binding site and not present in other cadherins, may recruit cytoplasmic proteins to the cell surface to regulate EGFR function. One such candidate could be the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family member, merlin, which has been shown to prevent EGFR signaling by sequestration of this receptor Tyr kinase into a more insoluble pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 2008</xref>) in a manner similar to ectopic Dsg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of Dsg1, the sustained activation of EGFR&#x02013;Erk1/2 in the suprabasal layers impaired differentiation without major changes in steady-state proliferation (Fig. S2). Because keratinocytes in different epidermal layers exhibit distinct responses to Ras-mediated Erk signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailleul et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1998</xref>), it is not too surprising that proliferation was unaltered by Dsg1 deficiency. However, our data support the notion that persistence of EGFR&#x02013;Erk1/2 in the suprabasal layers prevents the induction of K10, which is not only a critical component of the intermediate filament network in differentiated keratinocytes but also limits the size of these cells in the upper layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reichelt and Magin, 2002</xref>). This could help explain why suprabasal keratinocytes lacking Dsg1 are larger and more variable in size compared with their WT counterparts and may contribute to persistent Erk1/2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reichelt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yano et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, Erk1/2 can activate CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family members, which have been shown to regulate Dsc promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). This might account for the defects in Dsc1 expression beyond posttranslational stabilization of this Dsg1-binding partner in the suprabasal layers. In support of this possibility, Dsc1 mRNA levels are markedly reduced upon Dsg1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). The ability of Dsg1 to induce Dsc1 expression is likely an important step in constructing robust adhesion complexes in the suprabasal epidermis because Dsg1-deficient rafts have desmosome defects (Fig. S3), but Dsc1 is not absolutely required for aspects of the Dsg1-mediated differentiation pathway reported in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, skin blisters are not common in individuals with Dsg1 haploinsufficiency, who instead exhibit thickening in specific regions of the epidermis, which undergo extensive mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rickman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wan et al., 2004</xref>). Alterations in the epithelial thickness were not apparent in Dsg1-deficient rafts, which might reflect differences in how keratinocytes respond to the lack of Dsg1 in situ because of signaling contributions from other cellular compartments such as the underlying dermis and immune system. Although reduced adhesion may account for some of these skin defects, our data raise the possibility of the EGFR&#x02013;Erk1/2 signaling pathway as a novel therapeutic target for restoring epidermal architecture in patients with hyperkeratotic skin disease.</p><p>In summary, we have uncovered a novel role for desmosomal cadherins in epithelial differentiation by limiting the signaling potential of other cell surface receptors. In particular, Dsg1 is required for suppressing EGFR&#x02013;Erk1/2 signaling to allow for normal epidermal differentiation and morphogenesis in a manner that does not rely on its adhesive capability but more likely on unique properties of the cytoplasmic tail or binding partners that are regulated by this extended region. Therefore, Dsg1 has multiple roles in the epidermis: instructing an early epidermal differentiation program upon stratification and maintaining robust adhesion in the uppermost layers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of cDNA and miRNA constructs</title><p>The full-length human Dsg1 cDNA with a C-terminal Flag epitope in pTRE (p812) and pLZRS-Linker (p1007) along with pLZRS-pBMN-EGFP (p990) have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Getsios et al., 2004</xref>). An miRNA-resistant Dsg1 construct was generated from p812 by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) to incorporate two silent point mutations within the miR DG1 target region.
