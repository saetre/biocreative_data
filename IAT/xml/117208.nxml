In addition, numerous co-regulatory proteins are found in the Srb&#x0002f;Mediator complex, which is physically associated with RNA polymerase II via the C-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit and, together with the polymerase and a subset of general transcription factors, forms the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c1">1</xref>).</p><p>Classic activators (e.g. Gal4, VP16, E2F-1 and Gcn4) usually contain acidic, negatively charged activation domains and their activation function is exerted through interactions with various components of the transcription machinery, thereby recruiting RNA polymerase II and associated factors to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c4">4</xref>). Fusion of a heterologous DNA binding domain to a component of the transcription machinery, such as the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c7">7</xref>), TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c9">9</xref>), TBP-associated factors (TAF<sub>II</sub>s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c11">11</xref>), various Srb proteins and Gal11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c14">14</xref>) can activate transcription in the absence of a classic activation domain, proving that recruitment of the transcription machinery is the predominant role of the activation domain.</p><p>Transcriptional repressors can be either general or gene specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c15">15</xref>). General repressors usually act through the general transcription machinery and negatively regulate a broad class of functionally unrelated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c15">15</xref>).</p><p>For example, Mot1 or NC2 (Dr1&#x0002f;Drap) function via interactions with TBP, preventing the association of TBP with DNA or other general factors, such as TFIIA or TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c18">18</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c19">19</xref>).</p><p>Gene specific repressors regulate the expression of a defined group of genes. Some act by binding to the activation domains of gene specific activators and thereby inhibit their function (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c20">20</xref>). Other gene specific repressors bind sequences in the upstream regulatory regions of their target genes and recruit other repressor proteins, which then act to repress transcription. For example, the yeast protein Ume6 or the mammalian proteins YY1 and Mad recruit histone deacetylases that deacetylate nucleosomal histones and produce a transcriptionally inactive chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c25">25</xref>). In contrast, the yeast repressors Mig1, &#x003b1;2 or Crt1 recruit the co-repressor complex Tup1&#x0002f;Ssn6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c29">29</xref>), which is thought to inhibit gene expression via interactions with components of the transcription apparatus or by modifying chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c32">32</xref>). Transcriptional repression is also mediated by the kinase&#x02013;cyclin pair Srb10&#x0002f;11 found in the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c33">33</xref>). The Srb10 kinase phosphorylates the CTD of RNA polymerase II prior to stable association of the polymerase with promoter DNA and, thus, prevents the formation of a transcriptionally competent initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c34">34</xref>). Srb10 is not a general repressor of transcription. Genome-wide analysis of <italic>srb10</italic> mutants has shown that it is required for repression of a defined subset of genes (&#x0223c;3&#x00025; of the genome), half of which belong to the group of genes induced by nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c35">35</xref>).</p><p>Tethering of repressor proteins to promoter regions by a heterologous DNA binding domain, as in the case of Lex&#x02013;Tup1, Lex&#x02013;Ssn6, Lex&#x02013;Srb10, Lex&#x02013;Sin3 or Lex&#x02013;Rpd3, results in repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c36">36</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a novel yeast protein, Xtc1, was identified using an <italic>in vitro</italic> crosslinking technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c37">37</xref>). Xtc1 could be covalently crosslinked in a promoter-dependent manner to the activation domain of a photoactive derivative of Lex&#x02013;E2F-1 in an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription system. It was also shown to bind directly and specifically to the activation domains of two other acidic activators, Gal4 and VP16, and to co-purify with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c37">37</xref>). The interaction of Xtc1 with acidic activation domains positively correlated with their ability to activate transcription. Emili <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that Xtc1 could act to regulate the response of RNA polymerase II to transcriptional activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c37">37</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, this same protein has also been implicated to function in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) recombination and maintenance in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c38">38</xref>), and to be involved in repair of oxidative damage to the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c39">39</xref>). Thus, two different functions have been proposed for Xtc1: one is regulation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and the other is regulation of mtDNA recombination, maintenance and repair.</p><p>In this report we have further analyzed the function of Xtc1 in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II and its subcellular localization in yeast cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>The reporters for monitoring &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f1">1</xref> and were integrated at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains GGY1<sub>tH</sub> (<italic>gal4 gal80 tyr1 ade leu2 his3 ura3 trp1::HIS3</italic>), NLY2 (&#x00394;<italic>gal4</italic> &#x00394;<italic>gal80 ura3 his3 leu2 trp1 lys2</italic>), and &#x00394;<italic>srb10</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>srb11</italic> derivatives of NLY2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c30">30</xref>).

To better characterize the function of Xtc1 in transcription regulation, we tested the <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription function of a fusion of Xtc1 to the heterologous DNA binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1), using a chromosomally integrated <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter construct containing Gcn4 and Gal4 binding sites upstream of the yeast <italic>GAL1</italic> core promoter (Fig. 1, reporter GG9). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f2">2</xref>A, Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 repressed transcription of the reporter gene to 40&#x00025; of the activity obtained with the DNA binding domain alone. To eliminate the possibilty that transcriptional repression is a result of steric hindrance in the context of GG9, where the repressor is bound downstream of the activator, we also tested the repression function of Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 using the reporter SS38-3, in which Gal4 binding sites are positioned upstream of Gcn4 binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f1">1</xref>). A similar level of repression by Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 was observed in the context of SS38-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f2">2</xref>A), arguing against a steric hindrance mechanism of repression. Furthermore, repression by Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 is dependent on tethering Xtc1 to the promoter region by the Gal4 DNA binding domain, since no repression was observed in the absence of Gal4 binding sites in the reporter or with Xtc1 lacking the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f2">2</xref>A, reporter SS36; data not shown).</p><p>We next tested whether Xtc1 was also able to repress transcription in a different promoter context using a reporter plasmid containing the LexA operator upstream of the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter driving the expression of <italic>lacZ</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f1">1</xref>, JK1621). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f2">2</xref>B shows that Lex&#x02013;Xtc1 also repressed transcription of a reporter gene in the context of the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter.</p><p>In order to identify the regions of Xtc1 required for transcriptional repression, we sequentially deleted 50, 75 and 100 amino acids from the N-terminus and 50 and 100 amino acids from the C-terminus of Xtc1, and fused them to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f3">3</xref>A shows that deletion of 50 or 75 N-terminal amino acids, or 50 or 100 C-terminal amino acids did not compromise the ability of Xtc1 to repress transcription of the reporter gene. However, the deletion mutant that lacks the N-terminal 100 amino acids (&#x00394;N100) no longer repressed transcription, but rather exhibited higher &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity than the DNA binding domain alone.</p><p>Therefore, the repression domain of Xtc1 maps to the fragment between amino acids 75 and 100 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f3">3</xref>A). This fragment has a positive charge of &#x0002b;3 and a number of hydrophobic (Val&#x0002b;Leu) residues. The identified repression domain was sufficient to repress expression of the reporter gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f3">3</xref>A, see construct RD 75&#x02013;100), but to a slightly lesser extent than the full length protein.</p><p>The activation potential of the construct &#x00394;N100 was also assayed using the reporter RY171 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f1">1</xref>), which is analogous to GG9, but lacks Gcn4 binding sites and it is, therefore, not activated. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f3">3</xref>B, the C-terminal domain of Xtc1 activated transcription of the reporter gene 3-fold, compared with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Thus, in addition to the repression domain, Xtc1 bears a weak activation domain in the C-terminal part of the protein.</p><p>Expression of all Gal4 fusion proteins, except the construct containing the repression domain (RD 75&#x02013;100), was confirmed by western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f4">4</xref>; data not shown). Since we were able to observe repression with the construct RD 75&#x02013;100, we believe it is expressed in yeast but possibly to a lower level than the other fusions. Also, we were unable to demonstrate expression of the deletion mutant &#x00394;N100 in strain GGY1<sub>tH</sub>::GG9, but were able to do so in strain GGY1<sub>tH</sub>::RY171, in which this construct also activated transcription. Therefore, we think that the construct &#x00394;N100 is expressed in both yeast strains, but that it is either rapidly degraded or inefficiently extracted in our extract preparations from strain GGY1<sub>tH</sub>::GG9.</p><p>Xtc1 has been shown to co-purify with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c37">37</xref>) and could possibly functionally interact with other holoenzyme components in exerting its repression function. Therefore, we tested whether repression by Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 required the function of the holoenzyme components Srb10 and&#x0002f;or Srb11. The reporter SS38-3 was integrated in the <italic>URA3</italic> locus of strains deleted for genes encoding either Srb10 or Srb11 and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were assayed. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf366tb1">1</xref> shows that, in contrast to wild-type cells where Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 repressed transcription 2-fold compared with control levels, repression was abolished in the &#x00394;<italic>srb10</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>srb11</italic> strains. The expression of the Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 fusion was not affected in the deletion strains (data not shown).</p><p>These data suggest that Xtc1 functionally interacts with the kinase&#x02013;cyclin pair Srb10&#x0002f;11 to repress gene transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization of Xtc1</title><p>As mentioned previously, Xtc1 was implicated not only in regulating RNA polymerase II dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c37">37</xref>), but also to function in the maintenance, recombination and repair of the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c39">39</xref>). These two processes occur in separated cellular compartments, the nucleus and the mitochondria, which prompted us to determine the subcellular localization of Xtc1.</p><p>To that end, we fused GFP to the C- or N-terminus of Xtc1 and looked at its subcellular localization by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>Wild-type yeast cells were transformed with plasmids containing either N- or C-terminal fusions of Xtc1 to GFP and grown in selective media at 30&#x000b0;C to mid-log phase. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA were visualized by DAPI staining.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f5">5</xref>A, when GFP was attached to the C-terminus of Xtc1, GFP&#x02013;Xtc1 localized exclusively in the mitochondria; however, the N-terminal GFP fusion to Xtc1 could be seen in both nuclear and mitochondrial compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf366f5">5</xref>B). The C-terminal GFP&#x02013;Xtc1 fusion expressed from plasmid pGFP-C-Xtc1 is functional for complementation of the petite phenotype of an <italic>XTC1</italic> deletion strain. Interestingly, the N-terminal fusion could not complement the petite phenotype of the <italic>XTC1</italic> deletion strain, even though it localized to the mitochondria, suggesting that the N-terminal fusion of GFP obstructs an interaction required for full mitochondrial function. Similarly, the fact that the N- but not the C-terminal fusion localizes to the nucleus suggests that fusing GFP to the C-terminus of Xtc1 precludes an interaction important for nuclear localization. At present, we have been unable to define a specific nuclear phenotype for the <italic>XTC1</italic> deletion strain given the pleiotropic effect of the petite phenotype and thus cannot test for nuclear function complementation.</p><p>The fact that we could localize Xtc1 to both the nucleus and the mitochondria is in agreement with the two proposed functions for this protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The yeast protein Xtc1 was identified as a protein that binds directly and specifically to the activation domains of the acidic activators E2F-1, Gal4 and VP16, and co-purifies with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex. Binding to acidic activators positively correlated with their ability to activate transcription and Emili <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that Xtc1 may act as a factor that modulates the response of RNA polymerase II to transcriptional activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c37">37</xref>). Various activator binding proteins and RNA polymerase II holoenzyme components are able to influence reporter gene expression when tethered to the promoter region by a heterologous DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c43">43</xref>). Therefore, to further address the transcription function of Xtc1, we used a Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 fusion and assayed its ability to regulate expression of a synthetic <italic>lacZ</italic>-based reporter containing Gcn4 and Gal4 binding sites upstream of a <italic>GAL1</italic> core promoter. Our results show that Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 inhibits reporter gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Repression by Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 was observed regardless of whether Gal4 binding sites were upstream or downstream of Gcn4 binding sites. These data argue against a steric hindrance mechanism of repression, in which DNA-bound Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 would simply sterically impede activation by Gcn4. In addition, Xtc1 was also able to repress transcription in the <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter context.</p><p>By sequentially deleting 50, 75 and 100 amino acids from the N-terminus, or 50 and 100 amino acids from the C-terminus, we have shown that, as is the case for other repressors such as Eve, Kr&#x000fc;ppel or Mig1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c46">46</xref>), Xtc1 contains a small, 25 amino acid long repression domain, which is located between amino acids 75 and 100. This domain bears a positive charge of &#x0002b;3, and positively charged fragments have been found to repress transcription when fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c47">47</xref>). However, in contrast to the repression domain of Xtc1, the peptides identified by Saha <italic>et al.</italic> had, in principle, a higher degree of basicity, and it was shown that the degree of basicity positively correlates with the strength of repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c47">47</xref>). In that respect, the small positive charge of the Xtc1 repression domain could account for the relatively weak repression of 2&#x02013;2.5-fold, observed with Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1. The 25 amino acid long repression domain was sufficient to inhibit transcription when fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, although to a lesser extent than the full length protein.</p><p>Interestingly, the construct which lacked the N-terminal 100 amino acids of Xtc1 showed higher &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities than the DNA binding domain alone, both in the context of the Gcn4-activated reporter and with the reporter which lacks Gcn4 binding sites. These data demonstrate that Xtc1 bears an activation domain in its C-terminal portion. The activation potential of this domain is weak, activating transcription 3-fold, in contrast to strong activators, such as VP16, which activates transcription 1000-fold in the same reporter context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c48">48</xref>). Other transcriptional regulators, such as some hormone receptors or p53, also contain separate activation and repression domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c52">52</xref>), and many holoenzyme components have been implicated to function in both activation and repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c56">56</xref>). It has recently been shown that the yeast co-repressor complex Tup1&#x0002f;Ssn6 can switch to a co-activator of <italic>CIT2</italic>, when recruited to its promoter by the activator Rtg3, in response to mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c57">57</xref>). The Ssn6 component was critical for both the interaction with Rtg3 and the co-activator function, and different domains of the Ssn6 protein were required for the function of the complex in activation versus repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c57">57</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that Xtc1 can positively regulate transcription at certain genes, or in a different physiological context, and that this function is exerted through its C-terminal domain.</p><p>Since it has been shown that Xtc1 co-purifies with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex, it seemed plausible to assume that it functionally interacts with other holoenzyme components to repress gene expression. Among holoenzyme components involved in repression, the best characterized is the Srb10&#x0002f;11 kinase&#x02013;cyclin pair that negatively regulates transcription by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, thereby preventing stable preinitiation complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c34">34</xref>). Srb10&#x0002f;11 function is also required for repression by the artificial repressor protein Lex&#x02013;Tup1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c58">58</xref>). We tested whether Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 functionally interacted with the kinase&#x02013;cyclin pair Srb10&#x0002f;11 in repressing gene expression, by assaying its repression function in strains deleted for <italic>SRB10</italic> or <italic>SRB11</italic> and found that repression by Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 was abolished in the &#x00394;<italic>srb10</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>srb11</italic> mutants, showing that Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 requires Srb10 and Srb11 to efficiently repress transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. The fact that Xtc1 was able to repress transcription in different promoter contexts also suggests that it may act through the general machinery to inhibit gene expression. Since Srb10 does not globally affect transcription and represses only a subset of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c35">35</xref>), there must be a mechanism to differentiate between Srb10-dependent and -independent promoters. It is possible that different RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complexes are recruited at Srb10-dependent versus Srb10-independent promoters, and that the presence or absence of Xtc1 discriminates between different types of holoenzyme. Xtc1 could help recruit the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme at Srb10-dependent genes by interacting with a promoter specific factor. It is also possible that the presence of Xtc1 stimulates the kinase activity of Srb10, which is presumably inactive at genes that are not negatively regulated by this kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c34">34</xref>). If Gal4&#x02013;Xtc1 recruited a repression-specific type of holoenzyme with an active Srb10 kinase to the promoter, this would result in the observed repression of transcription. Similarly, Srb10 also represses transcription of a reporter gene when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c36">36</xref>).</p><p>In addition to regulation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, it was also proposed that Xtc1 functions in homologous recombination, maintenance and repair of mitochondrial DNA in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c39">39</xref>). Since these two processes occur in different cellular organelles, namely the nucleus and the mitochondria, we determined the subcellular localization of Xtc1 using a fusion to the GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c40">40</xref>). By using fusions of GFP to either the C- or N-terminal part of the protein, we found an interesting localization pattern: when GFP was fused to the C-terminus of the Xtc1 protein, the fusion localized to the mitochondria and was excluded from the nucleus. However, the N-terminal GFP&#x02013;Xtc1 fusion localized to both organelles. There are a number of possible explanations for this localization pattern. Perhaps the C-terminus of Xtc1 has to be free for it to be localized to the nucleus, possibly by interacting with another protein required for its transport into the nucleus. Alternatively, two different forms of Xtc1 could exist in the cell: the full length protein that localizes to the mitochondria and the protein truncated at the C-terminus, which localizes to the nucleus. The latter would not be seen when GFP is attached to the C-terminal part of Xtc1, because any putative processing&#x0002f;cleavage events at the C-terminus would also result in release of the GFP moiety.</p><p>It is interesting to note that there is precedence for both yeast proteins, such as the helicase Pif1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c60">60</xref>) or the DNA repair protein Ntg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c61">61</xref>), and mammalian proteins (for example the human DNA glycoslyases hOGG1 and hNTH1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf366c62">62</xref>), localizing to the nucleus and the mitochodria and having either the same or a totally different function in each organelle.</p><p>The fact that we found that Xtc1 could be localized to both the nucleus and the mitochondria is consistent with the two proposed functions for this protein, one in the regulation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and the other in mtDNA physiology. Although we cannnot rule out the possibilty that the nuclear and mitochondrial functions of Xtc1 are related, the dual localization in both organelles suggests that the two functions could be functionally and physically separated.</p><p>Future efforts will focus on finding Xtc1 target genes using whole genome transcription profiling of mutant strains and on identifying its protein interaction partners in the cell, both of which should allow us to better characterize the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of Xtc1.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf366f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The reporters used for &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkf36601"/></fig><fig id="gkf366f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p> Repression by Xtc1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays for all experiments were performed from at least three independent transformants assayed in triplicate and the standard error was between 10 and 20&#x00025;.
