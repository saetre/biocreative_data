In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> they form multimeric complexes that bind to specific DNA regulatory elements named PcG response elements (PREs). To date, few PREs have been identified and the chromosomal distribution of PcG proteins during development is unknown. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with genomic tiling path microarrays to analyze the binding profile of the PcG proteins Polycomb (PC) and Polyhomeotic (PH) across 10 Mb of euchromatin. We also analyzed the distribution of GAGA factor (GAF), a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that is found at most previously identified PREs. Our data show that PC and PH often bind to clustered regions within large loci that encode transcription factors which play multiple roles in developmental patterning and in the regulation of cell proliferation. GAF co-localizes with PC and PH to a limited extent, suggesting that GAF is not a necessary component of chromatin at PREs. Finally, the chromosome-association profile of PC and PH changes during development, suggesting that the function of these proteins in the regulation of some of their target genes might be more dynamic than previously anticipated. </p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The authors map the GAGA factor and Polycomb group proteins PC and PH to <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromosomes.

The data show fundamental differences between GAF and the two PRC1 members PC and PH. GAF binds a substantially larger number of sites in the genome compared to PC and PH. Moreover, GAF has a tendency to bind to narrow chromatin regions while PC and PH are spread over larger regions ranging in size from several kb to hundreds of kb. PC and PH bind to large genes, encoding for transcription factors with multiple developmental roles. Finally, we found that the developmental binding profile of PC and PH is dynamic. New binding sites appear at late stages, while some of them&#x02014;present in embryos&#x02014;disappear during late development. These previously unsuspected dynamics suggest that these proteins might play other regulatory functions in addition to maintenance of embryonic patterns of gene expression during development. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Analysis of Protein Distribution Profiles using Montpellier&#x02013;Yale Microarrays</title><p>We developed a genomic <italic>Drosophila</italic> DNA microarray by combining a tiling path containing 2.9 Mb of the <italic>Adh</italic> region on the left arm of Chromosome 2 (2L) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; with a tiling path covering 7 Mb of the tip of the X chromosome and with several smaller genomic regions of interest and control sequences such as known PREs of the BX-C, the <italic>ph</italic> and the <italic>en</italic> genes. This will be referred to in this paper as the Montpellier&#x02013;Yale (MY) arrays (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Tables S1</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st003">S3</xref> for a description of array assembly). Using these arrays, we analyzed binding profiles of PC, PH, and GAF at four developmental stages: embryos, pupae, adult males, and adult females. For each stage, two to three fully independent ChIP on chip experiments have been performed (an example of the hybridization result is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). A series of controls allowed monitoring the efficiency of the ChIP in each sample. The PREs regulating the genes <italic>en</italic> and <italic>ph,</italic> as well as the PREs of the BX-C <italic>Fab-7</italic> and <italic>Mcp,</italic> are known to recruit the three proteins (with the exception of <italic>Mcp,</italic> which recruits PC and PH but not GAF), and they were used as positive controls (the enrichments found in each condition are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref>). For negative controls, we did not know a priori any DNA fragment that would not be bound by any of these factors at any developmental stage. However, from the biological data available on these proteins we reasoned that they might bind a minor fraction of the genome. Therefore, we added on to the microarrays 37 randomly selected DNA fragments that are unrelated to known PC, PH, or GAF target genes and that are located at scattered positions throughout the genome. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of the fragments from this set are not bound by any of the three proteins ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref>). </p><p>A further validation of the ChIP profile for the GAF protein was obtained from a comparison of the ChIP on chip data with the profile already described &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d; by using an independent method (DamID), which is based on transfection of proteins fusing the Dam methylase enzyme to the factor of interest &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. The target loci are methylated by the Dam moiety of the fusion protein, and the methylated DNA fragments can be recovered and hybridized to microarrays along with a control sample where only the Dam protein is transfected. With this method, the binding profile of GAF in the same <italic>Adh</italic> region that was spotted on MY arrays was obtained &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. The comparison between the DamID profile and the ChIP on chip profile ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g001">Figure 1</xref>) shows a high degree of overlap with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.37, although the samples are obtained from different biological sources (embryos for ChIP versus cultured Kc cells for DamID). </p><p>The genomic regions covered in MY arrays are schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. The chromosomal profile of each protein was visualized by plotting the normalized fold change (FC) between IP and control IP samples on the <italic>y</italic>-axis versus the position of each fragment on the <italic>x</italic>-axis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the chromosomal distribution of PH in embryos, as an example of the profiles that were obtained.

A large portion of the fragments was not enriched, and hybridized similarly to the control IP sample, while strong enrichments were seen at a limited number of specific domains. </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Correspondence of PC/PH ChIP Sites with Cytological Mapping in Polytene Chromosomes</title><p>On the tip of the X chromosome, five PC/PH cytological binding sites were described on polytene chromosomes of third instar larval salivary glands &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. These sites map at cytological locations 2D1&#x02013;4; 4C1,2; 5A5,6; 5D1,2; and 7B. In the Chromosome 2L path, cytological sites 34D, 35B, 35D1, and 36A1 are bound by both PC and PH. The binding profiles from ChIP on chip at the embryonic stage show PC and PH binding at all these locations except 34D. In addition, we detected binding at locations 3A3, 4B4&#x02013;6, 6D7, 7A2&#x02013;7, and 35C2, which are not reported to be bound in polytene chromosomes. This indicates that the salivary gland tissue contains a subset of the total target sites, consistent with some degree of tissue specificity for PcG protein binding. </p><p>Since there is a degree of uncertainty on the location of any given polytene band in immunostaining experiments and in genomic databases, we wished to directly confirm the correspondence between the cytological location of the ChIP on chip fragments with polytene chromosome mapping. To this aim, we conducted immuno-FISH experiments on polytene chromosomes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d; with four different probes mapping to sites 4C1,2; 5A5,6; 5D1,2; and 7B (FISH probes corresponding to peaks 1, 2, 3, and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). These probes correspond to PC/PH binding sites located in the gene loci <italic>bifid,</italic> CG4136, <italic>mab-2,</italic> and <italic>cut</italic>. In all cases the FISH signal co-localized perfectly with a cytological binding site for both PC and PH ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Together with the correspondence between ChIP data and the polytene signal at the <italic>ph</italic> gene locus &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, this shows that the regions enriched in ChIP on chip experiments correspond precisely to the known PC/PH polytene binding sites. As a further validation of our analysis, we compared PC/PH profiles with an independent dataset, obtained from DamID experiments with the PC protein and using tiling arrays spanning the same region of Chromosome 2L that is contained in MY microarrays (B. Tolhuis, E. de Wit, I. Muijrers, H. Teunissen, W. Talhout, B. van Steensel, and M. van Lohuizen, personal communication). The distribution profiles are strikingly similar, both between PC-Dam and PC-IP as well as between PC-Dam and PH-IP. Taken together, these data show that the profiles obtained from our analysis represent the true chromosomal distribution of the proteins under study. </p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analysis of ChIP on Chip Results by the RDAM Method</title><p>To identify genomic DNA fragments that show significant enrichment for association with the proteins examined, we adapted the Rank Difference Analysis of Microarray (RDAM) method &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; to the ChIP on chip approach (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). RDAM replaces raw signal by its rank, expressed on a 0&#x02013;100 scale, which acts as a powerful normalizing procedure. Also, RDAM does not reduce replicated signals to their means, but instead only considers variations, expressed as rank differences (RDs), between individual experimental points and controls. Finally, RDAM estimates the total number of truly varying signals, assigns a <italic>p</italic>-value to each signal variation, characterizes the selection of a signal using the false discovery rate (FDR), in order to estimate the expected amount of false positive signals that may be present in the selected sample, and estimates the percentage of truly varying signals included in the selection (sensitivity). Sensitivity and FDR values are intimately correlated and allow to estimate the quality of each experiment &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. RDAM was applied to all conditions, each represented by at least two independent experiments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st005">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st006">S6</xref>). We estimated the performance of RDAM using the set of positive and negative controls present in the chips. Out of 41 positive controls analyzed for the different proteins in all conditions, only one was missed by RDAM at a level of FDR &#x02264; 10&#x00025;. By contrast, a criterion of FC &#x02265; 2 would have failed to detect six (i.e., about 15&#x00025;) of the positive controls. Nine of the 407 negative control spots were selected as enriched by RDAM, while 14 would have been selected by an FC &#x02265; 2. Thus, RDAM is clearly superior to an arbitrary cutoff at FC 2. Consistent with this analysis, a substantial number of fragments enriched less than two-fold can be selected by RDAM as truly enriched in most conditions ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st007">Table S7</xref>). </p><p>RDAM was used to filter out values that did not pass the FDR &#x02264;10&#x00025; criterion, allowing us to only plot significantly enriched signals. An example of this graphic transformation can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>. Note that the major binding peaks are retained in this analysis, consistent with a high quality of the experimental data (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g002">Figure 2</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>, PH embryo). </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>PcG Target Sites and Downstream Genes</title><p>Along the tiling paths of X chromosome and Chromosome 2L, a set of 70 DNA fragments were selected by RDAM as significantly bound by both PRC1 proteins PC and PH in embryonic chromatin. The position of these fragments in the genome allowed us to select 37 potential PcG target genes as the genes with the closest promoter ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040170-t001">Table 1</xref>). Sixteen of these genes code for proteins of unknown function (43&#x00025;), six for enzymes (16&#x00025;), one for an RNA binding protein (3&#x00025;), and 14 (38&#x00025;) code for transcription factors.

This indicates that these factors are acting upstream of multiple transcriptional regulatory cascades. </p><p>The 70 PC/PH fragments form 17 clusters of binding sites ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040170-t002">Table 2</xref>). We defined a cluster as a set of binding sites located adjacent to or within a series of neighboring genes, leaving no gene in the cluster without an associated PcG target DNA. The number of PcG-bound fragments within the cluster varies from one (six cases) to 23 (one case). Thus, PcG proteins are not dispersed randomly along the chromosome. Instead, they often form relatively large chromosomal domains of high PcG protein concentration. In most clusters, several bound fragments are not adjacent, suggesting that this clustered distribution does not simply reflect the presence of a single PRE from which PcG proteins spread into the flanking regions, but rather the presence of multiple PREs in each cluster. The relative distance between these clustered but spaced fragments is often in the range of 5&#x02013;20 kb, similar to the interdistance of PREs along the BX-C, the only locus for which precise information is available. </p><p>We then analyzed the distance from the fragments significantly bound by PRC1 proteins and the promoters of the closest genes. The PREs characterized previously were sometimes found close to or overlapping the promoters of their target genes, while in other cases such as in homeotic genes they often locate to regions much more remote, up to several tens of kb away from their target promoter. This distance distribution was also found in PRC1 binding on MY arrays. 28.9&#x00025; of PRC1 binding sites overlap or are located within 2 kb upstream of the 5&#x02032; end of genes ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040170-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that PcG proteins frequently associate with promoters. However, a substantial proportion (56.3 &#x00025;) of PRC1 sites is located between 2 kb and 40 kb away from the closest promoter ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>). In 29.7&#x00025; of these cases, the promoter-distal binding sites are not accompanied by additional PC/PH binding at the promoter of the same gene ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040170-t002">Table 2</xref>). The variable distance between PRC1 binding sites and promoters might reflect different modes of gene silencing, including direct obliteration of the promoter by overlapping PREs, spreading of PcG proteins from the PRE into the promoter region, or looping of PREs to reach distant promoters &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Remarkably, the sizes of the putative PcG target genes and intergenic regions are large. The candidate target genes for PRC1 on MY array have an average length of 9.7 kb, while the average in the genome is about 4.9 kb &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. The intergenic regions of these genes have an average size of 15 kb, also significantly larger than the average in the genome (5 kb). These results indicate that large regulatory regions are a hallmark of PcG target genes, potentially reflecting the fact that these genes might be highly regulated at the transcriptional level. </p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Developmental Dynamics of PC, PH, and GAF Chromosomal Binding</title><p>The binding profiles were analyzed in pair-wise comparisons to identify similarities and differences between the proteins analyzed at different developmental stages ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st008">Table S8</xref>). PH and PC bind the same loci on the X chromosome and even the relative binding intensities match ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g004">Figure 4</xref>A for a comparison in embryos). Over all the MY arrays, 110 out of the 117 ChIP on chip on embryonic samples (PC E)&#x02013;binding fragments are also PH E target fragments and the two profiles have a high correlation coefficient of 0.4. This observation is consistent with the perfect co-localization of PC and PH in polytene chromosomes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, and with their stoichiometric co-fractionation in the PRC1 complex &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. For this reason, binding of the two proteins PC and PH will be simply referred to as the PRC1 profile. In spite of previous reports that GAF is often associated with PRC1 in previously described PREs, our analysis shows that the distribution of GAF in the genome is only moderately correlated with PRC1 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st008">Table S8</xref>). GAF binds approximately four-fold more sites than PRC1 ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st005">Table S5</xref>) and is scattered throughout the entire tiling path, as expected based on polytene chromosome data &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>The dynamics of GAF binding during development are also different from those of the PRC1 proteins. A comparison between the embryonic stage and the pupal stage for PC ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) shows that many PC binding sites are maintained throughout development, but major differences can be detected (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These differences are seen both by comparing the embryo to the pupal stage, as well as when comparing adult males with adult females ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). It is interesting to note that the correlation coefficients between the distribution of PC and PH at any given stage is higher than the correlation between different stages for the same protein ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st008">Table S8</xref>), suggesting that PRC1 association at its target chromatin is dynamic during development. Notably, the PC and PH profiles in adult males deviate most from the profiles of all other developmental stages ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st008">Table S8</xref>), consistent with the idea that these proteins might have a specific developmental function in males &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>In the case of GAF, the developmental profiles vary little from one stage to the next, as seen by the excellent correlation between the binding profiles at all stages ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g004">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st008">Table S8</xref>, and note that the correlation of GAF profiles at different developmental stages is generally higher than that of PC and PH). This suggests that this protein binds stably to most of its DNA targets throughout development, and is consistent with the high degree of overlap between GAF ChIP in animals and the GAF binding sites determined by DamID in cultured cells. </p><p>Typical patterns of distribution and of developmental dynamics of PC, PH, and GAF proteins are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g005">Figure 5</xref> at higher resolution. The three proteins associate with specific domains in the <italic>en/inv</italic> region, which spans 200 kb of genome and contains interesting genes such as the PcG gene <italic>E(Pc),</italic> the two posterior patterning genes <italic>inv</italic> and <italic>en,</italic> and the trxG gene <italic>toutatis (tou)</italic>. As previously described, PRC1 proteins are strongly associated with two major sites in this region &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. One is just upstream of the <italic>inv</italic> gene and the second one spans the promoter region of the <italic>en</italic> gene. This second peak corresponds to the well-known <italic>en</italic> PRE described previously &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, the embryonic profiles of PC and PH exhibit a lower level of binding in the region flanking the two peaks, which is significantly higher than the baseline. This might reflect either the presence of previously uncharacterized PREs or a &#x0201c;spreading&#x0201d; of the two proteins away from their main PREs. Alternatively, PRC1 proteins bound stably at the major PREs might occasionally establish weak contacts with neighboring DNA fragments that might be &#x0201c;frozen&#x0201d; by the ChIP technology &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>A high resolution analysis of the distribution profile of GAF shows a clear difference from PRC1. At the <italic>en</italic>/ <italic>inv</italic> locus, GAF binds the two main PRC1 peaks. This binding is functional at least in the case of <italic>en,</italic> as shown by mutation analysis of GAF binding sites &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, but it is weak compared with the strong binding seen in the flanking domain that corresponds to the <italic>tou</italic> gene and that is devoid of PRC1 proteins. In principle, this difference in signal intensity might depend on the different accessibility of the target chromatin to the antibodies used for ChIP. However, we believe this is unlikely since both the PC and the PH antibody seem to access the <italic>en</italic> region of low GAF enrichment quite efficiently. Therefore, we believe that the observed difference represents a true difference in the strength of binding. Thus, these data suggest that GAF plays roles independent from tethering of PRC1 at many loci. </p><p>While GAF stays stably associated with its targets in many cases (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g005">Figure 5</xref>, compare left panels with right panels), PC and PH show a more dynamic profile at a number of loci. At the <italic>gt</italic>/ <italic>z</italic> locus ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g005">Figure 5</xref>C&#x02013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g005">5</xref>D), there is no GAF binding. In embryos, a strong PRC1 binding can be detected in a region between the <italic>gt</italic> and the <italic>technical knockout (tko)</italic> genes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Although this locus does not correspond to a polytene binding site, a regulation of <italic>gt</italic> by PcG proteins has been previously reported &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. Binding of PC and PH is strictly limited to the region between these two genes and spans approximately 20 kb. Strikingly, however, the binding of both proteins is completely lost at all later developmental stages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g005">Figure 5</xref>D for an example in adult females). The reverse situation was also found. In embryos, the chromosomal domain containing the gene <italic>CG14622</italic> is devoid of PC and PH ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g005">Figure 5</xref>E), while the entire region is bound by GAF on single peaks surrounding several different genes. In adult females ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g005">Figure 5</xref>F) the binding of GAF remains stable, while significant binding is now detected for both PC and PH downstream of the <italic>CG14622</italic> gene. </p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Regulation of <italic>gt</italic> and <italic>peb</italic> by PRC1 </title><p>Since the <italic>gt</italic> locus does not correspond to a polytene binding site of PRC1, but a regulation of <italic>gt</italic> by some PcG proteins has been previously reported &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, we wished to determine whether the embryonic association of PRC1 proteins to this region corresponds to a regulatory function. We therefore analyzed the expression of <italic>gt</italic> in <italic>Pc</italic> mutant embryos by RNA in situ hybridization. To detect homozygous <italic>Pc</italic> mutant embryos, we analyzed a line carrying a GFP reporter under the control of the zygotically expressed <italic>Kr&#x000fc;ppel</italic> promoter, which allowed us to immunostain for GFP after in situ RNA hybridization (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This analysis does not allow the identification of homozygous mutant embryos before stage nine of embryogenesis. At embryonic stage nine, <italic>gt</italic> is expressed in part of the gnatal buds and the procephalic portion of the head. In <italic>Pc</italic> mutants, ectopic expression is seen in the head of all embryos (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, see the arrowheads). During stages 10 and 11 of embryogenesis, wild-type (WT) <italic>gt</italic> staining declines but persists in restricted regions of the head, until stage 14 when all staining is completely lost. In contrast, in <italic>Pc</italic> mutants, the head staining persists until very late stages of embryogenesis. A low level staining is consistently seen in the trunk and the abdomen in late embryos, but it is much weaker compared with the ectopic de-repression seen in the head. Thus, the ectopic expression of <italic>gt</italic> in <italic>Pc</italic> mutants is not ubiquitous, suggesting that PcG proteins are not constitutively required as repressors of <italic>gt</italic> expression in all tissues and developmental stages. </p><p>This result was confirmed by the analysis of <italic>pebbled (peb),</italic> a large gene ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040170-t001">Table 1</xref>) coding for a transcription factor involved in embryonic development. PC/PH binds to its promoter region as well as to two upstream regions more than 10 kb away from the promoter ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040170-t002">Table 2</xref>). In WT embryos, <italic>peb</italic> is expressed in the anterior and posterior midgut ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, left panels), as well as in the peripheral nervous system at stage 11. In <italic>Pc</italic> mutant embryos at stage 9, <italic>peb</italic> is overexpressed in its normal domains. Starting from stage 10, ectopic expression is additionally found in the central and the peripheral nervous systems, in the trunk and the abdominal portion of the embryo, as well as in restricted portions of the head. This ectopic expression persists at later stages, where it is particularly strong at the ectodermal rim during dorsal closure ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040170-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, right panels). Again, ectopic expression is not ubiquitous at any developmental stage, suggesting that the requirement for PcG-mediated silencing is restricted to a subset of embryonic cells. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Establishing a Robust Dataset of Chromosomal Binding Sites for GAF and PRC1</title><p>The standardization of the experimental as well as of the bioinformatic approaches is an important component in ChIP on chip studies. Testing the ChIP samples on known gene targets by Southern blot analysis before doing the experiments on microarrays, additional validation of the GAF data by comparison with the DamID profile, and validation of PC/PH profiles by immuno-FISH on polytene chromosomes provides a strong degree of confidence in the present results. Furthermore, to improve the statistical quality of the results, we adapted the RDAM method to ChIP on chip analysis. The use of RDAM allowed estimating the sensitivity of target site detection by ChIP on chip, as well as the rate of expected false positive, defined as the FDR. This statistical analysis showed that, for most samples, a low FDR (10&#x00025;) is compatible with a high sensitivity (mean of 83&#x00025; and SD 15&#x00025;), strongly arguing in favor of a high quality of the dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Chromosomal Behavior of PC, PH, and GAF</title><p>Together with the earlier evidence, the very good overlap between PC and PH binding at all developmental stages strongly suggests that PC and PH are stoichiometric components of one and the same biochemical complex at most of their in vivo targets and in most cells throughout development. We noticed, however, minor differences between PC and PH, particularly in adult stages. Specific analyses will be required to determine whether a subset of the targets of these two proteins is not shared.</p><p>The fact that PRC1 members bind to extended regions along the chromosome indicates that they might spread out from PREs into flanking sequences to a certain extent &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. One example of this distribution is observed in the <italic>gt</italic> locus. The binding profile approximates a bimodal curve covering about 20 kb, and might reflect spreading of PRC1 from the peak binding site. In the case of <italic>en</italic>/ <italic>inv,</italic> PRC1 covers a region of about 60 kb. However, the binding profile differs strongly from a bimodal shape, suggesting that sequence or functional determinants may affect association of PRC1 within some chromosomal domains. Moreover, in the case of <italic>en</italic>/ <italic>inv,</italic> PRC1 binding declines sharply after a certain point, and the two genes <italic>E(Pc)</italic> and <italic>tou</italic> seem to be protected from PC/PH protein association. Since another PcG target locus, the BX-C complex, contains chromatin insulator sequences flanking PREs that might delimit their domain of action &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;, the abrupt interruption in PRC1 binding observed in the <italic>en</italic>/ <italic>inv</italic> region might be explained by the presence of insulators at the <italic>E(Pc)</italic> and <italic>tou</italic> genes ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg006">Figure S6</xref>). </p><p>The pattern of GAF is fundamentally different from PRC1. GAF binds to many more sites than PC and PH and it associates to DNA elements usually close to promoters of genes, consistent with the previously reported DNA binding to regions containing clustered GAGAG sites &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, GAGAG sites are highly enriched among the GAF-bound fragments. They occur with an average frequency of 3.32/kb in GAF target fragments from embryos and pupae, compared with 1.34/kb in MY array sequences. Furthermore, of the 228 GAF binding fragments detected on MY arrays at the embryonic stage, only seven do not contain GAGAG motifs, confirming a strong dependence on known GAF consensus motifs for targeting in vivo. It is remarkable that, even at shared sites between GAF and PRC1, the binding profile of GAF is often distinct from PRC1. For instance, in the <italic>en</italic>/ <italic>inv</italic> region, the strongest GAF sites are in regions devoid of PRC1, although weak binding occurs at the two PREs for <italic>en</italic> and <italic>inv</italic>. Therefore, the general function of GAF is distinct from that of PRC1. </p><p>Although the role of PRC1 proteins in the maintenance of homeotic gene regulation throughout development suggests that they are stable components of their target chromatin, we observed unexpected developmental changes of PC and PH chromosomal binding. In some cases, embryonic signals were lost at later stages, while in others, binding was absent in embryos and gained during later development or in adult life. These differences suggest that the role of PcG proteins is less static than previously thought, at least in a subset of their target loci. This interpretation is consistent with the recent analysis of PcG-mediated regulation of two different target genes, <italic>hh</italic> and <italic>CycA</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. Both genes are direct PcG targets, but in certain tissues and developmental stages they are not bound by PcG proteins and are regulated in a PcG-independent manner. Our analysis of <italic>gt</italic> and <italic>peb</italic> expression corroborates this analysis, suggesting that PcG-mediated repression of these genes occurs only in a subset of the embryonic cells. </p><p>The strongest difference in PRC1 developmental distribution profiles was found between the embryo and the adult male stage, both for PC and PH (while the embryo and adult male profiles are highly correlated for GAF, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st008">Table S8</xref>). Recently, a sex-specific function has been described for the HP1 protein &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our data suggest that male&#x02013;female differences also exist concerning PcG-mediated gene regulation in somatic cells. </p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Genome-Wide Identification of PRC1 Target Sites</title><p>We identified 17 different clusters of PRC1 binding sites potentially regulating 37 genes. Extrapolating to the whole genome, PRC1 might associate to about 200 regions and regulate approximately 400 genes at any developmental stage. By applying an algorithm named PREdictor, based on the fact that all known PREs contain clustered consensus motifs for PHO, Z, and GAF, Ringrose et al. predicted a set of 167 PREs in the whole <italic>Drosophila</italic> euchromatic genome &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. In the two tiling paths present on MY arrays, we detected a total of 70 fragments bound by PRC1 at the embryonic stage, while Ringrose et al. predicted 14 PREs in this region. Among these 14 predictions, four fragments are found enriched in our experiments in at least one developmental stage for the PC or the PH proteins. On the other hand, 69 out of the 70 embryonic PRC1 sites from ChIP on chip do not score as PREs when run through the PREdictor algorithm. The differences between the ChIP data and the bioinformatic PRE prediction indicate that, while the presence of clustered consensus sequences for GAF, PHO, and Z is probably required for the function of many PREs, other PRE-specific sequence signatures might be needed to generate a prediction algorithm capable of systematic PRE identification. Two of these signatures might be represented by motifs that mediate PRE association of the Dsp1 and of the Grainy head proteins &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. </p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>PRC1 Target Genes</title><p>The positions of PRC1 binding sites define a set of 37 genes as candidate targets of this complex.

These factors regulate a variety of developmental processes, with a high proportion of them involved in embryonic patterning and in neurogenesis.</p><p>Among these putative TF targets, one interesting class is represented by repressors of segmentation and homeotic genes, such as in the case of <italic>gt</italic> (see also above) and of <italic>ct</italic>. Our data suggest that PRC1 binding is involved in the maintenance of <italic>gt</italic> silencing in specific regions of the head, both in stages when the gene is expressed as well as in later stages when the gene is globally shut down in WT embryos.

As such, it will be important to extend this analysis to the whole genome and to improve it by selecting individual cell types and following them at fine-tuned developmental stages. Since no PRE has been found yet in mammals, the ChIP on chip approach should be extended in these organisms to analyze whether PcG target sites share conserved DNA features and whether the identity of PcG target genes and of their regulatory networks are conserved in distant species. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>MY microarrays manufacturing</title><p>Oligo design, oligo synthesis, and PCR products for the Montpellier tiling path have been provided by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium).

Flies were grown at 25 &#x000b0;C on a standard medium for amplification and then the egg laying was made on plates filled with standard vinegar medium. Embryos were collected in EWB (Embryo Wash Buffer: 0.03&#x00025; Triton X100, 0.4&#x00025; NaCl) 12 h after the beginning of egg laying. Half of the staged embryos were used for ChIP assay and half were put back into regular medium bottles and grown until pupal stage. Pupae were then collected one day after the first pupa emerged. Again, half of the pupae were used for ChIP while the other half was grown until adult stage. Adults were then collected two days after hatching and males and females were separated for ChIP assays. The ChIP method was an adaptation of a previously published protocol &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. For each ChIP, a reference sample named Mock corresponds to a ChIP performed at the same time without the addition of the specific antibody. Formaldehyde, at a final concentration of 1.8&#x00025; in buffer A1, i.e., 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 15 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.5&#x00025; Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 10 mM sodium butyrate, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), was used for cross-linking while crushing whole <italic>Drosophila</italic> animals (embryos, pupae, adults) for 15 mn at room temperature. After blocking the reaction with glycine and after three washes (5 min each, at 4 &#x000b0;C with buffer A1), the crushed material was then filtered through Centricon Y-100 columns to recover chromatin.

After hybridization, slides were washed in subsequent steps with washing solutions with decreasing SSC concentration. </p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Scanning and analysis of microarrays</title><p>Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000B scanner in the two channels (Cy3 and Cy5) at the same time. The GenePix Pro 6.0 software was used to grid the microarrays and to calculate the signals for each spot. Nonhomogenous or badly conformed spots were discarded from the measurements. The raw data corresponding to scanning of each slide are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st009">Tables S9</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st020">S20</xref>. The FC for each spot was then calculated after normalization to the overall median of the slide. Statistical analysis of microarray samples was performed using the RDAM method. Three completely independent ChIP samples were hybridized on MY arrays for each protein and developmental stage. In three cases (PC E, GAF E, and GAF M), hybridization of one of the samples failed. However, the two remaining samples were highly correlated when analysed with the RDAM method and, as such, these conditions could be included in the dataset. In contrast, ChIP experiments for PH in pupae failed due to unknown reasons, presumably related to the sensitivity of the antibody to chromatin prepared from pupae. Thus, this condition could not be analyzed. To eliminate further bias in RDAM analysis we performed dye swap hybridization for one of the samples in each condition. The correspondence between the dye and the samples are indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st010">Tables S10</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st020">S20</xref>. </p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>RDAM method for ChIP on chip analysis</title><p>We applied a modified version of the RDAM method &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. In the general case, this method allows us to identify statistically significant variations of signals between two conditions C1 and C2 (a condition in our case corresponds to a ChIP from a given developmental stage using a given antibody). In a first step, each signal value was replaced by its rank in the ordered series of all the signal values, and the rank was then scaled on a 0&#x02013;100 range. The scaled rank defines the relative level of each signal by its place in the overall signal distribution, and this simple transformation is a normalization method which makes all results directly comparable. </p><p>Then, each pair of signal values for a given target was converted into an RD, a measurement of variation of the signal between the two conditions, obtained by computing the difference of the corresponding ranks. To compensate for the fact that the variation is dependent upon the rank values, the following local standardization procedure was employed: zRD = RD&#x02212;&#x003bc;(RD)/std(RD), where &#x003bc;(RD) is the local mean value of the variation and std(RD) is the local standard deviation of the variation, both calculated by moving a window (comprising 100 datapoints) across the rank range.</p><p>Finally, to assign a <italic>p</italic>-value to each standardized variation, we used the variation distribution observed in the case of the null hypothesis. Generally, this distribution can be constructed empirically by considering two duplicated experimental points of the same condition, e.g., C1a and C1b (no significant variation is expected when comparing biologically identical samples). This is feasible when using commercial oligonucleotide arrays that have highly reproducible amounts of product in each spot. However, duplicated experiments could not be used with our arrays because of the lower degree of reproducibility inherent to this chip technology, which uses PCR products spotted on glass slides. Instead of using two replicates, we thus constructed two series of replicates by a proper target selection in each channel. To do so, we took advantage of the fact that the binding of a protein on a target should increase, never decrease, the signal of the corresponding spot (resulting in a positive RD) when the antibody IP is compared to the control IP. When the opposite case is found, namely stronger signal in the control IP than in the antibody IP (corresponding to spots with negative RD), this does not depend on biological determinants and thus it reflects the experimental noise. The subset of spots falling in this last category could thus be used to calibrate noise. This procedure allowed us to analyze the result of one IP by comparing the antibody IP channel to the control IP channel. </p><p>Since two or three independent ChIP on chip samples were available for the same condition, the RDAM method was applied as follows. We analyzed each replicate individually, calculated a <italic>p</italic>-value for each of them, and combined these <italic>p</italic>-values into a new random variable, the product of <italic>p</italic>-values, which distribution in the case of the null hypothesis is easily obtained. Subsets of genes were selected by estimating the FDR, i.e., the percentage of false positives in the selection, and/or the sensitivity, i.e., the percentage of the total variation found in the selection. The zVar and the FDR values for each array feature in all conditions are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st006">Table S6</xref>. </p><p>The biological significance of FDR and of the sensitivity values was previously verified in the case of synthetic gene expression data &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, and there it was shown that the FDR assignments are slightly overestimated (symmetrically, sensitivity is slightly underestimated) by this method. Concerning the present dataset, we estimated the true sensitivity and FDR based on the controls that were included in the MY arrays. We analyzed 11 positive controls that are known to be bound by the three proteins of interest (except for the <italic>Mcp</italic> fragment that is only bound by PC and PH, but not GAF). This results in 41 different features that should invariably be enriched. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref> shows that, out of them, only one fails to be detected as significantly enriched at an FDR &#x02264; 10&#x00025;. </p><p>It is important to note that these positive controls are not exceptionally strong binding sites (indeed, six of them fail to be detected by the FC &#x02265; 2 criterion). The average FC for these controls is similar as, for instance, the average value of all selected fragments for PH in embryos. Thus, the positive control sample is representative of the population of target fragments. Taken together, this suggests that the sensitivity might be slightly underestimated by RDAM. Concerning the FDR, a tentative estimation could be reached, based on the negative controls, i.e., the 37 randomly selected genomic fragments that were spotted in MY arrays. The whole analysis included 11 different conditions (different antibody and/or developmental stages), resulting in 407 individual negative control points for our test. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st004">Table S4</xref>, only nine of these points were selected by RDAM. Thus, in the worst hypothesis, 9/407 = 2.2&#x00025; of the negative features were selected. This indicates that the FDR is slightly overestimated in the present analysis. Together, these data suggest that the FDR and the sensitivity are slightly underestimated by the conservative analysis that is made by the RDAM method. </p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Immuno-FISH on polytene chromosomes</title><p>Immuno-FISH was performed as described previously &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040170-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.
