One well-studied example of terminal differentiation is the maturation of B lymphocytes into end-stage, antibody-secreting plasma cells. Although terminal differentiation of B cells involves complex changes in the expression of many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c4">4</xref>), a single transcription factor, B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), has been identified as a &#x02018;master regulator&#x02019; of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c5">5</xref>). Blimp-1 is a 98 kDa zinc finger-containing protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c9">9</xref>). Expression of Blimp-1 is sufficient to trigger terminal differentiation of B-cell lymphoma line <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c5">5</xref>), and the developmental stage-specific expression of Blimp-1 in B cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c10">10</xref>) is consistent with its role as a master regulator of terminal B cell differentiation. Recently Blimp-1 has also been shown to be required for terminal differentiation of monocyte&#x0002f;macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c11">11</xref>), suggesting the possibility that it may play a role in terminal differentiation of many cell lineages. Consistent with this hypothesis, the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> homologs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (XBlimp1) and sea urchin (SpKrox1) are required during early embryo development of these two organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Although the function of Blimp-1 has been the subject of many studies, virtually nothing is known about the structure of the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene or regulation of Blimp-1 expression. Here we report the organization of mouse <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene, the characterization of the three most abundant Blimp-1 mRNA isoforms as well as a minor splice variant. We also show that Blimp-1 expression in terminally differentiated B cells is controlled by transcription initiation, and identify the transcription initiation sites as well as the basal promoter of the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>GenBank accession numbers</title><p>The accession numbers for mouse <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene are: AF305534 for the promoter and exon 1; AF305535 for exon 2 and 3; AF305536 for exon 4; AF305537 for exon 5; AF305538 for exon 6 and 7; and AF305539 for exon 8.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic library screening</title><p>A genomic library from mouse (129 strain) in &#x003bb;fixII phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with Blimp-1 cDNA using standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c15">15</xref>).

The program used for the search was tblastn. Several of the species that matched Blimp-1 were translated from cDNA, however the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> amino acid sequences were derived from the genomic DNA. In an attempt to verify the accuracy of the predicted proteins, the genomic sequences from <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C.elegans</italic> were searched for splice sites using the Neural Network splice site predictor on the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project page (http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.fruitfly.org&#x0002f;seq&#x0005f;tools&#x0002f;splice.html) and the NetGene2 World Wide Web server which produces neural network predictions of splice sites in <italic>C.elegans</italic> (http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;130.225.67.199&#x0002f;services&#x0002f;NetGene2&#x0002f;). Sites were used to construct the cDNA if they had a confidence interval score above 0.90 and resulted in cDNA sequence that was in-frame with the mouse Blimp-1 sequence. The resultant amino acid sequence was compared with the amino acid sequence predicted by the genome projects using the Clustal W program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c26">26</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Organization of the murine <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene</title><p>Three &#x003bb; phage clones from a 129 mouse genomic phage library were isolated by virtue of their hybridization with a probe containing 5.3 kb Blimp-1 cDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f1">1</xref>a). Restriction mapping showed that these overlapping clones together span ~33 kb of genomic DNA. Restriction fragments encoding Blimp-1 mRNA were identified by hybridization to cDNA and sequenced to identify all exon&#x02013;intron junctions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f1">1</xref>a). The <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene contains eight exons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f1">1</xref>a) spanning ~23 kb and all exon&#x02013;intron junctions conform to the gt&#x0002f;ag rule. In general, all the identified functional domains (N-terminal acidic domain, PEST domain with proline-rich domain and C-terminal acidic domain) are encoded in separate exons with the exception of the PR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c8">8</xref>) and the five C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-type zinc finger domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f1">1</xref>a). The PR domain is encoded in exons 4 and 5 while the zinc finger domains are encoded in exons 6, 7 and 8. Of particular interest, zinc finger 1, one of two critical zinc fingers for Blimp-1&#x02019;s ability to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c27">27</xref>), is encoded in exons 6 and 7.</p><p>Comparison between the murine and human <italic>Blimp-1</italic> genes (GenBank accession no. AL358952 for human <italic>Blimp-1</italic> genomic gene) shows that they have a very similar exon&#x02013;intron organization (data not shown). The only exception is that the 5&#x02032; UT in human is encoded in only one exon while in the mouse it is encoded in two exons. Also, we could not find human sequence encoding the conserved histidines of zinc finger 1 in the human gene, because the sequence is still incomplete in this region.</p><p>When a BLAST search of the GenBank database was performed to identify <italic>Blimp-1</italic> homologs in other species, nine sequences received a score that was significant. These sequences, from human, mouse, frog, worm, fly and sea urchin, were more related to the mouse Blimp-1 sequence than the mouse Blimp-1 sequence was to any other zinc finger or PR family protein. The sequences are 69&#x00025; identical in the area of zinc fingers 1&#x02013;4 and there is considerable homology in the PR domain and 5&#x02032; acidic region as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f1">1</xref>b. Although there is little sequence homology in the proline-rich domain, the sequence from each species contains many prolines that are simply not aligned. The human (PRDI-BF1), <italic>Xenopus</italic> (Xblimp1) and sea urchin (SpKrox-1) cDNAs have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c13">13</xref>). However the worm and fly amino acid and cDNA sequences are predicted from genomic DNA determined by the <italic>C.elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c29">29</xref>). We verified these predictions to the best of our ability using neural networks to predict splice sites. There was one major difference between the predicted proteins found with the BLAST search and the proteins that we constructed. In the <italic>C.elegans</italic> sequence there is an acceptor site used in the protein from the genome project that is not recognized by the neural network. The donor site is predicted and the splicing is necessary for the change of reading frame that allows the full protein to be produced. Additionally, there are several donor and acceptor sites that may or may not be used that would add or delete very small sequences that do not alter the match with mouse Blimp-1 significantly. However it is impossible to tell if these are included in the endogenous protein by computer predictions alone. Despite our attempts at predicting the amino acid sequence of the fly and worm Blimp-1, there are probably errors since there are stretches where these two sequences match neither each other nor the sequences from any other species. These non-homologous areas are unlikely to be due to evolutionary distance since the sea urchin Blimp-1 (SpKrox1) does not contain these unmatched gaps. Interestingly, the very 3&#x02032; end of sea urchin Blimp-1 contains a leucine-zipper that was not evolutionary conserved.</p></sec><sec><title>Blimp-1 has multiple transcription initiation sites and lacks a TATA element</title><p>In order to map the transcription initiation sites of murine <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene, a primer extension assay was performed. A primer was chosen from the 5&#x02032; UT sequence of the cloned Blimp-1 cDNA (GenBank accession no. U08185). The results showed multiple extension products ranging from 40 to 80 bases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f2">2</xref>b), suggestive of multiple transcription initiation sites within a region of ~40 bp. However, some of the complexity could have been caused by the inability of the reverse transcriptase to transcribe completely in this GC-rich region. Furthermore, this assay indicates the length of 5&#x02032; UT mRNA from the primer but cannot show whether it is encoded by one or more exons. Therefore, a riboprobe protection assay was also performed to confirm the primer extension results and to map the location of transcription initiation sites in <italic>Blimp-1</italic>. A riboprobe from the genomic DNA encompassing the known 5&#x02032; UT and the putative initiation sites determined by primer extension was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f2">2</xref>c). Multiple protected fragments were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f2">2</xref>c), in agreement with the primer extension results. The size of the two largest protected fragments, 167 and 160 bp &#x000b1; 7 bp, is consistent with the size of the largest primer extension products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f2">2</xref>b). Taken together, these data show that <italic>Blimp-1</italic> is transcribed from multiple transcription initiation sites located between 244 and 251 bp from the ATG start codon.</p><p>The occurrence of multiple transcription initiation sites is the hallmark of transcription from TATA-less promoters that usually contain initiator elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c31">31</xref>). We examined the DNA sequence in the vicinity of Blimp-1 transcriptional start sites and found no TATA sequence. However, there is an initiator element located 13 bp upstream to the most 5&#x02032; transcription initiation site. It is likely that this initiator is responsible for the transcription of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f2">2</xref>d).</p></sec><sec><title>Three major Blimp-1 mRNA isoforms are generated by differential polyadenylation but a minor splice variant lacking exon 7 is also expressed</title><p>Knowing the exon&#x02013;intron structure and the location of transcription initiation sites in the gene allowed us to characterize Blimp-1 mRNA isoforms. Blimp-1 mRNA is found in three major isoforms of ~5.7, 4.3 and 3.6 kb, determined by northern blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f3">3</xref>a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c11">11</xref>). The original cDNA clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c5">5</xref>) is 5.3&#x000a0;kb exclusive of poly(A), corresponding to the 5.7 kb mRNA isoform. Probes corresponding to all the protein-coding exons and to the 5&#x02032; UT hybridized to all three mRNA isoforms in northern blots of total RNA from P3X cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f3">3</xref>a and data not shown) suggesting that the three isoforms encode the same protein. Analysis of the 2.5 kb 3&#x02032; UT portion of the cDNA sequence revealed several potential polyadenylation sites &#x0005b;poly(A) sites&#x0005d;. We therefore performed northern analyses using probes from different regions of the 3&#x02032; UT to determine whether the smaller isoforms were generated by the use of different poly(A) sites. A probe derived from the first 400 bp of the 3&#x02032; UT and a probe derived from the middle portion of the 3&#x02032; UT region detected the 5.7 and 4.3 kb isoforms but did not hybridize to the 3.6 kb isoform. A probe from the very 3&#x02032; end of the cDNA detected only the 5.7 kb isoform and did not hybridize to the 3.6 or 4.3 kb isoforms. Thus, the 3.6 kb isoform appears to result from polyadenylation at the poly(A) site located ~3.3 kb of the cDNA. The 4.3&#x000a0;kb isoform could result from usage of intermediate poly(A) site located at ~4.5 kb and the 5.7 kb isoform results from usage of the most 3&#x02032; poly(A) site. Thus, the three major Blimp-1 mRNA isoforms are generated by differential use of multiple poly(A) sites and all encode the same protein.</p><p>mRNAs encoding some zinc finger-containing proteins are expressed as alternatively spliced isoforms, differing in the presence of exons encoding specific zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c34">34</xref>). Since all of zinc finger 2 and parts of zinc fingers 1 and 3 are encoded by a small exon, exon 7, we examined whether an alternatively spliced isoform of Blimp-1 lacking exon 7 might be expressed. (Due to the small differences in size, such an isoform would not be revealed by northern analysis.) PCR primers for cDNA sequence 5&#x02032; of the region encoding zinc finger 1 and 3&#x02032; of the region encoding zinc finger 5 were used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f3">3</xref>b) in an RT&#x02013;PCR reaction using RNA from plasmacytoma P3X. Each primer pair gave a product predicted for full-length Blimp-1 mRNA as well as another product ~120 bp smaller (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f3">3</xref>b). The size of the smaller RT&#x02013;PCR product is consistent with an alternatively spliced isoform lacking exon 7. When the smaller RT&#x02013;PCR product was cloned and sequenced, it was indeed shown to be an alternatively spliced form lacking exon 7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f3">3</xref>c).</p><p>RT&#x02013;PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f3">3</xref>b) indicated that the isoform lacking exon 7 (&#x00394;exon7) constitutes &#x0003c;10&#x00025; of total Blimp-1 mRNA in P3X cells. Riboprobe protection assays confirmed this proportion and showed that it did not vary when RNAs from various mouse tissues were examined (data not shown). The protein encoded by the &#x00394;exon7 isoform lacks the functional zinc finger 1 and 2 and is not predicted to bind DNA efficiently since Keller and Maniatis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c27">27</xref>) showed that these two zinc fingers of Blimp-1 are critical for DNA binding activity. Indeed, the zinc finger domain synthesized in 293T cells from the &#x00394;exon7 cDNA did not bind to the Blimp-1 sequence from the c-<italic>myc</italic> promoter while binding of the zinc finger domain synthesized from the full-length cDNA was clearly evident (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Developmental stage-specific expression of Blimp-1 in B cells is determined by transcription initiation</title><p>Blimp-1 protein and steady-state mRNA are present in plasmacytoma lines but are absent from cell lines representing earlier stages of B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c9">9</xref>). To determine if this B cell stage-specific expression is the result of differential transcriptional initiation, transcription run-on assays were performed. Nuclei were isolated from two B-lineage cell lines: P3X, a plasmacytoma that expresses Blimp-1, and 18-81, a pre-B line that does not express Blimp-1. The results showed no polymerase loading on the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene in 18-81 nuclei, but significant polymerase loading on the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene in P3X (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f4">4</xref>). Transcription of <italic>C</italic><italic>&#x000b5;</italic><italic>, GAPDH</italic> and c-<italic>myc</italic> genes was also measured to provide positive controls for the assay. The amount of polymerase loading on <italic>Blimp-1</italic> was 5-fold higher than that on c-<italic>myc</italic>, and ~7.5-fold lower than <italic>C</italic><italic>&#x000b5;</italic> in P3X cells. These data show that developmental stage-specific expression of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> in B cells is regulated by transcription initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>The Blimp-1 basal promoter is contained within 900 bp 5&#x02032; of the transcription initiation sites</title><p>A transfection assay was used to search for the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> promoter. A region from &#x02013;918 to &#x0002b;204 bp relative to the most 5&#x02032; transcription initiation site of the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene was engineered into a plasmid containing the firefly luciferase cDNA but lacking a TATA or initiator element. Upon transfection into P3X plasmacytoma cells, the plasmid containing Blimp-1 sequence, showed 3&#x02013;4-fold more luciferase activity than the parent plasmid after correction for transfection efficiency (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f5">5</xref>). Thus, the region containing ~900 bp 5&#x02032; of the initiation sites is sufficient to confer basal promoter activity. To determine if this region also contained elements capable of conferring B-cell developmental stage-specificity or tissue-specificity, these plasmids were also transfected into 18-81 preB cells, NIH 3T3 cells and human U937 promonocytic cells, which do not express endogenous Blimp-1. The Blimp-1 plasmid had similar promoter activity in all cell lines tested. Thus we conclude that additional regulatory elements, outside the 1100&#x000a0;bp present on our reporter, are likely to be required for tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of <italic>Blimp-1</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this report, we analyzed the murine <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene and found that it contains eight exons, a transcriptional initiator and multiple transcription initiation sites. The organization of the human <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene is similar to that of the mouse. The three major Blimp-1 mRNA isoforms are generated by differential poly(A) site usage and a minor isoform, encoding a protein lacking zinc fingers 1 and 2, is generated by differential splicing. We showed that B-cell developmental stage-specific expression of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> is controlled by transcription initiation. Functional analyses showed that a region 900 bp 5&#x02032; of the Blimp-1 transcription initiation sites is sufficient for basal, but not B-cell stage-specific, promoter activity.</p><sec><title>Evolution of the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene</title><p>Blimp-1 was originally identified in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c7">7</xref>) and murine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c5">5</xref>) cells; subsequently <italic>Blimp-1</italic> homologs were identified in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c12">12</xref>) and sea urchin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c13">13</xref>). In this work we compared these <italic>Blimp-1</italic> homologs as well as those in two more primitive eukaryotes, <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C.elegans</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd697f1">1</xref>b) that have been identified by genome sequencing. However, <italic>Blimp-1</italic> homologs were not found in the genomes of lower, unicellular eukaryotes, such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, for which genome sequence is available. Thus, <italic>Blimp-1</italic> appears to have arisen during early evolution of multicellular organisms, consistent with the suggestion of its role as an inducer for terminal differentiation.</p><p>In all of the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> homologs, conservation of each known protein domain is evident, with the zinc finger domains having the highest degree of conservation. This domain conservation suggests that some&#x0002f;many biological functions of Blimp-1 are likely to be conserved between lower forms and mammals. Consistent with this idea is the finding of de Souza <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c12">12</xref>) that mouse Blimp-1 can substitute XBlimp1 during frog embryogenesis. In mouse, Blimp-1 is important for terminal differentiation of B lymphoid and myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c35">35</xref>), is expressed and may play a role in other end-stage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c11">11</xref>) and is required for development of the embryo (M.Davis, personal communication). Blimp-1 is a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor. One target of Blimp-1-dependent repression in hematopoietic cells is c-<italic>myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c11">11</xref>), a gene that plays key roles in cell growth and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c37">37</xref>) and which is repressed in terminally differentiated cells. However, we (J.Piskurich and K.Lin, unpublished data) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c7">7</xref>) have also identified other genes that are targets of Blimp-1 repression in mice and human cells. It is interesting to note that although <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c38">38</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c39">39</xref>) have c-<italic>myc</italic> homologs, <italic>C.elegans</italic> does not. It will be particularly interesting to learn if Blimp-1 regulates cell proliferation or terminal differentiation in <italic>C.elegans</italic>, where, presumably, there are Blimp-1 targets not related to c-<italic>myc</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Blimp-1 mRNA isoforms</title><p>Although three major and one minor isoform of Blimp-1 mRNA have been identified, their significance is not readily apparent. The three major isoforms differ with respect to 3&#x02032; UT sequence but encode the same protein. The three major isoforms are found in human as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c11">11</xref>) where they are also likely to be the result of alternative polyadenylation. Although the 3&#x02032; UT region of human Blimp-1 cDNA has not been cloned, we could identify in the human <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene the same putative poly(A) addition sequences identified in the mouse 3&#x02032; UT region. Different 3&#x02032; UT sequence and&#x0002f;or poly(A) could affect mRNA stability or translatability. However, the proportion of these isoforms to one another is similar in most tissues of the adult mouse we have investigated (D.Chang, unpublished results). The data suggest, therefore, that these isoforms have neither functional nor regulatory significance.</p><p>The minor isoform lacking exon 7 encodes a protein that does not bind DNA. Theoretically this protein could interfere with the function of the full-length Blimp-1 either by forming a heterodimer with altered function or by sequestering Blimp-1-associating proteins required for function. A recent report shows that an aberrant splice product of the zinc finger protein Ikaros fails to bind DNA and blocks normal Ikaros function by dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c40">40</xref>). At present there is no evidence that Blimp-1 heterodimerizes, making this mechanism unlikely. However, Blimp-1 does require association with hGroucho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c41">41</xref>) and HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c6">6</xref>) in order to function as a transcriptional repressor. If the small, non-DNA binding form is present at sufficient levels, it might sequester one or both of these proteins and block Blimp-1-dependent repression. Our analyses show that steady-state mRNA encoding the small form is usually 10-fold lower than that encoding full-length protein, making this mechanism unlikely unless the small protein is preferentially translated or has increased stability. When antisera become available to distinguish the two forms, it will be important to determine their relative abundance in different cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of Blimp-1 gene expression</title><p>In frogs, sea urchins and mice, Blimp-1 mRNA is expressed early in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd697c13">13</xref>). It is also expressed in various terminally differentiated cells of mouse and human and is induced upon terminal differentiation of both B lymphoid and myeloid cells. Thus, expression of Blimp-1 mRNA is subject to both lineage and developmental stage-specific regulation. The data presented here show that the developmental stage-specific expression of Blimp-1 mRNA in B cells is regulated at the level of transcription initiation. Transfection analyses showed that a 1.1 kb region containing the Blimp-1 transcription initiation sites, initiator element, and ~900 bp 5&#x02032; to the initiation sites has basal promoter activity. However, our studies did not reveal tissue or developmental stage specificity conferred by this region. More detailed analyses, possibly utilizing transgenic mice, may be necessary to unravel the transcriptional regulatory elements of the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene. It is possible that regulation is mediated by transcriptional repressors that could not be identified by transient transfection. Furthermore, some or all of the transcriptional regulation may be mediated by elements such as enhancers or locus control regions, located distal to the promoter. The gene organization presented in this study provides the basis for a systematic search for such regulatory elements.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd697f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (Above) (<bold>a</bold>) Organization of the murine <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gene.
