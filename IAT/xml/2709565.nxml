Here, we show that glucose induces overall acetylation of H3 K9, 18, 27 and H4 K5, 8, 12 in quiescent yeast cells mainly by stimulating two KATs, Gcn5 and Esa1. Genetic and pharmacological perturbation of carbon metabolism, combined with <sup>1</sup>H-NMR metabolic profiling, revealed that glucose induction of KAT activity directly depends on increased glucose catabolism. Glucose-inducible Esa1 and Gcn5 activities predominantly reside in the picNuA4 and SAGA complexes, respectively, and act on chromatin by an untargeted mechanism. We conclude that direct metabolic regulation of globally acting KATs can be a potent driving force for reconfiguration of overall histone acetylation in response to a physiological cue.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, the protein components of the nucleosome core particle, are subject to numerous chemically distinct post-translational modifications. In terms of function and regulation, the best characterized amongst these is reversible acetylation of lysine residues in the conserved histone amino-terminal tails. Histone acetylation is mediated by lysine acetylases (KATs) and reversed by histone deacetylases (HDACs), and controlled to a large extent by mechanisms that impinge on these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). This report concerns physiological regulation of histone acetylation in budding yeast in response to glucose, the preferred carbon source of this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments extend previous studies in which it was shown by immunoblotting analysis of total cellular proteins that overall H3/H4 acetylation declines as yeast cells progress into stationary phase (SP) in response to nutrient depletion from their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Conversely, SP cells inoculated into fresh medium give rise to an expanding population with a relatively high level of histone acetylation (data not shown). Although glucose refeeding in SP does not trigger entry into S phase, it does elicit gross morphological changes characteristic of preparation for re-proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We therefore reasoned that glucose might also induce overall H3/H4 acetylation. Here, we show that glucose refeeding indeed triggers robust acetylation of nucleosomal H3 (at K9, 14, 18, 27) and H4 (at K5, 8, 12) in SP cells. For simplicity, we refer to these events collectively as &#x02018;H3/H4 acetylation&#x02019;.</p><p>Physiological resetting of overall histone acetylation uncoupled from replication is well documented in mammalian cells. For example, H3 K9 and H4 acetylation are induced prior to S phase in mitogenically stimulated B and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), H4 acetylation is induced one day after the onset of embryonic stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), H3/H4 acetylation is induced in cells of the hippocampus and cortex during neuronal rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and H3 K9 acetylation is induced in the course of epigenetic reprogramming in the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Despite the abundant evidence that overall histone acetylation is subject to physiological regulation in non-replicating cells, little is known about the mechanisms of this regulation. We therefore further characterized glucose stimulation overall histone acetylation in SP yeast cells.</p><p>What mechanism could account for glucose induction of acetylation in SP cells? A straightforward and compelling model is suggested by two principles in chromatin biology which are widely appreciated and generally accepted. The first is that physiological cues can trigger signal transduction events which cause transcriptional induction of some genes, and repression of others. The second is that induction of transcription is typically accompanied by increased acetylation of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In yeast, it is well established that signaling pathways activated by glucose can drive reprogramming of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and while our work was ongoing, it was reported that almost 1400 genes are induced when SP cells are fed glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We further show here that glucose induction of H3/H4 acetylation largely depends on two KATs which play a pivotal role in transcription in yeast and higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>). These are Gcn5, which acetylates H3, and Esa1, which acetylates H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>The scenario suggested by previous studies (and consistent with prevailing views in the field) is that glucose induction of overall acetylation in SP cells is simply the sum of targeted acetylation events associated with pervasive induction of transcription driven by glucose-dependent signaling. Surprisingly, this is not the case. Glucose induction of H3/H4 acetylation in SP yeast cells is principally due to direct metabolic induction of KATs which act globally throughout chromatin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, fractionation and culture/refeeding protocols</title><p>Strains are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp270/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>.

Acetylation peaks at 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 9, 12) and is maintained for up to 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and data not shown). After peaking, H4 acetylation slowly declines to below the starting level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 1, 24). These changes were not accompanied by changes in steady-state bulk H4 expression. Parallel feeding revealed: (i) that increased acetylation in cells fed glucose and amino acids is due to the provision of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 9&#x02013;12; average glucose induction corrected for bulk H4 recovery = 4.7, <italic>n</italic> = 3), and (ii) that the persistence of H4ac is positively correlated with the glucose dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, compare lanes 11, 12 to 17, 18; glucose measurements are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Probing with site-specific antibodies revealed that fluctuations in acetylation detected by the H4ac antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D) are due to acetylation and deacetylation at K5, K8 and K12, but not K16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E also shows that H3 K9/K14 acetylation is regulated similarly to H4 K5, 8, 12 acetylation (a more detailed analysis showing glucose induction of H3 K9, K14, K18 and K27 acetylation is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). We conclude that glucose triggers transient acetylation at K5, 8 and 12 of H4 and at K9, 14, 18 and 27 of H3 in SP cells. Control and glucose-fed cells do not differ in their viability during the period of histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), so this response is not due to entry into a state from which reproliferation is not possible. Fractionation studies revealed that the free histone pool is extremely small in SP cells, and that glucose strongly induces acetylation of chromatin-associated H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F). Therefore, the results obtained by immunoblotting of total protein extracts likely reflect the regulation of histones that reside in nucleosomes, or become incorporated into nucleosomes. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Identification of the KATs required for glucose induction of H3/H4 acetylation in SP.

However, glucose induction of acetylation is not coupled to nuclear DNA replication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp270/DC1">Supplementary Figures S1, S2</ext-link>). Our further work therefore focused on identification of the histone modifying enzymes and complexes that are regulated by glucose, and the mechanism of their regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Histone lysine acetylases Esa1 and Gcn5 mediate glucose induction of H3/H4 acetylation in SP</title><p>Theoretically, glucose induction of H3/H4 acetylation in SP could be driven by increased KAT activity, decreased HDAC activity, or both. If this regulation is due to events that impinge on an individual KAT or HDAC, then a mutation that compromises the activity of that enzyme should dampen glucose induction of acetylation. We tested candidate KATs based on this expectation after obtaining evidence that regulation of HDAC activity is unlikely to play a central role in glucose induction of H3/H4 acetylation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp270/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>).</p><p>We predicted an important role for Esa1 in the regulation of H4ac in SP as this KAT is required for maintenance H4 acetylation in log phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and is expressed in SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Because Esa1 is essential for viability, its function was tested by analysis of two temperature sensitive mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) that were allowed to reach SP at the permissive temperature.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B shows that Esa1 activity is required for maintenance of basal acetylation in SP. At room temperature esa1-414 protein is partially inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), and <italic>esa1-414</italic> cells display lower than wild type H4 acetylation (lanes 1, 3). Furthermore, H4 acetylation drops sharply in <italic>esa1-L254P</italic> cells when they are shifted to the restrictive temperature in SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 5, 11), but does not do so in similarly treated wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 1, 7). Accordingly, we propose that dynamic H4 acetylation in SP directly involves Esa1.</p><p>A central role for Esa1 in glucose induction of H4ac in SP was uncovered by refeeding at the permissive and restrictive temperatures. At the permissive temperature, induction of H4 acetylation was slower in <italic>esa1<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutants (particularly <italic>esa1-414</italic>) than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;4, compare 1 and 2 h). When cells grown for 8 day at the permissive temperature were incubated for 1 h at the restrictive temperature and then fed at the restrictive temperature, there was an even more pronounced effect specifically in <italic>esa1<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutants: H4 acetylation was almost completely blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;12). On the other hand, null mutants of <italic>HAT1</italic> and <italic>SAS2</italic>, which encode the other two major H4 KATs in yeast, induce H4ac normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). We conclude that Esa1 activity is critical for robust glucose induction of H4 acetylation in SP. Esa1 does not contribute to H3 acetylation in log phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and is not important for glucose induction of H3ac in SP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp270/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>).</p><p>Of the known H3 KATs, Gcn5 was expected to play an important role in the regulation of H3ac in SP because it has long been known to contribute to the control of overall acetylation of H3 K9 in log phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>). Indeed, H3 acetylation in 8 day <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> cells is much lower than in wild type cells, and glucose induction of H3ac is severely compromised in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, lanes 1&#x02013;4).

We conclude that Gcn5 functions in the establishment and/or maintenance of global H3 acetylation in SP, and has an important role in induction of H3ac upon glucose refeeding.</p><p>One could argue, because <italic>esa1</italic> and <italic>gcn5</italic> mutants have a lower level of acetylation in SP than wild-type cells and fail to induce acetylation to wild-type levels when fed glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and D), that induction of acetylation in SP depends on Esa1/Gcn5 solely for establishment of a threshold level of acetylation that is permissive for glucose induction by other KATs. We do not favour this scenario because glucose induction of acetylation is normal in a non-KAT mutant that has low acetylation in SP (<italic>rpb1-1</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp270/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1F</ext-link>).</p><p>Our results do not exclude the possibility that glucose induction of H3/H4 acetylation in SP cells partly involves KATs in addition to Gcn5 and Esa1.

Therefore, although Esa1 is required for H4 acetylation triggered by glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), NuA4 is not.

Also of note, the cellular yield of picNuA4 increases with culture density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), and its Esa1, Epl1 and Yng2 subunits are expressed in SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and 3A, data not shown).</p><p>Although Gcn5 can acetylate nucleosomes on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), in yeast this enzyme mostly exists in complex with other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Therefore, we predicted that a Gcn5 complex performs glucose-induced H3 acetylation. Our first step in testing this prediction was to comprehensively analyze the site-specificity of Gcn5-dependent H3 tail acetylation in glucose-fed cells. For this experiment, blots were probed with antibodies which exclusively recognize H3 K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K27ac, as well as an antibody directed against acetyl-lysine (Kac). This experiment revealed that acetylation of H3 K9, 14, 18 and 27 is induced by glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 1, 2). As expected from published studies of the KAT-dependency of H3 tail acetylation in log phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), acetylation of H3 K9, K18 and K27, but not K14, strongly depends on Gcn5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 3, 4).</p><p>Three complexes which contain Gcn5 and can acetylate nucleosomal substrates have been well characterized. These are SAGA, SLIK and ADA. We tested if proteins required for the stability of such complexes are required for H3 acetylation in response to glucose. SAGA and SLIK are not detectable in cells lacking Spt7, <italic>rtg2&#x00394;</italic> cells lack SLIK but not SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and the ADA complex is absent in cells lacking Ahc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). We find that glucose induction of Gcn5-dependent H3 acetylation is completely blocked in <italic>spt7&#x00394;</italic> cells, but unaffected in <italic>AHC1</italic> and <italic>RTG2</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and D). This profile suggests that SAGA is sufficient for glucose induction of H3 K9, K18, K27 acetylation, and that neither ADA nor SLIK on its own is &#x02018;necessary and sufficient&#x02019; for the response. Deletion of <italic>SPT8</italic>, which interferes with many known functions of SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), does not block glucose induction of H3 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). Induction of acetylation therefore is either separable from Spt8-dependent functions of SAGA, or can also be mediated by SLIK. A straightforward and parsimonious interpretation of these results is that SAGA is sufficient for glucose-induction of H3 acetylation by Gcn5. An alternative possibility is that an unknown SAGA-like complex mediates untargeted H3 acetylation in glucose-fed cells. We do not favor this possibility because intensive characterization of Gcn5-dependent KATs by multiple independent groups has failed to reveal Spt7-dependent Gcn5 complexes in addition to SAGA/SLIK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>We tested if Gcn5 targeting is important for glucose induction of H3 acetylation using strains harboring mutations in known targeting subunits of SAGA/SLIK. These are Tra1, which mediates association of SAGA/SLIK with trans-activators, and the chromodomain protein Chd1 which binds to K4-methylated H3 in nucleosomes [H3 K4me is commonly found in promoter nucleosomes; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>)]. <italic>tra1-2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) acetylate H3 normally in response to glucose at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E), as do <italic>chd1&#x00394;</italic> cells and a <italic>tra1-2 chd1&#x00394;</italic> double mutant at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>F). It follows that neither Tra1 nor Chd1 plays a substantial role in overall acetylation of H3 after glucose refeeding in SP. Accordingly we propose that SAGA-dependent H3 acetylation in glucose-fed cells occurs by an untargeted mechanism. Furthermore, since inactivation of Tra1 prior to refeeding does not dampen glucose induction of H3 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E), we consider it unlikely that H3 acetylation is due to passive spreading of targeted H3 KATs from induced genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>We do not exclude glucose induction of targeted Esa1 or Gcn5 activity in SP cells. It is clear from our results, however, that induction of targeted activity makes only a minor contribution to glucose induction of overall Esa1/Gcn5-dependent acetylation in the amino-terminal tails of H3 and H4.</p></sec><sec><title>A metabolic mechanism for glucose induction of global histone acetylation</title><p>Two distinct regulatory mechanisms that could contribute to glucose induction of untargeted KATs have been under investigation. Since much cellular regulation depends on signal transduction cascades, we have been testing if signaling previously implicated in gene induction by glucose contributes to the control of untargeted KAT activity. This work is ongoing (so far we have shown that individually compromising the protein kinase A and target of rapamycin signal transduction pathways has little effect on glucose induction of overall histone acetylation in SP; Figures S6, S7 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp270/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>). Based on the idea that increased synthesis of acetyl-CoA, an essential co-substrate of KATs, could stimulate acetylation, we have also tested if glucose metabolism is necessary for upregulation of overall histone acetylation by glucose. This idea builds on the following published results. First, artificial depletion of nuclear acetyl-CoA in log phase cells causes overall histone acetylation to drop precipitously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Second, acetyl-CoA essentially disappears from cells in early SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). And finally, cells that have depleted glucose from the medium (1 day culture) can synthesize acetate and (by inference) ATP when fed glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). As noted by Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), Acs1 and Acs2 receive substrates from glycolytic metabolism. Since glycolytic activity can fluctuate during the life history of a cell, physiological variations in histone acetylation might be regulated by changes in the availability of acetyl-CoA, which result directly from changes in glycolytic rate. Accordingly, we envisioned that acetate and/or ATP resulting from glucose metabolism would be used by acetyl-CoA synthases to increase the availability of acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation by untargeted KATs [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, adapted from ref.

Acid soluble intracellular metabolites were obtained from clarified cell lysates. Targeted metabolic profiling of these samples was performed by <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In this quantitative method, NMR spectra of purified compounds at known concentrations are compared to spectra collected from cell samples. Representative spectra for glucose in one refeeding experiment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B. As expected the concentration of glucose is very low in unfed cells, and rises sharply after refeeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B; the upper panel includes the reference signature peaks for glucose; the lower panel shows glucose in cells). These changes occur in concert with glucose depletion from the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Increases in cellular ADP, ATP, acetate and ethanol concentrations accompany glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). An enzymatic assay confirmed acetate production in glucose-fed SP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). We conclude that glucose feeding in SP results in new synthesis of ATP and acetate, the metabolites required for acetyl-CoA production.</p><p>The acetyl-CoA used by nuclear KATs (and some other enzymes) is synthesized by acetyl-CoA synthase Acs1 and/or Acs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). If glucose induction of acetylation in SP depends on increased synthesis of acetyl-CoA for use by KATs, then Acs1 and/or Acs2 should be expressed in SP, and necessary for glucose induction of acetylation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A shows that Acs1 and Acs2 are both present in SP cells. Acs1 expression in SP is likely due, at least in part, to derepression of <italic>ACS1</italic> transcription under conditions of glucose limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Note that although glucose refeeding might inhibit <italic>ACS1</italic> transcription in SP, Acs1 protein expression remains high during the period when histones are acetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), and enzyme activity declines only slowly under conditions that repress <italic>ACS1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Therefore, acetyl-CoA synthesis in SP cells treated with glucose could result from the activity of both Acs1 and Acs2. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Metabolic regulation of global histone acetylation by glucose.

At the permissive temperature the <italic>acs1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>acs2-Ts1</italic> mutations in combination have no effect on maintenance acetylation, but glucose induction of H4ac is consistently dampened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes 7, 8). If acs2-Ts1 protein is partly defective for acetyl-CoA production at room temperature, then the blunted response in the double mutant might reflect the dependence of glucose induction of acetylation on increased metabolic flux through the ACS enzymes. It follows that the difference in induction of histone acetylation between mutant and wild-type cells could be accentuated at lower temperatures, where reaction rates are slowed. Consistent with this prediction, at 16&#x000b0;C induction of H4ac by glucose is robust in wild-type cells but is not evident in <italic>acs1&#x00394; acs2-Ts1</italic> cells even at 2 h after refeeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C; note that both strains are viable at 16&#x000b0;C). We conclude that ACS activity is essential for glucose induction of acetylation. From a broader perspective, we hypothesize that increased glycolysis provides the metabolites necessary for increased flux through acetyl-CoA synthases Acs1 and Acs2, which in turn expands an acetyl-CoA pool that is used by untargeted KATs for histone acetylation.</p><p>A strong prediction of this hypothesis is that induction of histone acetylation requires execution of all the steps of glycolysis. Consistent with this prediction, the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-D-Glucose (2DG), which is not metabolized after being phosphorylated in the first step of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), does not induce histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Feeding a 1:1 mixture of glucose and 2DG dampens the response in comparison to feeding of glucose alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D), probably because 2DG phosphorylation consumes ATP and blocks ATP production by glycolysis, thereby reducing ATP availability for acetyl-CoA synthesis.</p><p>To further test if glucose catabolism is important for glucose-stimulated histone acetylation, we analyzed glucose regulation of H4ac in a strain defective in pyruvate kinase 1 (Pyk1, encoded by <italic>CDC19</italic>), which catalyzes the final step of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, phosphoenolpyruvate &#x02192; pyruvate). Note that Pyk1 inactivation does not deplete pre-existing ATP stores because ATP consumption during the hexose phase of glycolysis is balanced by its production in the subsequent steps leading to phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7), unfed wild-type and <italic>PYK1</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) have the same level of acetylation at the permissive and restrictive temperatures. The mutant, however, does not support induction of H4ac at either temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E, lanes 1, 2 compared to 3, 4; 5, 6 compared to 7, 8). We conclude that flux through Pyk1 allows for both net ATP generation by glycolysis and production of pyruvate which is used to form acetate that is required for acetyl-CoA synthesis. Glucose induction of histone acetylation in SP is thus critically dependent on its metabolism to produce the acetyl-CoA used by untargeted KATs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A major ongoing effort in biology is focused on determining if there are causal links between physiological fluctuations in metabolism and the activity of other biochemical modules of cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Such links between carbon metabolism and NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent HDACs are now well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Here, we provide the first evidence that physiological regulation of acetylation can also depend on direct metabolic control of KAT activity.</p><sec><title>Glucose induction of untargeted KAT activity</title><p>Glucose induction of overall H3 K9, 18, 27 and H4 K5, 8, 12 acetylation in SP cells depends mainly on the activity of Gcn5 and Esa1, respectively. How does glucose upregulate Gcn5-/Esa1-dependent histone acetylation in SP cells? As part of our effort to answer this question, we assessed the relative contribution of targeted and untargeted KAT activity to the stimulation of acetylation. Given that hundreds of mRNAs are induced when SP cells are refed glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), targeted KAT activity associated with induction of glucose-regulated genes was expected to account for most of the increase in acetylation triggered by glucose. Surprisingly, this is not the case: Esa1-dependent acetylation of H4 can largely be attributed to picNuA4, which is specialized for untargeted acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), and Gcn5-dependent H3 acetylation by SAGA (or a closely related complex) does not require SAGA subunits that are known or likely to target it to genes in the course of transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>A role for SAGA in untargeted acetylation might seem surprising in view of its well-established function in locus-specific histone modification. It is noteworthy, however, that all Gcn5 complexes including SAGA readily acetylate chromatin by an untargeted mechanism in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Therefore, our evidence for untargeted acetylation by SAGA <italic>in vivo</italic> is consistent with its demonstrated substrate specificity.</p><p>Generally speaking our finding that the acetylation state of H3 and H4 in SP cells is largely controlled by untargeted KATs is consistent with published evidence that untargeted KATs have pervasive effects on chromatin acetylation in log phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42 B43 B44 B45 B46">42&#x02013;46</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Untargeted KAT activity is controlled by glycolytic metabolism</title><p>Our further analysis of glucose regulation of Gcn5 and Esa1 activity revealed a previously unknown physiological mechanism by which histone acetylation is modulated in vivo. That is, induction of KAT activity by glucose refeeding in SP depends on increased availability of acetyl-CoA. We base this conclusion on several key observations. The steady state concentration of metabolites required for acetyl-CoA synthesis&#x02014;acetate and ATP&#x02014;increases in SP cells within 15 min of glucose feeding. These metabolites are likely used to produce the acetyl-CoA required for histone acetylation, as induction of acetylation depends on enzymes that require acetyl-CoA (the KATs Esa1 and Gcn5) and the enzymes that generate acetyl-CoA (Acs1 or Acs2). Because net production of ATP by glycolysis, and glucose induction of acetate, both require the last step of glycolysis (phosphoenolpyruvate &#x02192; pyruvate), we propose that glucose-fed SP cells must execute the entire glycolytic program in order to produce acetyl-CoA for use by KATs. This proposal is supported by the finding that inhibition of Pyk1, which catalyzes the final reaction of glycolysis, strongly dampens glucose induction of H3/H4 acetylation. Mitochondria could provide acetate or acetyl-CoA for use by nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA synthases and nuclear KATs (respectively). However such pathways (if they exist) do not make a major contribution to maintenance histone acetylation in log phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), and therefore probably have only a minor role in glucose induction of H3/H4 acetylation in SP.</p><p>Since pulse-feeding of glucose causes a transient increase in acetylation, and the duration of peak acetylation depends on the amount of glucose provided to the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), glucose may be a rheostat-like controller of KAT activity. In this model, histones are deacetylated at late time points after glucose repletion because the balance between KAT and HDAC activity gradually shifts in favor of HDACs as the KAT-inducing signal from glucose decays.</p><p>Glucose-induction of overall H3/H4 acetylation depends mainly on the untargeted activities of Gcn5 and Esa1 (in SAGA and picNuA4, respectively), and glucose catabolism is required for glucose-induction of overall H3/H4 acetylation; it follows that glucose catabolism controls untargeted KAT activity. This finding has several important implications for our understanding of chromatin regulation during entry into and exit from quiescence. In view of the evidence that acetyl-CoA depletion is an early metabolic event in the transition into SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), it helps to explain why overall H4 acetylation declines during SP entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) despite induction of picNuA4 at this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Specifically we propose that protein induction of picNuA4 is compatible with overall H4 deacetylation because cells entering SP do not make enough acetyl-CoA to support increased picNuA4 activity. By extension, it is plausible that metabolic regulation of KAT activity is a mechanism for modulating the acetylation state of chromatin even in cells in which nuclear KATs are otherwise fully activated.</p><p>Glucose triggers systems-wide physiological reprogramming in SP cells: many characteristics of quiescence are lost, hundreds of mRNAs are induced, and events that promote budding are initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Induction of global histone acetylation accompanies these changes (this study), and like them, is a hallmark of re-entry into a proliferative state. Generally speaking this regulation would be beneficial from a fitness perspective in yeast because it intrinsically couples the process of overall chromatin &#x02018;activation&#x02019; to competence for metabolic activity that is associated with a high rate of proliferation. Targeted KATs might also be directly regulated by glycolytic metabolism, although in SP cells this regulation does not make a substantial contribution to changes in acetylation detected by immunoblotting.</p><p>In order to characterize the contribution of untargeted acetylation to glucose regulation of specific chromatin-dependent biochemical activities, it would be optimal to obtain mutants in which untargeted activity is compromised. Using such mutants in glucose refeeding experiments, for example, one could determine how the absence of untargeted KAT activity affects the kinetics of gene induction. Although we are attempting to identify untargeted KAT mutants, none has yet been obtained.</p><p>In the meantime, we speculate that direct glucose induction of untargeted acetylation in SP cells contributes to transcriptional activation. We favor this possibility based on recent work in yeast. Using an activator bypass approach, Imoberdorf <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) showed that high levels of untargeted H3 acetylation allow robust transcription in the context of weak recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. Their work also suggests that the strength of interaction between an activator and its target in the transcriptional machinery might determine the extent to which induction of natural promoters depends on untargeted acetylation. We predict that glycolytic induction of untargeted acetylation in SP cells helps to overcome the gene induction barrier presented by low global acetylation in G0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). When SP cells are refed all the nutrients required for proliferation (glucose, amino acids, vitamins, etc.), the full spectrum of genes that must be induced for a balanced physiological response to the growth stimulus will benefit from chromatin opening triggered by glucose.</p></sec><sec><title>Beyond yeast</title><p>Untargeted KAT activity almost certainly contributes to chromatin acetylation in higher organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The HBO1 and PCAF/STAGA/TFTC complexes of human are respectively equivalent to picNuA4 and SAGA of yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). HBO1, like picNuA4, is specialized for untargeted acetylation of nucleosomal H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), and the human SAGA-related enzymes are capable of untargeted acetylation of nucleosomal H3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50 B51 B52">50&#x02013;52</xref>)</p><p>What we have learned in yeast suggests that direct metabolic regulation of untargeted KATs probably manifests itself in cells which depend heavily on glycolysis for their metabolic needs. Such cells include T cells and cancer cells. T cells, like yeast, can be triggered to re-enter proliferation from a non-dividing state in which metabolism is relatively low. Intriguingly, this T cell &#x02018;activation&#x02019; requires induction of glycolytic metabolism and (at least <italic>in vitro</italic>) is associated with replication-independent induction of overall H4 tail acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). We speculate induction of histone acetylation in T cells partly involves glycolytic upregulation of untargeted KAT activity.</p><p>Many cancer cell types are specialized for energy generation by glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Cancer cells likely experience substantial fluctuations in glucose availability during vascular remodeling within solid tumors and during egress from poorly vascularized tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Perhaps fluctuations in glycolysis accompany such changes in access to glucose and directly modulate untargeted KAT activity, thereby affecting transcriptional reprogramming that promotes cancer cell survival. What makes this scenario attractive is the evidence that the glycolytic phenotype of cancer cells, and tumor cell growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, depend on expression of pyruvate kinase isoform PKM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>).
