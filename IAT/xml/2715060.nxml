The display of self-antigens by thymic epithelial cells is key to inducing tolerance in the T lymphocyte compartment, a process enhanced by the Aire transcription factor. Using a doxycycline-regulated transgene to target Aire expression to the thymic epithelium, complementing the Aire knockout in a temporally controlled manner, we find that Aire is essential in the perinatal period to prevent the multiorgan autoimmunity that is typical of Aire deficiency. Surprisingly, Aire could be shut down soon thereafter and remain off for long periods, with few deleterious consequences. The lymphopenic state present in neonates was a factor in this dichotomy because inducing lymphopenia during <italic>Aire</italic> turnoff in adults recreated the disease, which, conversely, could be ameliorated by supplementing neonates with adult lymphocytes. In short, Aire expression during the perinatal period is both necessary and sufficient to induce long-lasting tolerance and avoid autoimmunity. Aire-controlled mechanisms of central tolerance are largely dispensable in the adult, as a previously tolerized T cell pool can buffer newly generated autoreactive T cells that might emerge.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Adaptive immune systems face the challenge of discriminating between foreign antigens, against which a response may have to be mounted, and self-constituents, which should be ignored or tolerated. Although there are multiple theoretical solutions to the challenge of self/nonself discrimination, Burnet and Fenner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) proposed as a corollary to the clonal selection theory that the problem can be solved on the basis of time considerations; any antigen to which the immune system is exposed in the fetal or early neonatal stages is flagged as self and induces long-term tolerance. Lederberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) extended this notion by postulating that immature lymphocytes have a heightened sensitivity to tolerance induction. This &#x0201c;newborn privilege&#x0201d; was tested by introducing foreign molecules as surrogates for self, and, indeed, it did prove possible to induce tolerance by administration of allogeneic cells, viruses, or proteins to neonates but not in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). However, neonatal exposure was not always tolerogenic, and the outcome was clearly dose dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Although related observations already existed in the literature, the strongest challenge to the notion of neonatal tolerance induction came from a trio of studies published in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), which showed that neonatal lymphocytes could mount full immune responses under the appropriate conditions. Ridge et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) pointed out that the differential effects of fetal versus adult exposure to allogeneic cells highlighted by the Medawar group, long a linchpin of neonatal tolerance, may have been due simply to the large disparities in doses (relative to body size) administered at the two stages. As a result, the notion of neonatal tolerance was questioned in the field, and more attention was given to the influence of concomitant triggering of the innate immune system by inflammatory and microbial ligands.</p><p>One issue with experimental testing of neonatal tolerance induction has been that, going back to the 1950s, investigations mainly relied on the administration of allogeneic or xenogeneic molecules in the tolerization and/or test steps but rarely addressed tolerance to true self-constituents, which were long impossible to manipulate experimentally. The <italic>Aire</italic> gene may provide such an experimental handle. Aire is a transcription factor expressed primarily in medullary epithelial cells (MECs) of the thymus, where it promotes the ectopic expression and presentation of peripheral tissue antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). This presentation imparts deletional tolerance, and Aire deficiency results in multiorgan autoimmune disease in both human patients and KO mice. Importantly in the present context, the autoimmune disease that develops in Aire-deficient mice (hereafter Aire disease) is solely controlled by immunological tolerance and does not require microbial triggers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Thus, Aire-controlled presentation of self might provide a manipulable system that is more appropriate for investigating the temporal aspects of T cell tolerance.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>To this end, we attempted to develop a regulable <italic>Aire</italic> transgenic system that could complement an Aire deficiency in a time- and dose-controlled manner. The TA transgene drives expression of the tetTA (tTA) transcriptional activator in thymic epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>); its product activates the tetOAire (TOA) reporter transgene, which carries the mouse <italic>Aire</italic> complementary DNA (cDNA) under the dictates of a tTA-responsive promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). When both transgenes are present, Aire is expressed in thymic epithelium, but administration of doxycycline (Dox) blocks the interaction of tTA with the reporter gene promoter, turning <italic>Aire</italic> off. The transgenes were crossed to the <italic>Aire</italic> KO mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) on the nonobese diabetic (NOD) genetic background to generate <italic>Aire</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>TA<sup>+</sup>TOA<sup>+</sup> mice, which are referred to as inducible-Aire (iA) mice.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Conditional Aire transgenic system.</bold> (A) Schematic of the Dox-controlled TA and TOA dual transgenes (together referred to as iA).

Similarly, the usual punctate staining of Aire in nuclei from thymic epithelial cells was recovered in iA mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Transgene-encoded Aire was expressed in medullary and cortical epithelial cells, with little to no expression in DCs and macrophages, as expected from the properties of the driver construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Expression in these thymic populations was dependent on the presence of both the driver and reporter transgenes, as the reporter alone yielded no detectable expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Flow cytometry after intracellular staining confirmed the presence of Aire in MECs from iA mice, in quantities slightly higher than those of WT littermates and of an Aire<sup>+</sup> MEC population in close to normal proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>).</p><p>Aire expression in the thymus of iA mice proved sensitive to Dox, with a complete loss of <italic>Aire</italic> transcripts within the first 24 h of Dox treatment and a disappearance of Aire<sup>+</sup> MECs over the subsequent 3 and 5 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>), which is consistent with the rapid turnover of Aire<sup>+</sup> MHCII<sup>hi</sup> MECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Reexpression of Aire after a turnoff period was more sluggish but could be achieved after 1&#x02013;2 wk of Dox withdrawal, particularly when low doses were initially used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref> and not depicted). Because the turnoff with Dox treatment was sharper than the turnon in this model, as in other Dox-controlled transgenic settings, regulated Aire extinction was the strategy primarily used in the studies described in the subsequent paragraphs.</p><p>It was recently reported that <italic>Aire</italic> is expressed in the stromal cells of peripheral lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Aire-encoding transcripts from the iA transgenes were detected almost exclusively in the thymus, with very low expression in the spleen and LNs (&#x0003c;3&#x02013;5% of thymus values; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>, top). In the CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>gp38<sup>+</sup>UEA-1<sup>+</sup> stromal cell population described by Lee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), <italic>Aire</italic> transcripts were 10&#x000d7; more abundant in iA<sup>ON</sup> than in WT mice but were maintained in iA<sup>OFF</sup> animals, likely because of the leakiness occasionally observed with Dox-controlled systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>, bottom left). Similarly, significant transgene-driven <italic>Aire</italic> transcripts were detected in CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup> spleen cells that correspond to the eTAC cells of Gardner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), but this expression was also only partially affected by Dox, with residual expression in treated iA mice comparable to that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>, bottom right). No expression was detected in other tissues, including the lung, kidney, heart, or brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>, top, and not depicted).</p><p>The key test of complementation was whether the iA transgenes could protect, in a Dox-sensitive manner, from Aire disease. Mice with the <italic>Aire</italic>-null mutation on the NOD background develop wasting disease, with a median survival time of 55 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) because of multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration that has particular predilection for the lung, exocrine pancreas, eye, and ovary/prostate. In contrast, NOD.Aire<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are protected from the insulitis that normally affects the NOD strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). These observations were reproduced in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Aire deficiency was indeed complemented by the transgenes, as iA mice in which the reporter was continuously on (iA<sup>ON</sup>) survived to 100 d of age and beyond, developing the typical insulitis of NOD mice, rather than exocrine pancreatitis. Only rare isolated and mild infiltration of the lung or gonads was detected over the course of multiple experiments, comparable with that observed in similarly aged WT mice. Aire turnoff by continuous Dox exposure (iA<sup>OFF</sup>) restored the full array of disease manifestations, confirming that Aire disease depends on regulated Aire expression. As expected, Dox treatment of either WT or KO mice had no effect.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The iA transgenic system rescues Aire disease.</bold> (A) Survival curve of WT (<italic>n</italic> = 7), Aire<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>TOA<sup>+</sup> reporter-only (<italic>n</italic> = 29), iA<sup>ON</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 7), and iA<sup>OFF</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 3) mice.

Consistent with this notion, there was no correlation between peripheral Aire expression, which was largely insensitive to Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>), and protection from disease, which was fully sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). This peripheral expression is thus not relevant to the present study, although it may not be a coincidence that the same peripheral cells that normally express low levels of Aire are also those that show leaky expression of the transgenic reporter.</p><p>Thus, the inducible Aire system provided us with a means to vary the expression of and tolerance to Aire-controlled self-antigens. To dissect the influence of <italic>Aire</italic> expression on tolerance throughout life, we examined the incidence of wasting disease and autoimmune infiltration in iA mice in which Aire was expressed over different time intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Dox treatment should result in clearance of peripheral tissue antigens within a matter of days, from their own molecular turnover and because Aire-positive cells turn over rapidly, with a half-life of 3&#x02013;4 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Turning <italic>Aire</italic> off before birth resulted in full-blown wasting disease and multiorgan autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>), but keeping it on for an increasing number of days after birth resulted in a progressively marked increase in the median survival age and in the protection from multiorgan infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E&#x02013;H</xref>). Mice expressing <italic>Aire</italic> only until 21 d (iA<sup>ON(0&#x02013;21)</sup>) were indistinguishable from iA<sup>ON</sup> controls, including the appearance of &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; insulitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 H</xref>). Several iA<sup>ON(0&#x02013;21)</sup> mice that were observed for &#x0003e;250 d remained similarly free of disease (unpublished data). These results demonstrate that <italic>Aire</italic> expression during the neonatal period is essential for self-tolerance but that it is dispensable beyond weaning age. This conclusion was confirmed by the reverse experiment, in which Aire was turned on only after birth; in spite of continued Aire expression for the remainder of their lives, these animals showed wasting and autoimmune pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 I</xref>). Thus, exposure to self-antigens during the neonatal period is both necessary and sufficient to prevent the devastating autoimmunity associated with Aire disease.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>A neonatal time window for Aire-mediated tolerance.</bold> Survival curve analysis (left; the numbers are the mean survival times in days) and histopathology (right) for iA mice in which <italic>Aire</italic> turnoff was initiated at different times or initiated on embryonic day (e) 0 and then allowed to be reexpressed from birth (day 0), as depicted in the central diagram (black fill, Aire on; white fill, Aire off).

Neonatal T cells are peculiar in several respects, any of which could be relevant in the present context: their TCRs are largely devoid of N-region diversity and have a different intrinsic affinity for major histocompatibility complex molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>); they include relatively few CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory (T reg) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), and they are able to access the parenchymal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Finally, neonatal thymocytes emerge into peripheral T cell compartments that are largely empty and, thus, show lymphopenia-driven proliferation, a state which can provoke effector-like potentialities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Several experiments were set up to explore some of these explanations. First, iA<sup>ON(0&#x02013;21)</sup> mice were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with syngeneic bone marrow while Aire was turned (and maintained) off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), a setting which should recreate in an adult mouse the lymphopenic conditions of the neonate. In this case, iA<sup>ON(0&#x02013;21)</sup> mice did develop wasting disease and multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Unmanipulated iA<sup>ON(0&#x02013;21)</sup> mice remained free of disease, and all other controls behaved as expected (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090300/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Similarly, partial T cell lymphopenia was induced in iA<sup>ON(0&#x02013;21)</sup> mice by injection of depleting anti-CD4/CD8 mAbs at 3 wk of age at the time of Aire turnoff. Multiorgan pathology ensued, albeit in the absence of wasting disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090300/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link> shows additional controls). Third, Aire<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neonates were infused with boluses of adult spleen and LN cells (10 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> T-enriched cells at days 1 and 7), thus reducing their lymphopenic state. Distinct, albeit not complete, protection was achieved with this treatment, with less frequent and delayed wasting and a reduced intensity of histological lesions. Such protection could not be achieved by the transfer of 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells alone, which is equivalent to the number of T reg cells present within the 10 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> T cell&#x02013;enriched cells' bolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090300/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). These results are not compatible with a major influence of the neonatal TCR repertoire or with an intrinsic &#x0201c;openness&#x0201d; of neonatal tissues. Neither are they compatible with an explanation based solely on the relative dearth of T reg cells at birth because after irradiation and reconstitution from bone marrow precursors, T cell populations are restored with largely normal proportions of T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). An explanation which is purely based on T reg cell deficiency would not account for the autoimmune pathology in reconstituted iA<sup>ON(0&#x02013;21)</sup> mice. Rather, they indicate that lymphopenia provides a permissive environment for the initiation of autoimmunity, because T cells spontaneously acquire effector functions and/or are able to enter tissues, in which escape of autoreactive cells from the thymus has deleterious consequences.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Aire is required to prevent autoimmunity during lymphopenia.</bold> Survival curve analysis (left) and histopathology (right) in supplemented Aire-deficient mice (WT, KO, and additional control mice were included in each experiment and are not shown here for clarity but are explained in detail in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090300/DC1">Figs.

The autoimmunity induced by d3Tx was initially thought to reflect defective T reg cells, but it has since been realized that the numbers and activity of T reg cells are normal in d3Tx mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). A unifying interpretation is that the T cell compartment requires exposure to self-antigens in the thymus during the postnatal period. Eliminating this exposure by either thymectomy or shutdown of Aire expression results in incomplete tolerance. This tolerogenic exposure can be achieved only in the thymus and not in the periphery, a notion which is also supported by the classical studies of embryonic quail/chick embryonic grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>); pre/postnatal exposure to peripheral tissues, even as massive as an entire limb, cannot replace the contribution of thymic epithelium. In addition, the lymphopenic state inherent to a growing T cell pool exacerbates this dependency, which is consistent with the autoimmune manifestations often observed in lymphopenic situations, such as the &#x0201c;immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes&#x0201d; observed after T cell depletion in HIV or other viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). In contrast, a fully established adult T cell pool can provide enough control, via regulatory cells or other mechanisms of peripheral tolerance, to buffer incoming self-reactive cells arising from an Aire-deficient thymus. But these buffers can be established only if thymic exposure to self has occurred previously in the formative stages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>The TOA construct contains <italic>Aire</italic> cDNA (positions 36&#x02013;1879 from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_009646.1">NM_009646.1</ext-link>) and an intron and polyadenylation site from the rabbit &#x003b2;-globin gene in the tetO-SB plasmid.

TA mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) were backcrossed more than seven times onto NOD, fixing NOD alleles at A<sup>g7</sup>, <italic>Idd3</italic>, and <italic>Idd5.2</italic>. Aire<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on the NOD background have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Dox hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) was provided in drinking water at 100 &#x000b5;g/ml, unless otherwise indicated. Equal sweetener was added to the water to mask Dox's bitter flavor, and water was changed three times per week. For prenatal or neonatal treatment, Dox-supplemented water was provided to pregnant or lactating mothers. To follow wasting disease, mice were weighed three times per week and sacrificed when they lost 15&#x02013;20% body weight relative to littermates. For bone marrow chimeras, recipients were irradiated (9 Gy), reconstituted with 10 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> bone marrow cells from a syngeneic WT mouse, and kept on with sulfatrim for the remainder of the experiment. For mAb depletion of CD4 and CD8 T cells, mice were treated i.p. with 0.5 mg each of anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5) and anti-CD8 (clone 2.43) every 3 d for a 2-wk period. All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Harvard Medical School facility (protocol 02954 approved by Harvard Medical School's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee). For lymphocyte transfer experiments, spleen and LN cells were depleted of non&#x02013;T cells with the negative selection T cell isolation reagent (Miltenyi Biotec) and 10 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells were injected i.p. into neonates. For T reg cell transfer experiments, T reg cells from spleen and LN of female Foxp3-GFP (NOD) transgenic mice were isolated by sorting (B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>+</sup>) and 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> T reg cells were injected i.p into neonates.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time PCR.</title><p>RNA was prepared from tissues or sorted cells with Trizol (Invitrogen), treated with DNase (Applied Biosystems) for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C to remove contaminating DNA, and cDNA synthesized with random or gene-specific priming (GSP).
