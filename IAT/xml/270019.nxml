GAD65 catalyzes the formation of &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which interacts with neuropeptide Y in the paraventricular nucleus to contribute to stimulate food intake. A case-control study (575 morbidly obese and 646 control subjects) analyzing <italic>GAD2</italic> variants identified both a protective haplotype, including the most frequent alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A (OR &#x0003d; 0.81, 95&#x00025; CI &#x0005b;0.681&#x02013;0.972&#x0005d;, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0049) and an at-risk SNP (&#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G) for morbid obesity (OR &#x0003d; 1.3, 95&#x00025; CI &#x0005b;1.053&#x02013;1.585&#x0005d;, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.014). Furthermore, familial-based analyses confirmed the association with the obesity of SNP &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A haplotype (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 7.637, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02). In the murine insulinoma cell line &#x003b2;TC3, the G at-risk allele of SNP &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G increased six times <italic>GAD2</italic> promoter activity (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) and induced a 6-fold higher affinity for nuclear extracts. The &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP was associated with higher hunger scores (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.007) and disinhibition scores (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.028), as assessed by the Stunkard Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. As <italic>GAD2</italic> is highly expressed in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells, we analyzed GAD65 antibody level as a marker of &#x003b2;-cell activity and of insulin secretion.

However, the role of genetic factors in common obesity is complex, being determined by the interaction of several genes (polygenic), each of which may have relatively small effects (i.e., they are susceptibility genes) and which may work in combination with each other as well as with environmental factors (e.g., nutrient intake and physical activity). The examination of candidate genes for involvement in the susceptibility to common obesity has not yet yielded convincing results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Chagnon1">Chagnon et al. 2003</xref>). Another approach used for identifying genes underlying common polygenic obesity utilizes genome-wide scans in order to detect chromosomal regions showing linkage with obesity in large collections of nuclear families. The power of this approach was proven in other complex traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Horikawa1">Horikawa et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Gretarsdottir1">Gretarsdottir et al. 2003</xref>). A genome-wide scan performed in 158 multiplex French obese Caucasian families (514 individuals) having at least one subject with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and at least one further sibling with a BMI of greater than 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> reported significant evidence for linkage of obesity to a Chromosome 10p locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Hager1">Hager et al. 1998</xref>), with a maximal logarithm of odds (LOD) score (MLS) near the D10S197 marker. Replication studies in both European-American and African-American cohorts confirmed the maximum nonparametric linkage peak at D10S197 for the combined sample set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Price1">Price et al. 2001</xref>) as well as for a German young obese sib cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Saar1">Saar et al. 2003</xref>). All together, these independent linkage studies strengthen the hypothesis of a susceptibility gene for obesity in the Chromosome 10p11&#x02013;12 locus. Marker D10S197 is located in intron 7 of the <italic>GAD2</italic> gene encoding the glutamic acid decarboxylase enzyme (GAD65). GAD65 catalyzes the formation of &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from L-glutamic acid and is expressed in both pancreatic islets and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Erdo1">Erdo and Wolff 1990</xref>).

Single-point analyses showed a cluster of markers with an MLS higher than 1. D10S1639, D10S197, and D10S600 markers displayed an MLS of 3.4, 3.3, and 2.54, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000068-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Multipoint analysis revealed two peaks, at the D10S197 (MLS &#x0003d; 3.2) and D10S600 (MLS &#x0003d; 3.4) markers, respectively. As D10S197 is located in intron 7 of the <italic>GAD2</italic> gene, we sought association of alleles or group of alleles of this marker with obesity. Allele frequencies were compared between obese and control subjects. Empirical <italic>p</italic> value for the normal statistics was 0.0017 and for the lumped allele (Lall) statistics was 0.01, respectively (data not shown), suggesting that a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in partial linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the D10S197 marker may be located nearby.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>GAD2</italic> Gene: SNP Map and Association Studies with Obesity</title><p><italic>GAD2</italic> coding sequences (introns and exons) 3 kb upstream from the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) and 3 kb downstream from the 3&#x02032; UTR were screened for mutations in 24 obese patients from families showing evidence of linkage at the Chromosome 10p locus and in 24 nonobese subjects. In addition, we genotyped previously reported SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Johnson1">Johnson et al. 2002</xref>) and those from public databases. On the basis of their frequency and location in a coding or a putative regulating region, 15 SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000068-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.0000068-t001">Table 1</xref>) were then selected for association studies. As families from the genome-wide scan were recruited through a proband with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, we postulated that the Chromosome 10p putative susceptibility gene may be primarily associated with morbid obesity, which represents less than 1&#x00025; of the adult population in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Charles1">Charles et al. 2002</xref>). Thus, 15 SNPs were genotyped in 48 unrelated morbidly obese patients from families showing evidence of linkage at the Chromosome 10p locus and in 48 nonobese control subjects. For further extensive case-control study, six SNPs &#x02212;2625 A&#x0003e;G, &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G (5&#x02032; flanking region), &#x0002b;84 G&#x0003e;A (intron 1), &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A (intron 11), &#x0002b;70210 A&#x0003e;T (intron 13), and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A (intron 15) were selected, as they were not in complete LD between each other (&#x00394;2) and their frequency was higher than 10&#x00025; and thus could account for the genetic variability of the <italic>GAD2</italic> gene.</p><p>The six SNPs were genotyped in 349 unrelated morbidly obese patients, in 383 unrelated moderately obese subjects, and in 376 unrelated nonobese normoglycemic subjects. We observed a first indication for association (or trend) between morbid obesity and four SNPs at position &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G, &#x0002b;84 G&#x0003e;A, 61450 C&#x0003e;A, and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A (0.035 &#x0003c; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.1; 1.27 &#x0003e; odds ratio &#x0005b;OR&#x0005d; &#x0003e; 1.02). No association was observed between any SNP and moderate obesity (0.2 &#x0003c; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.93) (data not shown). As we cannot exclude an effect of uncommon polymorphisms (prevalence, &#x0003c;5&#x00025;) in the coding regions on morbid obesity, we genotyped SNPs &#x0002b;2414 C&#x0003e;A (Pro153Gln), &#x0002b;53881 C&#x0003e;T (Thr339Thr), and &#x0002b;70210 A&#x0003e;T in this first cohort.

In this replication study, a trend for association between the G allele of the &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP and morbid obesity was found (OR &#x0003d; 1.25 &#x0005b;0.906&#x02013;1.722&#x0005d;, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.17).

No association was detected for SNPs <bold>&#x0002b;</bold>84 G&#x0003e;A and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A. The risk alleles were the G and A alleles for SNP &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G and SNP &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A, respectively.</p><p>Haplotype analyses of SNPs &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G, &#x0002b;84 G&#x0003e;A, &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A, and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A were then performed by both haplotype trend regression (HTR) and permutation and model-free analysis and estimation haplotype (PM&#x0002b;EH&#x0002b;) methods. Haplotypes including SNP &#x0002b;84 G&#x0003e;A with each of the three remaining SNPs did not improve association with morbid obesity, and indeed association of SNP &#x0002b;84 G&#x0003e;A resulted from its LD with the other three SNPs (data not shown). Thus, SNP &#x0002b;84 G&#x0003e;A was excluded from further haplotype analyses. Haplotype structures, including the three SNPs &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G, &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A, and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A, were then investigated in the 575 unrelated morbidly obese patients with familial history of obesity and in the 646 nonobese subjects. Among the eight possible haplotypes defined by SNPs &#x02212;243, &#x0002b;61450, and &#x0002b;83897, only six haplotypes displayed a frequency of greater than 1&#x00025; and their combined prevalence encompassed all but 2&#x00025; of the haplotypes seen in the population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.0000068-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of haplotype frequencies performed by HTR between cases and controls showed evidence for association with obesity with an empirical <italic>p</italic> value of 0.0004.

Frequencies of haplotypes bearing the wild-type alleles (A&#x02013;C&#x02013;T) were significantly higher in nonobese compared to the morbidly obese group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.0000068-t003">Table 3</xref>). It is noteworthy that the risk G allele at SNP &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G was present on several haplotypes with frequencies lower than 1&#x00025; that cannot be taken into account for the haplotype analysis. SNPs &#x02212;243, &#x0002b;61450, and &#x0002b;83897 were in strong LD, and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> between these markers ranged from 556 to 1265; thus, <italic>p</italic> values were &#x0003c;0.00001. In addition, posterior probabilities of haplotype accuracy, as assayed by software for estimating frequencies of large haplotypes of SNPs, SNPHAP, were greater than 0.98 for 98&#x00025; of the subjects included in the study. For the remaining 2&#x00025; of subjects, posterior probabilities ranged from 0.88 to 0.98. Moreover, on a background wild-type CC for SNP &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A or TT for SNP &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A, association of SNP &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G with morbid obesity remained significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.01 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.03, respectively). The independent effect of &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G was confirmed by haplotype analysis of SNPs &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A that presented a significant association with morbid obesity, overall permutation showing an empirical <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001.

For haplotype analysis of SNPs &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A, the global test for association with obesity was significant (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 7.637, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02).

Seventeen nuclear families, with concordant affected sibpairs for the A&#x02013;A genotype, displayed a LOD score of 4.13, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02 (as this LOD score was reached 20 times out of 1,000 simulations, assessing a C allele frequency of 0.72, the value in the control cohorts). When considering a C allele frequency of 0.68 (value in the morbidly obese cohorts), a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.06 was observed. Remaining sibpairs nonconcordant for this genotype displayed a LOD score of 1.75.

Analyses of <italic>GAD2</italic> SNP haplotypes allow us to conclude that SNP &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G and an haplotype including SNPs &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A displayed separate effects, as these genetic risk factors have never been encountered on the same haplotype.</p><p>These assumptions are primary based on case-control studies in French Caucasian adult patients, a population still protected against massive obesity, as its prevalence is three to five times lower compared to the United States' population. As our initial affected sibpair linkage study only included individuals with adult onset of obesity, few families have parental genotype information. However, to exclude false-positive association (due to population stratification) and to assess the contribution of <italic>GAD2</italic> SNPs to the observed linkage on Chromosome 10p12, we performed studies to examine familial association and association with the evidence of linkage in the nuclear families from the original population showing linkage on this locus. We observed a modest but significant evidence of association with obesity and the linkage signal. For SNP &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A, at-risk homozygous-bearing (A&#x02013;A) affected sibpairs (17 nuclear families) displayed a significant LOD score of 4.13. Remaining affected sibpairs nonconcordant for this genotype displayed alone a LOD score of 1.75 at this locus. Although this suggests that a unique SNP of the <italic>GAD2</italic> gene could explain a significant part of the linkage on Chromosome 10p12 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02&#x02013;0.06), the effect of this SNP, in terms of relative risk, given the prevalence of 1&#x00025; of morbid obesity and the SNP allelic frequency of 32&#x00025; in the morbidly obese cohort, is not compatible with such a high MLS. Therefore, it is very likely other SNPs and/or genes located nearby on Chromosome 10p could contribute to the observed linkage.</p><p>SNP &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G, although shown to be associated with morbid obesity in case-control cohorts and to modulate the <italic>GAD2</italic> promoter activity, did not show significant evidence of familial association with obesity and the linkage signal. To observe a linkage, we need at least one of the risk factors to be heterozygous for parents and transmitted to affected offspring. Indeed, the risk G allele at the &#x02212;243 locus is less frequent than its counterpart at the &#x0002b;61450 locus (0.21 versus 0.32), and if 17 homozygous-bearing (A&#x02013;A) affected sibpairs were scored for the &#x0002b;61450 SNP, only three homozygous-bearing (G&#x02013;G) affected sibpairs were scored for the &#x02212;243 SNP. Thus, an association with obesity and the linkage signal for the &#x02212;243 SNP, if it exists, may remain undetected. However, the effect of the gene does not necessarily lie only on one SNP. It is very possible that other variations in the gene, as &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G, may have an effect, although undetected by linkage.</p><p>We believe that our case-control data showing association between <italic>GAD2</italic> SNPs and morbid obesity do not result from a stratification bias, as there is little allelic heterogeneity in European populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Ardlie2">Ardlie et al. 2002b</xref>), and moreover our family-based data support this association. It is noteworthy that only 16&#x00025; of the obese subjects included in case-control analyses were part of the genome-scanned and fine-mapped families, ruling out that the observed association is specific to this small group. In this respect, results remained qualitatively similar (but less significant, as the number of subjects was lower) when removing these obese probands from the case-control studies (ORs of 1.28, 95&#x00025; CI &#x0005b;1.04&#x02013;1.59&#x0005d;, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02; 1.17, 95&#x00025; CI &#x0005b;0.97&#x02013;1.41&#x0005d;, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.1; and 1.13, 95&#x00025; CI &#x0005b;0.91&#x02013;1.41&#x0005d;, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.296, respectively, for SNPs &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G, &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A, and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A).</p><p>SNPs &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A are located, respectively, in <italic>GAD2</italic> intron 11 and 15 and their functional role is not obvious. On the other hand, the hypothesis of a functional effect for SNP &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G is further supported by transcriptional activity studies, clearly showing that the G allele of SNP &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G increased <italic>GAD2</italic> promoter activity although two nearby promoter SNPs (&#x02212;1600 G&#x0003e;A and &#x02212;2004 A&#x0003e;T) in strong LD with SNP &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G did not modulate promoter activity. As suggested by EMSA, a nuclear protein that remains to be identified could have an higher affinity for the G allele. Furthermore, obese homozygous carriers of the G allele at &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G SNP were characterized with overeating features as evaluated by the TFEQ. They had significantly higher indexes of hunger and disinhibition, which characterize higher sensitivity to the sensorial stimulation of food, leading in certain circumstances to a decreased ability to control their food intake over the time.</p><p>The disinhibition score has also been highly associated with binge-eating features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Heartherth1">Heartherth and Polivy 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Lawson1">Lawson et al. 1995</xref>). Eating behavior was shown to be partially heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Faith1">Faith et al. 1997</xref>), and several susceptibility loci were suggested from genome-wide scan studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Steinle1">Steinle et al. 2002</xref>). In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Branson1">Branson et al. (2003</xref>) recently reported that binge-eating was a major phenotypic abnormality associated with mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4-R), suggesting that MC4-R contributes to modulate eating behavior. A significant linkage on Chromosome 10p was recently identified in bulimia nervosa, a psychiatric disorder characterized by overeating and self-induced vomiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Bulik1">Bulik et al. 2003</xref>). Here, the probability to detect genetic mutations massively increasing BMI is higher. Both our in vitro and genetic findings suggest that <italic>GAD2</italic> SNPs may have contributed to the worsening of obesity in this population, possibly though a disability of the rare allele carriers in controlling their food intake. Further clinical investigation in bearers would be needed to validate this hypothesis. At present, we speculate that an increased activity of the <italic>GAD2</italic> gene may increase the GABA pool in the hypothalamus, thus enhancing GABA orexigenic effects, resulting in an altered feeding behavior. Several lines of investigation support a role for GABA in regulation of feeding behavior. Investigation in turkeys has demonstrated that intracerebroventricularly injection of varying doses of muscimol, a potent GABA agonist, caused a dose-dependant increase of food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Denbow1">Denbow 1991</xref>). Transgenic mice ubiquitously overexpressing the GABA transporter exhibited heritable obesity, with increased body weight and fat deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Ma1">Ma et al. 2000</xref>). GABA is coexpressed in the subpopulation of NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus, suggesting that GABA and NPY interact in the paraventricular nucleus to stimulate food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Ovesjo1">Ovesjo et al. 2001</xref>). Indeed, the gut-secreted hormone PYY3&#x02013;36, which potently inhibits food intake in both rodents and in human, acts by inhibiting NPY neurons, thus disinhibiting pro-opiomelanocortinergic (POMC) neurons through a GABA-mediated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Batterham1">Batterham et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>The dopaminergic neurons were previously suggested to be involved in behavioral disorders, such as eating disorders.

Dopamine D2 receptor polymorphisms were reported to be associated with obesity in Pima Indians from Arizona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Jenkinson1">Jenkinson et al. 2000</xref>).

The <italic>GAD2</italic> gene is highly expressed in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells and GAD65 is the most important autoantigen in type 1 diabetes. In each &#x003b2; cell, there are 3,000 small GABA-containing neuron-like secretory vesicles, similar to the clear synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals. It has been speculated that GABA-containing microvesicles are released by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent exocytosis and may have an autocrine/paracrine function within the islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Gu1">Gu et al. 1993</xref>). GABA released from the &#x003b2; cell accordingly inhibits insulin exocytosis by activation of GABA-B receptors (G protein-coupled receptors) and in the &#x003b1; cell suppresses glucagon release by activation of GABA-A receptor Cl channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Rorsman1">Rorsman et al. 1989</xref>; P. Rorsman, personal communication). Given the anorectic role of insulin and of glucagon-related peptides in the CNS, it is also possible that <italic>GAD2</italic> SNP-related increase of the GABA pool in pancreatic islets contributes to modulate food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Niswender1">Niswender et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>In order to be able to test this hypothesis in humans, we analyzed the GAD65Ab level as a marker of &#x003b2;-cell activity and of insulin secretion. Indeed, it was recently shown that in a nondiabetic general population from Sweden, the ORs for subjects in the highest BMI group to exceed the 95th or 99th GAD65Ab percentile were 3.6 and 17.6, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Rolandsson1">Rolandsson et al. 1999</xref>). Previously confirmed among first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetes patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Weets1">Weets et al. 2001</xref>), this correlation between obesity and GAD65Ab levels was also observed in our French population and may be due to the overstimulation of the &#x003b2; cells associated with obesity. In order to have an indirect confirmation of the <italic>GAD2</italic> SNP functional role, we then examined possible associations between the SNPs &#x02212;243 A&#x0003e;G, &#x0002b;61450 C&#x0003e;A, and &#x0002b;83897 T&#x0003e;A and GAD65Ab and plasma insulin levels. These analyses showed lower GAD65Ab levels (especially in the control group) and lower insulin secretion indexes in homozygous variant carriers at any of these SNPs. This is in agreement with a negative regulation by GABA (generated by GAD65 in the &#x003b2; cells) of the first phase of insulin secretion in response to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000068-Shi1">Shi et al. 2000</xref>). The fact that GAD65Ab and related insulin values are lower in <italic>GAD2</italic> carriers of SNP variant alleles but are higher in obese compared to normal-weighted subjects may look like a paradox if one wants to see a direct role of GAD65Ab in the development of obesity. Further, we think that the presence of GAD65Ab is only a marker of hyperinsulinemia and has nothing to do with the molecular mechanisms responsible for obesity. Instead, GAD65Ab levels should be considered as an intermediary phenotype for <italic>GAD2</italic> gene higher expression in subjects carrying the at-risk SNPs that in turn may impair insulin secretion, decrease GAD65Ab secretion, and ultimately influence food intake behavior through insulin central effects.</p><p>In conclusion, our data point out <italic>GAD2</italic> gene as a candidate for morbid obesity.

This method considers all the possible informative triads and discordant sibpairs (DSPs) in the pedigree. A variable is created that is either the difference between the number of transmissions and the nontransmission for a given allele in a triad or the difference between the frequency of this allele in affected and unaffected member of the DSP. The sum of this value is weighted by the number of units (triad and DSP) in each pedigree. The new random variable D is then summed over all the pedigrees. It is expected to be equal to 0 under the null hypothesis of no linkage and no association and D/<inline-formula>&#x0221a;<overline>Var(D)</overline></inline-formula> follows a Normal with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.</p><p>We decided to use the option that computes the statistic for the trios and only when the founders are untyped uses DSP.

The tests uses the generic form S &#x0003d; &#x003a3;T&#x000b7;X as a test statistic, where summation is over all offspring in all families in the dataset. The distribution of S under H<sub>0</sub> is calculated using the distribution of offspring genotype, conditional on the trait T and on the parental genotype, or the sufficient statistics when parental genotype is unobserved. The value S &#x02212; E(S)/<inline-formula>&#x0221a;<overline>Var(S)</overline></inline-formula> follows a Normal (0,1). As we are in a region of linkage, with several individuals in each family, we chose the option &#x02212;e that calculates an empirical variance and provides a valid test of association in this case. The phenotype was coded 1 for affected and 0 for unaffected, giving them a null weight in the final statistic. This is an affected-only test, although the genotypes of unaffected are used when the parents' genotypes are missing.</p><p>The FBAT program allows for haplotype tests. We therefore repeated this association test on haplotypes.</p><p><italic>Association with Evidence of Linkage.</italic> We sought to test whether any of the SNPs was responsible for the observed linkage. We therefore split the sample of affected sibpairs onto pairs concordant for genotype categories (1 1, 1 2, 2 2, 1 X, 2 X). Note that the sets of 1 X and 2 X, where X represents allele 1 or 2, are overlapping. If a genotype is responsible for the observed linkage, we expect that the MLS of the set of the pairs concordant, or identical by state (IBS) for this genotype, which we call MLSg, is significantly higher than what is expected under H<sub>0</sub>. In our case, H<sub>0</sub> includes linkage and association. We then derive a <italic>p</italic> value through simulation after preserving the linkage information (i.e., the identical by descent &#x0005b;IBD&#x0005d; status for each pair) and the association (the number of pairs concordant for the genotype).</p><p>It is worth pointing out that genotype category-specific MLSg cannot be considered as a traditional MLS. Indeed, we select pairs where IBS is 2 and the IBD status is not independent of the IBS status. Therefore, the MLSg does not follow a mixture of &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests with 1 or 2 df, as usual. The <italic>p</italic> value is obtained through simulation under H<sub>0</sub>.</p><p>We simulate the parents' genotype and drop the alleles in the offspring according to the transmission probabilities (&#x000bd;&#x02013;&#x000bd;) and the IBD status. For each pair, its IBD status is drawn from the <italic>z</italic><sub>ij</sub> distribution, where <italic>j</italic> &#x0003d; (0,1,2) is the number of alleles IBD and <italic>j</italic> is the pair's index. These values were obtained with the GeneHunterPlus software. Note that in parents, we just determine the number of 1 and 2 alleles, from an original allelic frequency (<italic>f</italic>1), and then just shuffle the alleles among them. Therefore, we will have the same allelic frequency in founders for each replicate. For a valid test of association with evidence of linkage, we count the number of times the replicate LOD score exceeds the observed LOD score, for a number of pairs equal to the original (if there are N pairs 11 11, we will use only the replicates where we observe N pairs simulated).
