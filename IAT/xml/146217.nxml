It has a high sequence similarity to the erythroid-specific bZIP factor p45 NF-E2 in the CNC domain, which is involved in DNA binding. LCR-F1, a TCF11 isoform, is a more potent transcriptional activator than p45 NF-E2 in erythroid cells. We show here that the TCF11 protein interacts to form heterodimers with small Maf proteins, previously shown to dimerize with p45 NF-E2, ECH and Fos. Such heterodimerization significantly alters the DNA binding characteristics of TCF11. While TCF11 alone binds in vitro to the tandem NF-E2 site derived from 5' DNase hypersensitive site 2 in the beta-globin locus control region and to the single NF-E2 site in the porphobilinogen deaminase gene promoter, stronger binding is detected in the presence of small Maf proteins. Using antibodies, TCF11 isoforms bound to the single NF-E2 site were detected in K562 erythroid cell nuclear extracts. These findings place TCF11 as a good candidate for the proposed widely expressed factor(s) known to interact with small Maf proteins and bind NF-E2 sites in a sequence-specific manner resembling NF-E2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
