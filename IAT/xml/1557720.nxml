The tumor burden in the spine and the lung following inoculation of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3-expressing 66cl4 (66cl4beta3) tumor cells or control 66cl4pBabe into the mammary gland was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR.

Moreover, &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 increased 66cl4 tumor cell adhesion and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3-dependent haptotactic migration towards bone matrix proteins, as well as their chemotactic response to bone-derived soluble factors <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results demonstrate for the first time that tumor-specific &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 contributes to spontaneous metastasis of breast tumors to bone and suggest a critical role for this receptor in mediating chemotactic and haptotactic migration towards bone factors.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer affects one in ten women in developed nations. The prognosis is favorable for women with clinically confined tumors at the time of diagnosis, but mortality rates are greater than 80% in cases where the tumor has metastasized to distant sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Metastasis to bone occurs frequently in advanced breast cancer and is accompanied by debilitating skeletal complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Current treatments are largely palliative and new therapies that specifically prevent the spread of breast cancer to bone are urgently required. Little is known, however, about the molecular determinants that regulate homing of breast cancer cells to bone.</p><p>Integrins are dimeric adhesion receptors that mediate cellular attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) or to adjacent cells. Interaction of integrins with their substrates regulates various cellular functions associated with tumor development and metastatic progression, including cell adhesion, migration, invasion, proliferation and survival/anoikis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The changes in the integrin activation state and the alteration in the level of expression of integrins or their ECM ligands have therefore been extensively documented and are thought to contribute to neoplastic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Studies examining the expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin in various tumor tissues have been strongly suggestive of a potential role for this receptor in tumor progression, particularly for invasive tumors that preferentially metastasize to bone, such as breast and prostate carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. &#x003b2;3-type integrins (&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;3) are expressed in multiple cell types including invasive tumor cells, osteoclasts, activated endothelial and smooth muscle cells, platelets, megakaryocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Accordingly, the contribution of several of these &#x003b2;3-expressing cell populations to tumor growth and metastatic progression has been demonstrated in studies using specific inhibitors and/or genetic ablation of &#x003b2;3 receptors in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with enhanced endothelial expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin in the tumor vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and its role in promoting primary tumor growth, small molecule antagonists or function-blocking antibodies targeting &#x003b2;3 integrins exert anti-tumor effects concomitant with decreased tumor vascularization in melanoma, prostate cancer and breast cancer xenograft models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, studies examining tumor growth in mice null for &#x003b2;3 integrin have yielded results apparently at odds with the inhibitor data. In contrast to the decreased tumor growth and angiogenesis observed upon treatment with &#x003b2;3 inhibitors, these responses are enhanced in &#x003b2;3-null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To reconcile these studies, it was proposed that &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 may function as an angiogenic switch, promoting vessel growth when ligated but triggering an apoptotic response in &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3-expressing endothelial cells in the absence of appropriate ligand. In &#x003b2;3-null mice the absence of endothelial &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 may remove apoptotic signals, allowing excessive endothelial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Some of the discrepancies between studies using &#x003b2;3 antagonists and genetic ablation of &#x003b2;3 may be attributed also in part to the lack of receptor specificity for some of the inhibitors used <italic>in vivo </italic>or to their direct effect on tumor cells, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. &#x003b2;3 inhibitors would presumably inhibit both host populations and tumor cell populations expressing these receptors, whereas &#x003b2;3 ablation would target only host populations, including cells of the innate immune system, which may exert either pro-tumor or anti-tumor effects and produce a net stimulatory effect on primary tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>While there is strong correlative evidence supporting the role of tumor-specific &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 expression in breast cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], its precise contribution to primary tumor growth and metastasis is still unclear. Human breast tumor lines expressing &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 are typically more metastatic in xenograft models than those that do not express this receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. From <italic>in vitro </italic>studies, a variety of functions likely to contribute to tumor progression have been ascribed to &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 expressed on tumor cells. In particular, &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 mediates breast tumor cell adhesion to vitronectin and other bone ECMs and promotes their survival, migration and invasion on bone matrix <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These processes can be inhibited by anti-&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 antibodies or antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, activated &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 regulates protease maturation, is required for breast tumor cell interaction with platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and contributes to breast tumor cell adhesion to the subendothelial matrix under dynamic blood flow conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p><italic>In vivo </italic>studies addressing specifically the role of tumor cell &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 on primary tumor growth are conflicting, however. Exogenous expression of wildtype or constitutively active &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in transformed human astrocytes exerts suppressive effects on intracranial growth of gliomas, giving rise to fewer and smaller tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in 21NT human mammary carcinoma cells is insufficient alone to enhance their growth in the mammary fat pad of nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], whereas the same approach reduces subcutaneous growth of MCF-7 cells in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It is also probable that tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 may have different roles at various stages of metastatic progression. In fact, expression of activated &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in melanoma and breast cancer cells enhances experimental metastasis to the lung following intravenous injection of tumor cells (which bypasses the formation of a primary tumor) in immune-compromised mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Enhanced metastasis of breast tumor cells was postulated to be mediated through tumor-induced platelet aggregation and arrest in capillaries as these processes are inhibited by antibodies targeting specifically platelet &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;3 or human &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 on tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Whether these interactions are required for spontaneous metastasis of breast tumors from orthotopic sites remains unclear, however.</p><p>Vascular or oral administration of selective inhibitors of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 S247 and S137, respectively, was reported to significantly reduce spontaneous metastasis of 435/HAL breast tumor cells to the lung from the mammary gland in severe combined immunodeficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Neither drug inhibited primary tumor growth or platelet aggregation at the concentration used, and thus the antimetastatic effects are unlikely to be mediated through these processes. Similar evidence supporting the role of tumor-specific &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in bone metastasis has been reported. Chinese hamster ovary cells or MDA-MB-231 variants overexpressing &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 are more metastatic to bone than their respective parental line when inoculated intravenously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Conversely, treatment of mice with the selective &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 inhibitor S247 dramatically reduces the incidence and size of MDA-MB-435 osteolytic lesions whereas the specific platelet aggregation inhibitor ML464 prevents B16 melanoma metastases to bone in the intracardiac experimental model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>While informative, the lack of a primary tumor in experimental models of bone metastasis makes it difficult to assess whether tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 is required at the primary site, the metastatic site or both sites for spontaneous metastasis from the mammary gland to bone. Conversely, current xenograft models of breast cancer metastasis are poorly metastatic to bone from the orthotopic site and thus have not been used to investigate the role of tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in spontaneous breast cancer metastasis to bone. To circumvent these problems, we have used a syngeneic orthotopic model of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis developed in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and asked whether exogenous expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin in 66cl4 mammary carcinoma cells that metastasize to the lung but not bone is sufficient to promote their spontaneous metastasis from the mammary gland to bone. The model allows the simultaneous measurement of the impact of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 expression on primary tumor growth and on the metastatic burden in bone in immunocompetent Balb/c mice. Our results indicate that tumor expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 does not alter the proliferation of 66cl4 cells <italic>in vitro </italic>or in the mammary gland, and nor is it required for their growth in bone. The expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in these cells, however, is sufficient to promote their spontaneous metastasis to bone. Assays mimicking various steps of the metastatic process suggest a critical role for this receptor in regulating the chemotactic response of mammary carcinoma cells to bone-derived factors, in regulating adhesion and migration towards bone matrix proteins and in the recruitment of osteoclasts to bone metastatic sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell and cell culture</title><p>The mouse mammary epithelial cell lines 4T1, 66cl4 and 67NR were derived by Dr F Miller (Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit, MI, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. 4T1.2 and 4T1.13 are clonal cell lines derived from 4T1 by our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

The cells were washed extensively with PBS, and then 600 &#x003bc;l serum-free &#x003b1;-MEM was added and the cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for a further 2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C.

Genomic DNA was extracted from organs and a multiplex reaction was performed on genomic DNA from each organ to determine the ratio of the vimentin signal (present in all cells) to the LXSN signal (retroviral LTR sequence present in stably integrated pBabe vector in tumor cells only).

The 4T1.2 and 4T1.13 lines are highly metastatic to lymph nodes, lungs and bone following inoculation into the mammary gland. The 66cl4 line shows a low level of metastasis from the mammary fat pad to the lung, but not to bone. The 67NR line is nonmetastatic. All four lines were derived from the same spontaneous mammary carcinoma in a Balb/c/C3H mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin in these cell lines was investigated by flow cytometry using antibodies specific to the &#x003b1;v and &#x003b2;3 subunits and an isotype-matched control antibody. Both &#x003b1;v and &#x003b2;3 subunits were expressed by 4T1.2 and 4T1.13 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). 67NR and 66cl4 expressed low levels of the &#x003b1;v subunit, but not of &#x003b2;3 integrin. The expression of integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 is therefore restricted to bone metastatic lines in this model and is correlated with their aggressive metastatic phenotype.</p><p>To investigate the relationship between &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin expression and bone metastasis, &#x003b2;3 integrin expression was induced in 66cl4 cells by retroviral infection of mouse &#x003b2;3 cDNA. A pool of cells stably expressing high levels of &#x003b2;3 was selected by puromycin resistance followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These cells were designated 66cl4beta3 and represent the brightest 30% of the total puromycin-resistant population. Expression of &#x003b2;3 integrin enhanced expression of both &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;v integrin subunits at the cell surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The same phenomenon has been reported in MCF-7 breast cancer cells following exogenous expression of the &#x003b2;3 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and may be due to enhanced transcription of the &#x003b1;v subunit or redistribution of a pre-existing intracellular pool. Integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 expression was stable in 66cl4beta3 cells for the duration of the experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin enhances spontaneous metastasis to the lung and bone</title><p>Given the correlation between &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 expression and the ability to metastasize to bone in the metastasis model, it was of interest to determine whether expression of this integrin altered the primary tumor growth or metastasis in Balb/c mice. 66cl4pBabe or 66cl4beta3 cells were injected into the fourth mammary fat pad of Balb/c mice (<italic>n </italic>= 15/group). Tumors were palpable 9 days after injection. The 66cl4beta3 tumors grew slightly faster than the control group, although the difference in the growth rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>) or the final tumor weight at the completion of the experiment on day 39 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>) was not statistically significant. Similarly, there was no difference between the proliferation rates of 66cl4beta3 and 66cl4pBabe cells <italic>in vitro </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). The expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin therefore does not alter tumor growth at the primary site.</p><p>Lungs and spines were harvested for analysis of the metastatic tumor burden by RTQPCR. The metastatic burden of 66cl4beta3 cells in the spine increased 20-fold over that observed with 66cl4pBabe cells, with a relative tumor burden of 25.8 &#x000b1; 9.2 in 66cl4beta3 compared with 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.4 in 66cl4pBabe (<italic>P </italic>= 0.01) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Spines were chosen for quantitative RTQPCR analysis of the tumor burden in bone because the metastatic burden in the spine is typically larger and more frequent in this model than metastasis to the femur or tibia. Spontaneous metastasis of 66cl4beta3 tumors to long bones clearly occurred in some mice, however, as evidenced by histological examination of femoral sections (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). As expected, no femoral metastases were seen in mice injected with 66cl4pBabe cells.</p><p>Similarly, there was a trend toward increased metastasis of 66cl4beta3 tumors to the lung compared with 66cl4pBabe tumors, with average relative tumor burdens of 590 &#x000b1; 303 and 295 &#x000b1; 163 (mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P </italic>= 0.32) &#x02013; most probably due to the stochastic nature of spontaneous metastasis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>). It should be noted that the high lung tumor burden in mice injected with 66cl4beta3 limited the lifespan of these mice and necessitated early termination of the experiments, therefore restricting the time available for the development of bone metastases. Attempts to extend the 39-day endpoint by resection of the primary tumors at day 14 did not increase survival time appreciably due to early onset of lung metastases.</p><p>Visual examination of all mice at harvest failed to detect visible 66cl4pBabe or 66cl4beta3 metastases in the lymph nodes, liver or kidneys (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin in breast tumor cells induces spontaneous metastasis from the mammary gland to bone in a tumor line that does not normally metastasize to this organ.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin is not required for proliferation in bone but enhances osteoclast recruitment and osteolysis</title><p>To determine whether expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin is required for proliferation in bone, 66cl4beta3 or 66cl4pBabe cells were injected directly into the tibia. Mice were culled after 14 days and the tibias were processed for quantitative measurement of the tumor burden by RTQPCR or for histological examination of serial sections taken from three levels through each tibia, and were stained with H&#x00026;E to confirm tumor growth and to measure the length of the bone surface adjacent to the tumor nodule. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a&#x02013;c</xref>, the extent of the tumor deposit was similar for 66cl4pBabe and 66cl4beta3 cells, indicating that tumor expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin does not directly confer a proliferative advantage in bone and that the failure of 66cl4pBabe to metastasize spontaneously to bone is not due to its inability to grow in this organ.</p><p>Osteoclast-mediated resorption of bone is intimately linked to growth of breast cancer in bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Recruitment and activation of osteoclasts in proximity of the metastatic nodule is well documented and thought to contribute indirectly to metastatic growth in bone via the release of mitogenic factors from the bone matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. To determine whether expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 alters tumor-associated bone resorption, the ability of 66cl4beta3 cells to influence osteoclastogenesis within the bone microenvironment following intratibial injection of the cells was investigated. Sections adjacent to those stained with H&#x00026;E were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity to detect active osteoclasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a,b</xref>). The density of osteoclasts (osteoclasts/mm) was determined at each level through each tibia. Analysis of tibias injected with 66cl4beta3 and 66cl4pBabe cells in two independent experiments showed that osteoclast density was approximately twofold higher in the 66cl4beta3 tibial tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Osteoclasts were present at the interface between the bone and tumor cells and also at the interface between the tumor and the bone marrow. Cortical bone surfaces adjacent to 66cl4beta3 tumor nodules showed extensive resorption (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). In contrast, fewer osteoclasts and negligible bone resorption were observed in the proximity of the 66cl4pBabe tumor deposits (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin stimulates tumor cell adhesion to vitronectin</title><p>To explore the mechanisms by which &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin enhanced metastasis to bone, the ability of the cells to adhere to extracellular matrix molecules was investigated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In this short-term adhesion assay (30 minutes), none of the lines adhered to the control BSA coating. The 67NR line adhered only weakly to vitronectin, fibronectin and collagen IV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). None of the substrates tested promoted rapid adhesion of the weakly metastatic line 66cl4pBabe. Exogenous expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin in 66cl4 cells, however, resulted in markedly increased adhesion to vitronectin, but not to other matrices (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Bone metastatic 4T1.2 cells similarly adhered most avidly to vitronectin but poorly to other substrates, whereas 4T1.13 cells showed moderate binding to collagen IV and vitronectin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). In adhesion assays extended over several hours, the cells adhered to all these matrices (data not shown). Treatment of 66cl4beta3 and 4T1.2 cells with a function-blocking anti-&#x003b2;3 integrin antibody, but not with an isotype-matched control antibody, substantially inhibited their adhesion to vitronectin, indicating that adhesion to vitronectin was mediated specifically via &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). A similar inhibition of binding to vitronectin was observed in the 4T1.13 line (data not shown).</p><p>Additional experiments were conducted to assess whether tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 may contribute to attachment to endothelial cells, a process required for intravasation/extravasation of metastatic tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. We compared 66cl4pBabe and 66cl4beta3 cells for their ability to attach to a confluent monolayer of microvascular endothelial bEnd.3 cells in the absence of serum. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>, both 66cl4pBabe and 66cl4beta3 cells adhered to bEnd.3 cells to the same extent, indicating that &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 is not required for their adhesion to endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin promotes migration and invasion of 66cl4 cells</title><p>To metastasize successfully, cells need to acquire a motile phenotype and to invade through the basement membrane and surrounding stroma. Site-specific metastasis has been proposed to be regulated, in part, by adhesion to and migration towards the ECM expressed at metastatic sites. To explore the role of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin in these processes, we first compared the haptotactic migration of 66cl4pBabe and 66cl4beta3 cells towards specific extracellular matrix substrates coated on the underside of the porous membranes of the transwell inserts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). The inserts were placed in wells containing serum-free medium. Collagen IV stimulated the haptotactic migration of 66cl4pBabe cells with a further enhancement in 66cl4beta3 cells. This migration, however, was not blocked by antibodies targeting &#x003b2;3 integrin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). Control 66cl4pBabe cells showed no haptotactic migration towards osteopontin, an abundant &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin ligand in bone, presumably due to their lack of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 expression. Consistent with this, 66cl4beta3 cells were strongly migratory towards osteopontin in a process blocked completely by neutralizing antibodies against integrin &#x003b2;3. Migration towards vitronectin was also strongly stimulated by &#x003b2;3 integrin expression in 66cl4beta3 cells and was partially inhibited by neutralization of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>).</p><p>The cooperative role of integrins and MMPs in tumor cell migration and invasion has been extensively documented. We have previously reported that all of the tumor lines of the model express similar levels of MT1-MMP but none express detectable MMP-2. The bone metastatic 4T1.2 cells express significantly higher levels of MMP-9 than 66cl4 or 67NR cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. We confirmed here by gelatin zymography that exogenous expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin in 66cl4 cells did not induce MMP-2 or alter the profile of MMP-9 expression when the cells were plated on plastic or on vitronectin (data not shown), suggesting that increased haptotactic migration of 66cl4beta3 cells towards vitronectin occurred independent of changes in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels.</p><p>To determine whether protease activity is required for vitronectin-mediated haptotactic migration of 4T1.2 and 66cl4beta3 cells, we tested the effect of the broad-spectrum hydroxamate MMP inhibitor Prinomastat (AG3340) in the haptotaxis assay. For these experiments, the cells were pretreated with low doses of AG3340 (10 &#x003bc;M) for 48 hours prior to seeding into uncoated or vitronectin-coated wells. At this concentration, no toxicity was observed in vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide)-treated cells or AG3340-treated cells. As seen earlier, neither 4T1.2 nor 66cl4beta3 migrated in the absence of coated substrate but their migration was strongly induced by the presence of vitronectin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Importantly, pretreatment with AG3340 inhibited 4T1.2 and 66cl4beta3 cell migration by 23% and 40% respectively, compared with control dimethyl sulfoxide alone. &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin-mediated migration of bone metastatic mammary carcinoma cells towards vitronectin is therefore dependent, in part, on extracellular protease activity.</p><p>To determine whether secreted factors produced in the bone microenvironment may also contribute to homing of 66cl4beta3 cells to bone, we compared the effect of bone stromal cells isolated from tibias and femurs of Balb/c mice on the chemotactic migration of 66cl4pBabe and 66cl4beta3 cells in the absence of serum. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>, neither line migrated in the absence of bone cells in the bottom chamber. In contrast, while chemotactic migration of 66cl4pBabe was negligible when stromal cells were added to the lower chamber, 66cl4beta3 efficiently migrated under these conditions. Importantly, chemotactic migration of 66cl4beta3 cells was almost completely abrogated by treatment with &#x003b2;3-neutralizing antibodies but not by control antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). The invasive capacity of 66cl4pBabe and 66cl4beta3 cells was assessed by their ability to move through a Matrigel barrier in response to a chemotactic gradient provided by FCS in the lower chamber. The &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin-expressing 66cl4beta3 cells showed enhanced invasion through Matrigel compared with 66cl4pBabe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin promotes mammary carcinoma cell adhesion to and haptotactic migration towards bone matrix proteins, enhances their responsiveness to bone-derived soluble factor and increases their invasive properties. Migration towards vitronectin appears to be partially dependent on MMP activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Numerous <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies have documented the correlation between tumor expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin and the bone metastatic potential of breast tumors and other human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Our observation that only aggressive and bone metastatic mammary carcinoma cell lines of our murine model express this receptor is consistent with these studies. The precise role of tumor-specific &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin and its relative contribution to primary tumor growth and bone metastasis remains unclear. This is due in part to the lack of clinically relevant syngeneic models of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis that recapitulate the entire metastatic cascade from the mammary gland to bone. We report in the present article that exogenous expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin in mammary carcinoma cells that do not normally metastasize to bone is sufficient to promote their spontaneous metastasis to this organ. To our knowledge, these data provide the first direct <italic>in vivo </italic>evidence that tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin contributes to the spontaneous metastasis of breast tumors from the mammary gland to bone.</p><p>Increased bone metastasis occurred without apparent effect on 66cl4beta3 primary tumor growth <italic>in vivo </italic>or proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>. These observations contrast with some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], studies in xenograft models showing inhibition of mammary tumor growth by &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 antagonists. Reduced angiogenesis observed in these tumors suggests that &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 inhibitors impair tumor growth primarily by targeting the tumor neovasculature rather than the tumor cells. Unlike these studies, our approach addressed specifically the role of tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3. Comparable growth of 66cl4pBabe and 66cl4beta3 tumors indicates that tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 is unlikely to promote spontaneous bone metastasis through stimulation of tumor cell proliferation at the primary site. Instead, results from <italic>in vitro </italic>assays suggest that tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 may have multiple roles downstream of primary tumor growth that contribute to enhanced metastasis to bone. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the selective &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 antagonist S247 inhibits the metastasis of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3-expressing MDA-MB-435 to bone in the experimental metastasis model that bypasses the formation of a primary tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>While our results show increased spontaneous metastasis predominantly to bone and are consistent with data from experimental models, they do not preclude that tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 may enhance metastasis to several organs in part through its effect on earlier stages of metastasis, such as escape from the primary tumor and intravasation. For instance, we found that 66cl4beta3 cell migration towards collagen IV and invasion through Matrigel were substantially increased compared with that of 66cl4pBabe cells (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). Both these responses are likely to be important in early dissemination of metastatic cells from the mammary gland and may explain also the trend towards increased spontaneous metastasis to lung observed in our model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). This would be consistent also with the inhibitory effect of S247 reported on the spontaneous metastasis of MDA-MB-435 cells to the lung despite its lack of effect on primary tumor growth in the mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms leading to increased collagen-IV-mediated migration of 66cl4beta3 cells are unclear but could involve MT1-MMP-dependent regulation of cross-talk between &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin and the &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 collagen receptor, as reported previously in human breast carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In particular, these authors noted that MCF-7 cells expressing both MT1-MMP and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin were more migratory towards collagen I than MCF-7 cells expressing only MT1-MMP. By analogy, 66cl4beta3 cells express both &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and MT1-MMP whereas 66cl4pBabe express only MT1-MMP ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and this study).</p><p>In agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], we found that expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin in 66cl4beta3 cells dramatically enhanced their &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3-dependent adhesion and haptotactic migration towards bone matrix proteins. It is probable that these interactions are critical for homing of breast tumor cells to bone. Migration towards vitronectin was partially inhibited by the MMP inhibitor AG3340, suggesting cooperation between &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and MMPs to promote haptotactic migration. Functional cooperation between &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin and several MMPs, including MMP-2, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP, has been demonstrated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. 66cl4 cells express similar levels of MT1-MMP but significantly less MMP-9 than the bone metastatic 4T1.2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Neither line expresses detectable levels of MMP-2. Since we did not detect any significant changes in the levels of MMP-2 or MMP-9 activity between 66cl4beta3 and 66cl4pBabe cells by gelatin zymography, cooperation between &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and MMP-2/9 is unlikely to account for the enhanced haptotactic response observed in 66cl4beta3 cells.</p><p>Interestingly, Deryugina and colleagues reported that expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in MCF-7 cells is insufficient alone to promote their migration towards vitronectin and requires the proteolytic processing of the &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 receptor by MT1-MMP to migrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Short-term treatment of MCF-7 cells coexpressing MT1-MMP and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 with AG3340 blocked direct proteolysis of vitronectin by MT1-MMP and enhanced migration. In contrast, due to the slow turnover of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3, long-term treatment was required to replace existing pools of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 proteolytically activated by MT1-MMP at the cell surface and to inhibit migration. Similarly, long-term treatment (48 hours) with AG3340 was required to block 4T1.2 and 66cl4beta3 cell migration (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Although we cannot completely rule out a potential interaction between &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and MMP-9 in 66cl4beta3 cells, these observations suggest that functional activation of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 by MT1-MMP may be more relevant to the haptotactic response of 66cl4beta3 cells to vitronectin.</p><p>While our results clearly implicate tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in breast cancer metastasis to bone, it should be noted that the metastatic burden observed with 66cl4beta3 was not as high as that typically seen using the more aggressive 4T1.2 and 4T1.3 lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. There therefore does not appear to be a direct correlation between the level of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 expression and the extent of metastasis to bone. Presumably, the level of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin found in 4T1.2/4T1.13 cells is sufficient to promote metastasis to bone, and expression above this level (as seen in 66cl4beta3) does not offer additional benefits. Moreover, unlike 4T1.2/4T1.13 lines, we failed to detect any spontaneous 66cl4beta3 metastases in the lymph nodes, kidney or liver. A probable explanation for these differences is that other factors not present in 66cl4beta3 cells cooperate with &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin and contribute to the high metastatic phenotype of 4T1.2/4T1.13 lines. Although we found no evidence implicating MMP-9 in the 66cl4beta3 migratory response to vitronectin, it is tempting to speculate that enhancing the level of MMP-9 expression (as seen in 4T1.2 and 4T1.13 cells) together with expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 in 66cl4beta3 cells may be sufficient to achieve the high metastatic burden observed with 4T1.2 and 4T1.13 tumors. Alternatively, coexpression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and its ECM ligand may be required to further enhance the 66cl4beta3 metastatic potential as demonstrated in 21NT human xenografts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Consistent with this, cDNA microarray analysis of primary tumors of our model revealed that several ECM-related genes are more highly expressed in bone metastatic lines (4T1.2, 4T1.13) compared with weakly metastatic (66cl4) and nonmetastatic (67NR) lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The cooperative role of some of these ECMs and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin is under investigation.</p><p>Tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 has been proposed to enhance metastasis by facilitating tumor cell arrest in the vasculature through interaction with platelets and adhesion to the subendothelial matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. 66cl4pBabe and 66cl4beta3 cells adhered equally well to endothelial cells, indicating that receptors other than &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin mediate their attachment to the endothelium under our assay conditions. It should be noted, however, that the assays were conducted in the absence of serum and thus a role for &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3-mediated tumor&#x02013;platelet interaction under blood flow conditions cannot be ruled out. Further work will be required to address this possibility.</p><p>Exogenous expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin dramatically enhanced the chemotactic migration of 66cl4beta3 cells towards soluble factors secreted by bone stromal cells. Almost complete inhibition of chemotaxis by &#x003b2;3-blocking antibodies indicates that the antibody either prevents binding of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 receptor to a soluble ECM ligand and/or interferes with the association of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and a chemotactic receptor. Several factors produced in the bone stromal microenvironment have been shown to promote chemotactic migration, including insulin-like growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and stromal cell derived factor 1 (sdf-1/CXCL12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. While we have yet to determine the specific bone stromal factor stimulating the 66cl4beta3 cell chemotactic response, PDGF may be of particular interest as &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin has been shown to associate with the PDGF receptor &#x003b2; and to enhance chemotactic migration in response to PDGF stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Moreover, PDGF is a potent mitogen for breast tumor cells and blocking PDGF receptor signaling in these cells inhibits their growth in bone and associated osteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>The observations that 66cl4pBabe tumors were able to grow when injected directly into the tibia clearly demonstrate that tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 is not required for proliferation of breast tumor cells in bone. Moreover, the fact that they proliferated to the same extent as 66cl4beta3 tumors despite evidence of osteoclast recruitment or large lytic lesions indicates that extensive bone degradation is not required for metastatic growth to occur in bone. The increased recruitment of osteoclasts in the proximity of 66cl4beta3 tumor nodules and evidence of osteolysis at the tumor&#x02013;bone interface, however, are consistent with the vicious cycle theory, and suggesting that tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 may play an indirect role in promoting the growth of breast cancer cells that spontaneously metastasize to bone through enhanced osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and release of mitogenic factors from the bone matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Engagement of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin with bone ECM proteins may induce production of an osteoclast-stimulating factor, such as RANKL or colony stimulating factor 1, by tumor cells or by bone marrow cells. Alternatively, tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 may promote osteoclastogenesis through interaction with activated platelets in the bone microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. While Boucharaba and colleagues did not specifically investigate the role of tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3, they showed that interaction of human MDA-MB-231/B02 breast tumor cells with platelets promotes osteoclast-mediated bone resorption through the release of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in response to platelet-derived lysophosphatidic acid. Further work will be required to elucidate the mechanism by which tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 enhances osteoclastogenesis. Assays that measure the production of such factors in cocultures of breast cancer cells and bone marrow stromal cells may help to elucidate the mechanism by which tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin promotes the formation of osteolytic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown for the first time that tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin contributes to the spontaneous metastasis of breast tumors to bone. Results from our investigation highlight the critical role of this integrin in homing of breast tumor cells to bone through enhanced chemotactic migration and haptotactic migration as well as in recruiting activated osteoclasts at metastatic lesions. The addition of an inhibitor specifically targeting tumor &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 to existing treatments may provide greater therapeutic benefits for the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BSA = bovine serum albumin; DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ECM = extracellular matrix; FCS = fetal calf serum; H&#x00026;E = haematoxylin &#x00026; eosin; &#x003b1;-MEM = alpha minimal essential medium; MMP = matrix metalloproteinase; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PDGF = platelet-derived growth factor; RTB = relative tumor burden; RTQPCR = real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The authors' contributions to this research work are reflected in the order shown, with the exception of EKS and NP who contributed equally to the majority of the <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>experimental work and preparation of the manuscript.
