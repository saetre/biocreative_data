This binding positively affects some early stage of the viral life-cycle because prevention of binding either by drugs that occupy that active site of cyclophilin A, by mutation in HIV-1 CA, or RNAi that knocks down intracellular CypA level diminishes viral infectivity. The closely related lentivirus, SIVcpz also binds CypA, but it was thought that this interaction was limited to the HIV-1/SIVcpz lineage because other retroviruses failed to interact with CypA in a yeast two-hybrid assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We find that diverse lentiviruses, FIV and SIVagmTAN also bind to CypA.

CypA interacts with HIV-1 by virtue of a direct binding between residues in a loop between the fourth and fifth alpha-helices of the capsid (CA) protein of HIV-1 and the active site of CypA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug, binds to the same region of binding groove of CypA and disrupts the CypA/CA interaction which leads to an attenuation of wild type HIV-1 infectivity by 2&#x02013;5 fold in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although CypA can bind to viral CA in the producer cell during viral assembly, it is CypA in the newly infected target cells that is important for infectivity rather than the CypA that is present in the producer cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]</p><p>Tripartite motif 5 isoform alpha (Trim5&#x003b1;) proteins also bind to retroviral CA early after viral entry, and can have a negative effect on the viral lifecycle by accelerating the viral core uncoating or CA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Trim5&#x003b1; contains a C-terminal B30.2 domain that recognizes retroviral CA and restricts viral replication in a species-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The resistance of cells from the owl monkey (<italic>Aotus trivirgatus</italic>) to HIV-1 infection is due to the presence of a natural fusion protein in this species, called TrimCyp, in which the B30.2 recognition domain of Trim5&#x003b1; was replaced by the <italic>CypA </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. CypA is important for the activities of some Trim5&#x003b1; alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The CypA/CA interaction was initially identified by two-hybrid analysis in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In those studies, it was reported that only HIV-1 and the closely related SIVcpz encoded Gag proteins (which are cleaved by viral protease to generate CA during maturation) that could interact with CypA, while the Gag proteins from HIV-2, SIVmac, SIVs from African green monkeys-Sabaeus (SIVagmSAB), feline immunodeficiency viruses (FIV), and Mason-Pfizer monkey viruses (MPMV) failed to interact with CypA in this assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, incorporation of CypA into virions was detected in HIV-1 and SIVcpz, but not in HIV-2, SIVmac, SIVagm-Grivet (SIVagmGRI), and murine leukemia viruses (MLV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, here we show that the CypA/CA interaction is not unique to HIV-1/SIVcpz. By both genetic and biochemical experiments we show that FIV can bind CypA and its replication is affected by this interaction to the same extent as HIV-1. Moreover, we have identified an amino acid that is essential for FIV CA interaction with CypA that is in a nearly identical context to an amino acid necessary for the interaction of HIV-1 CA with CypA. Finally, we show that SIVagm-Tantalus (SIVagmTAN) is restricted by TrimCyp, strongly suggesting that this viral CA also interacts with CypA. While these studies were in progress, two other groups also provided evidence that FIV and SIVagm are both susceptible to the TrimCyp restriction in a CsA sensitive manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Together, these results demonstrate that lentiviral interactions with CypA are more conserved than had been previously assumed and suggest that CypA/CA interactions play an evolutionarily conserved role in the life cycle of many lentiviruses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>FIV CA interacts with CypA</title><p>We began this study by looking at the pattern of restriction effect of Trim5&#x003b1; isolated from diverse primate species with a panel of different retroviruses. Remarkably, we found that HIV-1 and FIV had an identical pattern of restriction in that both were strongly restricted by rhesus Trim5&#x003b1;, had slight sensitivity to human and Tamarin Trim5&#x003b1;, and were resistant to Titi Trim5&#x003b1; (data not shown). Similar data was also reported by another group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Because Trim5&#x003b1; restriction, like the CypA interaction, is dictated by CA, this led us to examine if FIV is also similar to HIV-1 in its interaction with CypA.</p><p>The TrimCyp protein from owl monkeys strongly restricts HIV-1 because the C-terminal CypA portion of the protein binds to HIV-1 CA, while the N-terminal portion of the protein leads to premature uncoating or degradation of incoming virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We therefore asked whether FIV is also sensitive to TrimCyp restriction as an indirect measure of CA-CypA recognition. Cells expressing TrimCyp were generated and infected with VSV-G pseudotyped wild-type HIV-1, a HIV-1 G89V mutant (CA with a G89V mutation does not bind CypA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]), and FIV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Infections were done in the presence or absence of CsA to verify the dependence of the restriction on CypA function. Because infections were done with viruses that encode GFP (see Methods), the number of infected cells could be directly analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], HIV-1 is sensitive to TrimCyp restriction and the restriction can be neutralized by treatment of cells with CsA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), while the negative control, the HIV-1 G89V mutant, is not restricted by TrimCyp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We found that FIV behaves similar to HIV-1 in that it was restricted by TrimCyp, and this restriction is reversed by CsA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Infectivity of HIV-1 WT, G89V mutant and FIV under the TrimCyp restriction</bold>. CRFK and CRFK-TrimCyp cells were infected with HIV-1 wild-type (A), HIV-1 G89V (B), and FIV (C) in the presence or absence of CsA. The infected cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and the infectivity is presented as percentage of cells that were GFP+ (on a log scale).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-3-70-1"/></fig><p>These results with TrimCyp suggested that FIV does indeed interact with CypA. In order to test this directly, we used an assay to biochemically detect binding of CypA to FIV CA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Thus, 293T cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid that expressed a fusion protein between GST and human CypA (GST-CypA) or with GST alone. Cell lysates were then incubated with glutathione beads to partially purify the GST proteins from the cell extracts. After washing to remove unbound proteins, the beads were incubated with FIV virions, and the GST-bound proteins were run on SDS-PAGE gels and blotted with anti-CA antibodies. HIV-1 WT and G89V were used as the positive and negative controls for this assay, respectively. HIV-1 wild type associates with CypA because it is pulled down by the GST-CypA fusion protein, whereas the HIV-1 G89V mutant does not bind to GST-CypA (data not shown). On the other hand, FIV behaves similar to HIV in that partially purified GST-CypA, but not GST alone, is able to bind FIV <italic>in vitro </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This binding is dose-dependent (adding more FIV virions increases the amount of CA that is pulled-down, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, top), and is sensitive to CsA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, bottom). Thus, by both genetic (TrimCyp restriction) and biochemical (GST-CypA pull-downs) assays, we demonstrate that FIV, like HIV-1, interacts with CypA.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Biochemical interaction of CypA and FIV CA</bold>. (A) GST-CypA or control GST fusion proteins were generated in 293T cells. After the incubation of the 293T cell lysates with glutathione beads, the beads were washed to remove unbound proteins, and then incubated with FIV virions. After removing unbound FIV virions by washing, beads were subjected to the SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-FIV CA antibodies for the detection of the interaction between CypA and FIV CA. (B) was conducted with the same experimental protocol for (A), but with different amounts of input FIV virions (serial dilution) in the presence or absence of 10 &#x003bc;M of CsA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-3-70-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Proline 90 on FIV capsid is an essential amino acid for Cyclophilin A binding</title><p>The glycine at position 89 and the proline at position 90 on HIV-1 capsid are the most critical target amino acids of CypA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Since we observed that FIV also interacts with CypA, we next tried to identify if amino acids in a similar region of CA of FIV are also critical for the CypA recognition. By aligning the capsid amino acid sequence of FIV with that of HIV-1, we noticed that FIV capsid contains five prolines on the loop between the predicted alpha-helices 4 and 5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Each of these five proline residues was individually mutated to alanine. In addition, arginine at position 89 was also mutated to alanine because this position corresponds to the critical glycine at position 89 in the HIV CA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>CypA/CA interaction in FIV WT and mutants</bold>.

FIV virions are detected by anti-FIV CA antibody.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-3-70-3"/></fig><p>These constructs were then co-transfected to 293T cells with VSV-G and GFP reporter plasmids to generate VSV-G pseudotyped FIVs that were used to infect CRFK or CRFK-TrimCyp cells. The infectivity of each virus was normalized to give an amount of virus that resulted in about the same number of infected CRFK cells. Similar to wild-type FIV, the mutations P84A, P85A, P88A, P92A, and R89A are also restricted by TrimCyp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Moreover, in each case, the restriction by TrimCyp is abrogated by the addition of CsA. These data indicate that mutating each of these residues did not destroy a functional interaction between CypA and the viral CA. However, the P90A mutant is not sensitive to the TrimCyp restriction and the infectivity is not affected by the addition of CsA. This indicates that amino acid P90 is critical for a functional interaction between FIV CA and CypA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the TrimCyp assay, we also applied the GST-CypA pull down assay to test the interaction of CypA and FIV mutants. The FIV wild type and mutant virions were incubated with the GST-CypA and the interactions were analyzed by Western Blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Wild-type FIV and other mutants are sensitive to the TrimCyp restriction and are pulled down by the GST-CypA. On the other hand, the P90A mutant, which is not sensitive to the TrimCyp restriction, is also not pulled down by GST-CypA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These data demonstrate that amino acid P90 is a critical target for CypA binding to FIV CA.</p></sec><sec><title>CypA affects FIV infection</title><p>Previous reports showed that CsA decreases spreading infections of FIV in cells and in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, comparisons with HIV-1 were not done. It has been shown that the infectivity of HIV-1 drops 2&#x02013;5 fold when the CypA/CA interaction is blocked by CsA in Jurkat T cells in single-cycle infection experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To examine the role of CypA in FIV infection in the same cell type, Jurkat T cells were infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped FIV in the presence or absence of CsA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As expected, the infectivity of wild type HIV-1 was reduced by the addition of CsA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, top). We obtained reduced infections of FIV in Jurkat cells relative to CRFK cells presumably due to human Trim5&#x003b1; restriction of FIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, similar to HIV-1, the infectivity of FIV decreased further by 2&#x02013;5 fold when CsA was present during infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, middle). The P90A mutant of FIV which fails to bind cyclophilin A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), in contrast, was not sensitive to CsA treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, bottom). These results indicate that FIV, like HIV-1, requires the endogenous cyclophilin A in target cells for optimal infection.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The CypA-dependency of FIV</bold>. Jurkat T cells were infected with HIV-1 wild-type (A), FIV wild-type (B), and FIV P90A (C) in the presence or absence of 1.25 &#x003bc;M of CsA. All viruses were first normalized on CRFK cells and equivalent CRFK infectious units were used and are plotted on the X-axis. For example, the amount of virus that gave 20% GFP positive cells on CRFK cells is 0.2 on the X-axis.

We therefore tested whether SIVagmTAN also interacts with CypA using the TrimCyp assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Consistent with other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], SIVmac, as a negative control, is not sensitive to the TrimCyp. On the other hand, SIVagmTAN behaves like HIV-1 and FIV. The infectivity of SIVagmTAN is strongly restricted by TrimCyp protein, and the restriction can be counteracted by the treatment of CsA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This result suggests that the CA of SIVagmTAN is also recognized by the CypA, and that the ability of CypA to recognize lentiviral capsids is widespread, although not universal, among lentiviruses.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>CypA/CA interaction in SIVmac, HIV-1, and SIVagmTAN</bold>.

Here, we show that this phenotype is more widespread among lentiviruses because both FIV and SIVagmTAN also interact with CypA. Moreover, we identified an amino acid in FIV CA that is critical for CypA binding that is in a similar position in CA of HIV-1. Finally, we show that the CypA/CA interaction is functionally significant for FIV replication.</p><p>It is not clear why a functional assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and a direct binding assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) detected the CypA/CA interaction in FIV, whereas previous reports that looked for interactions with a yeast-two hybrid assay or by expression of recombinant Gag and CypA in <italic>E. Coli </italic>did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is possible that the formation of mature viral core may be more important for CypA recognition of FIV, or that subtle folding problems with FIV Gag was expressed in yeast and <italic>E. Coli </italic>might have prevented binding. Nonetheless, the two assays used here (TrimCyp restriction and GST-CypA pull down) were conducted in mammalian cells and thus more closely mimic the structure of CA found in natural targets cells.</p><p>The finding that FIV and SIVagmTAN also bind host CypA demonstrates that the CypA/CA interaction is a more wide spread phenotype among lentiviruses than just the HIV-1/SIVcpz lineage. At this point it is not possible to determine if this property arose independently in three separate lentivirus lineages, or if an ancestral retrovirus was able to bind CypA and then other lentiviruses (for example, SIVmac) each lost this ability. Although the latter possibility is more parsimonious, it will be important to test a much broader range of lentiviruses for CypA binding. It is also possible that the ability of a lentivirus to bind CypA is evolutionarily dynamic and changes upon adaptation to new hosts.</p><p>We determined that the proline at amino acid 90 on FIV CA is critical for the interaction with CypA. This is similar to the site on HIV-1 that binds CypA, suggesting the proline in the middle of the loop is crucial for CypA recognition. However, the CA sequence alignment of SIVmac with HIV-1 shows that SIVmac also possesses this corresponding proline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The major difference of the loop between the fourth and fifth alpha-helices in HIV-1 and SIVmac is its length. We applied the SWISS-MODEL computer modelling to generate putative structure of CA from SIVmac and SIVagmTAN based on the crystal structure of HIV-1 CA bound to CypA (PDB:1AK4). We found that the CypA-binding loop of SIVagmTAN can be superimposed on the parallel loop of HIV-1 well, while the loop of SIVmac is shorter than that of HIV-1 and is not able to fit in the HIV-1 scale (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This suggests that in addition to the proline at position 90 (based on HIV-1), the length of the loop also contributes to the CypA binding. A shorter loop might not be able to insert into the binding groove of CypA even though the target proline is present in the middle of the loop. On the other hand, Cyclophilin B (CypB), another member in the cyclophilin family, was showed to interact with Gag proteins from HIV-1 and SIVmac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, the CypB/Gag interaction in both HIV-1 and SIVmac is not mediated by binding of CypB to the same loop that CypA recognizes. To our knowledge, the CypB/Gag interaction has not been reported to affect viral replication.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Computer modelling of the CA structure from SIVmac and SIVagmTAN</bold>.

The potent restriction against HIV-1 infection requires the recognition of HIV-1 CA by the C-terminal CypA domain of TrimCyp. In addition, the CypA/CA interaction in HIV-1 was shown to correlate with viral sensitivity to rhesus and African green monkey Trim5&#x003b1; restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Blocking CypA/CA interaction by CsA or down-regulating endogenous CypA by RNAi rescues HIV-1 replication from rhesus and African green monkey Trim5&#x003b1; restriction, suggesting the rhesus and African green monkey Trim5&#x003b1; restrict HIV-1 via the CypA-binding pathway. Human Trim5&#x003b1;, on the other hand, weakly restricts HIV-1 via a pathway that is independent of CypA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is not clear whether the Trim5&#x003b1; restriction is mediated by direct binding to CypA or requires an unidentified adaptor protein. Another explanation is that CypA/CA interaction changes the CA conformation which provides access for rhesus and African green monkey but not human Trim5&#x003b1;. We report here that SIVagmTAN interacts with CypA, but it has a different recognition pattern by different Trim5&#x003b1; proteins when compared to HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. SIVagmTAN is resistant to the African green monkey Trim5&#x003b1; but susceptible to rhesus Trim5&#x003b1; restriction, whereas HIV-1 is restricted by rhesus and African green monkey Trim5&#x003b1; via the CypA-binding pathway. The SIVagmTAN susceptibility to rhesus Trim5&#x003b1; is probably determined by the patch on the B30.2 domain and the CypA/CA has little to do with the restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>CypA binding is necessary for Trim5&#x003b1; restriction of HIV-1 in rhesus cells, but not for that in human cells. It has been hypothesized that CypA binding protects HIV from an unknown restriction factor in humans. If so, then this hypothesis would have to be extended to account for the fact that diverse lentiviruses also bind CypA. Our report here will provide a parallel line to investigate the role that CypA plays in lentiviral life cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>293T and CRFK (Crandall Feline Kidney) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
