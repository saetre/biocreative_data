The functional failure of the TM/SC outflow pathway is believed to cause the elevation of IOP commonly associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that the TM/SC tissue may respond to transient changes in IOP by altering its AH outflow resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], thus maintaining normal IOP levels. However, the molecular and physiologic mechanisms regulating such potential outflow pathway tissue homeostasis are far from being understood.</p><p>Our laboratory has long hypothesized that mechanical stress accompanying the elevated IOP-associated changes in outflow pathway morphology induces the release from TM cells of factors that might act in a homeostatic, regulatory manner to increase outflow facility and lower IOP by either altering the conductivity of SC or changing the geometry of the TM pathway for aqueous flow. Supporting this hypothesis, we have demonstrated that exposure of TM cells to cyclic mechanical stress induces the expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cell primary cultures as well as organ cultures of porcine anterior segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. We additionally found that IL-6 increases outflow facility when administered to porcine perfused anterior segments. Furthermore, our studies revealed that TGF-&#x003b2;1 itself upregulated the expression of <italic>IL-6</italic> in HTM cells, suggesting that the initial activation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 may be one of the contributing factors leading to the induction of <italic>IL-6</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms participating in these inductions are unknown.</p><p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that respond to extracellular stimuli and regulate various cellular activities such as gene expression, mitosis, differentiation, and cell survival/apoptosis. Three MAPKs have been identified in mammalian cells, the extracellular-regulating kinase (ERK), the c-jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38 MAPK. MAPK signaling pathways have been implicated in the expression of cytokines in response to other stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>].</p><p>Herein, we aimed at further exploring the relationship between TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-6 in HTM cells as well as at identifying the signaling pathway/s involved in the increased <italic>IL-6</italic> expression in response to mechanical stress and TGF-&#x003b2;1. The data presented in this study suggest the existence of an autocrine loop between TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-6 in cultured HTM cells and that p38 MAPK might play a pivotal role in the maintenance of such a loop.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Recombinant human TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-6 proteins were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

For this purpose, we chemically blocked the TGF-&#x003b2;1 pathway using an inhibitor of the TGF type I activin receptor (SB431542, 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, chemical inhibition of the TGF-&#x003b2;1 pathway clearly led to a significant decrease in the levels of both secreted IL-6 protein (1,012.18&#x000b1;67.79 pg/ml secreted IL-6 in stretched vehicle-treated cultures versus 256.27&#x000b1;57.6 pg/ml in stretched SB431542-treated cultures, p=0.0001) and mRNA content (1.61&#x000b1;0.22 <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA fold expression in&#x000a0; stretched vehicle-treated cultures versus 0.89&#x000b1;0.17 fold in stretched SB431542-treated cultures, p=0.01) induced by cyclic mechanical stress.

We wondered whether IL-6 might upregulate <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;1</italic> expression in HTM cells and thus initiate an autocrine loop similar to the one described in activated pancreatic stellate cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. For this purpose, we treated three different HTM primary cultures previously infected with the recombinant adenovirus, AdTGF&#x003b2;1-SEAP, with IL-6 (100 ng/ml). Such IL-6 concentration, which significantly increased the permeability of SC endothelial cells as well as outflow facility in perfused porcine anterior segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], has been used for similar studies in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, exogenous IL-6 quickly induced the transcriptional activation of <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;1</italic> promoter at 3 h (112.79&#x000b1;33.4 relative fluorescence units [RFU] in IL-6-treated cultures versus 52.34&#x000b1;12.79 RFU in control cultures, p=0.042) and 6 h post treatment (393.44&#x000b1;132.45 RFU&#x000a0; in IL-6-treated cultures versus 7.96&#x000b1;26.07 RFU in control cultures, p=0.034) compared to control levels. To identify the intracellular pathways participating in such activation, we repeated the experiment in the presence of MAPK inhibitors.

In addition, our data suggest that p38 MAPK might play a contributing role in the maintenance of such a loop. These findings support a potential role of mechanical stress in regulating AH outflow through a synergistic collaboration between MAPK and stretch-induced cytokines.</p><p>The upregulation of <italic>IL-6</italic> by TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been described in other cell types including human fibroblasts, osteoblasts, prostate cancer cells, and retinal pigmented epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Our time-course experiments showed a progressive accumulation of IL-6 in the culture media of HTM cells exposed to TGF-&#x003b2;1. Levels of <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA were also found to be increased at early times (up to 6 h), returning to control levels after 16 h, thus indicating a transient effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on <italic>IL-6</italic> production. Strikingly, quantification of <italic>IL-6</italic> promoter activity using a recombinant adenovirus expressing the reporter gene, <italic>SEAP</italic>, under the <italic>IL-6</italic> promoter region showed no difference in <italic>SEAP</italic> activity between TGF-&#x003b2;1 treated and untreated HTM cultures at any time tested. However, a gradual increase in <italic>SEAP</italic> activity was detected over time in the untreated, control cultures, thus confirming the efficiency of the selected <italic>IL-6</italic> promoter region to mediate the expression of the reporter gene. Upregulation of <italic>IL-6</italic> is controlled by the activity of several transcription factors with known consensus sequences in the <italic>IL-6</italic> promoter region including IRF-1, AP-1, CRE, c/EBP, and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. One might speculate that the promoter region included in our construct does not contain the binding sequence required for a particular transcription factor activated by TGF-&#x003b2;1. Although we cannot rule out the need of additional responsive elements in HTM cells, transactivation of the <italic>IL-6</italic> promoter by TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been reported to be mediated via an AP-1 responsive element (&#x02212;283/&#x02212;277) in human lung fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Such AP-1 binding site is contained within the promoter region used in our experiments. Furthermore, increased <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA levels in response to TGF-&#x003b2;1 were also observed in the presence of the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D. Thus, our results suggest that the high levels of expression of <italic>IL-6</italic> in response to TGF-&#x003b2;1 in HTM cells were not primarily mediated by a transcriptional activation of <italic>IL-6</italic>.</p><p>A potential mechanism by which TGF-&#x003b2;1 can mediate the observed increase in IL-6 is through mRNA stabilization. Many short-lived mRNAs encoding proto-oncogenes, nuclear transcription factors, and cytokines contain adenylate/uridylate (AU)-rich elements (AREs), which are usually found in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region and regulate mRNA stability. Stabilization of mRNA is a characteristic of short-lived cytokines and contributes to the strong and rapid induction of genes in the inflammatory response, which otherwise are targeted to degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. Indeed, <italic>IL-6 </italic>mRNA has been reported to rapidly be degraded in non-stimulated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Similarly, our own results show a progressive decline in <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA levels in untreated HTM cells. Induction of <italic>IL-6</italic> associated with mRNA stabilization has been described in several cellular systems in response to different compounds including TGF-&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Additional, more specific experiments aimed at monitoring the half-life of <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA will be required to confirm the stabilization of mRNA in HTM cells in response to TGF-&#x003b2;1 treatment.</p><p>MAPKs are known to be key regulators of the expression of many cytokines and in responding to extracellular stimuli. MAPKs are also known to play a crucial role in the response to cyclic stretching in cells from tissues that are subjected to this type of stress in physiologic conditions including the vascular endothelium, pulmonary epithelium, kidney podocytes, and cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Moreover, our previous studies, which used a static model of mechanical stress, have shown fluctuations in the levels of expression and phosphorylation of at least some MAPKs in HTM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Therefore, we chose to investigate the potential participation of MAPKs in the stretch-induced expression of <italic>IL-6</italic>. We found that p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 pathways contribute to <italic>IL-6</italic> upregulation in stretched HTM cells and that their inhibition significantly attenuates <italic>IL-6</italic> protein and mRNA levels, indicating a synergistic collaboration of multiple signaling in the induction of <italic>IL-6</italic> by cyclic mechanical stress in HTM cells.</p><p>One of the most interesting observations in our study was that specific blockage of the TGF-&#x003b2;1 pathway using a TGF type I activin receptor inhibitor significantly affected the basal production of IL-6 and completely abrogated the increased expression of IL-6 with mechanical stress. These results clearly demonstrate a key role for TGF-&#x003b2;1 in basal IL-6 expression as well as the upregulated expression of IL-6 by cyclic mechanical stress in HTM cells. Since p38 MAPK was found to regulate both the TGF-&#x003b2;1 and the stretch-induced expression of IL-6, it is likely that the observed effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on the increased expression of IL-6 by mechanical stress is also partly mediated through p38 MAPK. Although TGF-&#x003b2;1 is known to regulate the expression of <italic>IL-6</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>] and <italic>IL-6</italic> expression has been shown to be modulated by mechanical stress in different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>], this is the first time to our knowledge that a connection between both events is established.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been reported to positively regulate its own transcription in TM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. Here, we observed that treatment of HTM cells with exogenous IL-6 induced the transcriptional activation of <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;1</italic> promoter and that such induction was impaired by blocking the p38 MAPK pathway. A similar autocrine loop between TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-6 was recently described in pancreatic stellate cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Altogether, these findings open up the possibility that activation of <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;1</italic> by mechanical forces might act as an upstream signal leading to increased <italic>IL-6</italic> expression, which in turn might upregulate the production of TGF-&#x003b2;1. We further propose that p38 MAPK might be one of the factors regulating such an autocrine loop between TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-6, although we do not discard the possibility of the synergistic collaboration of multiple MAPK pathways (in fact, our data suggest this possibility). Additional studies will be required to confirm the existence of a TGF-&#x003b2;1/IL-6 loop in HTM cells in response to mechanical stress.</p><p>In the short term, TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-6 potentially can have a beneficial effect in regulating the flow of AH. Indeed, we previously showed that exogenous administration of IL-6 produces an increase in outflow facility in porcine perfused anterior segments as well as an increase in permeability in cultured SC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. The existence of such a regulatory loop could offer important biological advantages by increasing redundancy in the mechanisms that modulate the expression of cytokines in TM cells and, perhaps more importantly, by providing a mechanism for amplification of relatively small stress signals. However, the permanent activation of these two pro-inflammatory cytokines can ultimately lead to undesirable secondary effects. Dysregulation of <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;1</italic> has been linked to an array of inflammatory and pathologic conditions including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. Therefore, we anticipate the existence of a negative regulatory mechanism aimed at preventing a chronic activation of the stress response that might originate from the constitutive activation of such a loop under normal tissue physiology.</p><p>It is important to mention that a constitutive activation of the stress response controlled by an autocrine IL-1 feedback loop has been described in the cells within the glaucomatous outflow pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>]. In addition, a more recent study showed an altered responsiveness of ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK pathways in glaucomatous TM cells, which the authors postulated might be due to the fact that the pathways are already maximally activated by the disease process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. In this scenario, TM cells could be unable to modulate their gene expression patterns and lose the flexibility to respond to the environment. Similarly, failure of the feedback mechanism controlling the TGF-&#x003b2;1/IL-6 loop could lead to a related disease phenotype.</p><p>In summary, we have described here that that TGF-&#x003b2;1 participates in the regulation of the basal and the stretch-induced expression of IL-6, and we suggest the possible existence of an autocrine loop between IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 in cultured HTM cells. We also found that p38 MAPK might play a contributing role in the maintenance of such a loop. Additional studies aimed at understanding the effects of mechanical stress on the MAPK pathways and their potential role in modulating the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-6 in HTM cells using mechanical stress models would very likely help to dissect the homeostatic molecular mechanisms involved in the outflow pathway &#x0201c;sensing&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;responding&#x0201d; to changes in IOP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the National Eye Institute (NEI EY01894, NEI EY019317, NEI EY016228, NEI EY05722) and from
