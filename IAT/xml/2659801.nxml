Synovial sarcoma is a soft tissue cancer associated with a recurrent t(X:18) translocation event that generates one of two fusion proteins, SYT-SSX1 or SYT-SSX2. The role of the translocation products in this disease is poorly understood. We present evidence that the SYT-SSX2 fusion protein interacts with the polycomb repressive complex and modulates its gene silencing activity. SYT-SSX2 causes destabilization of the polycomb subunit Bmi1, resulting in impairment of polycomb-associated histone H2A ubiquitination and reactivation of polycomb target genes. Silencing by polycomb complexes plays a vital role in numerous physiological processes. In recent years, numerous reports have implicated gain of polycomb silencing function in several cancers. This study provides evidence that, in the appropriate context, expression of the SYT-SSX2 oncogene leads to loss of polycomb function. It challenges the notion that cancer is solely associated with an increase in polycomb function and suggests that any imbalance in polycomb activity could drive the cell toward oncogenesis. These findings provide a mechanism by which the SYT-SSX2 chimera may contribute to synovial sarcoma pathogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The manipulation of chromatin organization is at the heart of a plethora of biological processes. Many proteins which modify the structure of chromatin during normal cellular events are often deregulated in disease processes, including cancer. One group of proteins involved in the stable and dynamic regulation of chromatin heritable over successive cellular divisions is the polycomb group (PcG) family of complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Sparmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. PcG complexes are implicated in the repression of gene transcription through exquisite modulation of chromatin structure. They were originally identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as repressors of <italic>Hox</italic> genes for posterior body segmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Ringrose1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. polycomb complexes are classically divided into Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Sparmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The PRC2 complex is comprised of the subunits EZH2, EED and SUZ12. PRC2 promotes gene silencing by associating with histone deacetylases and DNA-methyltransferase 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-vanderVlag1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Vir1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and through methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (K27) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Czermin1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Mller1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Methyl-H3K27 in turn serves as a binding platform for PRC1, composed mostly of PC2, HPH, Bmi1 and Ring1A/B. PRC1 compacts chromatin and hinders its accessibility to transcriptional activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Pasquale1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the complex between subunits Bmi1 and Ring1B (an E3 ligase) is implicated in the monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 (K119) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Cao1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, a modification frequently detected in the promoters of polycomb target genes. Polycomb silencing plays an important role in cell fate determination, self-renewal in both embryonic and adult stem cells, as well as X-chromosome inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Sparmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. These processes result from polycomb suppression of key developmental pathways, including Wnt and Notch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Boyer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Lee1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recent evidence implicates deregulation of polycomb function in cancer promotion. A number of reports have described an increase in the expression of polycomb complex proteins in various malignancies; overexpression of Bmi1 in medulloblastoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Leung1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, EZH2 in advanced prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Varambally1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and SUZ12 in colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Kirmizis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. These increases in protein level are thought to result in the aberrant silencing of tumor suppressor genes that would normally prevent carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Jacobs1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, several lines of evidence suggest that a decrease in polycomb function can favor tumor formation in the appropriate context. Downregulation of polycomb complex proteins has been described in certain tumors; these include reduced levels of Ring1B in germ cell tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-SnchezBeato1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and a decrease in Mel18 (polycomb RING Finger) in some breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Guo1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, many cancers, including leukemias and colon cancers, are associated with reactivation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes, the classical targets of polycomb silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Vider1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Abramovich1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. More directly, one study determined that expression of a loss-of-function mutant of the PRC1 component PC2 resulted in the cellular transformation of fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Satijn1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, a report demonstrated a reduction in histone H2A monoubiquitination- a polycomb-induced post-translational modification- in prostate cancer tumor samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Zhu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Much like gain-of-polycomb function effects, these studies imply that perturbation of normal polycomb-mediated transcription repression is involved in some aspect of tumorigenesis. However, it remains to be seen whether any known oncogene can directly influence polycomb silencing in a negative fashion.</p><p>Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive soft tissue cancer that typically afflicts young adults. This disease is characterized by a persistent t(X;18)(p11;q11) translocation event that juxtaposes the <italic>SYT</italic> (SYnovial sarcoma Translocated) gene on chromosome 18 with an <italic>SSX</italic> gene (either <italic>SSX1</italic> or <italic>SSX2</italic>) on the X chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Clark1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The resulting chimeric product, <italic>SYT-SSX</italic>, generates a fusion protein derived from both genes. The t(X;18)(p11;q11) rearrangement is detected in greater than 95&#x00025; of synovial sarcoma tumors and is thought to play a crucial role in the genesis and progression of this cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Clark1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous studies have revealed that SYT-SSX1 possesses inherent transforming activity in both cell culture systems and nude mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Nagai1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The oncogenic capacity of SYT-SSX2 was also demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model whereby SYT-SSX2, expressed in <italic>Myf5</italic> lineage myoblasts, generated synovial sarcoma-like tumors with 100&#x00025; penetrance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Haldar1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it was demonstrated that SYT-SSX2 disrupted cellular positioning by remodeling the cytoskeleton and altering both cytoarchitecture and microtubule stability. The former was caused by activation of the ephrin pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Barco1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite these recent advances in the understanding of the biological consequences of the SYT-SSX chimeras, the specific mechanisms through which they execute these functions are unclear.</p><p>The SYT-SSX fusion product and its wildtype SYT and SSX counterparts are nuclear proteins believed to function as regulators of gene expression. Several studies have confirmed an interaction between the N-terminal domain of SYT (SNH; also present in SYT-SSX) with the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodeling complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Thaete1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Perani1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and the histone acetyltransferease p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Eid1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The specific contribution of SYT and SYT-SSX to chromatin modification and the biological consequences of these associations are currently unknown.</p><p>Recently, colocalization of both wildtype SSX and oncogenic SYT-SSX with the nuclear aggregates of polycomb complexes was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Soulez1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. A functional correlation between polycomb and the oncogene was also described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Lubieniecka1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Nielsen2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. These associations suggested that SYT-SSX likely modulates polycomb gene silencing function, an effect that could ultimately contribute to synovial sarcoma pathogenesis. However, a specific description of the functional consequence of SYT-SSX on polycomb repression is lacking. In this report, we demonstrate and further characterize the interaction between the SYT-SSX2 oncogene and the PRC1 polycomb complex. We also show that <italic>de novo</italic> expression of SYT-SSX2 induces a significant depletion of Bmi1 protein, an effect that is mediated at the post-translational level. Downregulation of Bmi1 was associated with attenuated monoubiquitination of histone H2A, a Bmi1-specific function. These events correlated with derepression of a variety of polycomb target genes involved in diverse cellular processes. These studies demonstrate for the first time polycomb antagonism as one possible mechanism by which SYT-SSX2 contributes to the epigenetic deregulation of normal transcription. They show negative regulation of polycomb function by a reputed oncogene and propose a novel paradigm regarding polycomb silencing and cancer-related proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>SYT-SSX2 colocalizes and associates with polycomb components</title><p>Previous reports have demonstrated colocalization between SYT-SSX and polycomb bodies, using Bmi1 and Ring1A as markers of polycomb complexes. These studies suggested that an interaction, whether direct or indirect, exists between these proteins. Similarly, using a retroviral system that allowed expression of SYT-SSX2 in U2OS cells (human osteosarcoma) at levels similar to those detected in primary synovial sarcoma cells (Syn1 cells- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; in synovial sarcoma, <italic>SYT-SSX2</italic> expression is driven by the robustly active promoter of <italic>SYT</italic>), we were able to detect substantial colocalization of SYT-SSX2 with the polycomb protein Bmi1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). U2OS cells were chosen for their shared mesenchymal origin with synovial sarcoma tumors. Overlapping distribution was most readily visualized in the Bmi1-containing polycomb bodies, where approximately 86&#x00025; of these subnuclear structures were co-occupied by SYT-SSX2 aggregates. Colocalization of SYT-SSX2 was also observed with the polycomb complex component Ring1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), where co-aggregation was slightly higher (93&#x00025;). the SYT portion of the chimera alone (SYTdel8) failed to display significant colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that targeting to polycomb bodies required the presence of the SSX2 component in the SYT-SSX2 fusion protein. Further analysis confirmed that when expressed alone, the SSX2 component of the chimera is capable of localizing to polycomb bodies. SSX2 was detected in 78&#x00025; of Bmi1- and 75&#x00025; of Ring1B-containing foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These indirect immunofluorescence experiments, in accordance with others, suggested that SYT-SSX2 might physically interact with polycomb complexes. We next wanted to determine whether a direct interaction between SYT-SSX2 and Bmi1 or Ring1B was responsible for targeting SYT-SSX2 to polycomb foci. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pull-down assays, we detected specific binding between SYT-SSX2 and Ring1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) but failed to demonstrate a similar interaction with the Bmi1 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005060.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These results suggest that SYT-SSX2 colocalization with the Bmi1/Ring1B complex in polycomb bodies is likely mediated by its direct binding to Ring1B. Further characterization of the SYT-SSX2/Ring1B association is underway.</p><fig id="pone-0005060-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005060.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>SYT-SSX2 associates with Polycomb complex proteins.</title><p>(A) Equivalent protein levels of retrovirally expressed SYT-SSX2 (FLAG and HA-tagged) in U2-OS cells and in a primary human synovial sarcoma cell line (Syn1). 100 ug of cellular lysate-derived protein was loaded in each lane.

This reduction in Bmi1 fluorescence was quantified by MetaMorph software as approximately 50&#x00025; of wildtype levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). There was an apparent loss of not only the Bmi1 pool distributed diffusely throughout the nucleoplasm, but in the Bmi1 pool present in polycomb bodies as well. No change in the Bmi1 nuclear pool was observed in pOZ vector control and wildtype SYT-infectants. We also noted that localization of SSX2 in the Bmi1- and Ring1B-bearing foci was not accompanied by an attenuation of the Bmi1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the specific loss of Bmi1 immunofluorescence associated with SYT-SSX2 expression was consistently accompanied by an apparent decrease of Bmi1 protein levels on immunoblots of SYT-SSX2-transduced cellular extracts, using the same Bmi1 monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Conversely, the levels of other polycomb complex subunits, such as Ring1B and YY1 in SYT-SSX2 infectants were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), highlighting the specificity of this depletion effect for Bmi1. Consistent with the Bmi1 fluorescence signal, the singular expression of the SYT or the SSX2 fragment present in the chimera (SYTdel8, SSX2) did not affect Bmi1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that the SSX2 domain targets SYT-SSX2 to polycomb foci. However, its fusion to SYT is required to cause diminution of Bmi1 cellular levels. This effect is therefore specific to the SYT-SSX2 oncogene.</p><fig id="pone-0005060-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005060.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Loss of Bmi1 immunoreactivity following de novo expression of SYT-SSX2.</title><p>(A) Extracts derived from pOZ vector, SYT and SYT-SSX2 cells were analyzed by Western blotting for levels of Bmi1 and alpha-tubulin (loading control).

U: uninfected cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0005060.g002"/></fig><p>To gain a better insight into the decreased immunoreactivity of Bmi1 in SYT-SSX2-infectants, we generated a series of truncation mutants of SYT-SSX2 and expressed them in U2OS cells. The first set of deletions, named SXdel1-del4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), contained truncations between 15&#x02013;23 amino acids in length. Mutants SXdel1 and SXdel2, corresponding to deletion of amino acids 1&#x02013;35 of the translocated SSX2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), retained their ability to colocalize with polycomb complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Conversely, mutants SXdel3 and SXdel4, which lack amino acids 35&#x02013;78, lost their association with polycomb bodies. This suggested that the C-terminal 44 amino acids contain the region essential for localization of SYT-SSX2 to polycomb complexes. We further refined the mapping of SYT-SSX2- polycomb association by creating smaller truncations within the C-terminal 44 amino acids of SSX2; these mutants were designated SXdel5-del9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Of these mutants, only SXdel5 retained its polycomb colocalization ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that the C-terminal 34 amino acids of SYT-SSX2 contain the polycomb association motif. This C-terminal stretch lacks homology to any known protein-protein interaction domains and represents a novel interface for association with polycomb components or their interacting proteins. Like its SXdel4 counterpart, mutant SXdel8 with truncated amino acids 55&#x02013;65 expressed poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that region maintains proper stability of SYT-SSX2. As anticipated, expression of the SYT-SSX2 mutants that co-localized with polycomb complexes (SXdel1, del2, and del5) induced depletion of endogenous Bmi1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g003">Fig. 3B and D</xref>). These same three mutants also exhibited a decreased Bmi1 fluorescence in their nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The remaining SYT-SSX2 mutants that failed to be targeted to polycomb bodies had no effect on Bmi1 cellular levels. Taken together, these experiments suggest that SYT-SSX2 requires close association with polycomb complexes in order to induce a decrease in Bmi1 immunoreactivity.</p><fig id="pone-0005060-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005060.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Mapping of the Polycomb association region on SYT-SSX2.</title><p>(A) Schematic of wildtype SYT-SSX2 and the truncation mutants generated within the SSX2 region.

We did not detect changes in Bmi1 mRNA levels following transduction of SYT-SSX2 by both relative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005060.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and real time RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), arguing against transcriptional inhibition as the mechanism for Bmi1 depleted signal. We then carried out three different studies to ascertain whether the lack of Bmi1 immunoreactivity resulted from decreased Bmi1 protein stability or a <italic>de novo</italic> Bmi1 modification. In the first experiment, U2OS cells were transduced with Bmi1 cDNA that was fused to two copies of the polyoma epitope tag (2PY-Bmi1). These cells were re-infected with either pOZ retroviral backbone or SYT-SSX2 cDNAs and lysed 48 hours later. Immunoblotting for both the polyoma tag (2PY) and Bmi1 revealed signal depletion in the SYT-SSX2-infectants using both antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This argues against a Bmi1 post-translational modification, since an epitope-masking modification should not interfere with the ability of the polyoma tag antibody to recognize tagged Bmi1. In another experiment, lysates from either pOZ or SYT-SSX2-infected cells were blotted for endogenous Bmi1 using both a monoclonal and a polyclonal Bmi1-specific antibodies. Both antibodies revealed decreased Bmi1 levels in lysates from SYT-SSX2-transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), again negating the possibility of epitope-masking by a Bmi1 post-translational modification. Moreover, mass-spectrometry analysis of Bmi1 present in SYT-SSX2 cellular lysates failed to detect phosphorylated, acetylated or methylated residues (data not shown). In the final experiment, the half-life of 2PY-Bmi1 was measured using pulse-chase experiments in both pOZ and SYT-SSX2 infectants. Not surprisingly, Bmi1 in SYT-SSX2-expressing cells exhibited accelerated degradation when compared to pOZ control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). We confirmed the correct identity of the immunoprecipitated 2PY-Bmi1 by peptide competition studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Regression analysis on the pulse chase curves revealed a half-life of Bmi1 at 13.1 hours in pOZ vector-infected cells and 4.9 hours in SYT-SSX2 expressants. These studies suggest that decrease in Bmi1 protein stability is the contributing factor to Bmi1 signal depletion in SYT-SSX2-infected cells. The decision to use the 2PY-Bmi1 in the pulse-chase experiments was based on the fact that expressed 2PY-Bmi1 exhibited similar behavior to that of endogenous Bmi1 in SYT-SSX2 expressants and on the high immunoprecipitating efficiency of the 2PY antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0005060-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005060.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Loss of Bmi1 immunoreactivity in SYT-SSX2-infected cells results from depletion of the Bmi1 protein.</title><p>(A) Real time RT-PCR of Bmi1 in U2OS lysates expressing the indicated proteins.

Nonetheless, the definitve means to demonstrate a reversion of polycomb-mediated transcription inhibition is to examine whether expression of SYT-SSX2 induces reactivation of polycomb-repressed genes. We performed genomewide analysis of SYT-SSX2-infectants using microarray technology to elucidate the gene expression patterns altered by this oncogene. Hybridization of total RNAs derived from SYT-SSX2 and pOZ vector-infectant transcripts to Affymetrix microarray platforms was performed and transcript changes were expressed as Log<sub>2</sub> ratios of SYT-SSX2 signal intensity to pOZ control &#x0005b;where the Log<sub>2</sub> ratio (x) represents 2<sup>x</sup> fold increases (or decreases) in transcript level&#x0005d;. Only differences of two-fold or greater that recurred in both replicates were designated for further analysis. Of the differentially expressed genes, 123 displayed transcriptional upregulation whereas 33 demonstrated transcriptional downregulation (Microarray of upregulated and downregulated target genes by SYT-SSX2 is available upon request). Gene profiles in SYT-SSX2-expressing cells repeatedly displayed changes in the expression patterns of key proteins involved in cell cycle control, signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization and transcriptional regulation.

These studies, which combined chromatin immunoprecipitation of polycomb-bound promoters with microarray analysis, were designed to determine polycomb-binding regions across the genome. They identified approximately 8&#x00025; of the human embryonic genome as binding to polycomb complexes and these genes have been designated as putative polycomb targets. In order to compare our SYT-SSX2-differentially expressed genes with this genomewide study, we utilized the Vanderbilt University run, web-based program called WebGestalt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/">http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/</ext-link>).

The effect of SYT-SSX2 on the Ring1B/Bmi1 complex was further characterized on a representative promoter- that of the NGFR gene- by chromatin immuno-precipitation (CHIP). Our choice of an appropriate target for such studies was based on the persistent upregulation of NGFR in all the microarrays performed on SYT-SSX2-expressing mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005060-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and data not shown).

This attenuation of Bmi1 appears to be mediated at the level of protein stability, although the specific mechanism by which SYT-SSX2 promotes Bmi1 degradation awaits further investigation. The expected outcome of Bmi1 degradation in the presence of SYT-SSX2 is the alteration of at least certain aspects of polycomb silencing function. Indeed, evidence exists to corroborate the expected impairment of polycomb gene regulation. First, we demonstrated the predicted loss of global histone H2A monoubiquitination resulting from SYT-SSX2-mediated Bmi1 depletion. This effect most likely stems from a decrease in Bmi1 facilitation of Ring1B E3-ligase activity towards H2A, as the population of depleted Bmi1 corresponded largely to the pool that interacted with Ring1B. Whether the reduction in Bmi1 alters the positioning of Ring1B relative to H2A and/or affects the polyubiquitination status of Ring1B remains to be elucidated. To date, this is the only specific polycomb function that has been shown to be compromised by SYT-SSX2, suggesting that only a subset of polycomb target genes may be affected by the chimera.</p><p>In addition, we presented evidence to suggest that the Bmi1 depletion and histone H2A hypoubiquitination correlated with the reactivation of polycomb-repressed genes. To demonstrate this derepression, we adopted a genomewide approach that relied on microarray analysis to determine which transcripts were induced by SYT-SSX2. The output from these analyses were compared with another study whereby polycomb target promoters were identified utilizing a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis. One important limitation of these comparison studies is that the genomewide analysis conducted by Lee <italic>et al.</italic> (2006), as well as others, were performed in the context of embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, studies performed on a prototypic polycomb target promoter &#x02013;the NGFR gene- corroborated our central observation of Bmi1 attenuation by SYT-SSX2. Further chromatin studies in U2-OS and other mesenchymal cells are ongoing.</p><p>Although the influence of indirect effects cannot be discounted and unlisted genes may be down-regulated to undetectable levels, the microarray results support the notion that SYT-SSX2 may predominantly activate rather than suppress genes. Notably, a large number (more than half) of the 33 derepressed polycomb targets were also upregulated in the microarrays of the SYT-SSX2-derived murine synovial sarcomas as well as human synovial sarcoma tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Nagai1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-debruijn1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Nielsen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Nagayama1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-lee1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The overlap includes either the same factors such as Jagged2 (JAG2), Delta-like 1 (DLL1), Sal-like 1 (SALL1), dual specificity phosphatase 9 (DUSP9), nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR), ephrin B3 receptor (EPHB3), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOC3), Msh-homeobox 1 (MSX1), chromobox homolog 4 (CBX4), BCL2-Like11 (BCL2L11), cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1), member RAS family (RAB40), solute carrier family 16 (SLC16), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATC1), or members of the same signaling families such as JAG1, SALL2, MSX2, transducin-like enhancer of split 3 (TLE3), G-protein receptors (GPR), ephrin receptors (EPHB1,2,4), NFATC4, CBX2,5, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Several of the polycomb-silenced transcripts upregulated by SYT-SSX2 corresponded to proteins that are implicated in tumor formation and progression. Several members of the Notch signaling pathway, including <italic>DLL1</italic>, <italic>JAG2</italic> and <italic>HES4</italic>, displayed increased steady state mRNA in the presence of SYT-SSX2. Activating mutations of Notch signaling receptors or overexpression of the Notch ligands (DLL, JAG) have been observed in hematological, breast, cervical, and intestinal tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Wu1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Increased Notch signaling can promote cellular transformation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and tumor vascularization in the appropriate context. Another gene, <italic>EphB3</italic>, corresponds to a receptor of the ephrin signaling pathway, a cascade whose deregulation contributes to tumor cell shape, adhesion, migration and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Pasquale1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, <italic>PDGF-B</italic> corresponds to a ligand in the platelet derived growth factor pathway that can mediate tumor migration and capillary network formation. Reactivation of these genes by SYT-SSX2 could therefore ultimately facilitate tumorigenesis and/or tumor progression in synovial sarcoma.</p><p>The finding that a reputed oncogene can suppress certain aspects of polycomb silencing was somewhat unexpected. The majority of work examining the role of polycomb silencing in cancer has established that oncogenicity is often associated with a polycomb gain of function. However, several lines of evidence, including the observed reactivation of the polycomb target <italic>Hox</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Abramovich1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Zhu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and downregulation of some polycomb proteins in limited cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-SnchezBeato1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, have suggested that polycomb derepression can equate to tumorigenesis in the appropriate context. In addition, the transforming activity attained by a loss-of-function mutant of the polycomb subunit PC2 provides more direct evidence that polycomb silencing can also be impaired in cancer. Recently, a landmark study also demonstrated that a consistent decrease in global ubiquityl-histone H2A occurs in prostate cancer, suggesting that H2A hypoubiquitination may serve as a tumor marker in this disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Zhu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The significance of the work presented in the current study lies in the novel demonstration of disrupted polycomb silencing caused by an oncogene.</p><p>A crucial and precarious balance in Polycomb function is needed for maintaining the homeostasis of the cell. This balance in polycomb gene silencing is mediated by processes including histone H2A ubiquitination, chromatin compaction, RNA polymerase II inhibition, histone hypoacetylation and DNA methylation. When any of these functions are perturbed through a gain of polycomb silencing, such as when polycomb components are overexpressed, tumor-promoting phenotypes are induced through the repression of tumor suppressors. However, a shift towards impairment of certain polycomb silencing functions can also promote cancer through the reactivation of oncogenic genes. In this regard, it is important to emphasize that many polycomb gene targets are overexpressed in cancer, including members of the Wnt, Notch and ephrin signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Boyer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Lee1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Although it has yet to be determined, a possible mechanism explaining aberrant signaling through these pathways in cancer may reside in the suppression of polycomb silencing.</p><p>Based on the available evidence, we believe that SYT-SSX2 protein is recruited to a subset of polycomb repressive complexes within the nucleus via direct and/or indirect interactions with polycomb components or other co-residing chromatin modifiers. This SYT-SSX2 recruitment promotes the displacement and/or degradation of Bmi1 protein, which alters normal Bmi1-mediated functions, such as histone H2A monoubiquitination. In addition, the SYT-SSX2 chimera, through physical interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Eid1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005060-Soulez1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, may recruit both the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and p300 acetyltransferase to this polycomb-repressed chromatin. The aberrant targeting of these proteins may then promote changes that culminate in the transcription of genes that were once silenced by polycomb complexes. The protein products of these upregulated genes could then ultimately contribute to some aspect of synovial sarcoma pathogenesis.</p><p>Taken together, these studies provide an interesting insight into the molecular function of SYT-SSX2. When carried further, these analyses of chromatin deregulation by the fusion protein will be beneficial for targeting synovial sarcoma. Moreover, they will enhance our understanding regarding the regulation of polycomb components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and Reagents</title><p>The U2OS osteosarcoma cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS).
