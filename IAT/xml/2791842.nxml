To investigate this issue, we have analyzed the adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>-null mouse model. <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> is a transcriptional co-factor endowed with antiproliferative and prodifferentiative properties; indeed, its upregulation in neural progenitors has been shown to induce exit from cell cycle and differentiation. We demonstrate here that the deletion of <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> causes an increased proliferation of progenitor cells in the adult dentate gyrus and an arrest of their terminal differentiation. In fact, in the <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>-null hippocampus postmitotic undifferentiated neurons accumulated, while the number of terminally differentiated neurons decreased of 40&#x00025;. As a result, <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>-null mice displayed a deficit of contextual memory. Notably, we observed that <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> can associate to the promoter of <italic>Id3</italic>, an inhibitor of proneural gene activity, and negatively regulates its expression, indicating that <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> acts upstream of <italic>Id3</italic>. Our results identify <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> as a gene required in the control of proliferation and terminal differentiation of newborn neurons during adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest its involvement in the formation of contextual memories.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>PC3</italic>, also known as <italic>Tis21</italic> or <italic>BTG2</italic> (in rat, mouse and human, respectively; see for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Tirone1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Matsuda1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>), originally isolated as gene induced by nerve growth factor, negatively controls a cell cycle checkpoint at the G1 to S phase transition in fibroblasts and neuronal cells by direct inhibition of the activity of <italic>cyclin D1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Bradbury1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Montagnoli1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Guardavaccaro1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, by means of a transgenic mouse over-expressing <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> in adult hippocampal progenitor cells we have shown that <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> accelerates their differentiation, without affecting the final number of differentiated neurons. We found that the synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus and the performance in different hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory tests was severely reduced. This suggested that the time the young neurons spend in different states of neuronal differentiation is critical for their ultimate function in learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-FarioliVecchioli2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The hippocampus is known to be required in the processing of spatial and contextual memories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Bird1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Frankland1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. A specific role in this context appears to be played by the new neurons continuously generated during adulthood from progenitor cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. In fact, adult hippocampal neurogenesis appears to be necessary for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, as indicated by severe cognitive deficits following ablation of neurogenesis in mice models by toxins, x-ray irradiation or virus-activated pro-drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Shors1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Snyder1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Saxe1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

In fact, during brain development <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> is expressed in the proliferating neuroblasts of the ventricular zone of the neural tube, and to a lower extent in the differentiating neuroblasts of the mantle zone; postnatally it is expressed in cerebellar precursors mainly in the proliferating regions of the neuropithelium (i.e., in the external granular layer), and in the hippocampus in proliferating and differentiating progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Iacopetti1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Canzoniere1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-FarioliVecchioli2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Attardo1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, given that <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> appears to be a pan-neural gene that marks neural progenitors and induces their differentiation, its genetic ablation is expected to interfere with the ongoing neurogenesis. Indeed, we found that the terminal differentiation of adult-generated hippocampal granule neurons is specifically dependent on <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> expression, being impaired in mice ablated of <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>.</p><p>Such impairment was accompanied by a deficit of contextual memory in fear-related tests, suggesting that terminal differentiation of new neurons can be critical for associative memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>-Null Mice and Genotyping</title><p>The <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> knockout mice had been generated previously, as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Park1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

When the mouse had stepped with all four paws into the dark side, the door was closed, the step-through latency was recorded, and two foot shocks (0.4 mA, 50 Hz, 2s, 5s ISI) were delivered. Twenty-four hours after training mice were tested in the same apparatus with a similar procedure to that of training, except that no foot shocks were administrated.

In the present model, terminal differentiation of new neurons is prevented, while the proliferation rate of progenitor cells is increased.</p><p>This cellular phenotype is associated to different performances in memory tests, being a deficit evident in the contextual fear conditioning and inhibitory avoidance, but absent in the Morris water maze. A possible explanation is that fear-related tests, as one-time associative tasks, are more sensitive to the large decrease, up to 40&#x00025;, of terminally differentiated stage 6 neurons 1- to 4-week-old, than the Morris water maze that, conversely, consists of repeated training trials. Consistently, the total number of c-fos activated neurons was equal in <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>-null and WT mice only after the Morris water maze test, suggesting that a functional compensation of the decrease of terminally differentiated neurons occurred in memory circuits of <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>-null mice during that test.</p><p>Notably, c-fos activation of stage 5 neurons (BrdU/Calretinin/NeuN-positive) occurred quite selectively in <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>-null mice, after both Morris water maze and contextual fear conditioning tests. In fact, stage 5 neurons are present also in WT mice, which suggests that such preferential recruitment in memory circuits of stage 5 undifferentiated neurons may act as a homeostatic mechanism, compensating for the large reduction of stage 6 differentiated neurons in <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>-null mice. However, since the undifferentiated stage 5 neurons in <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>-null mice are equally recruited after both tests, it is unlikely that these neurons are responsible for the normal performance of mutant mice in the Morris water maze test. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that, under certain learning conditions such as those of the Morris water maze test in <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>-null mice, stage 5 neurons may contribute to recruit a larger number of neurons within memory circuits.</p><p>More generally, our data reveal how critical for spatial/contextual memory and recruitment in memory circuits of newborn neurons is the control of the neural differentiation process in dentate gyrus, not only at the stage of progenitor cells, as previously observed following an acceleration of their differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-FarioliVecchioli2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, but also for early post-mitotic neurons when their terminal differentiation is delayed, as observed here after genetic ablation of <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>.</p><p>Moreover, given the physiological role in the control of proliferation and differentiation of developing neurons highlighted here for <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic>, and considering the neuroprotective role assigned to this gene in several systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Zhang1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Lau1">&#x0005b;81&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008339-Corrente1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, future studies should aim at defining whether <italic>PC3/Tis21</italic> plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases.

(A-C) The open field test was carried out in a circular arena (60 cm of diameter) made in grey Plexiglas surrounded by walls (20 cm high). Animals were placed in the centre of the arena and allowed to explore it over a 8-min period. Elapsed the first 4 min, an object was inserted to the centre of the apparatus and mice were leaved into the arena for an additional 4-min period. Behaviors were videotaped and the time spent in locomotion (Loc), no locomotion (No loc), rearing (Rear), freezing (Freez) and contact with object (Cont), as well as the time spent in sectors (external, Ext; middle, Mid and internal, Int) were analyzed by using the Observer software (Noldus Information Technology, Costerweg, NL).
