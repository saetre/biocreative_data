Optimal repression requires MelR binding to a site that overlaps the <italic>melR</italic> transcription start point and to upstream sites. In this work, we have investigated the different determinants needed for optimal repression and their spatial requirements. We show that repression requires a complex involving four DNA-bound MelR molecules, and that the global CRP regulator plays little or no role.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Repressors play an important role in the complex web of regulatory interactions that control transcription in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Many repressors bind to sites that overlap key promoter elements and down-regulate promoter activity by preventing the binding of RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). At some promoters, efficient down-regulation requires the repressor to be bound at tandem operators. In a number of instances, these operators are separated by more than 100 bp and it has been suggested that bound repressors interact, forming a repression loop in the intervening DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). One of the best-studied examples is the AraC protein, an arabinose-trigerred transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In the absence of arabinose, transcription of the <italic>araC</italic> gene is repressed by two AraC molecules that bind to two DNA sites (<italic>O2</italic> and <italic>I1</italic>) that flank the <italic>araC</italic> promoter and are separated by 210 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In this paper, we present a study of similar complex repression by a transcription factor that is related to AraC, the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MelR protein, which represses transcription of its own gene, <italic>melR</italic>.</p><p>MelR is a member of the AraC-XylS family of bacterial gene regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and our previous studies have shown that MelR, together with the cyclic AMP receptor protein, CRP, regulates expression of the <italic>melAB</italic> operon that encodes products essential for melibiose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Melibiose triggers the formation of an activatory complex of four MelR molecules and one CRP dimer at the <italic>melAB</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In this complex, MelR binds to two pairs of DNA sites, sites 2 and 2&#x02032; and sites 1 and 1&#x02032;, and CRP binds between the two pairs of sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). This complex cannot form in the absence of melibiose because MelR, whilst binding to sites 2, 1 and 1&#x02032;, is unable to occupy site 2&#x02032;. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The <italic>melR</italic> promoter and its repression by MelR. (<bold>A</bold>) The figure illustrates the starting TB20 EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII fragment carrying the <italic>mel</italic> operon regulatory region together with the TB22, TB23 and TB10 derivatives. Bent arrows indicate the transcription start sites for the <italic>melAB</italic> and <italic>melR</italic> promoters and triangles denote the corresponding &#x02212;10 hexamer elements. The locations of the different 18-bp DNA sites for MelR are indicated by squares, with their orientation shown by horizontal arrows. The two DNA sites for CRP, CRP1 and CRP2, are denoted by pairs of ovals. (<bold>B</bold>) The figure illustrates &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> WAM1321 cells carrying <italic>melR</italic> promoter::<italic>lac</italic> fusions, encoded by pRW50 with insertions of the TB20, TB22, TB23 or TB10 EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII fragments, as indicated. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase expression was measured in cells containing pJW15 that encodes MelR (+MelR: black filled bars) or the control pJW<italic>&#x00394;melR</italic> with no <italic>melR</italic> insert (&#x02212;MelR: open bars). For each promoter, the activity +MelR is expressed as a % of the activity &#x02212;MelR (300, 350, 300 and 330 Miller units for TB20, TB22, TB23 and TB10, respectively). The results are averages from at least three independent determinations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn119f1"/></fig></p><p>Expression of MelR is controlled by the <italic>melR</italic> promoter, which drives initiation of a divergent transcript from 237-bp upstream of the <italic>melAB</italic> transcript start point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Transcription of <italic>melR</italic> is completely dependent on cAMP-CRP binding to a DNA target that overlaps the promoter -35 region, and is autoregulated by MelR binding to a fifth target site, site R, that overlaps the <italic>melR</italic> promoter transcript start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Like many members of the AraC-XylS family, MelR consists of an N-terminal ligand-binding domain connected, via a flexible linker, to an &#x0223c;100 amino acid C-terminal DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The DNA-binding domain, that is the defining feature of all AraC-XylS family regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), contains two helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motifs which, when bound at operator targets, recognize different base sequences in adjacent major grooves in a specific orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The orientation of MelR binding at sites 2 and 2&#x02032; and sites 1 and 1&#x02032; has already been determined experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and here we have investigated the orientation of MelR bound at site R.</p><p>Previously, we found that optimal MelR-dependent repression of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter occurs in the absence of melibiose, and requires MelR-binding site 2, centred between base pairs &#x02212;174 and &#x02212;175 (i.e. position &#x02212;174.5), upstream of the <italic>melR</italic> transcript start point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). By analogy with the action of AraC at the <italic>araC</italic> promoter, it was suggested that repression might simply be due to loop formation between two MelR molecules bound at site R and site 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Hence, in this work, we used <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> methods to investigate the determinants needed for MelR-dependent repression of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter. We show that the simple looping model is not applicable and that repression involves four bound MelR molecules, and we argue for a repression complex rather than a repression loop.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids and promoters</title><p>In this work, we used the WAM1321 &#x00394;<italic>lac</italic> &#x00394;<italic>melR</italic> &#x00394;<italic>melA</italic> strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, together with the shorter TB10 derivative that lacks sequences upstream of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter. Derivatives of the TB20 fragment are illustrated in the figures and the complete base sequence of each fragment from the EcoRI site to the HindIII site is shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn119/DC1">Figure 1 of the online Supplementary Data</ext-link>. All DNA sequences were checked by the University of Birmingham Functional Genomics Service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomics.bham.ac.uk/">http://www.genomics.bham.ac.uk/</ext-link>). By convention, in this paper, sequences are numbered with respect to the transcription start point of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter with upstream and downstream locations denoted by minus and plus prefixes, respectively. EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII fragments carrying the <italic>melR</italic> promoter were cloned into pRW50, a broad host range low copy number <italic>lac</italic> expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), to create <italic>melR</italic> promoter::<italic>lac</italic> fusions. Plasmid pRW50 and derivatives were maintained in host strains with 35 &#x003bc;g/ml tetracycline. Experiments to measure effects of MelR <italic>in vivo</italic> used pJW15, which carries the wild-type <italic>melR</italic> gene, and an empty control pJW15&#x00394;<italic>melR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Plasmid pJW15 and derivatives were maintained in host strains with 80-&#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin. The derivative of pJW15 encoding Val273 MelR is described in Grainger <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). For <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, <italic>melR</italic> promoter fragments were cloned into plasmid pSR that was maintained in host strains with 80-&#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of promoter fragments</title><p>Different promoter fragments were constructed by using PCR or megaprimer PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn119/DC1">Table 1 of the online Supplementary Data</ext-link> lists the base sequence of all the oligo primers that were used in these constructions.</p><p>Starting with the TB20 fragment cloned in pSR, PCR was used to construct the shorter TB22 and T23 fragments using primers D51247 and D21970 for TB22, and D51248 and D21970 for TB23. The TB20 5C, 13G and 13T derivatives were constructed by megaprimer PCR using primers D21970 together with D47376, D47377 and D47378, respectively. Corresponding products were then used as megaprimers together with primer D31961 to amplify the full-length TB20 mutated fragment. The TB210 fragment was constructed from a megaprimer made with D48803 and D21970 which was then used in conjunction with D31961 to give TB20 with a consensus <italic>melR</italic> promoter &#x02212;10 hexamer element. TB211 was then derived from TB210 using D49453 and D21970 to make a megaprimer, which was then used together with D31961. Finally, TB201 and TB222 were derived from TB20 and TB211, respectively, using D50812 and D21970 to generate megaprimers. These were then used in combination with D31961 to generate the mutant TB201 and TB222 fragments.</p><p>Starting with the TB22 fragment cloned in pSR, the &#x00394;5 derivative was constructed using PCR. To do this, upstream EcoRI&#x02013;NcoI and downstream NcoI&#x02013;HindIII fragments were generated using primers D31961 and D55280 and D55278 and D21970, respectively and ligated together. For the &#x00394;10-derivative, the same upstream EcoRI&#x02013;NcoI fragment was used together with a downstream NcoI&#x02013;HindIII fragment generated using primers D21970 and D55274. For the +5 derivative, the same D31961/D55280 EcoRI&#x02013;NcoI fragment was used together with a downstream NcoI&#x02013;HindIII fragment generated using primers D21970 and D55276. To make the +41 and +91 inserts, first a derivative of TB22 carrying NcoI and SalI sites downstream of site 1&#x02032; was constructed. To do this, a megaprimer was made using D56893 and D21970. The megaprimer was then used as a primer together with D31961 to generate the TB22 derivative. The TB22 + 41 and TB22 + 91 fragments were then constructed by insertion of blocks of sequence amplified from pBR322 and cloned as NcoI&#x02013;SalI fragments. These fragments were generated after PCR using D56890 and D56891 (for +41) or D56892 (for +91). The TB28 fragment was generated by ligating upstream EcoRI&#x02013;NcoI and downstream NcoI&#x02013;HindIII fragments together. The upstream fragment was generated using primers D31961 and D58647 with TB22 cloned in pSR as a template. The downstream fragment was generated using primers D58648 and D21970 with TB22 + 91 cloned in pSR as a template.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of promoter activities <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Assays were performed in WAM1321 &#x00394;<italic>lac</italic> &#x00394;<italic>melR</italic> &#x00394;<italic>melA</italic> cells containing <italic>melR</italic> promoter::<italic>lac</italic> fusions on pRW50 derivatives, into which the different fragments carrying the <italic>melR</italic> promoter had been cloned.

Thus, the <italic>melR</italic> promoter is not efficiently repressed by MelR, and MelR is over-expressed. Cells were grown in minimal medium, with fructose as a carbon source, as in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and the Miller method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) was used to quantify &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification and labelling of MelR for Fe-BABE experiments</title><p>MelR carrying a single cysteine at residue 269 was over-expressed, purified and labelled with Fe-BABE, and used in footprinting experiments, exactly as described by Grainger <italic>et al</italic>.

For <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments, caesium chloride purified supercoiled pSR plasmid carrying the TB22 or TB23 EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII <italic>melR</italic> promoter inserts was used. Ten-nanomolar template was pre-incubated with purified CRP (200 nM; gift from Dr Georgina Lloyd) and cAMP (200 &#x003bc;M) and purified <italic>E. coli</italic> holo RNA polymerase (20 nM; purchased from Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison) in 40 mM Tris&#x02013;acetate pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM KCl and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml BSA, either with or without 100 nM purified MelR.

For DNAase I footprinting, we used AatII&#x02013;HindIII fragments that had been purified from pSR, carrying the TB22 or TB28 EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII inserts, and end-labelled with &#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P ATP at the HindIII end. Different concentrations of MelR were pre-incubated for 5 min at 37&#x000b0;C with 4 nM of the DNA fragment in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA and 0.05 mg/ml herring sperm DNA.

After phenol&#x02013;chloroform treatment and ethanol precipitation, samples were re-suspended in gel-loading buffer (40% deionized formamide, 5 M urea, 5 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, 0.025% bromophenol blue and 0.025% xylene cyanole), heated for 2 min at 90&#x000b0;C and then loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Footprints were scanned and quantified using Bio-Rad Quantity One software. To compare the affinity of MelR for site R in the TB22 and TB28 fragments, we measured the intensity of bands which result from cleavage at three different positions in site R, where cleavage is reduced by MelR binding. Intensities were measured in footprints obtained at different MelR concentrations, and lane-to-lane variation was accounted for by normalization to the intensities of bands at positions -35 and -65, that are unaffected by MelR binding. Comparison of the apparent concentration of MelR required for 50% protection at site R in the two fragments gives an estimate of relative binding affinities.</p></sec><sec><title>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of MelR&#x02013;DNA complexes</title><p>The DNA fragment used was generated by digestion of pSR carrying the TB22 EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII fragment with SspI and NdeI.

This fragment, together with the TB22, TB23 and TB10 truncated derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), was cloned into pRW50, a <italic>lac</italic> expression vector, to generate <italic>melR</italic> promoter::<italic>lac</italic> fusions. To measure MelR-dependent repression of <italic>melR</italic> promoter activity, the pRW50 derivatives carrying the TB20, TB22, TB23 or TB10 fragments were transformed into WAM1321 &#x00394;<italic>melR</italic> &#x00394;<italic>lac</italic> cells containing either pJW15, encoding <italic>melR</italic>, or empty control vector, pJW&#x00394;<italic>melR</italic> and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were measured. The results, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, show that, with the TB20 fragment cloned in pRW50, MelR causes a &#x0003e;5-fold reduction in &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression. Similar repression is seen with the TB22 fragment, in which <italic>melAB</italic> promoter sequences upstream of MelR-binding site 2 have been removed. In contrast, and in full agreement with the previous results of Wade <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), the longer deletion in the TB23 fragment, that removes MelR binding site 2, results in a sharp reduction in the repression of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter by MelR. This reduced repression is unchanged by the longer deletion in the TB10 fragment.</p><p>Next, we attempted to reproduce MelR-dependent repression of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter <italic>in vitro</italic>. To do this, the TB22 and TB23 fragments were cloned into plasmid pSR such that the <italic>melR</italic> promoter was placed upstream of the bacteriophage &#x003bb; <italic>oop</italic> factor-independent terminator. The recombinant plasmids were incubated with purified RNA polymerase holoenzyme and the activator, CRP, and radiolabelled nucleoside triphosphates were added. Analysis of the RNA products, shows that two discrete RNA species were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These correspond to the plasmid-encoded RNA-1 (108 nt) and a longer 138 base transcript that initiates at the <italic>melR</italic> promoter and runs to the <italic>oop</italic> terminator.

Furthermore, though the base at position 13 is the non-consensus A, substitution with a T also reduces MelR-dependent repression.

First, we exploited the observation that the RV273 substitution in helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix 2, permits MelR to recognize binding targets with a T at position 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C show that Val273 MelR gives a small enhancement in repression of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter carrying the 13T substitution in site R, compared to wild-type MelR. In contrast, repression of the 5C derivative is reduced with Val273 MelR. These data are consistent with a model in which helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix 2 of MelR contacts the downstream part of site R, with residue 273 interacting with the base pair at position 13. To confirm this, we used a preparation of purified MelR that had been labelled with an inorganic DNA cleavage reagent at residue 269, adjacent to helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The reagent, <italic>p</italic>-bromoacetamidobenzyl-EDTA-Fe (Fe-BABE), generates a pulse of hydroxyl radicals that can be used to find the location of DNA binding of a protein and its orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28">26&#x02013;28</xref>), and previously we exploited this to determine the orientation of MelR binding at sites 1&#x02032;, 1, 2 and 2&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A shows the pattern of DNA cleavage due to Fe-BABE covalently attached at residue 269 of purified MelR, bound at site R. As expected, two sets of bands are observed. These result from cleavage at minor grooves on either side of the site where helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix 2 is bound, which occurs as a pulse of hydroxyl radicals encounters the neighbouring DNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B shows the location of these sites of cleavage in the context of MelR-binding site R. The results confirm that helix&#x02014;turn&#x02013;helix 2 of MelR binds to the downstream half of site R and hence MelR must bind in opposite orientations at site R and site 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Binding of Fe-BABE-labelled MelR to <italic>melR</italic> promoter DNA.

Thus, TB201 is a derivative of TB20 in which the DNA site for CRP located between MelR site 1 and site 2 (CRP1) is inactivated. Results illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B show that MelR-dependent repression of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter is unaffected when CRP binding at this target is prevented. It is more complicated to investigate the DNA site for CRP located 41-bp upstream of the <italic>melR</italic> transcript startpoint (CRP2) because its inactivation leads to loss of <italic>melR</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).

This change confers partial CRP independence on the <italic>melR</italic> promoter (data not shown) and also causes a small reduction in MelR-dependent repression. We then constructed the TB211 fragment in which the CRP2 site was inactivated, and TB222, in which both DNA sites for CRP were inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Results illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B show that the MelR-dependent repression of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter in the TB210 fragment is unchanged in the TB211 and TB222 derivatives.

To do this, we exploited an 821-bp SspI&#x02013;NdeI restriction fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), which contains the 251-bp TB22 EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) with a short 190-bp extension upstream of the EcoRI site and a longer 380-bp segment downstream from the HindIII site. A mixture containing purified MelR and the DNA fragment was deposited onto a nickel chloride-treated mica surface and imaged by AFM using a cantilever in tapping mode. DNA fragments and MelR&#x02013;DNA complexes were visualized, and typical examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> (with more examples and data in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn119/DC1">Figure 2 of the online Supplementary Data</ext-link>). The cluster of the binding sites 2, 1 and 1&#x02032; is at a distance from site R that would allow clear visualization of a DNA loop, but no sign of such loops was apparent in any of the &#x0223c;100 images of complexes that we examined. Instead, DNA-bound MelR appears as distinct oval foci at a distance of &#x0223c;59&#x02013;64 nm from one end of the DNA fragments. While the length of the shorter DNA arm was approximately the same in all complexes, the length of the longer DNA arm appeared shorter in a third of the complexes. In the examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, the longer arm is 205 nm in one complex and 158 nm in the other, and more examples are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn119/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>. We noticed that the foci due to MelR binding were consistently bigger in the complexes with the shortened arm. In the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, the MelR focus is 15 &#x000d7; 33 nm across the shortest and longest axes of the oval in the complex with the shortened arm (right hand panel), compared to 9 &#x000d7; 12 nm in the other complex (centre panel). The simplest explanation for these observations, that is consistent with the location of sites in the DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), is that one type of complex contains 3 MelR molecules bound at sites 2, 1 and 1&#x02032; (centre panel), whilst the other contains 4 MelR molecules bound at sites 2, 1, 1&#x02032; and R (right panel). Thus there is an apparent progressive shortening of the end-to-end contour length of the DNA from the naked DNA to the MelR-2-1-1&#x02032; complex and to the MelR-2-1-1&#x02032;-R complex. The shortening appears to be due to compaction of the DNA between bound MelR molecules rather than to looping. Note a loop formed from the DNA between MelR bound at sites 2, 1, 1&#x02032; and bound at site R would have a diameter of &#x0223c;13 nm and this is well within the range of sizes visualized in other studies that used the same methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31">29&#x02013;31</xref>). <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Analysis of MelR binding using AFM.

Our aim in this work was to ascertain if such a simple model applied to MelR-dependent repression of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter. Our principal conclusion is that optimal repression does require MelR binding at distant targets, but it is more complicated, involving four molecules of MelR.</p><p>Expression of the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 <italic>melAB</italic> genes, which encode products essential for melibiose metabolism, depends on transcription activation by MelR and CRP, and is triggered by melibiose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Expression of the <italic>melR</italic> gene depends on transcription activation by CRP, whose activity depends on cyclic AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In conditions where CRP is active, but melibiose is absent, MelR is made and occupies binding sites 2, 1, 1&#x02032; and site R, but it cannot occupy site 2&#x02032; and activate the <italic>melAB</italic> promoter, and hence the system is &#x02018;poised&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In this situation, MelR autoregulates its own expression by binding to site R and repressing its own promoter, and this repression is reinforced by upstream binding of MelR. The simplest model is that repression is dependent on the formation of a complex involving more than one molecule of MelR and we have found that optimal repression requires the binding of MelR at sites R, 2, 1 and 1&#x02032;, but not the binding of CRP at its targets. Since each target site accommodates one MelR monomer, and since MelR exists in solution as a monomer&#x02013;dimer equilibrium (Mohamed el-Robh, unpublished data) we suppose that the final repressing complex is a dimer of MelR dimers.</p><p>We previously suggested that a MelR dimer simultaneously occupies site R and site 2, creating a repression loop and the effects of different insertions and deletions on MelR-dependent repression of the <italic>melR</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) are consistent with this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, we now argue for a repression complex rather than a repression loop, and, taken together, our results suggest that this complex involves MelR bound at sites 1 and 1&#x02032;, as well as at site 2 and site R. Our AFM imaging data suggest that DNA regions between the MelR-binding sites remain associated with the MelR&#x02013;DNA complexes rather than forced to loop out of the complexes. The nature of this DNA packaging in the MelR&#x02013;DNA complexes is not clear and might involve MelR-induced DNA bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) or wrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), but whatever its nature, the intervening DNA remains accessible to attack by DNAase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Note that others have argued for repression by complexes rather than by simple loops, and the best example is that of the <italic>E. coli</italic> GalR repressor at the <italic>gal</italic> operon regulatory region, where &#x02018;repressomes&#x02019; have been visualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Thus, our results may have implications for understanding the pathway of DNA at other regulatory regions, such as the <italic>E. coli chbB</italic> regulatory region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), where multiple bound factors are required for repression.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn119/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkn119_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkn119_nar-02722-x-2007-File003.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_gkn119_nar-02722-x-2007-File004.ppt"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkn119_nar-02722-x-2007-File005.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust, the UK BBSRC and the Darwin Trust of Edinburgh.
