We previously generated <italic>ataxin-2</italic> (<italic>Atxn2</italic>) knockout mice and demonstrated that these animals lacked obvious anatomical abnormalities of the CNS, but showed marked obesity and reduced fertility. We now report on behavioral changes as a consequence of <italic>Atxn2</italic>-deficiency. <italic>Atxn2</italic>-deficiency was associated with impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in the amygdala, but normal LTP in the hippocampus. Intact hippocampal plasticity was associated behaviorally with normal Morris Water maze testing. Impaired amygdala plasticity was associated with reduced cued and contextual fear conditioning. Conditioned taste aversion, however, was normal. In addition, knockout mice showed decreased innate fear in several tests and motor hyperactivity in open cage testing. Our results suggest that <italic>Atxn2</italic>-deficiency results in a specific set of behavioral and cellular disturbances that include motor hyperactivity and abnormal fear-related behaviors, but intact hippocampal function. This animal model may be useful for the study of anxiety disorders and should encourage studies of anxiety in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2).</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>ataxin-2</italic> (<italic>ATXN2</italic>) gene belongs to a group of genes, in which expansion of a translated CAG repeat causes neurodegeneration.

Backcrossing mice into a pure C57BL/6J or 129/SvJ background was not possible as litter sizes decreased dramatically once C57BL/6J or 129/SvJ backgrounds exceeded 90&#x00025;. Therefore, all experiments were carried out in a mixed C57BL/6J:129/SvJ background. Initial breeding pairs (F0) had a defined background of approximately C57BL/6J 50&#x00025;:129/SvJ 50&#x00025;. For cohort A, all mice represented F1 animals (B6;129SF1-SCA2<sup>tm1SMP</sup>/J) derived from these breeder pairs.

Swimming trajectories were monitored with a video tracking system (HVS Water Maze Package) that calculated swim speed, trajectory length and average distance from the platform. The latency to find the platform was recorded for each block of the four trials. A total of 8 trials were performed per day. The latencies of the 8 trials were averaged and used for statistical analysis. On the first day, the platform was kept visible to evaluate visual acuity and swimming ability. Mice were given 8 visible platform trials. On the following days, during the hidden platform test, mice learned the location of the escape platform in relation to four external cues in the room. Mice were given 8 hidden platform trials per day from days 2 to 13. Mice were placed into the water facing the wall of the pool and allowed to search for the platform. Trials ended either when a mouse climbed onto the platform or when a maximum of 60 seconds had elapsed. In a block of trials, the starting position was varied among 4 positions. The main measure was the latency to stay in the quadrant with the hidden platform. Probe tests were administered on the 10<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> day. During probe tests, the platform was removed from the pool. Mice were started in a position opposite the location of the training platform position and allowed to swim for 60 seconds.</p><p>Mice that were floating or showed thigmotaxis during the probe tests were excluded from analysis.

Cohort B consisted of 7 wt, 9 het, and 8 Atxn2 ko mice consisting of 3 wt female, 5 het female, 3 female Atxn2 ko, 4 wt male, 4 het male, and 5 Atxn2 ko mice.</p><p>To test aversive memory, wild type and <italic>Atxn2</italic> ko mice were subjected to cued and contextual fear conditioning experiments. In this test, mice were conditioned to associate an auditory cue or environmental contexts with a foot shock. The conditioning chamber was connected to a video monitor that recorded movement in the chamber. During the training phase, a mouse was placed in a conditioning chamber, allowed to explore the testing chamber for 2 minutes before the onset of a discrete conditioned stimulus (CS) in the form of a tone (30 s, 2800 Hz, 80 dB). Within the last 2 seconds of the tone, an unconditional stimulus (US) in the form of a mild foot shock (0.50 mA, 2 s) was delivered. The mouse was allowed to recover for 1 minute, and then a second pair of CS-US was delivered. A total of 3 pairings of the CS-US were delivered during the training phase. After the last CS-US pairing, the mouse was allowed to remain in the conditioning chamber for 1 minute and then was returned to its original cage.</p><p>24 hours later, mice were tested for &#x0201c;freezing&#x0201d;. Freezing is defined as a defensive posture, in which no movement except for respiration is observed. For cued conditioning measurements, mice were placed in a novel context and allowed to explore for 2 minutes, followed by exposure to the tone (CS) for 30 s. After a recovery period of 30 s, the tone and recovery period were repeated twice. For measurements of contextual conditioning, mice were placed back into the original conditioning chamber. Freezing was observed for 5 minutes. No shocks were given during testing for cued or contextual freezing. The percentage of total time in which an animal exhibited freezing behavior was recorded.</p><p>Response to the shock was measured as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006235-Anagnostaras1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, full-screen video images for the 2-sec period prior to the shock (baseline) and the 2-sec period during the shock were digitized at 10 Hz using NIH image. X-Y coordinates were collected frame by frame for each mouse by an investigator who did not know the identity of the mouse and the data were imported into Microsoft Excel. Distance traveled measured in pixels between successive frames was computed, and converted into centimeters using known landmark distances in the video frame.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Startle Test</title><p>We used the startle test protocol at the UCLA Behavior core facility to test basic startle mechanisms. Accordingly, mice were placed in a restraint tube mounted on a startle measuring platform and startle response to a loud auditory stimulus was recorded. After a period of 5 min for acclimation, mice were presented with a null trial (no stimulus) followed by 10 trials at startle stimuli with intensities at 75 dB, 80 dB, 85 dB, 90 dB, 95 dB, 100 dB, 105 dB, 110 dB, 115 dB, or 120 dB.

After habituation, the hot plate was heated to a constant temperature of 52.5&#x000b0;C. Mice were then placed with all four feet onto the hot surface. Once the mouse responded by lifting or licking a hind paw, or by jumping, the mouse was immediately removed from the hot plate and the latency of time to respond was recorded.
