The tiny <italic>FrRUNT </italic>packs six exons and two putative promoters in just 3 kb of genomic sequence.

In the human genome, <italic>SUPT3H </italic>is instead interlocked with <italic>RUNX2</italic>. <italic>FrRUNT </italic>has no detectable ortholog in the genomes of mammals, birds or amphibians. We consider alternative explanations for an apparent contradiction between the phylogenetic data and the comparison of the genomic neighborhoods of human and fugu runt domain genes.

The 130 amino acid long runt domain is very highly conserved and is readily identifiable computationally. RD transcription factors are developmental regulators involved both in cell proliferation and differentiation, and their disruption usually leads to disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In humans, three different RD genes were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and named according to various schemes, currently standardized by the human gene symbols <italic>RUNX1</italic>, <italic>RUNX2 </italic>and <italic>RUNX3</italic>. RUNX genes have two promoters (P1 and P2, also called distal and proximal, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] separated by a long intron; the proximal promoter (P2) is always located within a large CpG island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Extensive alternative splicing giving rise to many isoforms has been described for all RUNX genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Orthologs of all three human <italic>RUNX </italic>genes were identified in mouse. A single RD gene was described in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, presumed to be orthologous to <italic>RUNX1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. An experimental search for RD genes in fugu showed the existence of a fugu ortholog of human <italic>RUNX2</italic>, and suggested the existence of a single additional RD gene in fugu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], while a computational search of the fugu genomic sequence revealed three <italic>RUNX </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Four RD genes were identified in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], while a single RD gene exists in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], sea urchin and amphioxus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Based on these data, current thought on the evolution of the RD gene family posits that a single RD gene was present in the common ancestor of chordates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and this ancestral gene triplicated during early vertebrate evolution, giving rise to the modern <italic>RUNX </italic>gene complement. The proposed mechanism of expansion involved large-scale genomic duplications, identifiable today as large paralogous segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The proper identification of true orthology relationships is often helpful for inferring gene function and translating knowledge between model organisms and more complex species. Under the current model, simple orthology relationships should be expected among vertebrate <italic>RUNX </italic>genes, but their functional relationship to the ancestral RD gene is unknown. The single known RD gene in <italic>C. elegans </italic>has been shown to be required for the formation of a functional gut; this role has been claimed to be conserved with mouse <italic>Runx3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The current availability of genome drafts for several vertebrate species, including <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, <italic>Canis familiaris</italic>, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>, <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio </italic>and <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>, allows us to explore a comprehensive set of vertebrate RD genes and characterize their genomic environments, shedding light on the structure and evolution of this important gene family.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The fugu genome has at least four runt domain genes</title><p>Our search for RD genes in the fugu draft yielded four distinct genomic scaffolds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), each containing a single, complete RD gene. Each scaffold had one or more sequence gaps, some within the RD genes, others between them and their neighbors. We employed a directed sequencing approach to obtain the additional sequence needed to close the gaps in these four scaffolds and to improve sequence quality.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The four fugu scaffolds analyzed and visualized using the GESTALT Workbench.

Three of the four RD genes found in the fugu genome have clear one-to-one similarity relationships with the three mammalian <italic>RUNX </italic>genes (see phylogenetic analysis below). They have been assumed to be their orthologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; we call them <italic>FrRUNX1</italic>, <italic>FrRUNX2 </italic>and <italic>FrRUNX3 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Their genomic structures are similar to those of their human counterparts, but their sizes have evolved differently. <italic>RUNX3 </italic>is the smallest of the three human RUNX genes, while in fugu <italic>FrRUNX3 </italic>is the largest (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), and <italic>FrRUNX2 </italic>is significantly larger than <italic>FrRUNX1</italic>. <italic>FrRUNX1 </italic>has acquired an additional intron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] that is not present in human <italic>RUNX1 </italic>or in any other RD gene. This intron is just 65 bp long, has canonical splice signals, and is in phase 0 with respect to the protein reading frame, at the beginning of the runt domain. An additional intron has been described at the 5' end of the coding region, yielding a short form that would be locally non-homologous to the other RD genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A detailed comparison of human <italic>RUNX2 </italic>and <italic>FrRUNX2 </italic>has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In both human and in fugu, <italic>RUNX3 </italic>has the highest G+C content of the RD genes, while the G+C content of <italic>RUNX2 </italic>differs significantly between the two species (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The fugu RUNT gene</title><p>In addition to the three <italic>RUNX </italic>genes, the fugu genome has a fourth and more divergent runt-domain gene, that we named <italic>FrRUNT</italic>. <italic>FrRUNT </italic>is an extremely compact gene, spanning just 3 kb of genomic sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Based on sequence analysis only, <italic>FrRUNT </italic>appears to have two promoters, with an intron separating the hypothetical distal promoter (P1) and first exon from the main body of the gene. This intron is usually very long in <italic>RUNX </italic>genes. It is indeed the longest intron observed in <italic>FrRUNT</italic>, but it is nevertheless very short, spanning just 1372 bp. There is a local concentration of CpG dinucleotides 200&#x02013;300 bp upstream of exon 2 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), suggesting that an incipient CpG island might function as a proximal promoter (P2). The G+C content is not elevated in this area, in similarity to the CpG islands of the fugu <italic>RUNX </italic>genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The main body of the gene is split into five exons, separated by much shorter introns (69&#x02013;190 bp long), all of which have canonical splice signals. The longest predicted FrRUNT product is 294 amino acids long, in contrast with the 496 aa, 463 aa and 421 aa observed for FrRUNX1, FrRUNX2 and FrRUNX3, respectively. The small number of exons in <italic>FrRUNT </italic>leaves little room for alternative splicing by exon skipping, without compromising functionally important domains of the protein. The overall compactness of the gene makes the incorporation of yet undetected exons improbable. Several cryptic splice sites within the exons could enable splicing variants altering exon length.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><italic>FrRUNT </italic>sequence detail, showing its compact organization and its interlocking with the <italic>SUPT3H </italic>gene. The two genes are disposed in opposite orientations. The inverted lettering for SUPT3H denotes translation from the reverse strand. The two putative promoters and the extent of the runt domain (RD) are indicated; x1&#x02013;x6 denote the six exons. The black triangle points at the asparagine residue absent from all previously known runt domain proteins.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2148-4-43-2"/></fig><p>FrRUNT is exceptional in that the length of the runt domain (131 residues) varies from the universally conserved 130 amino acids, due to the introduction of an asparagine residue after position 47 in the RD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This appears to be the first report of such a mutation within this highly conserved domain. We also noted that the RD sequence of the tunicate <italic>Oikopleura dioica </italic>(AAS21356 in GenBank) has an insertion at the same position (of two amino acids, a proline and an isoleucine). Comparison to the published structure of this domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] shows that this variable region is located in loop L4, opposite the DNA-binding region, i.e. in the location least likely to disrupt the structure of the protein.</p><p>A surprising observation is that <italic>FrRUNT </italic>is "interlocked" with <italic>FrSUPT3H </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the gene orthologous to the human transcription factor <italic>SUPT3H </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]: The first exon of <italic>FrRUNT </italic>is located within the first intron of <italic>FrSUPT3H</italic>, and vice-versa. In the human genome, though, <italic>SUPT3H </italic>is interlocked with <italic>RUNX2</italic>, as shown in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We discuss the puzzles posed by these differences in genomic organization below.</p></sec><sec><title>Four RD genes in Tetraodon and in zebrafish</title><p>A genome draft of another pufferfish species, <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>, has been released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A computational search into this draft reveals four RD genes with clear orthologous relationships with the four fugu RD genes. We call them <italic>TnRUNX1</italic>, <italic>TnRUNX2 </italic>and <italic>TnRUNX3</italic>, and <italic>TnRUNT </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The RD portion of TnRUNT has been deposited in the EMBL database (accession CAG00330); in this work we report the complete gene structure of <italic>TnRUNT</italic>, which is similar to that of <italic>FrRUNT</italic>. In further similarity with the fugu genomic organization, <italic>TnRUNT </italic>is "interlocked" with the Tetraodon ortholog of <italic>SUPT3H </italic>(not shown). The three <italic>RUNX </italic>gene pairs are conserved between fugu and Tetraodon (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and display a larger percentage of protein identity than nucleotide identity, indicating a prevalence of conservative substitutions. In contrast, TnRUNT is only 83.3% identical to FrRUNT at the protein level, less than their nucleotide identity. Indeed, a striking series of non-synonymous mutations has created a highly divergent segment (only eight identical amino acids out of twenty-two) including the N-terminus of the runt domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The strong and unexpected divergence is not the result of local low sequence quality, as tested by examining the relevant Tetraodon entries from the NCBI Trace Archive, and by resequencing the fugu gene. The differences between TnRUNT and FrRUNT do not modify the Ig-like &#x003b2;-sandwich core of the runt domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], which is highly conserved as expected. Therefore, the structural integrity of the runt domain appears not to be compromised. We can only speculate that the extensive variation in its N-terminus may reflect species-specific constraints.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>The four <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis </italic>RD genes, and their identity levels to their respective fugu orthologs.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" colspan="4">Tetraodon gene</td><td align="center" colspan="2">Identity</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Name</td><td align="center">Location</td><td align="center">Size</td><td align="center">%G+C</td><td align="center">Nucleotide</td><td align="center">Protein</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>TnRUNT</italic></td><td align="left">SCAF14597</td><td align="right">2.5</td><td align="right">42.3%</td><td align="right">87.5%</td><td align="right">83.3%</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>TnRUNX1</italic></td><td align="left">SCAF15084</td><td align="right">(*) 6.0</td><td align="right">44.1%</td><td align="right">93.3%</td><td align="right">97.0%</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>TnRUNX2</italic></td><td align="left">SCAF14590</td><td align="right">(*) 31.8</td><td align="right">44.4%</td><td align="right">96.4%</td><td align="right">99.4%</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>TnRUNX3</italic></td><td align="left">SCAF15009</td><td align="right">(*) 36.6</td><td align="right">45.3%</td><td align="right">94.6%</td><td align="right">98.1%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Sizes are expressed in kb.

In these incorrect topologies, the duplication event appears to be more ancient than supported by the data, which in turn suggest the existence of lineage-specific gene loss events. We tested our phylogenetic reconstruction using the program ASaturA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which identifies and suppresses saturated amino acids, thereby correcting the affected tree topology. This analysis did not modify the location of FrRUNT and TnRUNT in our reconstruction, suggesting that mutational saturation is not causing the observed divergence age of the pufferfish <italic>RUNT </italic>genes.</p><p>In this protein-level comparison of the conserved runt domains, the pufferfish RUNT proteins appear to be surprisingly ancient, predating the divergence between craniates (including vertebrates) and cephalochordates (including amphioxus). On the other hand, when comparing the nucleotide sequences of the first exon from each human and fugu runt domain gene, we observed that <italic>FrRUNT </italic>is more closely related to <italic>RUNX2 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, top right), suggesting the possibility of a recombination event between these genes (see discussion below).</p><p>We also studied the relationships between the RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3 orthologs in several vertebrates and found the species trees to be largely as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, bottom row). One of the two zebrafish RUNX2 protein sequences (RUNX2A) appeared to be slightly more closely related to tetrapod RUNX2 genes than to the other RUNX2 genes in fish species, including zebrafish RUNX2B (dashed branch in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, RUNX2 panel). We tested this result using ASaturA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and found it to be an artifact of mutational saturation: in the corrected tree (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), RUNX2A is more closely related to the other fish RUNX2 genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative genomics of runt domain genes</title><p>Four RD genes have been identified in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], more similar to each other than to the vertebrate <italic>RUNX </italic>genes: they represent an independent family expansion in insects. The four <italic>Drosophila </italic>RD genes are all linked on chromosome X. Moreover, three of these genes are clustered within a 150 kb region. There is no linkage of RD genes, however, in the human genome: each gene is on a different chromosome. Their genomic environments usually show some conservation: the three human <italic>RUNX </italic>genes are followed by <italic>CLIC </italic>genes in the complementary strand (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), and linked to members of the <italic>DSCR1 </italic>family. The RD genes appear not to be clustered in the fugu genome, though this conclusion is limited by the fragmentary nature of the current genome draft. All four fugu RD genes are flanked by at least one non-RD gene on each side. Fugu <italic>RUNX </italic>genes are followed by <italic>CLIC </italic>genes except for <italic>FrRUNX1</italic>, but a <italic>CLIC </italic>gene is located ~55 kb upstream of <italic>FrRUNX1 </italic>and in the same orientation. This organization could have arisen by an inversion event in the fugu lineage. To ensure a misassembly did not cause this apparent inversion, we performed a 3x shotgun sampling of the BAC clone OML73850, which spans the range 1&#x02013;97413 of scaffold 682. This quality control step failed to uncover any misassemblies, and confirmed the genomic organization observed in this fugu scaffold. <italic>FrRUNT </italic>does not appear to be linked to any <italic>CLIC </italic>gene, and no DSCR1 family members can be discerned near any of the fugu RD genes.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Comparative genomic organization.

Indeed, when comparing each of the genes neighboring fugu <italic>RUNX </italic>genes to the human genome, we find that their orthologs tend to be located in the corresponding human chromosome, e.g. most of the genes linked to <italic>FrRUNX3 </italic>have orthologs on human chromosome 1, where human <italic>RUNX3 </italic>resides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Some inversion events can be inferred, e.g. one involving the genes <italic>PHIP </italic>and <italic>IRAK1BP1 </italic>and another involving <italic>MUT</italic>. Gene order and orientation has changed, and intergenic distances have changed drastically, but the overall gene synteny is largely preserved, lending support to the assignments of orthology between the human and fugu <italic>RUNX </italic>gene pairs.</p><p>An exception to the conservation of synteny involves the genes <italic>CDC5L </italic>and <italic>SUPT3H</italic>, which in the human genome are found immediately upstream of <italic>RUNX2</italic>, but in fugu are instead located upstream of <italic>FrRUNT</italic>, including the first-exon interlocking with <italic>SUPT3H </italic>mentioned earlier. Evidence points at a larger duplication in fishes, encompassing at least <italic>CDC5L</italic>, <italic>SUPT3H</italic>, <italic>RUNX2</italic>, <italic>CLIC5</italic>, <italic>ENPP4 </italic>and <italic>ENPP5</italic>, followed by differential gene loss. One duplicate copy would have retained <italic>FrRUNX2</italic>, <italic>CLIC5 </italic>and <italic>ENPP5 </italic>(see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), while the other copy (currently represented by scaffolds 835 and 376) would have retained <italic>CDC5L</italic>, <italic>SUPT3H</italic>, a second RD gene, a second copy of <italic>CLIC5 </italic>(<italic>CLIC5L</italic>) and <italic>ENPP4</italic>. The presence of remnants of <italic>SUPT3H </italic>upstream of <italic>FrRUNX2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and of two copies of <italic>RUNX2 </italic>in zebrafish, lends further support to this hypothesis. Thus, comparative genomic analysis of human, fugu and zebrafish suggests that <italic>FrRUNT </italic>may be a derivative form of a duplicated <italic>RUNX2 </italic>gene. However, this contradicts the conclusions from phylogenetic analysis or the protein sequences; we discuss this contradiction below.</p></sec><sec><title>A new family of follistatin-like genes</title><p>We find several fugu genes for which no human ortholog can be discerned (green features in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), among them <italic>FrRUNT</italic>.

This suggests that <italic>FrFSTL6 </italic>was also lost in the tetrapod lineage. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the neighboring <italic>FrRUNT </italic>and <italic>FrFSTL6 </italic>genes were lost in a single deletion event.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have taken advantage of the availability of genomic drafts for several vertebrate species, including the finished human genome, to identify the orthologs of all currently known runt-domain (RD) genes, as well as a novel member of this small gene family. Both pufferfish species (<italic>Takifugu rubripes </italic>and <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>) have four RD genes; since these genomes are only available as draft assemblies, additional RD genes might be found when the finished genomic sequences are made available.</p><p>The function of the novel <italic>FrRUNT</italic>/<italic>TnRUNT </italic>gene is currently unknown. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, this novel gene appears to represent an ancestral form of the RD family in vertebrates, subsequently lost in the tetrapod lineage. It is therefore surprising that its gene structure, and not that of <italic>RUNX2 </italic>as in humans, is interlocked with the <italic>SUPT3H </italic>gene. Based on the comparative genomics analysis alone, one could hypothesize that <italic>FrRUNT </italic>is simply a derivative form of <italic>RUNX2</italic>, i.e. the ortholog of zebrafish <italic>RUNX2A</italic>. In this case, though, one would expect FrRUNT to be more similar to FrRUNX2 than it is to either FrRUNX1 or FrRUNX3, but in terms of amino acid sequence similarity, it appears to be equidistant from the three <italic>RUNX </italic>genes. This discrepancy might be explained by invoking accelerated evolution of the pufferfish RUNT genes, perhaps as a lineage-specific adaptation. Typically, nucleotide sequences diverge much faster than amino acid sequences, and the first exons of RD genes are significantly less conserved than the runt domain itself, on which we based our phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, we find it hard to sustain that, while the first exon of <italic>FrRUNT </italic>maintains its nucleotide similarity to the first exon of <italic>RUNX2</italic>, the amino acid sequence of the (normally highly conserved) runt domain itself has diverged at such an accelerated pace. Furthermore, we found this not to be an artifact of mutational saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A similar situation is observed for the neighboring <italic>FSTL6 </italic>gene: parsimony considerations could lead one to assume that <italic>FSTL6 </italic>is a fish-specific duplicate of <italic>FSTL1</italic>, though contradicting the phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolution of this gene family (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This situation could again be explained by assuming accelerated evolution of <italic>FSTL6</italic>, but we consider this to be a remarkable coincidence.</p><p>The conundrum is whether <italic>FrRUNT </italic>is an ancestral form, or is derived from <italic>RUNX2</italic>. Both hypotheses contradict part of the available data. We propose here a third hypothesis, in the form of an evolutionary history (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>): An ancestral RD gene duplicated in chordates, after divergence from sea urchin, which has a single RD gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. One of the two resulting RD genes became the <italic>RUNX </italic>family founder, which expanded by triplication, and one of the three <italic>RUNX </italic>genes (namely <italic>RUNX2</italic>) became interlocked with <italic>SUPT3H</italic>. After the teleost/tetrapod divergence, a regional duplication in teleosts created a second copy of <italic>RUNX2 </italic>and its neighboring genes. In the tetrapod lineage, the ancestral <italic>RUNT </italic>gene was lost, in conjunction with <italic>FSTL6</italic>. In the pufferfish lineage, the <italic>RUNT </italic>gene replaced most of <italic>RUNX2A</italic>, perhaps by recombination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This is supported by the clear similarity between the first exons of <italic>FrRUNT </italic>and <italic>RUNX2</italic>. The copy of <italic>SUPT3H </italic>interlocked with <italic>RUNX2B</italic>, apparently superfluous, is being lost by gradual degradation, and only small fragments of it remain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This scenario is compatible with all the data observed. While it posits a small number of additional evolutionary events, it does not involve highly improbable events like the accelerated evolution of a normally highly conserved protein structural domain. Interestingly, the first duplication event could correspond to the first round of vertebrate genome tetraploidization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A second round of tetraploidization in the ancestral vertebrate could have produced a set of four paralogous runt domain genes, and a hypothetical gene conversion event may have led to the current complement of three RUNX genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> inset). Conversion between paralogous copies of genes derived from tetraploidization events has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Hypothesis for the evolution of vertebrate RD genes.

Rather, these derivative genes coexisted with an additional <italic>RUNT </italic>gene and still do so in teleost genomes. The single known RD gene in amphioxus is more similar to the vertebrate <italic>RUNX </italic>genes than it is to <italic>FrRUNT</italic>. It is possible, therefore, that cephalochordates (including amphioxus) have a second RD gene, short and divergent enough to escape experimental detection by DNA hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Why was one of the ancestral RD genes lost in the tetrapod lineage? The three <italic>RUNX </italic>genes bind to the same DNA motif and modify the expression of target genes through recruitment of transcriptional modulators, which are also shared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]; functional differences between the three <italic>RUNX </italic>genes are attained by way of tightly regulated spatiotemporal expression patterns. We hypothesize that the ancestral <italic>RUNT </italic>gene became inessential to amniotes by functional reprogramming of the remaining three <italic>RUNX </italic>genes. Its loss would therefore represent an example of evolution by reduction in complexity. In pufferfishes, the hypothesized recombination event would have placed the <italic>RUNT </italic>gene under the regulatory control of the former <italic>RUNX2A </italic>promoter. The viability of such a sudden regulatory change would in turn suggest a significant level of functional redundancy among the RD genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We identified a fourth runt domain gene in the fugu genome, which appears to represent either a pufferfish-specific, fast-evolving derivative of <italic>RUNX2</italic>, or a direct descendant of the ancestral chordate <italic>RUNT </italic>gene. We find the latter hypothesis more reasonable. This novel gene evolved in parallel with the vertebrate <italic>RUNX </italic>genes, and while it has been preserved in pufferfishes, it appears to have been lost entirely in tetrapods. This suggests that the ancestral vertebrate was more complex than previously suspected.</p><p>By studying a very limited set of fugu genomic regions, namely the scaffolds related to RD genes, we have identified seven apparently functional fugu genes that are absent from the human genome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), and were probably lost early in tetrapod history. In the process of identifying relevant homologs for one of these genes (<italic>FrFSTL6</italic>), we have identified a new family of follistatin-like genes in the human genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the RD protein sequences led to results that contradict those derived from comparative genomics, but we showed that the two could be reconciled into a coherent evolutionary model. These results underscore the importance of obtaining complete genomic sequences of strongly divergent vertebrates, and the value to be derived by performing detailed and integrated analyses of their gene complements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Search for RD genes</title><p>We used the human RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3 proteins (SwissProt entries Q01196, Q13950 and Q13761, respectively) as queries in a TFASTY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] search into the <italic>Takifugu rubripes </italic>"assembly3" genome draft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] released after publication of the fugu genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These data have been provided freely by the Fugu Genome Consortium for use in this publication only. This search resulted in the unambiguous identification of four complete RD genes in scaffolds 183, 260, 682 and 835. Scaffold 25789 is nearly identical with range 115299&#x02013;115845 of scaffold 183, partially overlapping the last exon of <italic>FrRUNX3</italic>. No further evidence was found for an additional <italic>RUNX3 </italic>gene: we conclude that scaffold 25789 is an assembly artifact.

Cosmids (cloned in Lawrist4) were grown in LB media with kanamycin at 37 &#x000b0; C for 14 hrs, and DNA was prepared on the Autogen 740 DNA Isolation system in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. BACs (cloned in pBeloBAC 11) were similarly prepared by growing in media with chloramphenicol. Primers were designed in both directions, across all gaps. Oligonucleotide-directed sequencing from clones and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods were used to fill the gaps. PCR amplification was performed on spanning BAC/cosmid or genomic DNA of <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>, generously provided by Dr. Greg Elgar. PCR products were purified with sephacryl (Amersham Pharmacia) and sequenced directly using Applied Biosystems Big dye terminator kit reagents. Whenever necessary, additional pairs of primers were designed for oligonucleotide-directed sequencing to close gaps. Shotgun sequencing data was obtained from the BAC clone OML73850 (b193C08) for part of scaffold 682. OML73850 was fragmented by sonication, end-repaired and electrophoresed to select insert size of 2&#x02013;5 kb. Insert was ligated into pUC18 vector, transformed and plasmid DNA was made using Eppendorf &#x02013; 5 Prime PERFECTprep robot and sequenced from both ends. Assembly was carried out using Phrap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Analysis of the resulting sequence shows that OML73850 spans the first 97413 bp of scaffold 682, and links it to scaffold 4260. The additional sequence data generated in-house were combined with the consensus sequences of the scaffolds produced by the JGI WGS assembly v.3 for the purpose of producing a contiguous sequence for each scaffold.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic reconstruction</title><p>The sequences were aligned using ClustalW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Phylogenetic trees were built using the neighbor-joining algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and tested with 1000 rounds of bootstrapping. Graphics were produced with TreeView [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Since full-length protein sequences cannot be reliably aligned for extremely divergent RD genes, we used only the runt domain to reconstruct the relationship between the pufferfish RUNT, human RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3 (NP_00175, NP_033950 and NP_004341, respectively), ciona (<italic>C. intestinalis</italic>) RUNT, <italic>Oikopleura dioica </italic>RUNT (AAS21356), amphioxus (<italic>B. floridae</italic>) RUNT (AY146617), sea urchin <italic>S. purpuratus </italic>RUNT (NP_999779) and the four <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>RD sequences (NP_523424, NP_511099, NP_572693 and NP_608398). The tree was rooted using the <italic>C. elegans </italic>RUN protein (AB027412) as outgroup. We further excluded the first thirteen amino acids of the runt domain, to avoid the topological distortion expected in this region from the highly divergent pufferfish RUNT sequences. For the separate phylogenetic trees of the three RUNX genes, we used the complete protein sequences, with gap opening and extension penalties of 5 and 0.1, respectively. ASaturA analyses were performed using PAM250, Kimura's correction and a cutoff value of 9, with 1000 rounds of bootstrap. The first exons of human and fugu runt domain genes were compared at the nucleotide level. For each exon, we selected the range from 30 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon, to 15 downstream of the splicing donor site, i.e. 103 nucleotides for each <italic>RUNX </italic>gene and 94 nucleotides for <italic>FrRUNT</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GG conceived of the study, performed the bioinformatics analyses and prepared the manuscript.
