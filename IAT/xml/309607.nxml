Like c-fos, fra-2 was inducible by phorbol ester, cAMP and calcium ionophore, as well as serum. In all three cases, the induction of two species of fra-2 transcript (5.7 kb and 6.8 kb) was delayed and prolonged compared with that of c-fos mRNA. The size difference between the two transcripts was attributable to the heterogeneity of the 3'-end, probably reflecting utilization of different polyadenylation sites. The major transcriptional start point is located at 30 bp downstream of a TATA-like sequence. In the fra-2 promoter region, which is located in a typical CpG island, enhancer consensus sequences such as SCM, SRE, GC boxes and CRE-like sequences were detected upstream of the TATA-like sequence in the same order as that in the 5'-upstream region of the chicken c-fos gene. Fibroblast transfection studies with a series of promoter deletion constructs positioned upstream of bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase indicated, however, that SRE-like sequence is not the sole responsible element for the serum induction, and that a minimal fragment containing no SRE-like sequence is sufficient for this induction. Two typical AP-1 sequences are located between the major transcriptional initiation site and the coding sequence, and the binding activity of protein complexes to these sequences was induced by serum.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0176-a" xlink:role="2717"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0177-a" xlink:role="2718"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0178-a" xlink:role="2719"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0179-a" xlink:role="2720"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0179-b" xlink:role="2720"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2715"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2716"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0176.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2717"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2718"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2719"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2720"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2721"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
