In normal cells, Shh signaling is initiated by the binding of the Shh ligand to PTCH, which relieves PTCH-mediated repression of SMOH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hooper and Scott, 2005</xref>). In cells carrying a mutated <italic>PTCH1</italic> allele, SMOH signaling is inadequately repressed, leading to unrestrained activation of Gli1, a transcription factor and putative oncogene that is capable of inducing tumorigenesis in skin and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ruiz i Altaba et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the predisposition for spontaneous tumorigenesis in BCNS patients, these patients are also at highly increased risk of tumor development in areas exposed to ultraviolet or ionizing radiation (IR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gorlin, 1987</xref>).

After the appearance of a DSB, ATM activates Chk2 and triggers the nucleolytic processing of the DSB into extended regions of single stranded DNA (ssDNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jazayeri et al., 2006</xref>). ATR is then activated when the ssDNA is coated by replication protein A (RPA), which recruits ATR (in a complex with ATR-interacting protein ATRIP) and triggers the loading of the Rad9&#x02013;Hus1&#x02013;Rad1 (9-1-1) complex. The 9-1-1 complex then induces ATR-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the protein kinase Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zou, 2007</xref>) in a process that requires Claspin, an adaptor protein that is phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner. Once activated, Chk1 prevents cells from exiting G<sub>2</sub>, regulates DNA repair, stabilizes stalled replication forks, and triggers the S-phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartek and Lukas, 2003</xref>).

Consistent with this hypothesis, Gli1 expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells suppressed IR-induced Chk1 Ser<sup>317</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) and Ser<sup>345</sup> (Fig. S1 B) phosphorylation as well as the Chk1-dependent degradation of Cdc25A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). To rule out that this effect on Chk1 phosphorylation was the result of a Gli1-mediated disruption of the cell cycle, we analyzed the cell cycle profile of vector-transfected and Gli1-expressing cells.

Similar to what was observed in <italic>Ptc1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> cerebella, Gli1 expression in HEK293 cells did not block the IR-induced phosphorylation of two ATM substrates, Chk2 and SMC1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), thus demonstrating that Gli1 selectively blocks the ATR&#x02013;Chk1 but not the ATM&#x02013;Chk2 pathway. Notably, a Gli1 mutant (Gli1<sup>&#x00394;ZFD</sup>) lacking the five zinc finger DNA-binding domains did not activate a Gli1-dependent promoter (not depicted) and did not suppress IR-induced Chk1 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), suggesting that Gli1 mediates its effect via transcription.</p><p>Although our results demonstrated that ATM phosphorylation of Chk2 and SMC1 was not compromised in Gli1-expressing cells, it was possible that Gli1 prevented ATM from generating the ssDNA intermediates that activate ATR. To address whether Gli1 affected the pathway upstream or downstream of ATR, we treated Gli1-expressing HEK293 cells with hydroxyurea, an agent that blocks DNA replication and induces ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation that, unlike IR, does not require ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feijoo et al., 2001</xref>). As was observed with IR, hydroxyurea-induced Chk1 phosphorylation was attenuated by Gli1 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

One of the first events in the pathway is the recruitment of the 9-1-1 complex to chromatin. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, Gli1 did not affect the expression of Hus1, Rad1, and Rad9, the proteins that assemble into the 9-1-1 clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Volkmer and Karnitz, 1999</xref>), nor did it affect the expression of Rad17, the clamp loader for the 9-1-1 clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zou, 2007</xref>). Consistent with these findings, Gli1 did not block the IR-induced binding of Rad9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>), a readout for the loading of the 9-1-1 complex at sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burtelow et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zou et al., 2002</xref>). Further examination of the ATR&#x02013;Chk1 signaling pathway revealed that Gli1 expression also did not affect the levels of ATR or TopBP1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), nor did Gli1 block the IR-induced phosphorylation of RPA32 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), another ATR substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olson et al., 2006</xref>).

Given these similar effects, we asked how Gli1 expression affected Claspin.

To further probe the effect of Gli1 on Claspin, we also assessed the impact of Gli1 expression on the DNA damage&#x02013;induced interaction between Claspin and Chk1, an interaction that is critical for ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, we found that the IR-induced binding of Chk1 to Claspin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>) was abolished by Gli1, suggesting that this transcription factor specifically disrupts the ability of Claspin to inducibly bind Chk1.</p></sec><sec><title>The Chk1-dependent activation of the S-phase checkpoint is disrupted by Gli1</title><p>To show the functional significance of Gli1-mediated disruption of Chk1 signaling, we examined activation of the S-phase checkpoint, a Chk1-dependent transient inhibition of DNA synthesis that is detected as a reduction in [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation into replicating DNA after IR treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Sanchez, 2004</xref>).

Irradiated mouse fibroblasts isolated from <italic>Ptc1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> embryos demonstrated reduced survival in clonogenic assays compared with wild-type fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Similarly, transient expression of full-length Gli1 but not the zinc finger mutant Gli1<sup>&#x00394;ZFD</sup> decreased clonogenic survival in irradiated HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that hyperactivation of the Shh pathway in mouse brains and HEK293 cells diminishes Chk1 phosphorylation and disrupts downstream cellular events that are dependent on Chk1.</p></sec><sec><title>Gli1 expression enhances IR-induced chromosome aberrations</title><p>Cells from BCNS patients show increased rates of IR-induced chromosome aberrations after radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Featherstone et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">el-Zein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shafei-Benaissa et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">1998</xref>). Similarly, disabling the ATR&#x02013;Chk1 pathway at the level of Rad17, Rad9, ATR, or Chk1 leads to genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weiss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Syljuasen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Durkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pandita et al., 2006</xref>). Because Shh signaling disrupts IR-induced Chk1 phosphorylation, we reasoned that Shh pathway activation might also affect the accumulation of IR-induced chromosome aberrations. To test this hypothesis, we expressed exogenous Gli1 in HEK293 cells. As a control, we also depleted Chk1 with siRNA. 24 h after irradiation, we analyzed the chromosomal aberrations by scoring for chromosome type, chromatid type, and other (dicentrics, rings, anaphase bridges, and pulverized chromosomes) aberrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Overall, there were large increases in all types of IR-induced aberrations in cells expressing Gli1 or depleted of Chk1 compared with control irradiated cells. Notably, however, when broken down by aberration type, both Gli1 expression as well as Chk1 depletion skewed the distribution of chromatid- versus chromosome-type aberrations so that chromatid-type aberrations became the dominant type of lesion when Chk1 signaling was attenuated by Gli1 expression or Chk1 depletion. Because chromatid breaks occur when cells are irradiated during S and G2, the results agree with previous studies showing that the ATR&#x02013;Chk1 pathway is particularly important during these phases of the cell cycle, perhaps because ATR and Chk1 participate in the repair of DSBs by homologous recombination, a repair pathway that is particularly important during S and G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petermann and Caldecott, 2006</xref>). Consistent with previously published findings, which showed that various components of the Chk1 pathway contribute to genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weiss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Syljuasen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Durkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pandita et al., 2006</xref>), the present results demonstrate that hyperactivation of the Shh pathway contributes to genomic instability by attenuating Chk1 activation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Gli1 expression increases genomic instability.</bold> (A) HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (EV), the EGFP-Gli1 expression vector, or luciferase (Luc) siRNA or Chk1 siRNAs (insets above graph).

We then show that expression of Gli1 in HEK293 cells phenocopies the reduced IR-induced Chk1 phosphorylation that was observed in irradiated <italic>Ptc1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse cerebella. Finally, we demonstrate that Gli1 disrupts the ATR&#x02013;Chk1 pathway at the level of the IR-inducible interaction of Claspin and Chk1, and we show that this disruption in Chk1 activation leads to S-phase checkpoint defects and increases the accumulation of IR-induced chromosome aberrations. These results therefore suggest that Shh pathway activation may contribute to medulloblastoma formation by attenuating the activation of a checkpoint that is important for maintaining genomic stability and that acts as a barrier to tumorigenesis. Moreover, given that the Shh pathway is implicated in the development of a wide range of human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacob and Lum, 2007</xref>), these results raise the intriguing possibility that aberrant Shh signaling promotes tumorigenesis by attenuating Chk1 signaling and increasing genomic instability in other human tumors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The mouse <italic>Gli1</italic> coding sequence was amplified by PCR and cloned into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) to create an EGFP-Gli1 expression vector.
