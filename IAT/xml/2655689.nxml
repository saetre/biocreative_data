An alternate promoter of the human <italic>ATF3</italic> gene (designated P1 in this study) has recently been reported, which is located &#x0223c;43.5 kb upstream of the previously reported P2 promoter. We showed here that the P1 promoter is highly conserved between human and mouse and is functional in response to various stimuli, whereas the P1 promoter was dominantly induced by serum and the P2 promoter was more efficiently activated in response to TGF-&#x003b2; and oncogenic <italic>HRAS</italic>. The P1 promoter contains multiple transcriptional start sites, and the different 5&#x02032;-UTRs markedly affected their translation in response to stress. In human prostate and Hodgkin Reed&#x02013;Sternberg cancer cells with elevated expression of ATF3, the P1 promoter was constitutively activated and its chromatin structure was modified into active configuration. The differential usage of alternate promoters of the <italic>ATF3</italic> gene at both transcriptional and translational level and the modification of chromatin structure may provide a novel mechanism for expressing <italic>ATF3</italic> in determining cell fate during stress response and cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>An increasing number of studies demonstrate the existence of alternate promoters for human genes and their differential usage is one of important source for generating protein and regulatory diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). For example, transcripts from alternate promoters are translated into distinct protein isoforms when their variant 5&#x02032; exons contain alternative ATGs, producing proteins with different N-termini or different proteins. For many genes with multiple promoters, however, no variation in the resulting proteins is generated, when a common downstream exon contains the translation initiation site and generates the same open reading frame (ORF). Some of these alternate promoters have different tissue specificity and developmental activity, such as the <italic>CYP19</italic> gene encoding the aromatase P450 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) or glucokinase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Furthermore, mRNA variants transcribed from the alternate promoter cause difference of their translational efficiencies, since the variant 5&#x02032;-UTRs regulate their secondary structure of mRNAs, thus affecting its stability and translation. The usage of alternate promoters of genes has also been reported to play role in stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>).</p><p>Activating transcription factor (ATF) 3 is a member of the ATF/CREB family of basic-leucine zipper (b-Zip) type transcription factors. Its mRNA level is low or undetectable in most cells, but is greatly induced by a variety of stress signal (9&#x02013;11, and references therein). This response has dual effects on cell fate, such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">10&#x02013;14</xref>), or cell survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">15&#x02013;21</xref>). We have recently reported that <italic>ATF3</italic> is induced downstream of c-myc in serum induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and other laboratories showed that the <italic>ATF3</italic> expression is elevated in human prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and Hodgkin Reed&#x02013;Sternberg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and more recently in human breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Furthermore, transgenic over-expression of <italic>ATF3</italic> in basal epithelial cells causes basal cell carcinoma in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). ATF3 also plays role as a negative regulator of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29">27&#x02013;29</xref>). These data support both physiological and pathological role of <italic>ATF3</italic> in regulating the stress response of cells to external stimuli.</p><p>The human <italic>ATF3</italic> gene is mapped to chromosome 1q32.3 region, and is comprised of five exons spanning &#x0223c;16 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The putative gene promoter, designated P2 in this study, contains a TATA motif and many <italic>cis</italic>-elements for binding of transcription factors responsible for the regulated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32 B33 B34">30&#x02013;34</xref>). More recently, a large scale and genome-wide analysis of 5&#x02032;-end sequence of full-length cDNAs has identified a novel upstream alternate promoter of the human <italic>ATF3</italic> gene as deposited in Genbank (NM001030287) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We also identified the transcripts in human and mouse cells that contain various novel 5&#x02032;-UTR (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank with accession numbers AB291910, AB291911 and AB291912), but their functional and biological significance remains elusive.</p><p>In this report, we investigated the molecular and functional properties of a novel upstream promoter, designated P1, of the human <italic>ATF3</italic> gene. It is shown that the P1 promoter is highly conserved between human and mouse and is differentially used at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional level in stress response. More strikingly, the P1 promoter is constitutively activated in human cancer cells with elevated expression of ATF3. This study for the first time describes evidence for the differential usage of alternate promoters of the human <italic>ATF3</italic> gene, providing a novel insight into the molecular mechanism by which <italic>ATF3</italic> is induced in stress response and cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids, antibodies and reagents</title><p>Plasmids encoding human <italic>HRAS</italic> wild-type and oncogenic mutant 12V were purchased from Addgene, and expression plasmids for oncogenic Ras 61L mutant and HA-Suv39 were gifts from Dr Nevins and Dr Jenuwein, respectively.

In contrast, the P1 transcript was significantly induced by serum, whereas the induction of P2 transcript was more rapid but decreased earlier than the P1 transcript. To clarify the involvement of each promoter, we knocked down the P1 or P2 transcript by RNA interference-mediated gene silencing. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, the knockdown of the P1 or P2 transcript partially suppressed the induction of ATF3 protein in response to MMS, demonstrating the contribution of both promoters. In contrast, in serum-stimulated cells, only the knockdown of the P1 transcript significantly reduced the ATF3 induction, clearly defining the direct contribution of the P1 promoter in serum induction. Next, we addressed if the P1 and P2 transcripts were induced by other stimuli. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C showed that both transcripts were induced by etoposide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, doxorubicin, thapsigargin and tunicamycin.

The P1 promoter is used differently from the P2 promoter at the transcriptional and translational level in stress response. Moreover, it is constitutively activated in human cancer cells associated with the active chromatin configuration, as a consequence, followed by the elevated expression of ATF3.</p><p>Kimura <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) reported that at least 52% of the human genes contain putative alternative promoters, with 3.1 alternative promoters per gene on average, and the genes subject to regulation by alternative promoters are enriched in those encoding signal transduction-related proteins. Indeed, the <italic>ATF3</italic> gene encodes a transcription factor that is induced and plays role in various stress response and signaling. The P1 promoter of the <italic>ATF3</italic> gene was highly conserved between human and mouse, which localizes &#x0223c;43.5-kb and &#x0223c;34.5- kb upstream of the previously reported canonical promoter P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), respectively. The P1 promoter has several properties that are conserved between human and mouse. (i) Sequence of the promoter region as well as the junction of exon A-1 and B are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and 2B). The putative TATA motif is localized &#x0223c;30 base upstream from the major TSS, and other binding motifs for AP1, ATF/CREB, NF-kB, E2F, or p53 are conserved. (ii) Multiple TSSs are present in the human and mouse genes. (iii) The P1 promoter has less stretch of CG dinucleotides, whereas the P2 promoter contains at least three CpG islands within the 2-kb region of the promoter. This structural difference between the P1 and P2 promoters is of intrigue, because there is one CpG-island-containing promoter per 2.6 CpG-less alternate promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Overall, the structural properties of the P1 promoter strongly support that it is evolutionally conserved between human and mouse, and has distinct control mechanism.</p><p>The P1 promoter of the ATF3 gene in human cells was activated by various stimuli including serum, DNA damage and oxidoreductive stress, and the extent of the P1 promoter activation was comparable to or exceeded that of the P2 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the P1 promoter contains several motifs for transcription factors involved in the signaling of stress stimuli, including the binding motifs for ATF/CRE, AP1, NF-kB, E2F, c-Myc or p53. Whereas the significance and implication of these motifs in each stress response was not addressed in this report, it is also possible that a common motif(s) in the <italic>ATF3</italic> gene locus confers stress response on both the P1 and P2 promoters. This is an important issue and must await further study.</p><p>Various 5&#x02032;-UTRs of the P1 transcripts contain the features of poorly translated mRNA, that is relatively long 5&#x02032;-UTR with multiple upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and upstream ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>B and 4A). These features are often found in mRNAs encoding regulatory proteins like proto-oncogenes or growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), consistent with biological role of the <italic>ATF3 gene</italic>. In our translational reporter assay, however, sequential mutations of uAUGs in the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the P1 transcrips had no significant effect on their translation (data not shown). The assay revealed the presence of the inhibitory region in the longest 5&#x02032;-UTR as well as the stimulatory element(s) in the shorter 5&#x02032;-UTRs, implicating a role of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor(s) interacting with these element(s) in the 5&#x02032;-UTR in stress response. The identification of such factor(s) and the corresponding <italic>cis</italic>-element(s) is an important issue of further study. It should be noted that the present study employed the reporters containing only the different 5&#x02032;-UTRs, since the P1 and P2 transcripts have the common sequence from the coding through the 3&#x02032;-UTR (NM_001030287 and NM_001674). However, it is possible that the 3&#x02032;-UTR may contribute to the regulation, since 3&#x02032;-UTR is well known to affect the translational efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic>. More importantly, the 5&#x02032;-RACE analysis revealed the differential usage of TSSs in MMS- and serum-treated cells. Thus, it is highly likely that the selection or shift of the TSSs within the P1 promoter also regulates the efficiency of translation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Early studies showed that the ATF3 induction correlates with cell-detrimental outcome such as cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, thus providing an idea that it is death factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12">9&#x02013;12</xref>). However, ATF3 is also implicated in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25 B26">23&#x02013;26</xref>). Our present study demonstrated for the first time that the P1 promoter is constitutively activated in human cancer cells with the elevated expression of ATF3 protein. In LNcaP and Hodgkin cancer cells, the chromatin structure of the P1 promoter region is remodeled and fixed to an active open state through the histone modification, including histone H3 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, the serum response of the P2 promoter was more rapid but suppressed earlier than the P1 promoter. It is speculated that the P2 promoter responds to serum, but is suppressed by the transcription from the upstream promoter P1 through a mechanism called delayed transcriptional interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), while it is also possible that the splicing of the transcripts is differently regulated. At this moment, however, it is not known to what extent these mechanisms could be applied to constitutive activation of the P1 promoter in LNCaP and Hodgkin cancer cells. It is also unlikely that <italic>cis</italic>-element(s) of the promoter responsible for serum response is the only mechanism by which the P1 promoter is constitutively activated in cancer cells, since the P2 promoter is induced by serum in rat fibroblasts via ATF/CRE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and the reporter activity driven by the P2 promoter was activated by serum as efficiently as the P1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D).</p><p>In conclusion, the present study for the first time described the molecular and functional properties of the upstream alternate promoter P1 of the stress response gene <italic>ATF3</italic>. Of intrigue, the expression from the P1 promoter is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels, and is constitutively activated with altered chromatin structure in human cancer cells. The differential usage and regulation of the alternate promoters of the human <italic>ATF3</italic> gene adds an important dimension to the control mechanism by which it plays dual role in determining cell fate during stress response and oncogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1082/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Research on Priority Areas from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan [18012015, 18055008] to S.K. in part.
