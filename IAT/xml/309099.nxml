Except for Oct-1, all Oct factors are expressed in a temporally and spatially restricted mode during murine development and their number varies in a given cell type. Despite its ubiquitous expression pattern Oct-1 may play a role in murine development. As a first step towards elucidating the role of Oct-1 we report the complementary DNA cloning of the mouse Oct-1 gene. Two large transcripts of 5 and 14 kb are derived from a single gene. The expression patterns of three splicing products of Oct-1 are similar in a number of cells and tissues. In the POU region murine Oct-1 differs in four amino acids from the human homologue and these differences are restricted to helices 1 and 2. Interestingly, two of the four variant amino acids are identical to those in human and mouse Oct-2 and thus the murine Oct-1 homeodomain is intermediary in sequence between human Oct-1 and Oct-2. These two amino acids together with a third one have been shown to be relevant for the interaction between human Oct-1 and herpes simplex virus transactivator VP16. Nevertheless, VP16 interacts albeit weakly with murine Oct-1. We speculate that the differences in the human and mouse Oct-1 homeodomains reflect host-specific differences in protein-protein interactions.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0075-a" xlink:role="246"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0076-a" xlink:role="247"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0076-b" xlink:role="247"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0079-a" xlink:role="250"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0074.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="245"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0075.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="246"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0076.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="247"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0077.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="248"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0078.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="249"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="250"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="251"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00051-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="252"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
