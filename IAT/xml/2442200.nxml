GCRs include translocations, deletions of chromosome arms, interstitial deletions, inversions, amplifications, chromosome end-to-end fusions, and aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kolodner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lengauer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teixeira and Heim, 2005</xref>). Chromosomes from cells carrying mutations in cancer susceptibility genes showed a large number of GCRs, which suggests that GCRs could be a means to achieve the multiple mutations necessary for carcinogenesis. GCR suppression studies using yeast as a model organism have demonstrated that multiple pathways cooperate to suppress GCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Myung et al., 2001c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kolodner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Motegi and Myung, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Homologous recombination (HR) is thought to be a vital pathway for suppressing GCR because it plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Myung et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kolodner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Symington, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to a GCR suppression role, detailed genetic studies of HR and GCRs have revealed that the restrained recruitment of HR proteins can promote GCR formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Myung et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Motegi et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, there should be mechanisms that determine when HR proteins participate in appropriate DNA repair and when they are involved in the misrepair (i.e., GCR formation). DNA helicases may be involved in such mechanisms.</p><p>DNA helicases/translocases melt DNA duplexes and remove proteins from DNA during DNA replication, HR, and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Opresko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheok et al., 2005</xref>). DNA helicase/translocase dysfunction is frequently associated with chromosome instability and carcinogenesis. For example, cancer-prone diseases such as Bloom, Werner, and Rothmund-Thompson syndromes are caused by mutations in BLM, WRN, and RTS helicases, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Opresko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheok et al., 2005</xref>). Their yeast homologue, Sgs1p, suppresses GCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Myung et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>). The yeast Pif1 helicase assists in telomere maintenance and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schulz and Zakian, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ivessa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Budd et al., 2006</xref>) and suppresses GCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Myung et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schulz and Zakian, 1994</xref>). The yeast Srs2p helicase suppresses Rad51p<italic>-</italic>dependent HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Opresko et al., 2004</xref>) and promotes general GCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Motegi et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, mutations in FANCM and BACH1 (also known as BRIP1) helicases are the cause of cancer prone phenotypes of Fanconi anemia (FA) group M and J patients, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kennedy and D'Andrea, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levran et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meetei et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mosedale et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>FA is a genomic instability disorder, clinically characterized by congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and a predisposition to malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kennedy and D'Andrea, 2005</xref>). The FA core complex consists of 13 proteins participating in the DNA damage response network with BRCA1 and BRCA2. FANCM, a newly identified component of this complex, is structurally similar to the Archaeal bacterial protein Hef, which may process stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Komori et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Mph1p is a putative <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> homologue of FANCM and has been implicated in an HR-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schurer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Onge et al., 2007</xref>). Mph1p has single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase, DEAH, and 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; DNA helicase motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prakash et al., 2005</xref>). Mutation in <italic>MPH1</italic> increases the forward mutation rate at the <italic>CAN1</italic> locus and enhances the reversion of <italic>trp1-289</italic> harboring an amber mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scheller et al., 2000</xref>). The <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> strain is sensitive to various DNA-damaging agents including methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, and camptothecin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scheller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schurer et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> mutation does not impair mitotic heteroallelic recombination. Nevertheless, it elevates spontaneous allelic recombination frequency in a strain carrying a mutation in another helicase gene, <italic>SGS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schurer et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, a genome-wide genetic interaction study suggested that Mph1p could function in HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Onge et al., 2007</xref>). However, more work is clearly needed to better define Mph1's role in DNA repair.</p><p>Cancers are often accompanied by overexpression of multiple oncogenes. Despite many studies identifying pathways that suppress GCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kolodner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Motegi and Myung, 2007</xref>), little is known about activation mutations that enhance GCRs. To discover proteins that enhance GCR when overexpressed, we screened a yeast overexpression library and found Mph1p. Mph1p enhanced GCR rates &#x0223c;4,800-fold when overexpressed compared with the normal level of expression. Interestingly, the high levels of Mph1p enhanced GCR formation through the partial inhibition of the Rad52p-dependent HR. GCRs caused by excess Mph1p are dependent on the interaction of Mph1p with replication protein A (RPA). Consistently, excess Mph1p increased RPA accumulation at double strand breaks (DSBs). In contrast, the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> mutation caused reduction of spontaneous GCR and RPA foci formation. In addition, the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> mutation enhanced MMS sensitivity synergistically with the <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> mutation, which suggests that like Srs2p, Mph1p may function at the level of suppressing damage-induced Rad52p-dependent HR. Collectively, these results suggest that Mph1p promotes GCR formation by partially suppressing HR through its interaction with RPA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mph1 promotes GCR</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromosome V GCR assay has been extensively used to identify genes that suppress GCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kolodner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Motegi and Myung, 2007</xref>). In contrast, only a small number of genes have been identified as genes promoting GCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Myung et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lengronne and Schwob, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tanaka and Diffley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>). To find genes that promote GCR formation, we transformed a <italic>pif1&#x00394;</italic> strain (RDKY4399) with yeast 2&#x003bc; genomic DNA libraries and monitored GCRs of individual transformants by replica patch testing. We used the <italic>pif1&#x00394;</italic> strain to improve the sensitivity of the screening because the <italic>pif1&#x00394;</italic> mutation synergistically increases GCR rates when it is combined with almost all known mutations enhancing GCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Myung et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Approximately 1,200 individual colonies were patched as 1 &#x000d7; 1 cm squares, in duplicate. Because the mean insert size of this library is &#x0223c;10 kb, this number covers &#x0223c;64% of yeast genes according to the Clarke and Carbon formula, which calculates the probability of genome coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarke and Carbon, 1976</xref>). We selected 52 putative clones and retested each of them with six additional patches from the original plates. Plasmids from 21 clones still producing higher GCRs were recovered and amplified in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> before being transformed back into yeast. 13 clones that reproducibly enhanced GCR after retransformation were selected, and both ends of the insert from each plasmid were sequenced.</p><p>The clone that yielded the highest GCR enhancement carried a plasmid with <italic>SGN1</italic>, <italic>MPH1</italic>, and two hypothetical open reading frames, <italic>YIL001w</italic> and <italic>YIR003w</italic>, as an insert. Sgn1p functions in RNA translation and is unlikely to be linked to GCR formation. Thus, we hypothesized that the GCR enhancement caused by this plasmid was caused by excess Mph1p. To test this hypothesis, we subcloned the full-length <italic>MPH1</italic> gene into the multi-copy 2&#x003bc; plasmid p42K-TEF, which expressed <italic>MPH1</italic> from a strong TEF promoter. Mph1p overexpression increased GCR rates nearly 5,000-fold in the wild-type strain (RDKY3615) compared with the vector control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711146/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711146/DC1</ext-link>). Rearrangement structures from 20 independent clones carrying independent GCRs were all broken chromosomes healed by de novo telomere addition requiring telomerase. Consistent with this result, the inactivation of the telomerase RNA subunit <italic>TLC1</italic> completely abolished Mph1p-induced GCRs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Table S1).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>A high level of Mph1p enhances GCR.</bold> (A) GCR formation caused by excess Mph1p depends on telomerase activity.

To evaluate the effects of HR and NHEJ on GCRs induced by excess Mph1p, <italic>MPH1</italic> was overexpressed in strains defective in either HR (<italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic>) or NHEJ (<italic>dnl4&#x00394;</italic>), and GCR rates were monitored. In contrast to similar enhancement of GCRs in the <italic>dnl4&#x00394;</italic> strain, excess Mph1p doubled GCRs in the <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic> strain compared with the wild type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Table S1). Mutations in other HR genes including <italic>RAD52</italic>, <italic>RAD59</italic>, and <italic>MRE11</italic> or the <italic>rfa1-t11</italic> mutation similarly enhanced GCRs when Mph1p was overexpressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and Table S1). Types of GCRs were determined in a total of 72 clones: 16 from <italic>mre11&#x00394;</italic>, 21 from <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic>, 17 from <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic>, and 18 from <italic>rad59&#x00394;</italic>. All clones had broken chromosomes healed by de novo telomere addition. Because inactivation of NHEJ did not reduce GCRs caused by excess Mph1p, and inactivation of HR even enhanced GCRs caused by excess Mph1p, neither NHEJ nor HR promote GCRs when Mph1p is overexpressed. Although loss of one NHEJ factor yKu70p reduced Mph1p-induced GCRs by half (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Table S1), this reduction likely reflects an inefficient recruitment of telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Myung et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2006</xref>) rather than loss of the NHEJ function by the <italic>yku70&#x00394;</italic> mutation.</p><p>Interestingly, GCRs were further enhanced when Mph1p was overexpressed in HR-deficient strains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and Table S1). This result indicates that HR may suppress GCRs caused by excess Mph1p. We thus hypothesized that Mph1p-mediated GCRs arise after partial suppression of HR accompanied by simultaneous activation of a GCR pathway by Mph1. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of excess Mph1p on the mating type switch recombination in a strain expressing <italic>HO</italic> endonuclease under a galactose-inducible promoter and the intact donor sequence. We found that excess Mph1p substantially reduced the yeast mating type switch recombination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Furthermore, spontaneous HR between inverted repeats was reduced when Mph1p was overexpressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Detailed analysis of recombination events indicates that there were no significant differences in rates of single strand annealing or short-track gene conversion events; however, a significant decrease in large-track gene conversion with crossover events was observed (Table S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711146/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711146/DC1</ext-link>). Recently, the in vitro branch migration activity of FANCM, a mammalian putative Mph1p homologue, was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gari et al., 2008</xref>). Because the branch migration activity reduces crossover, both Mph1p and FANCM could have similar activity for genomic stability. Previous studies described that excess Rad52p can partially offset HR deficiency in certain mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Firmenich et al., 1995</xref>). We thus measured GCR rates when Rad52p and Mph1p were simultaneously overexpressed. Rad52p overexpression completely abolished the GCR enhancement caused by excess Mph1p (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The expression level of Mph1p was not affected by cooverexpression of Rad52p (unpublished data). Together, these results indicate that excess Mph1p partially compromises both DSB-induced and spontaneous HR. In further support of this idea, we observed slightly enhanced sensitivity of Mph1p-overexpressing cells to both &#x003b3;-ray irradiation and MMS; we also observed the synergistic increase of sensitivity to MMS in the NHEJ-deficient <italic>dnl4&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Excess Mph1p down-regulates HR.</bold> (A) High expression of Mph1p reduced mating type switching frequency using JKM161 with different plasmids (<italic>&#x00394;ho HMLalpha MATa &#x00394;hmr:;ADE1 ade1-100 leu2-3</italic>,<italic>112 lys5 trp1&#x02237;hisg ura3-52 ade3&#x02237;GAL-HO endonuclease his-</italic>).

Excess Mph1p delayed Rad51p recruitment to the DSB, which implies that Mph1p indeed inhibits HR before or at the step of Rad51p filament formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>).</p><p>The Srs2p helicase removes Rad51p from single-stranded DNA to suppress HR repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>).

We hypothesized that this interaction might be at the level of RPA, which helps mediate the switch to HR. To test this hypothesis, epitope-tagged Rad51p, Rad52p, or RPA were monitored for their ability to interact with Flag-tagged Mph1p. The immunoprecipitated Flag-Mph1p coprecipitated RPA but did not pull down either Rad51p or Rad52p (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, top; and not depicted). Additionally, in the reverse immunoprecipitation, RPA-GFP pulled down Flag-Mph1p (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, bottom). Mph1-C&#x00394; protein did not interact with RPA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), which suggests that the loss of the C terminus disrupted the interaction between RPA and Mph1. Thus, GCRs enhanced by excess Mph1p may be caused by a physical interaction between Mph1's C terminus and RPA. This interaction could compromise the role of RPA in DNA repair.</p><p>The reduction of Mph1p-induced GCRs by Rad52p overexpression could be caused by its competition with Mph1p for RPA interaction. To test this, we examined interactions under competitive conditions. The Mph1p&#x02013;RPA interaction was not perturbed when Rad52p was overexpressed (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711146/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711146/DC1</ext-link>). In addition, MMS-induced Rad52p foci were not affected by either Mph1p or Mph1-&#x00394;C overexpression (Fig. S1 B). Therefore, the reduction of Mph1p-induced GCRs by Rad52p overexpression is not caused by a direct competition with Mph1p for RPA interaction.</p><p>DNA damage during DNA replication produces long RPA-coated single-stranded DNA that is visualized as foci in the nucleus. The interaction between Mph1p and RPA suggests that Mph1p could affect loading and/or stabilizing RPA on single-stranded DNA. To address this question, RPA foci formation was monitored in the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> strain expressing GFP-tagged Rpa1p. Even though we found no noticeable change in any phases of the cell cycle (not depicted), the number of cells with spontaneous RPA foci was significantly reduced in the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Reintroduction of Mph1 via a single copy expression vector recovered RPA foci formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>, <italic>mph1</italic> &#x0002b; pMph1). Therefore, it is likely that Mph1p stabilizes RPA foci formation. Alternatively, fewer cells with RPA foci in <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> could be caused by faster RPA turnover by efficient HR. Contrary to this idea, the loss of Rad51p did not restore the RPA foci levels in the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>), and there was no noticeable change in HR rate in the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> strain (not depicted).</p><p>Slow recruitment of Rad51p to DSBs by excess Mph1p (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>) and fewer cells with RPA foci in the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>) suggest that Mph1p could stabilize RPA at DNA damage. To test this hypothesis, RPA accumulation at DSB was monitored by ChIP with &#x003b1;-RPA antibody. Consistently, excess Mph1p enhanced the accumulation of RPA at DSB compared with controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). In contrast, excess Mph1-C&#x00394; could not enhance the accumulation of RPA. Lastly, we tested whether Mph1p is recruited to DSBs to stabilize RPA. ChIP analysis with an &#x003b1;-HA antibody that recognizes the tag of Mph1p demonstrated the enrichment of Mph1p, but not Mph1-C&#x00394;, at the DSB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Therefore, Mph1p seems to interact with and stabilize RPA at the site of DNA damage.</p><p>To determine whether there is any genetic interaction between <italic>MPH1</italic> and <italic>RPA</italic>, the effect of <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> was examined when one of three MMS-sensitive alleles of the Rpa1 subunit of RPA (encoded by <italic>RFA1</italic>) were expressed (Figs.

The <italic>rfa1-t48</italic> mutation showed a partial rescue of MMS sensitivity by excess Mph1p (Fig. S3). Therefore, there are clear genetic interactions between <italic>MPH1</italic> and <italic>RPA</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>DNA damage could be repaired correctly or sometimes misrepaired to produce GCRs. Because of the complexity for choice of pathways to deal with DNA damage, cells need to have mechanisms to promote the most appropriate repair pathway. Our results suggest that Mph1p can promote a GCR pathway by partially suppressing HR.</p><p>Mph1p enhances GCRs by partially compromising HR and activating a GCR pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The suppression of HR by Mph1p is likely achieved by stabilizing RPA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>) binding of DNA, thereby blocking Rad52p-mediated Rad51p nucleofilament formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Consistent with these ideas, complete HR inactivation allowed excess Mph1p to promote GCR more efficiently (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). The observation that Rad52p overexpression, but not that of Rad51p and Rad54p, could reduce Mph1p-induced GCRs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> and not depicted) also suggests that Mph1p suppresses HR before Rad51p recruitment to the DSB. Notably, Mph1p was captured by affinity capture mass spectrometry using RPA as bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gavin et al., 2006</xref>), and physically interacted with RPA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Collectively, we propose that Mph1p interacts with and stabilizes RPA-coated single-stranded DNA, and this prevents Rad52p-mediated Rad51p nucleofilament formation. This role of Mph1p is further supported by the observation that the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> mutation reduces the number of cells producing spontaneous or DNA damage&#x02013;induced RPA foci (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref> and not depicted).</p><p>Alternatively, it is possible that excess Mph1p could interfere with RPA or Rad51p-Rad52p recruitment to DNA damage by scavenging them. Nevertheless, there were no physical interactions between Mph1p and Rad52p or between Mph1p and Rad51p (unpublished data). Therefore, GCRs promoted by Mph1p are likely caused by the blocking of Rad51p-Rad52p through its interaction with RPA.</p><p>GCRs enhanced by excess Mph1p could be driven by the interference of DNA replication through its interaction with RPA. Even though excess Mph1p did not cause a significant change in the proportion of cells in S phase (unpublished data), we cannot rule out the possibility that the Mph1p-induced GCR enhancement arises when excess Mph1p perturbs DNA replication in the small proportion of cells that are not detectable by FACS analysis.</p><p>The GCR-promoting activity by Mph1p is required for GCRs produced in strains having <italic>rad5&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>rad18&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>mec1&#x00394;</italic>, or <italic>rfa1-t33</italic> mutations under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). For its GCR-promoting activity, Mph1p's interaction with RPA seems to be essential; in contrast, the helicase activity of Mph1p is only partially required (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). The blocking of Rad51p filament formation by Mph1p is solely dependent on its interaction with RPA, not its helicase activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Finally, because the motif mutants of Mph1 could still rescue the MMS sensitivity of <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>), only the loss of Mph1's GCR-promoting activity (i.e., its interaction with RPA) results in the synergistic sensitivity to MMS with the <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> mutation. Thus, the RPA interaction seems to be essential for both the GCR-promoting activity and the Srs2p-like repair functions of Mph1p.</p><p>Even though excess Mph1p increased GCRs by partially suppressing HR, the complete inactivation of HR does not increase GCR when Mph1p is expressed in physiological conditions, except the <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> mutation that also inactivates the break-induced replication that is important to suppress GCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Myung et al., 2001a</xref>). Therefore, partial HR activity is necessary to promote GCR, at least when Mph1p is expressed in physiological conditions. The requirement of partial HR activity for GCR formation is further supported by the suppression of GCRs in the <italic>rad5&#x00394;</italic> or <italic>rad18&#x00394;</italic> strain by the inactivation of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Motegi et al., 2006</xref>). This partial HR activity could be required to process DNA damage to produce intermediates, presumably DSB, for GCR formation. However, such activity might not be required if excess Mph1p covers RPA-coated single-stranded DNA and causes a break in the DNA. Alternatively, partial HR activity might allow GCR machinery to access DNA damage, whereas excess Mph1p could simply overcome such a requirement by blocking the access of other repair proteins.</p><p>One unique feature of Mph1p discovered in this study is the demonstration of its role in suppressing HR. Even though there are several studies that suggest that <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> is epistatic to mutations in HR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scheller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prakash et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Onge et al., 2007</xref>), the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> mutation did not change the HR rate (unpublished data). No change in the HR rate by the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> mutation could be caused by the activation of postreplication repair by the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scheller et al., 2000</xref>). Elevated postreplication repair could bypass damaged DNA before HR repairs it in the <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> strain, resulting in no change of the HR rate. Alternatively, Srs2p could suppress HR in the absence of Mph1p, which is supported by synergistic sensitivity to MMS by <italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> mutation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>).</p><p>Even though Srs2p could function similarly to Mph1p to promote GCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Motegi et al., 2006</xref>), we did not detect GCR enhancement under the same expression system with Srs2p (unpublished data). This may be caused by the toxicity of Srs2p overexpression, which has been observed in a yeast Srs2p purification study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>When cells reach late S or G2 phase, telomerase activity is high to replicate the end of chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marcand et al., 2000</xref>). This telomerase activity seems to promote de novo telomere addition&#x02013;type GCRs. Excess Mph1p could augment GCRs from DNA damage by partially suppressing HR at the stalled replication forks. This sustained replication stall may lead to DSBs, thus providing substrates for active telomerase to carry out de novo telomere addition (the major type of GCR observed in this study).</p><p>Multiple choices to repair DNA lesions during DNA replication could result in different outcomes. Usually, these outcomes are beneficial for cells, but sometimes they can result in harmful mutations. In the present study, we uncovered Mph1p as an important decision maker between HR and GCR. The abnormal expression or mutation of <italic>MPH1</italic> can lead to undesirable outcomes, like GCRs (Mph1p overexpression) or mutations (<italic>mph1&#x00394;</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scheller et al., 2000</xref>). Mph1p's putative human homologue FANCM could have a similar function for directing different DNA repair pathways. Therefore, the cancer predisposition observed in FA patients could be caused by erroneous repair choice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study for GCR, ChIP, and mating type switch; spontaneous recombination assay; and RPA interaction and RPA or Rad51p foci assays were isogenic to the S288c background strains RDKY3615 (<italic>MATa</italic>, <italic>ura3-52</italic>, <italic>leu2&#x00394;1</italic>, <italic>trp1&#x00394;63</italic>, <italic>his3&#x00394;200</italic>, <italic>lys2-Bgl</italic>, <italic>hom3-10</italic>, <italic>ade2&#x00394;1</italic>, <italic>ade8</italic>, <italic>hxt13&#x02237;URA3</italic>), JKM161 (<italic>&#x00394;ho HMLalpha MATa &#x00394;hmr:;ADE1 ade1&#x02013;100 leu2&#x02013;3</italic>,<italic>112 lys5 trp1&#x02237;hisg ura3&#x02013;52 ade3&#x02237;GAL-HO endonuclease his-</italic>), M137-11B (<italic>MATa can1-100 his3p&#x02237;INV leu2 lys2-128 trp1 ura3</italic>), and ATCC201388 (<italic>MATa his3&#x00394;1leu2&#x00394;0 met15&#x00394;0 ura3&#x00394;0</italic>), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>General genetic methods</title><p>Conventional PCR-based gene disruption and plasmid transformation were used to generate strains.
