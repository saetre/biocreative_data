Moreover, we provide evidence that CBP-1, the worm ortholog of human p300/CBP, functions as a cofactor of CEP-1. PRMT-5 forms a complex with both CEP-1 and CBP-1 and can methylate the latter. Importantly, down-regulation of <italic>cbp-1</italic> significantly suppresses DNA damage-induced <italic>egl-1</italic> expression and apoptosis in <italic>prmt-5</italic> mutant worms.

Aberrant expression of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are found in a wide variety of human diseases, especially in many cancers.

In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells can activate checkpoint signaling pathways that are orchestrated by DNA damage sensors, mediators, transducers and effectors. In mammals, the damaged DNA is cooperatively recognized by the phosphoinositide 3-kinases ATM or ATR and the protein complexes Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) and RFC-Rad17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Sancar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. ATM and ATR initiate a phosphorylation cascade that eventually leads to the stabilization of the tumor suppressor p53. By selectively activating cell cycle controlling genes such as p21 and proapoptotic genes such as Bax, Puma and Noxa, p53 can induce either cell cycle arrest that allows the repair of damaged DNA, or apoptosis that eliminates those over-damaged cells in which DNA lesions are irreparable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Sancar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Roos1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to phosphorylation, the activation of p53 also involves other protein modifications including methylation and acetylation that are implicated in increasing p53 protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Lavin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the activity of p53 is also regulated by transcription coactivators such as histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP which are recruited by p53 to form transcription initiation complex to facilitate the transcription of p53 target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Gu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Avantaggiati1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>DNA damage sensing and signaling pathways are evolutionarily conserved across diverse species ranging from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to humans. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the p53 homolog CEP-1 acts as a key effector to mediate germ cell apoptosis triggered by ionizing irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Derry1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Schumacher1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Following DNA damage, CEP-1/p53 transcriptionally activates the cell death initiator EGL-1, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> BH3-only protein analogous to the mammalian p53 targets Puma and Noxa, leading to the activation of the core cell death pathway that is essentially controlled by several evolutionarily conserved apoptotic factors, including the Bcl-2-like antiapoptotic protein CED-9, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Apaf-1 homolog CED-4, and the caspase CED-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Hofmann1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Schumacher2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, inactivation of components in the checkpoint signaling pathways also gives rise to abnormal apoptosis of germ cells following DNA damage. For example, mutations in <italic>mrt-2</italic>, <italic>hus-1</italic> and <italic>clk-2</italic>, which encode the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of mammalian Rad1, Hus1 and Rad5, respectively, suppress cell cycle arrest and germ cell apoptosis induced by &#x003b3;-irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Hofmann1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Ahmed1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Gartner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, inactivation of <italic>atm-1</italic> and <italic>atl-1</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of mammalian ATM and ATR, respectively, suppresses both DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-GarciaMuse1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These facts indicate that the DNA damage signaling pathway leading to apoptosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is essentially similar to that in mammals, which makes <italic>C. elegans</italic> an excellent model organism for identifying novel components involved in cellular response to DNA damage.</p><p>Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are a family of proteins that catalyze the addition of one or two methyl groups to the guanidine nitrogen atoms of arginine, a process of posttranslational modification termed protein arginine methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Bedford1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Pal1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. PRMTs have been found in diverse species and 11 members are identified in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Bedford1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Pal1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Depending on the methylated forms of arginine residues of their substrates, mammalian PRMTs are classified into two types. The type I PRMTs, including PRMT1, 3, 4, 6 and 8, catalyze asymmetric dimethylation of arginine residues (aDMA). In comparison, the type II PRMTs, including PRMT5, 7 and 9, catalyze symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues (sDMA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Pal1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In recent years, a growing body of evidence indicates that protein arginine methylation plays important roles in regulating multiple cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, DNA repair as well as RNA processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Bedford1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The regulation of transcription by PRMTs generally involves the recruitment of these proteins to promoters by transcription factors and methylation of histone tails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Bedford1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, or methylation of transcription coactivators such as p300/CBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Xu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-ChevillardBriet1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and transcription elongation factors such as SPT5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Kwak1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies have also shown that protein arginine methylation is likely involved in cellular response to DNA damage. For example, it has been reported that PRMT1, CARM1/PRMT4 and p300 function cooperatively to promote p53 transcriptional activity on the cell cycle controlling gene GADD45 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-An1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, it was found that PRMT2 promotes apoptosis by negatively regulating NF-&#x003ba;B independently of its methylation activity, which is also implicated in DNA damage-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Ganesh1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, whether other PRMTs are involved in cellular response to DNA damage, especially in p53-dependent apoptosis, still remains largely unknown. Moreover, aberrant expression of PRMTs are found to associate with a wide variety of human diseases including many cancers, but the underlying mechanisms still need to be further elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Bedford1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To better understand the signaling mechanisms underlying cellular response to DNA damage, we took advantage of the genetic tractable model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic> to determine whether PRMTs and protein arginine methylation are involved in p53-dependent apoptosis.

The formation of a tripartite complex among PRMT-5, CEP-1 and CBP-1 and the methylation of CBP-1 by PRMT-5 likely repress the transcriptional activation of the cell death initiator EGL-1 in response to DNA damage.

Next, we examined whether these <italic>prmt</italic> genes are involved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> programmed cell death using RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down their expressions. Our time-course analyses of both embryonic and germ cell corpses indicated that inactivation of these genes did not obviously affect the cell death profiles, which suggests that protein arginine methylation may not be involved in developmental cell deaths in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (data not shown).

The predicted worm PRMT-5 protein shows the highest sequence similarity to human type II protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 (34&#x00025; sequence identity and 48&#x00025; similarity, respectively). The sequence similarity is particularly strong between the residues 105 to 730 of <italic>C. elegans</italic> PRMT-5 and residues 58 to 633 of human PRMT5. <italic>C. elegans</italic> PRMT-5 also shares homology with yeast Skb1 and Drosophila Dart1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000514.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

However, it is not known whether <italic>prmt-5</italic> also plays a role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. To further determine this, we analyzed a mutant strain <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> containing a deletion of 522 bp that removes a small region of the exon 1 and the whole exons 2 and 3 of <italic>prmt-5</italic> genomic locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Using an antibody generated against recombinant PRMT-5, we detected the expression of PRMT-5 in wild type but not in <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> mutants, indicating that <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> is likely a strong loss-of-function allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> animals display no obvious developmental defects except that the growth rate is slightly lower than that of wild-type animals.

In mammals, PRMT5 was found to regulate transcription by methylating symmetrically the arginine 3 residue of histone H4 (H4R3) and the arginine 8 residue of histone H3 (H3R8) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Pal2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

Using GST pull-down assay, we found that GST-PRMT-5 interacted with <sup>35</sup>S-labeled N-terminal fragment (1&#x02013;320) and a fragment within the HAT domain (1286&#x02013;1770) of CBP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that PRMT-5 binds to at least two sites in CBP-1. These findings suggest that PRMT-5, CEP-1 and CBP-1 likely form a complex. To further prove this, we tested whether these proteins could interact in HEK293 cells by co-expressing Myc-PRMT-5, Myc-CEP-1 and Flag-CBP-1(1&#x02013;1620) in different combinations and performing immunoprecipitation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, PRMT-5 and CEP-1 were associated with CBP-1 in HEK293 cells when they were individually co-expressed with CBP-1(1&#x02013;1620). Furthermore, when these three proteins were co-expressed, both PRMT-5 and CEP-1 were pulled down by CBP-1 as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), providing further evidence that these three proteins can form a complex.</p><p>We next examined whether CBP-1 could be modified by PRMT-5. When incubated with the recombinant PRMT-5 in the presence of <sup>3</sup>H-SAM, the CBP-1 N-terminal fragment containing amino acids 1&#x02013;320 was strongly methylated.

Because <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi treatment of early larvae (L1&#x02013;L2 stage) gave rise to cell cycle arrest in adult germlines, we performed <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi in L4-stage animals to partially inactivate <italic>cbp-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000514.s006">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000514.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).

These data indicate that <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi treatment of L4-stage animals does not affect either germline development or physiological germ cell death. Thus <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi was carried out in L4-stage animals in our following experiments. Compared with control RNAi treatment, <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi caused a strong reduction of germ cell corpses in wild type when exposed to different doses of &#x003b3;-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

In agreement with this, the induction of <italic>egl-1</italic> expression by &#x003b3;-irradiation of 120 Gy in <italic>cbp-1(RNAi)</italic> animals was decreased by about 40&#x00025; compared to that in control RNAi-treated wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g006">Figure 6E</xref> (lanes 1&#x02013;2) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting that CBP-1 functions to promote CEP-1 transcriptional activity.

However, whether and how PRMT5 controls the expression of apoptosis-related genes to affect cell proliferation, apoptosis, as well as tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. Here we have shown that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> arginine methyltransferase PRMT-5 plays an important role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. <italic>prmt-5</italic> loss-of-function mutation does not affect developmental cell deaths but leads to excessive germ cell apoptosis in response to DNA damage, suggesting that <italic>prmt-5</italic> negatively regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our further genetic analyses indicate that mutations of <italic>cep-1</italic>/p53 and genes in the core cell death pathway suppress IR-induced excessive germ cell apoptosis in <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> mutants, indicating that <italic>prmt-5</italic>-mediated apoptosis following DNA damage is dependent on <italic>cep-1</italic>/p53 and requires the core cell death pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Meanwhile, we found that mutations in checkpoint genes significantly inhibited IR-induced excessive germ cell death in <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> mutants, suggesting that checkpoint signaling pathways are important for <italic>prmt-5</italic>-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Importantly, loss of <italic>prmt-5</italic> function causes a specific over up-regulation of the cell death initiator EGL-1 in response to DNA damage, which is directly responsible for the excessive germ cell apoptosis observed in <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> mutants. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PRMT-5 is a negative regulator of CEP-1/p53-dependent cell death pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Our results have suggested a novel mechanism underlying <italic>cep-1</italic>/p53-dependent cellular response to DNA damage in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ cells, it seems that PRMT-5 does not affect the symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 although mammalian and plant PRMT5 has been reported to do so <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Pal2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Wang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Presently we can not exclude the possibility that PRMT-5 methylates other arginine residues on histone H4 to regulate CEP-1/p53-dependent gene expression, but it seems less likely that PRMT-5 modifies H3R8 to affect transcription in <italic>C. elegans</italic> since PRMT-5 does not methylate histone H3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000514.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Regardless of histone arginine methylation, our results have revealed a novel regulatory mechanism underlying DNA damage-induced <italic>egl-1</italic> expression. The fact that PRMT-5 interacts with but does not methylate CEP-1 implies that PRMT-5 likely regulates CEP-1 transcriptional activity by affecting a CEP-1 cofactor(s). In support of this, we have identified CBP-1 as a cofactor of CEP-1/p53, which is supported by two lines of evidence: firstly, CBP-1 and CEP-1 physically interact with one another both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mammalian cells; secondly, reducing <italic>cbp-1</italic> expression significantly suppressed <italic>cep-1</italic>-dependent germ cell apoptosis and <italic>egl-1</italic> transcription in response to DNA damage. Moreover, we found that PRMT-5 can form complex with CEP-1 and CBP-1, and PRMT-5 can methylate the residue R234 in the N-terminus of CBP-1. Therefore PRMT-5 likely affects CEP-1 transcriptional activity through its effect on CBP-1 despite that it may not be the sole target of PRMT-5. In agreement with this notion, we found that partial inactivation of <italic>cbp-1</italic> by RNAi significantly suppressed the excessive germ cell apoptosis in <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> animals following DNA damage. Consistently, <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi significantly reduced <italic>egl-1</italic> expression in <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> mutants. Based on these experimental findings, we propose a possible model for PRMT-5 functioning through CBP-1 and CEP-1 to negatively regulate DNA damage-induced apoptosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>: In wild-type animals, PRMT-5 and CBP-1 are likely recruited by CEP-1 to form a complex so that CBP-1 is methylated by PRMT-5, which represses the capacity of CBP-1 for enhancing CEP-1-dependent transcription of <italic>egl-1</italic>. In this case, <italic>egl-1</italic> expression is maintained at a proper level to avoid excessive germ cell apoptosis after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). In <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> animals, the repression on CBP-1 by PRMT-5 is removed, thus CBP-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of CEP-1 by mechanisms yet to be uncovered, leading to high expression level of <italic>egl-1</italic> following DNA damage, which in turn causes excessive germ cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000514-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>ced-13</italic> was reported to be a transcription target of CEP-1, we found that IR-induced <italic>ced-13</italic> expression is indistinguishable between wild type and <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> mutants and <italic>ced-13</italic> loss of function does not suppress IR-induced apoptosis in <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> animals. These results suggest that the regulatory effect of PRMT-5 on IR-induced CEP-1 transcriptional activity is likely specific to <italic>egl-1</italic> transcription. It was found recently that IR-induced <italic>ced-13</italic> expression is only detected in somatic tissues but not in germline where DNA damage-induced apoptosis takes place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Greiss1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that <italic>ced-13</italic> may play a role in DNA damage response in soma while <italic>egl-1</italic> is the major CEP-1 target responsible for initiating germ cell apoptosis after DNA damage. In addition, although PRMT-5 is implicated in maintaining genome stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Pothof1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, our results indicate PRMT-5 likely acts mainly in germline to regulate DNA damage response since the survival of <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> embryos was comparable to that of wild-type animals after IR treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000514.s005">Table S1</xref>), which also suggests that <italic>prmt-5</italic> probably does not obviously affect the repair of DNA lesions caused by &#x003b3;-irradiation. As <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> worms also displayed similar cell cycle arrest in germline mitotic region to that in wild-type animals upon DNA damage (data not shown), it seems that <italic>prmt-5</italic> acts differently in sensing DNA damage from checkpoint genes. Thus, apart from a role in regulating DNA damage-induced germ cell apoptosis, it remains to be elucidated how <italic>prmt-5</italic> inactivation causes increased accumulation of mutation observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Pothof1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Because strong loss of function of <italic>cbp-1</italic> causes lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Shi1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, we could only analyze the role of <italic>cbp-1</italic> in <italic>prmt-5</italic>-mediated germ cell apoptosis in response to DNA damage by using the partial loss-of-function mutation of <italic>cbp-1</italic> (<italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi), which suppressed IR-induced germ cell apoptosis in <italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> mutant worms to a less extent than suppressed by the strong loss of function of <italic>cep-1</italic>. Therefore we can not conclude that PRMT-5 acts solely through CBP-1 based on the <italic>cbp-1</italic> RNAi results. Nevertheless, in agreement with our findings that PRMT-5 likely regulates CEP-1 activity through CBP-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a recent study also identified human PRMT5 as a negative regulator of p53-mediated apoptosis involving p300/CBP in mammalian cells. Jansson et al. reported that PRMT5 is associated with the CBP-binding protein Strap. As a result, PRMT5 is recruited to p53 to methylate the latter on the arginine residues in an RGRER motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Jansson1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, inactivation of PRMT5 by siRNA significantly enhanced DNA damage-induced apoptosis of mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Jansson1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike human PRMT5, however, we did not find that <italic>C. elegans</italic> PRMT-5 modify CEP-1, which is consistent with that CEP-1 does not contain an RGRER motif as human p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Jansson1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus our findings suggest a possibility that human PRMT5 may affect p53 activity through additional mechanisms except for p53 arginine methylation. For example, it is likely that human PRMT5 can function similarly to its <italic>C. elegans</italic> counterpart to regulate p300/CBP activity by arginine methylation. Previously, it has been shown that the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1/PRMT4) can methylate p300/CBP in the KIX domain to disable the interaction between the p300/CBP KIX domain and the kinase inducible domain (KID) of CREB, which blocks CREB-dependent transcription of genes such as Bcl-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Xu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, CARM1-mediated methylation of p300/CBP enhances nuclear hormone receptor (NR)-dependent gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Xu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-ChevillardBriet1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings indicate that the arginine methylation of p300/CBP is one of the mechanisms underlying transcription regulation. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, PRMT-5 methylates an arginine residue located in the GRG motif in the N-terminus of CBP-1. Interestingly, this GRG motif also exists in the N-termini of mammalian p300 and CBP. Furthermore, it has been found that PRMT5 is present in the p53 co-activator complex containing p300/CBP in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000514-Jansson1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it will be very important to determine whether human PRMT5 can methylate p300/CBP on the same arginine residue to regulate its coactivator activity in promoting apoptosis-related gene transcription. Further in-depth mechanistic studies in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian cells will be needed to establish the role of the site-specific methylation of p300/CBP by PRMT5 in regulating p53-dependent apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> Strains and Genetics</title><p><italic>prmt-5(gk357)</italic> and <italic>cep-1(gk138)</italic> deletion strains were generated by Dr. Donald Moerman (<italic>C. elegans</italic> Reverse Genetics Core Facility, Vancouver, B.C., Canada) and provided by <italic>C. elegans</italic> Genetic Center (CGC). <italic>ced-13(tm536)</italic> deletion strain was provided by Dr. Shohei Mitani.
