Rabs require activation by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP. Rab27a controls motility and regulated exocytosis of secretory granules and related organelles. In melanocytes, Rab27a regulates peripheral transport of mature melanosomes by recruiting melanophilin and myosin Va. Here, we studied the activation of Rab27a in melanocytes. We identify Rab3GEP, previously isolated as a GEF for Rab3a, as the non-redundant Rab27a GEF. Similar to Rab27a-deficient <italic>ashen</italic> melanocytes, Rab3GEP-depleted cells show both clustering of melanosomes in the perinuclear area and loss of the Rab27a effector Mlph. Consistent with a role as an activator, levels of Rab27a-GTP are decreased in cells lacking Rab3GEP. Recombinant Rab3GEP exhibits guanine nucleotide exchange activity against Rab27a and Rab27b <italic>in vitro</italic>, in addition to its previously documented activity against Rab3. Our results indicate promiscuity in Rab GEF action and suggest that members of related but functionally distinct Rab subfamilies can be controlled by common activators.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the <grant-sponsor>Wellcome Trust</grant-sponsor>.

More than 60 Rab family members are known in mammalian cells. Different Rabs are localized to specific cellular compartments where they are primary determinants of membrane identity and exert multiple local activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Rab proteins are posttranslationally modified by geranylgeranylation, which is required for membrane association and proper function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). After prenylation, Rabs form a complex with Rab escort protein, which is dissociated upon membrane association of the newly prenylated Rabs.</p><p>Regulation of Rab function is determined by the ability to cycle between a GDP-bound inactive form and a GTP-bound active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Rabs are activated by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref> that stimulate the release of GDP and the binding of GTP. Activated Rab-GTP binds effector proteins, which perform critical functions in the organization of membrane traffic. GTPase-activating proteins return Rabs to their inactive state by accelerating intrinsic Rab GTP hydrolysis. Once back in the GDP-bound form, Rabs are extracted from membranes by Rab guanine dissociation inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>).</p><p>The regulation of Rab activation plays a crucial role in determining when and where a given Rab exerts its cellular activity. In contrast to the large number of GEFs known for the Ras, Rho, and Arf families, few Rab GEFs have been identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). These include Sec2, the GEF for Sec4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>); the Vps9 domain-containing proteins Rabex-5, Varp, and the Rin family, which catalyze nucleotide exchange on Rab5 and closely related Rab family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>); Rabin-3, a GEF specific for Rab8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>); and Rab3GEP; and GRAB as activators for Rab3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into the mechanisms of Rab activation, we have studied these processes using Rab27a as a model Rab. Rab27a controls organelle transport in melanocytes and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) as well as regulated exocytosis in secretory cells such as pancreatic &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). It regulates these diverse functions largely by interacting with a family of effector proteins containing a conserved N-terminal Rab27 binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). In melanocytes, Rab27a recruits melanophilin (Mlph) and myosin Va to the melanosome membrane, allowing tethering of melanosomes to the actin cytoskeleton at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). The loss of any component of this tripartite complex results in disruption of peripheral tethering and clustering of melanosomes in the perinuclear area of the cell.</p><p>In this study, we took a candidate gene approach to identify Rab27 GEFs and studied Rab27a activation using melanosome transport in melanocytes as a model system. We identify Rab3-GEP, previously isolated as a GEF for Rab3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), as the non-redundant GEF required for the activation of Rab27a in melanocytes.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cell Culture</italic>&#x02014;Mouse wild-type melanocytes (melan-ink4a) and Rab27a-deficient <italic>ashen</italic> melanocytes (melan-ash2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 m<sc>m l</sc>-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 200 n<sc>m</sc> phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and 200 p<sc>m</sc> cholera toxin at 37 &#x000b0;C under a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO<sub>2</sub>.

We hypothesized that GEFs for the closely related Rab3 proteins could function as Rab27 GEFs. We examined two previously identified Rab3 GEFs, Rab3GEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) and GRAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). To gain insight into the function of these GEF proteins in melanocytes and investigate their putative roles as Rab27a GEFs, we used siRNA. Immunoblotting revealed that endogenous Rab3GEP was efficiently depleted by mouse Rab3GEP-specific siRNAs but not by non-targeting siRNAs in mouse melanocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>I</italic></xref>). Depletion of Rab3GEP with four different siRNA oligonucleotides resulted in clustering of melanosomes in the perinuclear area as opposed to the even distribution observed in control cells transfected with non-targeting siRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, <italic>A&#x02013;D</italic> and <italic>F</italic></xref>).

In cells transduced with virus carrying GFP alone, melanosome distribution was not altered (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>), with melanosome clustering seen in 65% of Rab3GEP siRNA-treated cells. However, expression of exogenous GFP-tagged or V5-tagged human Rab3GEP rescued the observed phenotype (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>E&#x02013;H</italic></xref>), dramatically reducing the number of cells with clustered melanosomes to 8 or 9%, respectively. As expected, expression of human Rab3GEP did not reverse the clustering of melanosomes induced by depletion of Mlph (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>I</italic> and <italic>J</italic></xref>).</p><p>This suggests that Rab3GEP plays a role in melanosome transport and functions in the same pathway as Rab27a/Mlph/myosin Va. A putative role for Rab3GEP as a GEF for Rab27a in melanocytes would be consistent with these results. Furthermore, our data suggest that Rab3GEP activity is not redundant in melanocytes.</p><p>Similar experiments using GRAB-specific siRNAs did not show any effect on melanosome distribution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic></xref>). To exclude the possibility that the function of Rab3GEP in melanocytes could be mediated via one of the isoforms of Rab3, we also depleted cells of Rab3. Rab3a, b, c, and d were targeted with specific siRNAs, either separately (data not shown) or simultaneously (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). Immunoblotting with an antibody reactive with all four isoforms demonstrated loss of Rab3 in the transfected melanocytes, but no effect on melanosome transport was observed.</p><p><italic>Loss of Rab3GEP Reduces the Levels of Activated Rab27a</italic>&#x02014;To address whether down-regulation of Rab3GEP induces melanosome aggregation by preventing Rab27a activation, we determined the level of endogenous Rab27a in the GTP-bound form in cells transfected either with Rab3GEP siRNA or with control siRNAs. We used the Rab27-binding domain of Slp1, tagged with GST, to pull down Rab27-GTP from cell lysates, followed by immunoblot analysis for Rab27a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Depletion of Rab3GEP in melanocytes led to a substantial decrease (&#x0223c;65% of total) in the amount of endogenous Rab27a pulled down by GST-Slp1 compared with treatment with non-targeting or Mlph siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). This decrease supports a GDP/GTP exchange activity for Rab3GEP on Rab27a. The fraction of Rab27a still interacting with Slp1 (&#x0223c;35% of total) may result from non-transfected cells (&#x0223c;20%). Additionally, although the Rab27 binding domain of Slp1 shows preferential interaction with the GTP-bound form of Rab27a, a low level of binding to Rab27a-GDP has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Loss of GRAB or Rab3 does not affect melanosome distribution.</bold><italic>A</italic>, melan-ink4a cells were transfected with GRAB-specific siRNA oligonucleotides and observed after 72 h. <italic>B</italic>, melanosome clustering was quantified in melan-ink4a cells transfected with non-targeting (<italic>NT</italic>), GRAB-specific, Rab3GEP-specific, or Mlph-specific siRNA oligonucleotides (<italic>n</italic> = 2, 100 cells/condition). <italic>C</italic>, HEK-293 cells were transfected with non-targeting or GRAB-specific siRNA oligonucleotides.

In Rab27a-deficient <italic>ashen</italic> melanocytes, a dramatic decrease in Mlph levels is observed in comparison with wild-type cells, suggesting that Mlph requires interaction with Rab27a-GTP for stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that loss of Rab27-GTP in Rab3GEP-depleted cells would result in Mlph destabilization. Consistent with this, Mlph was no longer detectable in cells depleted of Rab3GEP by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>) or by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>H</italic></xref>), similar to what was observed in cells treated with Mlph siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>B, D</italic>, and <italic>G</italic></xref>). These results support the idea that in Rab3GEP-depleted cells, Rab27a is predominantly in the GDP-bound form, precluding interaction with Mlph and resulting in its destabilization.</p><p><italic>Rab3GEP Is a GEF for Rab27a</italic>&#x02014;To confirm that Rab3GEP does indeed possess Rab27a GEF activity, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> GDP/GTP exchange assays with recombinant Rab3GEP produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Rab3GEP was assayed for the ability to stimulate [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP&#x003b3;S incorporation into bacterially expressed His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Rab1a, Rab3a, Rab5a, Rab27a, and Rab27b and NusA-His<sub>6</sub>-Rab8a. Purified Rab3GEP catalyzed the binding of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP&#x003b3;S to Rab3a, Rab27a, and Rab27b in a time-dependent manner, but not to Rab1a, Rab5a, and Rab8a (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). This analysis suggests that Rab3GEP is a GEF specific for the related Rab3 and Rab27 subfamilies. We also performed <italic>in vitro</italic> GDP/GTP exchange assays with recombinant GRAB protein. GRAB showed exchange activity toward Rab3a but did not catalyze nucleotide exchange on Rab27a (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study we used a candidate gene approach to identify a nucleotide exchange factor for mammalian Rab27. We find that Rab3GEP, a protein described previously as a GEF for Rab3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), acts as the non-redundant Rab27 GEF activity in melanocytes. We show that Rab3GEP has guanine nucleotide exchange activity for Rab27a and Rab27b as well as Rab3 proteins, but not for Rabs belonging to other subfamilies. Consistent with a key role for Rab3GEP as a Rab27 activator, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rab3GEP expression in epidermal melanocytes results in the perinuclear clustering of melanosomes, a phenotype similar to that observed in melanocytes lacking Rab27, such as those isolated from the <italic>ashen</italic> (Rab27a-deficient) mouse. Depletion of Rab3 isoforms, on the other hand, does not affect melanosome distribution, suggesting that melanosome clustering induced by the loss of Rab3GEP is due to a reduction in Rab27 activation rather than Rab3 function.</p><p>Rab3GEP was initially purified from rat brain by Takai and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) as a Rab3a GEF. It is a ubiquitously expressed protein of &#x0223c;200 kDa that has been shown to be active on all four Rab3 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Rab3GEP plays an important role in neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) and affects stimulated secretion from neuroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> Rab3GEP orthologue AEX-3 shows substantial levels of sequence homology over extended regions of the molecule. Studies in <italic>aex-3</italic> mutants also implicated this protein in the regulation of synaptic transmission and linked its function to that of RAB-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). However, <italic>aex-3</italic> mutants show a more severe phenotype than <italic>rab-3</italic> mutants, and more recent morphological, behavioral, and electrophysiological studies suggested that AEX-3 regulates both RAB-3 and RAB-27 function in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Down-regulation of Rab3GEP results in reduced levels of activated Rab27a.</bold><italic>A</italic>, Rab3GEP-depleted melanocytes contain lower levels of Rab27a in the GTP-bound form.

In many cell types, Rab3 and Rab27 proteins exhibit extensive overlap in their subcellular distributions, localizing to dense-core secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) and melanosomes in melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). Moreover, they are able to interact with a subset of common effectors, including rabphilin-3, granuphilin/Slp4, and Noc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). Despite these shared features, Rab27 and Rab3 perform distinct, non-redundant cellular functions. For example, Rab3 cannot restore the melanosome transport defect in melanocytes deficient in Rab27a, presumably because of its inability to interact with melanophilin/Slac2-a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). In a range of neuroendocrine cell lines, increasing the levels of active Rab27 leads to an enhanced secretory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>), suggesting a positive role for Rab27 in regulated secretory granule exocytosis. Rab3, on the other hand, may play an inhibitory role, with overexpression leading to a decrease in evoked secretion in most cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that Rab3GEP may be involved in differentially activating Rab27 and Rab3 within the same cell and potentially on the same subcellular membranes. In this way it could play a role in fine-tuning the spatiotemporal control of vesicular transport events to ensure that exocytosis of different storage organelles occurs with kinetics appropriate for the biological function of their secretory products.</p><p>Only a small number of Rab GEFs have been identified to date. These proteins are diverse in sequence and structure. Unlike the exchange factors for Rho or Ras GTPases that are characterized by conserved RhoGEF or RasGEF domains, Rab GEFs do not appear to possess a common catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Different GEF families employ a variety of strategies to promote nucleotide exchange and to achieve specificity for their substrate GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). The GEF domain in Rab3GEP has not been defined yet, and the structural determinants in Rab27 and Rab3 required for recognition by Rab3GEP are not known. Future mapping studies should provide an insight into the molecular mechanism of Rab3GEP interaction with its Rab substrates.</p><p>The regulation of two related Rab subfamilies, Rab3 and Rab27, by a common exchange factor is similar to what is observed for the Vps9 domain-containing family of Rab GEFs. At least some Vps9 proteins, such as Rabex-5, recognize multiple members of the same Rab functional group, consisting of the Rab5 isoforms, Rab21, and Rab22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Thus, a pattern may be emerging for the Rab family whereby a large number of Rab proteins are activated by a much smaller number of Rab GEFs with some substrate promiscuity. This is in marked contrast to the Rho family, in which a relatively small set of &#x0223c;20 Rho GTPases are activated by a large number of at least 70 Rho GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). An intriguing question is how a small number of Rab GEFs could regulate the many Rab family members involved in controlling diverse and dynamic intracellular trafficking pathways under a wide variety of conditions. To gain a better understanding of this, much more will need to be learned about how the activity of Rab exchange factors themselves is regulated. Many are multi-domain proteins that, in addition to the Rabs, might interact with a variety of intracellular regulatory molecules. A further interesting example is the yeast TRAPP complex, which shows GEF activity for two different Rab GTPases, Ypt1 and Ypt31/32, with a switch in substrate specificity dependent on binding of a subset of its components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). Rab3GEP, in particular, is a large protein likely to consist of multiple functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>), and a more detailed analysis of its properties and intracellular binding partners should provide valuable new insights into Rab protein activation and nucleotide cycling and the mechanisms governing their regulation.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Recombinant Rab3GEP is a nucleotide exchange factor for Rab27a <italic>in vitro</italic></bold>. <italic>A</italic>, His<sub>6</sub>-Rab1a (&#x025a1;), His<sub>6</sub>-Rab3a (&#x025cb;), His<sub>6</sub>-Rab5a (&#x025b5;), NusA-His<sub>6</sub>-Rab8a (&#x025be;), His<sub>6</sub>-Rab27a (&#x02022;), and His<sub>6</sub>-Rab27b (&#x025aa;) were incubated with [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP&#x003b3;S at 30 &#x000b0;C for the indicated periods of time in the presence or absence of recombinant Rab3GEP.
