Based on the nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones and the 5' flanking genomic region of the NFKB2 gene, RT-PCR analysis in a number of human cell lines demonstrated the presence of two alternative noncoding first exons (1a and 1b). Two distinct promoter regions, P1 and P2, were identified upstream of each exon, containing multiple sites of transcription initiation, as shown by RNase protection analysis. Sequence analysis of these regions showed a CAAT box upstream of exon 1a and high G-C content regions within both P1 and P2. Consensus binding sites for transcription factors, including SP1, AP1 and putative NF-kappa B (kappa B sites), were found upstream of each exon. In particular, six kappa B sites were identified, all but one of them capable of binding NF-kappa B complexes in vitro. Transfection in HeLa cells of plasmids containing P1 and P2 sequences linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene indicated that both P1 and P2 can act independently as promoters. Co-transfection of NF-kappa B effector plasmids (NF-kappa Bp52 and RelA) with a reporter gene linked to P1 and P2 showed that the NFKB2 promoter regions are regulated by NF-kappa B factors. RelA transactivates the NFKB2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner, whereas NF-kappa Bp52 acts as a repressor, indicating that the NFKB2 gene may be under the control of a negative feedback regulatory circuit.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0260-a" xlink:role="2330"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0261-a" xlink:role="2331"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0263-a" xlink:role="2333"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0258.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2328"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0259.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2329"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0260.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2330"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0261.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2331"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0262.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2332"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0263.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2333"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0264.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2334"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0265.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2335"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00012-0266.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2336"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
