One of the most well characterised of these G proteins is mammalian Arf6, a protein that participates in many cellular processes including endocytosis, actin remodelling and cell adhesion. Exchange of GDP for GTP on Arf6 is performed by a variety of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), principally of the cytohesin (PSCD) and EFA6 (PSD) families. In this paper we describe the characterisation of a GEF for the yeast orthologue of Arf6, Arf3, which we have named Yel1 (<underline>y</underline>east <underline>E</underline>FA6-<underline>l</underline>ike-1) using yeast genetics, fluorescence microscopy and <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleotide exchange assays. Yel1 appears structurally related to the EFA6 family of GEFs, having an N-terminal Sec7 domain and C-terminal PH and coiled-coil domains. We find that Yel1 is constitutively targeted to regions of polarised growth in yeast, where it co-localises with Arf3. Moreover the Sec7 domain of Yel1 is required for its membrane targeting and for that of Arf3. Finally we show that the isolated Yel1 Sec7 domain strongly stimulates nucleotide exchange activity specifically on Arf3 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Small G proteins of the Arf family control many aspects of intracellular membrane trafficking, interacting spatially and dynamically with a variety of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Gillingham1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This adaptability is achieved because like most G proteins of the Ras superfamily, Arfs can cycle between GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms. This switching of nucleotide results in a large conformational change primarily to two regions of the protein, known as switch I and switch II. These regions are the main sites of interaction for downstream effectors as well as regulators of the G protein. The main regulators of the GDP-GTP cycle are the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that mediate the rate-limiting exchange of GDP for GTP, and the GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that stimulate the hydrolysis of bound GTP.</p><p>Arf G proteins associate weakly with membranes in the GDP-bound form. Following GTP exchange the N-terminal amphipathic helix, which in most Arfs is also myristoylated, is exposed and can form a tight, stable interaction with the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Gillingham1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This allows the G protein to recruit effector proteins to distinct organelles or sub-compartments within the cell. All Arf-GEFs described so far are peripheral membrane proteins that contain a region of approximately 200 amino acids that is responsible for their GEF activity and is known as the Sec7 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Shin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Previous studies have shown that the most recognisable characteristic of Arf-GEFs is the catalytic Sec7 domain, first identified in the yeast protein Sec7, a protein with a key role in secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Chardin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Achstetter1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Using this domain and the iterative search programme PSI-BLAST to mine the GenBank database revealed the presence of an uncharacterised protein in yeast encoded by the gene YBL060w. This protein has 687 amino acids, with a Sec7 domain located near to the N-terminus (residues 70&#x02013;265). A small region of the YBL060w gene product, like the EFA6 and cytohesin GEFs, is predicted to form an amphipathic helix and there is a PH domain (residues 384&#x02013;558) in the C-terminal half of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Indeed a recent study analysing the specificity of all the PH domains in yeast reported that the YBL060w gene product bound phosphoinositides, although this binding was relatively weak and rather promiscuous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Yu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0000842-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000842.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Yel1 is a member of a conserved family of Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors.</title><p>(A) Schematic diagram of the domain structure of Yel1, showing the relative positions of the Sec7 domain, the PH domain and the EFA6-like regions.

However there are clear orthologues in other yeasts and filamentous fungi. Moreover, iterative PSI-BLAST with the C-terminal portion of Yel1 reveals two regions that are related to the EFA6 family of mammalian Arf6 GEFs, one being the PH domain and in particular a region at its C-terminal end and the other being at the extreme C-terminus of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;C</xref>).

We reasoned that, unless there is redundancy between Yel1 and another GEF, loss of the protein will result in the mislocalisation of its target G protein. Thus we expressed plasmid-borne copies of GFP tagged Arf1, Arf3, Arl1 or Arl3 in both wild-type and <italic>yel1&#x00394;</italic> mutant strains. As expected in wild-type cells Arf1, Arl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and Arl3 (data not shown) all localised to punctate structures scattered throughout the cell, which are typical of the Golgi.

In addition some weak plasma membrane fluorescence is apparent, although this is no longer restricted to sites of polarisied growth, and is not affected by additional loss of Syt1 (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0000842.g002"/></fig><p>To confirm these observations in the absence of over-expression, strains were created in which Arf3 was tagged at the C-terminus in the genome of wild-type or <italic>yel1&#x00394;</italic> mutant yeast. Under these conditions the G protein is expressed from its own promotor. As before Arf3 localised to regions of polarised growth in the wild-type strain. When Yel1 was absent the majority of Arf3 was displaced to the cytoplasm however a weak plasma membrane localisation was also observed in the majority of cells. Strikingly, residual targeting of Arf3 to the membrane under these conditions was no longer restricted to the emerging bud but instead appeared uniformly distributed around the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Finally we tested whether the fungal specific Sec7-domain protein Syt1, (which is also encoded by a non-essential gene in yeast), could function in the Arf3 pathway. This GEF has been reported to exhibit some weak nucleotide exchange activity towards Arf2, stimulating the release of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;GDP approximately 2-fold, however its activity on Arf3 has not been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Jones1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g002">Figure 2C</xref> shows that loss of Syt1 had no effect on the localisation of Arf3 in the presence or absence of Yel1.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Yel1 and Arf3 co-localise at sites of polarised growth on the plasma membrane</title><p>To characterise Yel1 in more detail we next asked whether its localisation was consistent with the targeting of Arf3 to the bud neck. Yel1 was initially C-terminally tagged in the genome of an <italic>arf3&#x00394;</italic> mutant strain with GFP and expressed under its own promotor. The resulting Yel1-GFP fusion localised to the bud, however the fluorescence signal was weak negating the possibility of two-colour imaging with Arf3-RFP. To circumvent this problem the fusion protein was re-engineered so that it could be overexpressed from a <italic>PHO5</italic> promotor with an N-terminal GFP tag. This construct was clearly visible at the plasma membrane where, like the C-terminal fusion, the majority was restricted to the bud neck and the emerging bud tip. As expected, co-expressed Arf3-RFP co-localised extensively with Yel1 at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), implying that the tagged Yel1 protein is functional. Moreover we occasionally observed that the localisation of Yel1 was more tightly restricted to the bud neck and bud tip than that of Arf3, particularly when Arf3 was expressed at high levels (right hand panels). One possible explanation for this is that following nucleotide exchange Arf3 can diffuse away from its site of activation before being turned over and released from the membrane. In addition we also observed 1&#x02013;2 intracellular punctate structures that contained both Arf3 and Yel1 in approximately 10&#x00025; of budding cells. The exact nature of these organelles is unclear, but they may represent endocytic compartments.</p><fig id="pone-0000842-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000842.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>The Sec7 domain of Yel1 is required for its localisation and for the localisation of Arf3.</title><p>Fluorescent micrographs of live yeast expressing the indicated fusion proteins.

To determine whether Yel1 can also localise to the membrane in this manner, a strain was constructed in which residues 1&#x02013;387 were replaced with GFP in the genome of an <italic>arf3&#x00394;</italic> mutant. This truncation removes the Sec7 domain leaving only the C-terminal portion of the protein that contains the PH domain. At steady state GFP-Yel1(388-687) was undetectable at the plasma membrane and was found instead throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These data suggest that, although Yel1 contains a recognisable PH domain, its affinity for phosphoinositides is insufficient to allow the protein to stably associate with the plasma membrane. Interestingly a study by Mark Lemmons' group in which the activities of all PH domains from yeast were assessed using a Ras activation assay demonstrated that, under certain conditions, a Ras-Yel1-PH domain fusion was capable of targeting Ras to the membrane, where it could rescue the defect of a <italic>cdc25<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutant strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Yu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However when this construct was tagged with GFP and localised in the cell it was not found at the membrane but instead targeted to the nucleus. These observations suggest that the PH domain of Yel1 is able to associate weakly with membranes but that the degree of membrane association is undetectable at the level of the light microscope. The results also imply that in the full-length protein, the N-terminus, perhaps through the activity of the Sec7 domain, is additionally required to ensure that a stable interaction with the membrane is sustained. We next examined the localisation of Arf3 in the GFP-Yel1(388-687) mutant yeast. As expected, Arf3-RFP was displaced from the plasma membrane in this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Since the isolated C-terminal portion of Yel1 is not capable of stably localising the protein to the membrane, we next asked whether the Sec7 domain can perform this function. To address this, a <italic>yel1&#x00394;</italic> mutant strain in which endogenous Arf3 is tagged with GFP was transformed with plasmid-borne copies of RFP-Yel1 or RFP-Yel1(1-285), the latter plasmid encoding only the Sec7 domain.

In contrast, although the Sec7 domain of Yel1 can promote nucleotide exchange on Arf3 (see later), expression of the Sec7 domain alone could not re-localise Arf3 to regions of polarised growth. Instead both RFP-Yel1(1-285) and Arf3-GFP were found distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), (although in the case of Arf3-GFP some weak non-polarised association with the plasma membrane was apparent as is also observed in the <italic>yel1&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g002">Figure 2B</xref>)). Thus the Sec7 domain of Yel1 is neither sufficient for its own membrane recruitment nor for that of Arf3.</p><p>To analyse the targeting of Yel1 in more detail two additional truncation mutants were engineered, RFP-Yel1(1-371) and RFP-Yel1(1-556) and transformed into the above strain. Neither of these truncated proteins proved particularly stable in cells and both failed to rescue the mislocalisation of Arf3 (data not shown). Moreover we mutated several conserved residues in the PH domain and C-terminal EFA6-like region of RFP-Yel1 (single mutants F540A and W569A and triple mutant K506A, R507A, K508A) in order to isolate a Yel1 protein that could no longer target to the membrane. However in all cases the Yel1 mutant behaved as wild-type protein and could rescue the Arf3 targeting phenotype. Together our results suggest that targeting information for Yel1 is encoded throughout the length of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Yel1 is specific for Arf3</title><p>In all cases so far examined, the catalytic activity of Arf GEFs has been attributed to the Sec7 domains of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Peyroche1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Morinaga1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Chardin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

It should be noted that the rate of spontaneous exchange on Arl1 is higher than that of Arf1 or Arf3, perhaps implying that, at least <italic>in vitro,</italic> Arl1 has a lower intrinsic affinity for nucleotides than either of the other G protein. Since the N-terminal amphipathic helix is known to play a role in &#x0201c;locking&#x0201d; G proteins in their GDP-bound conformation, it may be that removal of this domain from Arl1 has a more stimulatory effect on spontaneous nucleotide exchange than the same deletion from Arf1 or Arf3. (B) Comparison of the efficiency of Sec7 domains from different GEFs to stimulate GDP to GTP exchange on Arf3. Exchange on rArf3 was monitored as in (A) with Sec7 domains from Yel1 (cross symbols), Syt1 (squares), Sec7 (triangles) and human ARNO (circles) added at a final concentration of 50 nM.

To this end the Sec7 domains of Syt1 and Sec7 were expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. As before we analysed the fold stimulation in exchange activity of the isolated Sec7 domains over spontaneous exchange on Arf3. Under the conditions used here neither yeast protein could significantly stimulate nucleotide exchange on Arf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast the Sec7 domain from yeast Sec7 promoted efficient nucleotide exchange on Arf1, confirming that it was properly folded (data not shown).</p><p>Finally we tested the activity of human ARNO, a GEF known to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Arf6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Frank1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to Sec7 and Syt1, human ARNO stimulated nucleotide exchange on yeast Arf3 by approximately 11-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000842-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that although Yel1 and ARNO are only distantly related at the sequence level, they may share a conserved mode of action towards the Arf6 family of small G proteins that is not shared by other Arf GEFs.</p><p>In summary this paper describes the identification of Yel1 as a new guanine nucleotide exchange factor in yeast. This GEF is specific for yeast Arf3, a small plasma membrane localised G protein orthologous to the well-studied mammalian protein, Arf6. Over the past several years the number of exchange factors for Arf6 has been steadily growing and the list now includes GEFs from the BRAG (IQSEC), cytohesin (PSCD) and EFA6 (PSD) families. Why there are such a diverse set of exchange factors for Arf6 and how they regulate a single small G protein remain open questions. Moreover the relative contribution of each of these GEFs towards Arf6 function is complicated by the fact that most experiments are performed in the presence of other Arf6-specific GEFs. Regions of Yel1, particularly in the C-terminal half of the protein, share significant homology with EFA6. This suggests that the EFA6/Yel1 family of GEFs are more evolutionarily ancient Arf6 exchange factors than the other families found in mammals. Thus the identification of a single exchange factor for Arf3 may provide a useful tool for examining EFA6-like proteins in the absence of competing GEFs.</p><p>Arf3 and Yel1 co-localise in the emerging bud. However upon loss of Yel1, Arf3 is not only mis-localised to the cytosol but also loses its polarised distribution and is, instead, dissipated weakly around the plasma membrane. It is tempting to speculate that the low levels of residual membrane bound Arf3-GFP observed in the <italic>yel1&#x00394;</italic> strain represent an inactive form of the protein which is only loosely associated with the membrane and that it is the presence of the GEF that recruits Arf3-GFP into the bud. Indeed a recent paper reported that a GDP-locked, inactive mutant of human Arf6 also targets to the cell surface, leading the authors to suggest that GDP/GTP exchange on Arf6 occurs after the protein has bound to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Macia1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The precise role of Arf3 in yeast is, at present, unclear. A direct link between Arf3 and a component of the endocytic machinery, Lsb5, has recently been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Costa2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover Arf3 has been linked to actin cable and cortical patch formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Lambert1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Zakrzewska1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Others have argued against a role in endocytosis and instead implicate Arf3 solely in the establishment of cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000842-Huang2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Neither role need be mutually exclusive but since the function of Arf3 remains controversial we can only speculate as to the role of Yel1. As mentioned above since the distribution of Arf3 reflects the distribution of Yel1, the simplest function for Yel1 would be to localise and stimulate GTP-binding on Arf3 in the correct place for it to perform its tasks. This implies that there must be mechanisms in place to ensure a polarised distribution of Yel1. These interactions may well be stabilised by the contributions of the PH domain and C-terminal coiled-coil region but clearly our data shows that additional targeting information is required. It will be important to determine precisely how Yel1 is targeted to the emerging bud, and as such how this regulates the polarisation of Arf3 at this site.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Yeast strains and <italic>media</italic></title><p>All yeast strains were based on BY4741 (<italic>MATa his3</italic>&#x00394;<italic>1 leu2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>0 met15</italic>&#x00394;<italic>0 ura3</italic>&#x00394;<italic>0</italic>) or deletion strains within this background from the EUROSCARF consortium (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000842-t001">Table 1</xref>).
