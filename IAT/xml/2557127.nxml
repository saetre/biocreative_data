The current study examined the role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in ischemia-induced pathological angiogenesis called neovascularization during postnatal development. IL-10 deficiency resulted in significantly reduced pathological retinal angiogenesis. In contrast to the choroicapillaris where IL-10 interferes with macrophage influx, IL-10 did not prevent anti-angiogenic macrophages from migrating to the retina in response to hypoxia. Instead, IL-10 promoted retinal angiogenesis by altering macrophage angiogenic function, as macrophages from wild-type mice demonstrated increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO) compared to IL-10 deficient macrophages. IL-10 appears to directly affect macrophage responsiveness to hypoxia, as macrophages responded to hypoxia with increased levels of IL-10 and STAT3 phosphorylation as opposed to IL-10 deficient macrophages. Also, IL-10 deficient macrophages inhibited the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells in response to hypoxia while wild-type macrophages failed to do so. These findings suggest that hypoxia guides macrophage behavior to a pro-angiogenic phenotype via IL-10 activated pathways.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Angiogenesis is a critical process in maintaining tissue homeostasis during numerous physiological functions, such as wound-healing, reproduction, and embryonic development. However, unbridled angiogenesis can result in fulminant host disease. Abnormal angiogenesis is critical to the pathophysiology of diverse disease processes such as atherosclerotic heart disease and several cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Nakao1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Taylor1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Hansson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the eye, this becomes especially important as abnormal angiogenesis (neovascularization) leads to blindness in several disease processes. Intraocular neovascularization, as characterized by abnormal retinal or choroidal angiogenesis, is a major cause of decreased vision in patients with diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR): the leading cause of blindness in working adults, age-related macular degeneration (AMD): the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP): the leading cause of blindness in premature infants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Yoshida1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Prasad1">5</xref>.

Current laser ablation treatment for PDR has changed little over the 50 years since its first inception, and is applied only after onset of neovascularization. Although it reduces the risk of severe vision loss, laser photocoagulation reduces peripheral and night vision, and is uncomfortable and expensive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Gariano1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. There is recent evidence that the pathobiology of PDR is more complex. Immunological mechanisms, including exudation, upregulation of inflammatory mediators, and immune cell infiltration have been implicated in PDR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Adamis1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Retinopathy of prematurity blinds 50,000 newborn babies annually worldwide. Peripheral retinal ischemia and the cessation of normal retinal vessel growth leads to compensatory angiogenesis, tractional retinal detachment, and blindness. Although diseases resulting in ocular neovascularization differ in many aspects, it is believed that tissue ischemia is the underlying cause leading to compensatory angiogenesis. Tissue ischemia can also result in cellular inflammation, including the infiltration of macrophages to the site of ischemia.</p><p>Macrophages carry out a wide variety of biological functions, including participation in neovascularization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Sunderkotter1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Macrophages can exhibit both pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic functions. This dual function of macrophages seems to be largely dependent upon the polarization of macrophages. Polarization, in turn, seems to be regulated by the production of cytokines in the resident tissue micro-milieu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Kelly1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Mantovani1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Sica1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Mosser1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Macrophages stimulated in the presence of interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produce high levels IL-12, IL-23, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), and low levels of IL-10. This &#x0201c;classically-activated&#x0201d; macrophage, or M1 macrophage, displays an anti-angiogenic phenotype, and plays an important role in anti-bacterial and pro-inflammatory functions. Macrophages stimulated in the presence of IL-10, IL-4, or IL-13 produce high levels of IL-10 and low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;. These &#x0201c;alternatively-activated&#x0201d; macrophages, or M2 macrophages, are pro-angiogenic. Of these cytokines, IL-10 may possess the most significant influence on the polarization of macrophages and their ability to regulate angiogenesis in the eye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Kelly1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Apte1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>AMD is a disease of the elderly characterized by blindness that is secondary to post-developmental choroidal angiogenesis.

The initial exposure to high oxygen levels causes central retinal vascular growth to slow or cease completely, and also causes developed retinal vessels to regress. As the pup then matures in a normoxic environment, the non-vascularized retina becomes increasingly metabolically active. The absence of adequate vascularization leads to tissue ischemia and hypoxia. This results in compensatory retinal neovascularization. To measure retinal neovascularization, P17 animals were perfused with FITC-dextran, eyes were harvested, and retinal flatmounts were made.

Therefore, the localized expression of VEGF on macrophages may be influencing the development of retinal blood vessels.

This suggests that when immunocompetent macrophages infiltrate hypoxic regions such as the retina in OIR, the IL-10 signaling pathway is induced. Flow cytometric analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation was confirmed by western blot examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003381-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). RAW macrophages treated with either recombinant IL-10 protein (100 ng/ml) for 10 minutes or hypoxia for 24 hours demonstrated increased phosphorylation of STAT3.

In contrast to previous reports that analyzed the regulation of choroidal macrophages by IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Apte1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, IL-10 did not prevent the infiltration of macrophages into the retina, but rather polarized the macrophage genetic profile towards a pro-angiogenic phenotype. This difference in IL-10 function may be attributable to the local tissue micro milieu, as the hypoxic drive and regional soluble and membrane-bound signals in diverse vascular beds may differ, i.e. the retinal vasculature versus the choriocapillaris. Although IL-10 promotes angiogenesis by preventing the infiltration of anti-angiogenic macrophages into the choroid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Apte1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, this study suggests that in the retina, IL-10 promotes angiogenesis by directly polarizing macrophages towards a pro-angiogenic phenotype. Unlike choroidal neovascularization, hypoxia or ischemia is the prime driver of retinal and pre-retinal neovascularization observed in diabetic retinopathy and ROP. Hypoxia induces a profound change in the phenotype of macrophages. A recent study demonstrated that more than 30 pro-angiogenic genes were upregulated by hypoxia in primary macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-White1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, including VEGF and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Most of the work on hypoxia and macrophages has focused on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Macrophages have been shown to accumulate in hypoxic regions of tumors, and secrete multiple growth factors and pro-angiogenic cytokines that promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune evasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Lewis1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reveals that hypoxia and IL-10 function synergistically to influence macrophage function and angiogenic homeostasis. It is also noteworthy that the pro-angiogenic effects of hypoxic macrophages are IL-10 dependent and require IL-10 mediated signal transduction.</p><p>The diverse and complex regulation of angiogenesis by IL-10 is highlighted by the finding that in a mouse model of post-developmental surgically-induced hindlimb ischemia, IL-10 appears to function in an anti-angiogenic manner, and does so by downregulating VEGF expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Silvestre1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings illustrate the multifaceted role of IL-10 in regulating angiogenesis. The vascular bed and the tissue type likely have a profound impact on the ability of IL-10 to regulate macrophage behavior after tissue injury. The success of anti-IL-10 immunotherapy in our studies of mice during OIR was achieved by systemic depletion of IL-10 by intraperitoneal injection. If IL-10 immunotherapy is to be translated to humans as a potential treatment modality for retinopathy, local intraocular injection of anti-IL-10 antibodies or other IL-10 inhibitors, similar to anti-VEGF injections for AMD patients, may be desirable to minimize the systemic effects in non-ocular vascular beds.</p><p>The role of IL-10 in the induction of developmental angiogenesis seems to be a highly choreographed process involving multiple factors. Interestingly, all of the genes that were upregulated in macrophages following oxygen-induced retinopathy were found to be 1) significantly upregulated in C57BL/6 macrophages and not in IL-10 deficient macrophages, 2) proangiogenic, and 3) cross regulative. IL-10 has previously been shown to upregulate NO production in activated macrophages in a dose dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003381-Jacobs1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our findings demonstrate that this increase in NOS2 expression in the retina may be attributable to infiltrating retinal macrophages. The relationship between nitric oxide and VEGF is highly complex.

For flow cytometric analysis, cells were fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (Becton Dickinson). Cells were then stained with either rabbit IgG (2 &#x000b5;g/ml; Sigma) or rabbit anti-phospho STAT3 (1&#x02236;500; Sigma), followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (2 &#x000b5;g/ml; Sigma). Macrophages stimulated with recombinant murine IL-10 (100 ng/ml; R&#x00026;D Systems) for 10 min were used as a positive control for staining. Cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Results were analyzed using CellQuest v.3.1f software (BD Biosciences). For examination of STAT3 phosphorylation by western blot, normoxic and hypoxic macrophages were lysed with Triton X-100 buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM 1&#x00025; Triton X-100), run on SDS-PAGE (10&#x00025; NuPAGE gel from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (150 mAmp for 90 min). The membrane was incubated with 5&#x00025; nonfat dry milk for 1 h and washed three times for 10 min each with TBS-T. The blot was then incubated either with anti-phospho STAT3 (Cell Signaling Tech., Danvers, MA) or anti-STAT3 (Sigma) and then washed with TBS-T three times.
