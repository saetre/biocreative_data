In the kidney, the nephron is the functional organ unit. Each nephron is an epithelial tubule that is subdivided into discrete segments with specific transport functions. Little is known about how nephron segments are defined or how segments acquire their distinctive morphology and cell shape. Using live, in vivo cell imaging of the forming zebrafish pronephric nephron, we found that the migration of fully differentiated epithelial cells accounts for both the final position of nephron segment boundaries and the characteristic convolution of the proximal tubule. Pronephric cells maintain adherens junctions and polarized apical brush border membranes while they migrate collectively. Individual tubule cells exhibit basal membrane protrusions in the direction of movement and appear to establish transient, phosphorylated Focal Adhesion Kinase&#x02013;positive adhesions to the basement membrane. Cell migration continued in the presence of camptothecin, indicating that cell division does not drive migration. Lengthening of the nephron was, however, accompanied by an increase in tubule cell number, specifically in the most distal, <italic>ret1</italic>-positive nephron segment. The initiation of cell migration coincided with the onset of fluid flow in the pronephros. Complete blockade of pronephric fluid flow prevented cell migration and proximal nephron convolution. Selective blockade of proximal, filtration-driven fluid flow shifted the position of tubule convolution distally and revealed a role for cilia-driven fluid flow in persistent migration of distal nephron cells. We conclude that nephron morphogenesis is driven by fluid flow&#x02013;dependent, collective epithelial cell migration within the confines of the tubule basement membrane. Our results establish intimate links between nephron function, fluid flow, and morphogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The kidney's job is to maintain blood ion and metabolite concentrations in a narrow range that supports the function of all other organs. Blood is filtered and essential solutes are recovered in a structure called the nephron. Human kidneys have one million nephrons, while simpler kidneys like the zebrafish larval kidney have only two. Nephrons are segmented epithelial tubules; each segment takes on a particular shape (such as convoluted, straight, or U-shaped) and plays a specific role in recovering filtered solutes. How the nephron is proportioned into segments and how some tubule segments become convoluted is not known. This work takes advantage of the simple zebrafish kidney to image living cells during nephron formation. Unexpectedly, we found that nephron cells are actively migrating &#x0201c;upstream&#x0201d; toward the filtering end of the nephron. The cells remain connected to each other and migrate as an intact tube. This is similar to a process called &#x0201c;collective cell migration.&#x0201d; We find that collective cell migration establishes the final position of nephron segment boundaries and drives convolution of the tubule. We also find that cell migration is dependent on fluid flow in the tubules, supporting the idea that organ function is important in defining its final form.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Epithelial cell shape, tubule convolution, and segment boundary position along the kidney nephron unexpectedly involve the migration of fully differentiated epithelial cells against the flow of lumenal fluid.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Vasilyev A, Liu Y, Mudumana S, Mangos S, Lam P-Y, et al.

Basal surfaces of tubule segments exhibiting movement were positive for phospho-FAK by antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000009-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), further supporting the idea that basal cell protrusions were associated with adhesion to the tubule basement membrane. The migration of epithelial cells often involves a transition to a more mesenchymal phenotype and loss of cell&#x02013;cell adhesion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. We examined migrating cells by electron microscopy and found instead that the pronephric epithelial cells remained fully polarized with brush border membranes and joined together by adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000009-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Interestingly, we also observed that a majority of cells extended lamellipodia along the tubule basement membrane at their forward edge and under the cell in front (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000009-g003">Figure 3</xref>C; white arrowheads and inset). In electron microscopy of one complete tubule, 21 out of 32 basal cell junctions studied (66&#x00025;) showed forward-directed basal lamellipodia. Thus, tubule epithelial cells maintain apical connections to their neighbors in front and behind while exhibiting free movement of their basal surfaces, engaging in a form of collective cell migration.</p><fig id="pbio-1000009-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Pronephric Epithelial Cell Migration</title><p>(A) Time-lapse images of an individual pronephric multiciliated cell in a 2.5 dpf CD41:GFP transgenic fish at 20-min intervals.

Measurements of the pronephros did reveal a steady lengthening of the tubule over the period of observation (1,264 &#x000b1; 15 &#x003bc;m at 48 hpf (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9 tubules); 1,564 &#x000b1; 25 &#x003bc;m at 96 hpf (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 7 tubules)) however we did not observe a significant &#x0201c;thinning&#x0201d; of cells in the distal segment. We therefore asked whether the lengthening of the distal segment was accompanied by an increase in the number of cells in that segment. We examined the total number of DAPI-stained nuclei in the distal, <italic>ret1</italic>:GFP-positive segment, comparing embryos at 36 hpf and at 4 dpf. The number of <italic>ret1</italic>:GFP cells doubled over this time period (207 nuclei at 36 hpf to 411 at 4 dpf). This increase in cell number was proportional to the increase in length of the <italic>ret1</italic>-GFP positive segment (from 286 &#x003bc;m to 570 &#x003bc;m). In contrast, the number of proximal, ET33-D10-GFP&#x02013;positive cells did not change significantly over the same time window (208 nuclei at 36 hpf to 242 nuclei at 4 dpf), whereas the length of the GFP-positive domain shortened from 662 &#x003bc;m to 300 &#x003bc;m. This compression of the proximal segment without a change in cell number is consistent with the transition from a cuboidal to columnar cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000009-g003">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000009-g003">3</xref>E). To test whether disproportionate cell proliferation in the distal nephron segment played a role in stimulating forward migration by &#x0201c;pushing&#x0201d; cells proximally, we imaged tubules in embryos incubated in the presence of 60 &#x003bc;M camptothecin to block cell proliferation. Short-term (&#x0003c;8 h) treatment of the embryos with camptothecin had no effect on the migration rate of the pronephric epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000009-sv009">Video S9</xref>). Camptothecin incubation of a similar duration arrested early embryo development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000009-sg002">Figure S2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000009-sg002">S2</xref>D) and blocked BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000009-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000009-sg002">S2</xref>B), indicating that it effectively blocked cell division. We conclude the following: (1) proximal-directed cell migration is not driven by distal cell proliferation, but (2) the lengthening of the distal nephron segment is compensated by cell proliferation and (3) compression of the proximal tubule occurs without significant cell proliferation in this segment.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Initiation of Cell Migration Correlates with Onset of Tubule Fluid Flow</title><p>In our time-lapse studies we observed that prior to 24 hpf or after 4 dpf, epithelial cells migrated at a slow rate (&#x0003c;2 &#x003bc;m/h, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000009-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000009-g004">4</xref>D).

We have shown that nephron tubule patterning and morphology is controlled by a process of collective cell migration where differentiated, polarized kidney epithelial cells move en masse in a proximal direction toward the glomerulus. Our results also show that the initial definition of nephron segments associated with the expression of distinct transgenic markers and sets of ion transporter genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; is complete early in nephron formation and that the ultimate position of nephron segment boundaries and tubule convolution is a function of tubule cell migration. Kidney tubule cell migration is, in turn, controlled by fluid flow within the nephron, demonstrating an essential relationship between organ morphogenesis and organ function.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Collective Cell Migration and Kidney Organogenesis</title><p>Collective cell migration describes the coherent movement of cell groups, while the cells themselves remain connected by cell&#x02013;cell junctions and maintain constant positions while migrating &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

In each of these cases, epithelial cells adhere to each other by apical adherens junctions, while their basal surfaces are free to engage in dynamic, directed lamellipodial extensions associated with matrix adhesion. In wounded monolayers, basal lamellipodia are seen not only in leading edge cells but also in cells behind the edge, indicating that these cells are also actively involved in maintaining the migration of the monolayer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, we found that kidney epithelial cells along the entire mid-portion of the nephron maintain cell&#x02013;cell attachments while they extend basal lamellipodia in the direction of migration. This suggests that all tubule cells in this segment are actively involved in proximal migration as opposed to being passively &#x0201c;pulled along&#x0201d; by a smaller group of actively motile leading cells. Alternatively, it remains possible that a subset of proximal cells convey directional information to more distal cells and organize their proximal-directed migration by way of mechanical forces applied to cell&#x02013;cell contacts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Unlike the case of migrating lateral line primordia and wound healing in monolayers, in the pronephros, there is no free leading edge to the epithelial cell group that directs other cells to fill a gap or area of open matrix. Instead, all kidney tubule cells migrate proximally and compress cells at the leading edge into a columnar morphology, distorting tubule shape and creating the characteristic convolutions of the proximal tubule. Convolution of the proximal tubule also occurs in the mammalian kidney, where proximal tubule cells appear compressed and are more columnar in shape whereas in the more distal nephron, the cells are low cuboidal in shape &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. The similarities in cell morphology between mammalian and zebrafish nephrons raise the intriguing possibility that collective cell migration of tubular epithelial cells may be a general feature of vertebrate kidney morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Fluid Shear Forces and Organogenesis</title><p>Collective cell migration in the zebrafish pronephros required lumenal fluid flow, suggesting that fluid shear stress in the tubule lumen may be essential for nephron morphogenesis. Similar arguments have been made for biomechanical effects of fluid shear forces on cardiac morphogenesis. Physical obstruction of the cardiac inflow tract results in heart chamber malformation, decreased heart looping, and atrioventricular (AV) valve malformation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. The absence of endocardial cushions in blocked hearts lead Hove et al. to suggest that fluid shear stress was essential for the early steps in cardiac valve formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Subsequent studies using pharmacological inhibition of heart function have suggested an alternative mechanism of endocardial cushion formation that involves myocardial contractions per se, independent of shear forces &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. We have previously presented evidence implicating fluid shear force in morphogenesis of the glomerulus in zebrafish &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.

Endothelial cells sense and respond to fluid shear using a system of adhesion molecules including PECAM and VE-cadherin, integrin activation, activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, calcium influx, and modulation of the cytoskeleton by Rho family GTPases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Fluid shear first induces lamellipodial cell extensions followed by basal protrusions and new focal adhesion formation in the direction of flow, which are controlled by polarized distribution of rac and cdc42 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

Migration of pronephric epithelial cells is likely to involve similar basic mechanisms. For instance, we observe a strong correlation between the presence of directed lamellipodial extensions of epithelial cells on the tubule basement membranes and basal phospho-FAK staining, suggesting that pronephric epithelial cells actively remodel their matrix attachments as they migrate. It is also likely that specific integrin subunits are required for pronephric cell migration, as they are in endothelial cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. A notable difference between pronephric cell migration and endothelial cell migration is that pronephric cells migrate against flow instead of in the direction of flow. The similarities and differences between these two systems are likely to prove useful in resolving how mechanical forces establish self-perpetuating cell movement.</p><p>It is currently not clear how kidney epithelial cells might initially sense and respond to fluid flow. Manipulation of two known members of the mechanosensory TRP ion channel family, <italic>polycystin2</italic> and <italic>trpM7</italic>, did not conclusively link motility to TRP channel activity. <italic>polycystin2</italic> morphants have an obstructed phenotype &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, which precludes the analysis of Polycystin2 in fluid flow sensing. Also, <italic>polycystin2</italic> morphant tubule cells continue to move in a circumferential fashion, similar to other obstructed models, indicating that <italic>polycystin2</italic> is not required for motility <italic>per se</italic>. Knockdown of <italic>jagged2</italic> re-patterns the nephron and eliminates <italic>trpM7</italic> expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;; however, this did not affect the extent of tubule cell migration (unpublished data). Further studies will be required to determine whether mechanosensory channels are involved in tubule cell migration, or whether shear forces are detected by other mechanisms, as has been described in endothelial cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000009-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>While the data is compelling for a role of shear stress in nephron epithelial cell migration, an alternative mechanism for stimulation of motility could involve the delivery of a chemotactic peptide to the nephron lumen by glomerular filtration or secretion that is then carried down the nephron by fluid flow. Nephron epithelial cells could internalize or otherwise inactivate such a ligand and establish a linear concentration gradient along the length of the nephron. While we cannot completely rule out this potential mechanism, aspects of our data suggest that it is unlikely. First, elimination of glomerular fluid input by blocking cardiac contractions did not prevent cell migration in distal nephron segments. This indicates that delivery of a chemotactic peptide by glomerular filtration is not required for distal cell motility. If a hypothetical chemoattractant were instead secreted by the epithelial cells themselves, the <italic>silent heart/tnnt2</italic> morphant data would indicate that proximal tubules do not secrete the factor, since these cells are not motile in <italic>tnnt2</italic> morphants. However, proximal tubule cells are highly motile in normal embryos with filtration-driven fluid flow. Also, it is difficult to imagine how a gradient of secreted chemoattractant could generate the circumferential cell movement observed in obstructed nephrons. It is more likely (but not proven) that this curious cell behavior could result from local vortex fluid forces generated by cilia beating in the tubule lumen. Indeed, we consistently observed the presence of such vortex currents in obstructed kidneys as evidenced by the movement of lumenal debris (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Collective Cell Migration and Kidney Pathology</title><p>Does collective cell migration play a role in organ pathology and tissue repair?

A reduction in filtration-driven nephron fluid flow would be expected in this context, again raising the possibility that failure to stimulate fluid flow and cell migration could contribute to nephron pathology.
