Healthy individuals frequently develop asymptomatic or mild infection with <italic>C. neoformans </italic>while humans with impaired host defenses may progress to severe pneumonia and potentially fatal meningoencephalitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Natural infection is believed to occur via inhalation and is usually caused by an encapsulated cryptococcal strain, although recent investigations have reported similar clinical disease caused by acapsular yeast forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The use of animal models such as genetically engineered or naturally mutant mice have shown that the protective host immune response against <italic>C. neoformans </italic>requires type 1 helper T (Th1)-cell mediated immunity characterized by activation of CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells and secretion of the Th1-related cytokines gamma interferon (IFN-&#x003b3;), IL-12, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A variety of other cell populations including B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], natural killer (NK), NKT, gamma-delta antigen receptor-bearing T (&#x003b3;&#x003b4;T) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have also been implicated in the host immune response against <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Furthermore, several investigations have defined a major role for lung alveolar macrophages in the initial host response against <italic>C. neoformans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. While there is little doubt that the alveolar macrophage is a key mediator of host immunity against <italic>C. neoformans </italic>and other pulmonary pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the role of pulmonary epithelial cells in resistance to cryptococcal infection has not been well-characterized.</p><p>The lung epithelium represents much more than a simple protective physical barrier between the external environment and underlying tissues. In fact, both constitutive and inducible defense mechanisms of the airway lining are now recognized as fundamental elements of an effective antimicrobial environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The role of the airway lining as a highly responsive and multifunctional interface in the host innate immune response against various microorganisms has been summarized in several recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>C. neoformans </italic>has been shown to bind to the A549 human alveolar cell line in a time- and temperature-dependent manner, with apparent internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This report demonstrated that factors such as yeast culture age and <italic>in vitro </italic>growth conditions influenced lung epithelial cell binding by various strains of <italic>C. neoformans </italic>and showed greater adherence to A549 cells in the absence of a polysaccharide capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Using the same cell line, another group recently reported that purified GXM, the major capsular component of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, could induce IL-8 secretion after binding to the CD14 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Finally, the multifunctional enzyme secretory phospholipase B (PLB1) has also been shown to play a role in the adhesion process of <italic>C. neoformans </italic>to the alveolar epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies characterizing the interaction between <italic>C. neoformans </italic>and cells of the airway lining that represent a first site of contact for airborne pathogens. Therefore, we investigated the ability of immortalized and normal human bronchial epithelial cells to trigger a host inflammatory response to viable <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. We found that BEAS-2B cells produced the potent chemokine IL-8 in an AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B dependent manner when stimulated with acapsular <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. The presence of acapsular <italic>C. neoformans </italic>also led to an increase in expression of the chemokine CXCL1 as well as the transcription factor CAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBP/&#x003b2;). Primary Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial cells also secreted more IL-8 and exhibited significantly greater cell damage in response to acapsular <italic>C. neoformans </italic>compared to stimulation with an encapsulated strain. Together these data clearly demonstrate that airway epithelial cells mount a strong inflammatory response to <italic>C. neoformans </italic>that is modulated by the presence of the polysaccharide capsule.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>F-12K nutrient mixture (Kaighn's modification), penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and trypsin-EDTA were from GIBCO Life Technologies, Ltd (Paisley, UK).

A previously established technique to analyze the association and uptake of serotype A <italic>C. neoformans </italic>by human peripheral blood monocytes was then used to examine whether acapsular <italic>C. neoformans </italic>could be internalized by BEAS-2B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We initially confirmed the efficacy of trypan blue to quench fluorescently labeled acapsular <italic>C. neoformans</italic>; FITC-labeled <italic>C. neoformans </italic>cells were homogenously fluorescent (99.5%) and this signal was almost completely eliminated (97.5%) by 200 &#x003bc;g/ml of trypan blue (data not shown). Incubation of BEAS-2B cells with FITC-labeled acapsular <italic>C. neoformans </italic>grown at RT or 37&#x000b0;C led to an increase in fluorescence (FL1-H) for 7.5% and 10.4% of BEAS-2B cells grown at RT or 37&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>, respectively).

To more closely model conditions of authentic infection, a moderately virulent encapsulated clinical isolate, strain 52D, was used to stimulate primary cells. The NHBE cells used in this study were derived from a single male donor and had been extensively tested to exclude the presence of infectious agents.

A high serologic prevalence in certain geographic regions despite low clinical infection rates suggests that in many cases the initial infection is mild or completely asymptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the human lung, the host response to <italic>C. neoformans </italic>is presumed to start with alveolar macrophage activation, followed by the release of cytokines and chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells to the site of infection. In order for this interaction to occur, <italic>C. neoformans </italic>must transit the airways prior to reaching the alveolus, yet the responsiveness and contribution of the airway epithelium to host defense against cryptococcal infection is not well understood. The cells that line these passages have been increasingly recognized as an essential component of the host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The current study has shown that the interaction of <italic>C. neoformans </italic>with bronchial epithelial cells activates the expression of both transcription factors and chemokines that have well-established roles in host defense.</p><p>As an initial step in the investigation of human lung epithelial responses to viable <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, we selected the SV-40 immortalized BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cell line that is derived from normal human tissue and capable of microbial recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. For a primary measure of cell activation, we quantified the secretion of IL-8, a prototypical neutrophil chemokine. Interestingly, we observed significant IL-8 secretion only when the BEAS-2B cell line was stimulated with an acapsular form of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Acapsular cryptococci exhibited a stable association with BEAS-2B cells that was resistant to enzymatic treatment with trypsin as well as various physical manipulations including washing and centrifugation of cell cultures. The well known anti-phagocytic and immunomodulatory properties of the polysaccharide capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] are a plausible explanation for the absence of significant IL-8 release by BEAS-2B cells following stimulation with encapsulated <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, as well as the lack of visible fungal-host cell association under these conditions. In addition to the acapsular state, we observed that <italic>C. neoformans </italic>must be grown <italic>in vitro </italic>at 37&#x000b0;C in order to elicit IL-8 secretion by BEAS-2B cells. Environmental cues including temperature are well-known regulators of <italic>C. neoformans </italic>signal transduction that in turn influence microbial growth as well as virulence in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These data suggest that one or more temperature-regulated microbial factors distinct from GXM are required for activation of BEAS-2B cells. Alternatively, the <italic>in vitro </italic>cell aggregation that was observed at 37&#x000b0;C may also have contributed to the activation of BEAS-2B cells, possibly through coalescence or cross-linking of cryptococcal host cell surface receptors. This <italic>in vitro </italic>phenomenon has also been described for various other strains of <italic>C. neoformans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and has been associated with increased adherence as well as phagocytosis by mouse macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. On the basis of these initial observations, we chose to focus subsequent investigations on the interaction of BEAS-2B cells with acapsular <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.</p><p>Internalization of <italic>C. neoformans </italic>by the A549 alveolar cell line has been demonstrated by two previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In one case, host cell damage following internalization of an encapsulated serotype A clinical isolate was also documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To determine whether BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells are also capable of fungal internalization, we first examined differentially stained co-cultures of <italic>C. neoformans </italic>and BEAS-2B cells by light microscopy. Despite the stable fungal-host cell interaction described above, no clear evidence of fungal internalization was directly visible. We then used a more sensitive flow cytometry technique combined with quenching of trypan blue dye to examine the interaction of BEAS-2B cells with FITC-labeled acapsular <italic>C. neoformans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A clear increase in mean fluorescence intensity of BEAS-2B cells was observed following incubation with labeled cryptococci that were grown at 20&#x000b0; or at 37&#x000b0;C, verifying stable fungal binding in both conditions. The observation that only a minority of cells exhibited an increase in fluorescent signal may be attributable to partial disruption of fungal-host cell interactions by the washing, trypsinization, and centrifugation steps used to prepare the sample for cytometry. Quenching of fluorescence was almost complete for cryptococci grown at 20&#x000b0;C, a finding that is indicative of an extracellular fungal location. Interestingly, the residual fluorescence observed with fungi grown at 37&#x000b0;C indicates that they were either very tightly associated with the cell surface or may have been internalized by BEAS-2B cells. The extent of this process appeared to be quite limited as only a small percentage of fungi retained the trypan blue label. Further studies using a more detailed direct visualization technique such as electron microscopy will be required to confirm and discriminate between these two possibilities. Finally, limited damage of BEAS-2B cells by acapsular <italic>C. neoformans </italic>grown at 20&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000b0;C was observed by measurement of the intracellular enzyme LDH in cell supernatants following co-incubation.</p><p>In order to identify the signaling pathways that mediate IL-8 release by BEAS-2B cells in response to cryptococci, we performed transient transfections of a luciferase reporter plasmid downstream of the wild type human IL-8 promoter or engineered constructs bearing mutations of the NF-&#x003ba;B or AP-1 transcription factor binding sites. Compared to the wild type promoter sequence, luciferase activity was reduced for each of the mutant plasmids, demonstrating a role for both of these transcription factors in the up-regulation of IL-8 by <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. These observations are consistent with known regulation of IL-8 by other microbial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We also detected up-regulation of several other inflammatory genes by <italic>C. neoformans </italic>in human BEAS-2B cells using an oligonucleotide microarray and confirmed the hybridization data by conventional and real-time PCR for CXCL1 and CEBP/&#x003b2;. CXCL1 has already been shown to be involved in leukocyte recruitment in mouse models of <italic>C. neoformans </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], indicating that activation of this chemokine is likely to be conserved between mice and humans. CEBP/&#x003b2; is expressed by alveolar and bronchial epithelium and is particularly involved in acute lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Interestingly, CEBP/&#x003b2; is also known to bind the IL-8 promoter in lung epithelial cells and activate transcription in a cooperative manner with NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1, CEBP/&#x003b2; activation in BEAS-2B cells upon stimulation with <italic>C. neoformans </italic>may also contribute to the up-regulation of IL-8 expression.</p><p>In order to confirm the authenticity of the observations that were obtained using BEAS-2B cells, we studied the effect of viable <italic>C. neoformans </italic>on primary NHBE cells that had not been subject to viral immortalization or serial <italic>in vitro </italic>passage. We found that primary NHBE cells were highly responsive to stimulation with <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Specifically, for all experimental conditions tested (capsular or acapsular strains grown either at RT or 37&#x000b0;C), <italic>C. neoformans </italic>was able to stimulate the secretion of IL-8 and the expression of CXCL1 by NHBE. The highest level of IL-8 secretion was observed in response to acapsular <italic>C. neoformans </italic>grown <italic>in vitro </italic>at 37&#x000b0;C. At the mRNA level, CXCL1 expression did not appear to be influenced by <italic>in vitro </italic>growth conditions; however, this result does not exclude the possibility that both IL-8 and CXCL1 protein expression are coordinately regulated in response to <italic>C. neoformans </italic>stimulation. The confirmation of IL-8 protein secretion and CXCL1 up-regulation in NHBE strongly suggests that human bronchial epithelium recognizes <italic>C. neoformans </italic>and is capable of activating an <italic>in vivo </italic>host inflammatory response. Despite the observation that NHBE appeared to be responsive to capsular <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, growth of this organism at 37&#x000b0;C significantly diminished the magnitude of IL-8 secretion, suggesting that primary human epithelial cells respond to temperature dependent changes in fungal metabolism. Primary NHBE were also most susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, especially when stimulated with the acapsular form that had been cultured at 37&#x000b0;C. Encapsulated <italic>C. neoformans </italic>elicited very little LDH from NHBE compared to acapsular form, regardless of whether it was cultivated at room temperature or 37&#x000b0;C. The fact that both chemokine activation and cell damage were reduced in the presence of the cryptococcal polysaccharide capsule points to an immunomodulatory role for GXM at the airway lining. It is tempting to speculate that following cryptococcal inhalation, induction of the GXM polysaccharide capsule expression in response to a change from ambient environmental conditions to human body temperature could facilitate the initial stage of fungal growth in the airways by modifying or diminishing the inflammatory response of the bronchial epithelium. Although the precise mechanism by which capsule alters the host response is not known, one possibility is that the presence of GXM polysaccharide modulates the interaction of cryptococcal surface or secreted structures with the bronchial epithelium. This relative suppression of host immunity mediated by <italic>C. neoformans </italic>might, in some cases, favor the development of progressive pulmonary infection. Finally, the observation that IL-8 secretion and cell damage were greatest for NHBE at 37&#x000b0;C also suggests that <italic>C. neoformans </italic>expresses unidentified, temperature-regulated structures potentially involved in pathogenesis.</p><p>Our data clearly demonstrate that both the immortalized BEAS-2B cell line and primary NHBE cells are activated by <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Using either cell source, acapsular <italic>C. neoformans </italic>grown at 37&#x000b0;C elicited the maximal secretion of IL-8 and induced the greatest degree of cell damage. Transcriptional up regulation of CXCL1 was also exhibited by primary and immortalized cells in response to <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. The NHBE cells used in our report were somewhat more permissive to IL-8 secretion by encapsulated <italic>C. neoformans </italic>compared to BEAS-2B cells that were only activated by acapsular <italic>C. neoformans </italic>grown at 37&#x000b0;C. One other notable difference between primary and immortalized bronchial cells was the lack of CEBP/&#x003b2; up regulation by <italic>C. neoformans </italic>in NHBE. The precise reasons for these variations are not known but may be attributable either to the immortalization and maintenance of the BEAS-2B cell line or the inherent variability among human donors. Since the current data is derived from the study of cells from a single individual, it will be important to confirm these observations using a larger number of primary human samples.</p><p>In the lung, the inflammatory response of epithelial cells is likely integrated with alveolar macrophages to rapidly generate an innate immune response against <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. In this study, the amplitude of the IL-8 response was substantial, though relatively limited in comparison to highly pathogenic bacteria or viruses such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] or influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], respectively. This modest inflammatory activation of the airway epithelium is consistent with the subtle clinical manifestations that are characteristic of cryptococcal respiratory tract infection in humans and may be one mechanism by which cryptococci are able to establish a latent infective state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In contrast to studies with the A549 alveolar cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], our results indicate that cryptococcal GXM polysaccharide down-regulates the activation of bronchial epithelial cells. We speculate that the acute inflammatory response may be even more limited among immune compromised hosts, resulting in insufficient airway cellular recruitment and a predisposition to the development of disseminated disease. Interestingly, modest IL-8 release was also recently demonstrated following the interaction of A549 cells with mycelial fragments and spores of <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Taken together, these observations suggest that <italic>C. neoformans </italic>and perhaps other pathogenic fungi may escape the pulmonary innate immune response due to the limited extent of airway epithelial cell activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Primary as well as immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells secrete IL-8 and up regulate the expression of CXCL1 following <italic>C. neoformans </italic>exposure. In addition, bronchial epithelial cells are susceptible to damage when stimulated with cryptococci. Activation and host airway cell damage appears to be modulated by capsule expression and the growth temperature of the infecting yeast. These host responses are very likely to represent an important component of the pulmonary innate immunity against this opportunistic pathogen.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LG participated in the design of the study, performed cell culture and flow cytometry experiments, and drafted the manuscript.
