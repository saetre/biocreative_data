Because the pathophysiology underlying azoospermia is not elucidated, most male infertility is diagnosed as idiopathic. Genome-wide gene expression analyses with microarray on testis specimens from 47 non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and 11 obstructive azoospermia (OA) patients were performed, and 2,611 transcripts that preferentially included genes relevant to gametogenesis and reproduction according to Gene Ontology classification were found to be differentially expressed. Using a set of 945 of the 2,611 transcripts without missing data, NOA was further categorized into three classes using the non-negative matrix factorization method. Two of the three subclasses were different from the OA group in Johnsen's score, FSH level, and/or LH level, while there were no significant differences between the other subclass and the OA group. In addition, the 52 genes showing high statistical difference between NOA subclasses (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 with Tukey's <italic>post hoc</italic> test) were subjected to allelic association analyses to identify genetic susceptibilities.

Azoospermia, the absence of sperm in the ejaculate due to defects in its production or delivery is common in male infertility. In this study, we focused on non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) because the etiologies of obstructive azoospermia are well studied and distinct from those of NOA. Microdeletions of the Y chromosome are thus far the only genetic defects known to affect human spermatogenesis, but most cases of NOA are unsolved. Because NOA results from a variety of defects in the developmental stages of spermatogenesis, the stage-specific expressions of genes in the testes must be investigated. Thus, genome-wide gene expression analyses of testes of NOA can provide insight into the several etiologies and genetic susceptibilities of NOA. In the present study, we analyzed several differentially expressed genes in NOA subclasses and identified ART3 as a susceptibility gene for NOA.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Okada H, Tajima A, Shichiri K, Tanaka A, Tanaka K, et al.

While spermatogenesis is a maturation of germ cells, other cells including Sertoli, Leydig, and peritubular myoid cells also play important roles, and defects at any differentiation stage might result in infertility. Male infertility is estimated to affect about 5&#x00025; of adult human males, but 75&#x00025; of the cases are diagnosed as idiopathic because the molecular mechanisms underlying the defects have not been elucidated. In consequence, an estimated one in six couples experiences difficulty in conceiving a child despite advances in assisted reproductive technologies. Male-factor infertility constitutes about half of the cases, and a significant proportion of male infertility is accompanied by idiopathic azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia, which may well have potential genetic components. It is well-recognized that men with very low sperm counts (&#x0003c;1 million/ml), identified through an infertility clinic, have a higher incidence of Y-chromosome microdeletion (up to 17&#x00025;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040026-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040026-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the genetic causalities of most cases of azoospermia are not known.</p><p>Global gene-expression profiling with microarray technologies has been applied with great promise to monitor biological phenomena and answer biological questions. Indeed, microarray technologies have been successfully used to identify biomarkers, disease subtypes, and mechanisms of toxicity. We applied microarray analysis to testis specimens from infertile individuals including patients with obstructive azoospermia (OA) and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA &#x0005b;OMIM &#x00025;606766&#x0005d;) to characterize NOA and to identify the specific pathophysiology and molecular pathways of the disease. In addition, we attempted to identify genetic susceptibility to NOA from genes differentially expressed in NOA testes.</p><p>Genes related to spermatogenesis and candidate genes for azoospermia have been surveyed in humans and mice, especially since gene targeting technology accelerated the identification of genes that play crucial roles in spermatogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040026-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Because spermatogenesis is a complex process including meiosis, a germ cell&#x02013;specific event, gene expression profiles specific to the differentiation stage, clinically classified by the Johnsen's score, were examined to provide insight into the pathogenesis of azoospermia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040026-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In the current study, we performed microarray analyses on biopsied testes obtained from 47 NOA patients at diverse clinical stages without prior selection and 11 OA patients. The 47 NOA samples showed a wide range of heterogeneity, including a series of impairments at the differentiation stage of spermatogenesis that so far have been evaluated mainly by pathological findings. Thus, classification of NOA at the transcriptome level is a necessary first step in elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of NOA. To do this, we adopted the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method, an unsupervised classification algorithm developed for decomposing images that has been applied in various fields of science including bioinformatics because of its potential for providing insight into complex relationships in large data sets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040026-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040026-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. 47 of the NOA-samples were divided into three subclasses by the NMF method, and each class was associated with clinical features. 149 transcripts were identified as differentially expressed genes among the NOA subclasses according to a statistical criterion, and the features involved in spermatogenesis based on Gene Ontology classification were demonstrated.</p><p>The genetic causality of NOA most likely involves the expression level of a susceptibility gene, which might be detected by genome-wide gene expression analysis. While it is daunting to identify genetic susceptibility from 100-1000 differentially expressed genes, genetic susceptibility might more readily be identified from random genes differentially expressed with high significance rather than by investigating only genes in a specific biological pathway. Based on a well-defined statistical procedure, 52 candidate genes for NOA were catalogued by gene expression profile and screened for allelic association study in a total of 442 NOA patients and 475 fertile male controls. After gene-centric selection of SNPs, 191 SNPs of 42 candidate genes were initially evaluated for allelic association with NOA. After two rounds of screening, SNPs of the ADP-ribosyltransferase 3 (<italic>ART3</italic>) gene were found to be significantly associated with NOA, and five of these SNPs were selected for haplotype construction. The most common haplotype was significantly under-represented in the patients and may be protective. The functional impact of this haplotype was further investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Extraction of NOA-Related Gene Expression Profile</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040026-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, the most notable difference in histological findings between NOA and OA testes was that the NOA patients exhibited, at varying degrees, incomplete sets of spermatogenic germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa) in the seminiferous tubules. In severe NOA patients, we could not even detect Sertoli cells, the major somatic cells of the seminiferous tubules, on histological examination (figure not shown), indicating clinical heterogeneity of NOA testes. In order to elucidate the molecular systems underlying NOA at the transcriptome level, it is important to extract genes reflecting the diversity of NOA phenotypes. For this purpose, we first compared global gene expression profiles in NOA testes to those of OA testes using the Agilent Human 1A(v2) Oligo Microarray system.

To characterize the gene list from the biological aspect, the 2,611 transcripts were subjected to functional clustering according to Gene Ontology (GO) classification for biological processes with GeneSpring software. We identified a total of 190 GO categories that were significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 without multiple testing correction) over-represented among the 2,611 transcripts. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0040026-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the ten top-ranked GO categories in descending order of significance based on <italic>p</italic>-values with Fisher's exact test.

We further analyzed two separate subsets comprising 1,709 decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040026-g002">Figure 2</xref>, upper) and 902 elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040026-g002">Figure 2</xref>, lower) transcripts, based on their GO annotations.

Multiple SNPs of <italic>ART3</italic> were significantly associated with NOA, the most significant association being observed with ART3-SNP25 (rs6836703, nominal <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0025, permutation <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.034; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0040026-t004">Table 4</xref>). We also detected a protective haplotype, H1, which was the most common form and was strongly associated with NOA (nominal <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.000073, corrected <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.00080, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040026-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, diplotype analysis showed that individuals carrying at least one haplotype H1 showed an elevated plasma testosterone level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040026-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Functional Relevance of ART3 in the Pathogenesis of NOA</title><p><italic>ART3</italic> is a member of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase family genes. The biological function of ART3 remains obscure, as ART3 does not display any detectable arginine-specific transferase activity due to lack of the active site motif (R-S-EXE) that is essential for catalytic activity. Since differentiation of stage-specific expression of ART3 in testis has been reported, protein expression being exclusively present in spermatocytes but absent in spermatozoa &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040026-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, a genetic variation of <italic>ART3</italic> might well lead to a functional defect in the process of spermatogenesis. Haplotype H1 of <italic>ART3</italic>, comprising all of the disease-protective alleles at the respective SNP sites, was under-represented in the patients. However, functional disturbance associated with haplotype H1 is so far undetermined despite the fact that several experiments designed to demonstrate haplotype-specific differences in expression level have been performed. Thus, it is possible that this haplotype represents fine tuning that maintains normal maturation of spermatocytes and improves the efficiency of spermatogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, genome-wide gene expression analyses identified differentially expressed genes of NOA subclasses, and <italic>ART3</italic> was identified as a susceptibility gene underlying NOA. This genetic study constitutes only first-stage evidence of association because only Japanese individuals were included, so further replication in independent case-control samples is required to confirm the role of the <italic>ART3</italic> haplotype in genetic risk for NOA. Although further functional evidence is also required, these results provide insight into the pathoetiology of NOA as well as reproductive fitness at the molecular level, and suggest a target for therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Participants.</title><p>Testicular biopsy specimens for microarray analysis were obtained from 47 Japanese patients (aged from 24 to 52 years) with NOA and 11 (aged from 22 to 57 years) with OA, each of whom also underwent testicular sperm extraction (TESE) for assisted reproduction and/or diagnostic biopsy for histological examination. The biopsies for microarray analysis and histological examination were mainly sampled from unilateral, multiple testicular sites in the respective patients. Each patient was first assigned to azoospermia by showing no ejaculated spermatozoa in a semen examination. Subsequently, OA was defined as follows: (1) motile spermatozoa were sampled from microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA), or (2) a considerable number of mature spermatozoa was sampled from TESE. NOA was tentatively defined as having no epididymal and/or testicular spermatozoa. The degree of spermatogenic defect was histologically evaluated according to Johnsen's score &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040026-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. At least three biopsies from the same individual were taken, and the average Johnsen's scores in the NOA and OA groups ranged from 1 to 6.5 and from 5.1 to 9, respectively. In most patients, preoperative levels of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leutenizing hormone (LH), and total testosterone were measured. The infertile male patients who visited Niigata University, Tachikawa Hospital, and St. Mother's Hospital received a routine semen examination according to 1999 WHO criteria. Based on this analysis, sperm were counted and the patients who had no ejaculated sperms were enrolled for a case-control association study. In total, 442 patients were ascertained to have NOA. In the current study, azoospermia patients with varicocele, ejaculatory dysfunction, endocrinopathy, or histologically examined OA as defined above were excluded. 475 fertile men having no specific clinical record were recruited in Niigata University. The ethics committees of Niigata University, Tachikawa Hospital, St. Mother's Hospital, and Tokai University approved the study protocols, and each participant gave written informed consent. Genomic DNA was prepared from blood white cells by Dneasy (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) or salivas by phenol/chloroform extraction.</p><p>To examine microdeletion of the Y chromosome in a subset of NOA patients, PCR-based diagnostic technique was used as follows: PCR amplifications with fluorescence (FAM or HEX)-labeled primers were performed to obtain fragments encompassing each of 13 STS markers in and around azoospermia factor (AZF) regions of the Y chromosome (in AZFa: SY83, SY95 and SY105; in AZFb: SY118, G65320, SY126 and SY136; in AZFc: SY148, SY149, SY152, SY283 and SY1291; in the heterochromatin distal to AZFc: SY166). Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available from the authors on request. PCR-amplified fragments were run on the ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan), and Y-chromosome microdeletion was determined with GENESCAN software (Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Microarray analysis of testis samples.</title><p>Total RNA from testicular biopsy was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and quantity and quality of the extracted RNA were examined with 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) using RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent Technologies). Human Testis Total RNA (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), a histologically normal testicular RNA pooled from 39 Caucasians, was used as a common reference in two-color microarray experiments.</p><p>For fluorescent cRNA synthesis, high-quality total RNA (150 ng) was labeled with the Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In this procedure, cyanine 5-CTP (Cy5) and cyanine 3-CTP (Cy3) (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, USA) were used to generate labeled cRNA from the extracted patient RNA and the reference RNA, respectively. Labeled cRNAs (0.75 &#x003bc;g each) from one patient and the common reference were combined and fragmented in a hybridization mixture with the <italic>In Situ</italic> Hybridization Kit Plus (Agilent Technologies). The mixture was hybridized for 17 hours at 65&#x000b0;C to the Agilent Human 1A(v2) Oligo Microarray, which carries 60-mer probes to 18,716 human transcripts. After hybridization, the microarray was washed with SSC buffer, and then scanned in Cy3 and Cy5 channels with the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner model G2565AA (Agilent Technologies). Signal intensity per spot was generated from the scanned image with Feature Extraction Software ver7.5 (Agilent Technologies) in default setting. Spots that did not pass quality control procedures were flagged and removed for further analysis.</p><p>The Lowess (locally weighted linear regression curve fit) method was applied to normalize the ratio (Cy5/Cy3) of the signal intensities generated in each microarray with GeneSpring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies). Compared with the expression level of reference RNA, the NOA group, with expression undergoing a 2-fold mean change or more was extracted; the OA group comprised transcripts showing less than 2-fold mean expression change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040026-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

For this analysis, a complete dataset without missing values was generated from raw values of Cy5 intensities for the NOA-related target genes in the NOA samples, and used to clarify NOA heterogeneity using three M-files (available from the following URL; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/cgi-bin/cancer/publications/pub_paper.cgi?mode=view&#x00026;paper_id=89">http://www.broad.mit.edu/cgi-bin/cancer/publications/pub&#x0005f;paper.cgi?mode&#x0003d;view&#x00026;paper&#x0005f;id&#x0003d;89</ext-link>) for MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). According to the subclassification of NOA samples, transcripts differentially expressed between NOA subclasses were determined by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's <italic>post hoc</italic> test in GeneSpring GX.
