However, PSD-93 deficiency did not markedly change the amounts of NR2A and NR2B in either synaptosomal or total soluble fractions from cerebellum. In mice deficient in PSD-93, morphine dose-dependent curve failed to shift significantly rightward as it did in wild type (WT) mice after acute and chronic morphine challenge. Unlike WT mice, PSD-93 knockout mice also showed marked losses of NMDAR-dependent morphine analgesic tolerance and associated abnormal sensitivity in response to mechanical, noxious thermal, and formalin-induced inflammatory stimuli after repeated morphine injection. In addition, PSD-93 knockout mice displayed dramatic loss of jumping activity, a typical NMDAR-mediated morphine withdrawal abstinence behavior. These findings indicate that impaired NMDAR-dependent neuronal plasticity following repeated morphine injection in PSD-93 knockout mice is attributed to PSD-93 deletion-induced alterations of synaptic NR2A and NR2B expression in dorsal horn and forebrain cortex neurons. The selective effect of PSD-93 deletion on synaptic NMDAR expression in these two major pain-related regions might provide the better strategies for the prevention and treatment of opioid tolerance and physical dependence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Opioid drugs such as morphine are a class of powerful analgesics used for treating many forms of acute and chronic pain. However, their chronic use has been limited by undesirable side effects such as tolerance, abnormal pain sensitivity, and physical dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These undesirable symptoms are believed to be related to neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). Several lines of research have shed light on molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the development of opioid analgesic tolerance and dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) or targeted disruption of NMDAR subunit NR2 genes significantly attenuates symptoms of opioid tolerance and physical dependence, implicating involvement of NMDARs in the development of opioid-induced neuronal plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity during the development of opioid tolerance and physical dependence are unclear.</p><p>PSD (<underline>p</underline>ost <underline>s</underline>ynaptic <underline>d</underline>ensity)-93, also named chapsyn (<underline>ch</underline>annel-<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>p</underline>rotein of <underline>syn</underline>apses)-110, is one of a growing superfamily of PDZ-domain-containing proteins shown to physically link proteins together into macromolecular structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. PSD-93 was identified to have structural similarity with three other PDZ-domain-containing proteins, PSD-95/SAP (<underline>s</underline>ynapse-<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>p</underline>rotein) 90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], SAP102 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and SAP97/hdlg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These proteins are generically referred to as membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) and contain three tandem PDZ domains (PDZ1-3) at the N-terminal side, an Src homology region 3 domain in the middle, and a guanylate kinase-like domain at the C-terminal end. PDZ domains of MAGUKs are motifs of ~90 amino acid repeats that have recently been recognized to mediate protein-protein interactions. Studies using the yeast two-hybrid system revealed that the PDZ domains of PSD-93 specifically bind to the C-termini of NMDAR subunits NR2A and NR2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The deletion of PDZ domains from PSD-93 not only disrupts interaction between NR2A/NR2B and PSD-93, but also reduces NMDAR clustering at cellular membranes <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Targeted disruption of the PSD-93 gene reduces NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic function in dorsal horn and forebrain cortex and attenuated NMDAR-mediated persistent pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, a recent study reported that PSD-93 knockout (KO) mice displayed normal NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic response in hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It appears that the roles of PSD-93 in synaptic NMDAR targeting and NMDAR-dependent physiologic and pathologic processes in the CNS are still unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we examined whether PSD-93 deficiency affected synaptic NR2A and NR2B expression in two major pain-related regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], spinal cord and forebrain cortex, and a motor and coordination-related region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], cerebellum, of the CNS. Furthermore, we examined whether PSD-93 was required for NMDAR-dependent development of neuronal plasticity during morphine tolerance and physical dependence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The PSD-93 KO mice (C57BL/6 genetic background) were generated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Male PSD-93 KO mice and wild type (WT) littermates (10&#x02013;12 weeks) were obtained by interbreeding PSD-93 heterozygous mice. All animal experiments were carried out with the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins University. The experimenter was blind to the genotype of the mice in all studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Tail-flick assay</title><p>A tail-flick apparatus (Model 33B Tail Flick Analgesy Meter, IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA, USA) with a radiant heat source connected to an automatic timer was used to assess the analgesic response. A cut-off time latency of 10 s was used to avoid tissue damage to the tail. Tail-flick latencies were measured as the time required to induce a tail flick after applying radiant heat to the skin of the tail. The antinociceptive effects were expressed as the percentage of maximal possible analgesic effect (% MPAE): % MPAE = [(response latency - baseline latency)/(cut-off latency - baseline latency)] &#x000d7; 100%.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphine-induced tolerance studies</title><p>Acute morphine tolerance was induced by two subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of 100 mg/kg morphine (WT: n = 10; KO: n = 10) or saline (control; WT: n = 10; KO: n = 10) given 12 h apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; chronic morphine tolerance was induced by s.c. injections of morphine (10 mg/kg) (WT: n = 10; KO: n = 10) or saline (control; WT: n = 10; KO: n = 10) given every 12 h for 6 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. On day 2 after induction of acute morphine tolerance or day 7 after induction of chronic morphine tolerance, cumulative dose-response curves were determined as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Mice received a very low morphine dose (1 mg/kg, s.c.) and analgesia was assessed 30 min later by the tail-flick assay. Mice that were not analgesic at the first dose then received a second dose (cumulative dosing increase by a 0.3 log unit) and were tested 30 min afterward. This procedure was repeated until either the mice did not move their tail within the cut-off time or no further increase in tail-flick latency was noted from one dose to the next.</p><p>To observe whether repeated morphine injection produced a time-dependent and NMDAR-dependent reduction in morphine analgesic effects, WT and KO mice received s.c. injections of morphine (10 mg/kg) or saline twice daily (12-h intervals) with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline or 0.3 mg/kg MK-801 once daily for 6 days. WT and KO mice were divided into four paired groups (n = 10 WT and 10 KO per group): s.c. saline + i.p. saline, s.c. morphine + i.p. saline, s.c. saline + i.p. MK-801, and s.c. morphine + i.p. MK-801. Tail-flick latencies were determined prior to drug injection and 1 h after the first injection of morphine on days 1, 3, 5, and 7.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphine-induced abnormal pain hypersensitivity studies</title><p>To determine whether NMDAR-dependent mechanical allodynia occurs in morphine-tolerant mice, paw withdrawal response to mechanical stimuli was measured as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Mice received s.c. injections of morphine (20 mg/kg) or saline twice daily with i.p. injection of 0.3 mg/kg MK-801 or saline once daily for 6 days. WT and KO mice were divided into four paired groups (n = 6 WT and 6 KO per group): s.c. saline + i.p. saline, s.c. morphine + i.p. saline, s.c. saline + i.p. MK-801, and s.c. morphine + i.p. MK-801. Mechanical behavioral testing was performed before drug injection (baseline) and on days 1, 2, and, 4 after morphine withdrawal. Each mouse was placed in a Plexiglas chamber on an elevated mesh screen. Two calibrated von Frey filaments (0.24 and 1.47 mN; Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA) were applied to the hind paw for approximately 1 s, and each stimulation was repeated 10 times to both hind paws. The occurrence of paw withdrawal in each of these 10 trials was expressed as a percent response frequency [(number of paw withdrawals/10 trials) &#x000d7; 100 = % response frequency], and this percentage was used as an indication of the amount of paw withdrawal.</p><p>To determine whether NMDAR-dependent thermal hyperalgesia occurs in morphine-tolerant mice, paw withdrawal response to noxious heat stimulation was measured as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. WT (n = 24) and KO (n = 24) mice were divided into four paired groups and given drug treatments according to the same protocol as for the mechanical test. Thermal behavioral testing was carried out before drug injection (baseline) and on days 1, 2, and 4 after morphine withdrawal. Mice were placed in a Plexiglas chamber on a glass plate. A radiant heat from Model 336 Analgesic Meter (IITC Inc./Life Science Instruments, Woodland Hills, CA, USA) was applied by aiming a beam of light through a hole in the light box through the glass plate to the middle of the plantar surface of each hind paw. When the animal lifted its foot, the light beam was turned off. The length of time between the start of the light beam and the foot lift was defined as the paw withdrawal latency. Each trial was repeated five times at 5-min intervals for each side. A cut-off time of 20 s was used to avoid tissue damage to the hind paw.</p><p>The formalin test was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Briefly, mice received s.c. injection of morphine (20 mg/kg) or saline twice daily for 6 days. On day 7, WT (n = 12; 6 for saline and 6 morphine) and KO (n = 12) mice received a 10-&#x003bc;l intraplantar injection of 1% formalin. After the formalin injection, the duration of paw licking was recorded in 5-min periods for 60 min. We defined the first phase response as the total time spent licking during the first 10 min and the second phase response as the duration of licking that occurred 10&#x02013;60 min after formalin injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms</title><p>Among naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms, jumping is reliably observed in mice, although other symptoms, such as forepaw tremor and rearing, are sometimes observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To examine an NMDAR-dependent morphine physical dependence, the number of jumps was analyzed quantitatively. Briefly, WT and KO mice (10/genotype/treatment) were injected twice daily with morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and once daily with 0.3 mg/kg MK-801 or saline for 6 days and on the seventh day challenged with naloxone (2 mg/kg, i.p.) 2 h after a final s.c. injection of morphine (10 mg/kg). Immediately after naloxone treatment, each mouse was placed into a transparent acrylic quadribox (20 &#x000d7; 30 cm), and jump frequency was tallied over the next 15 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular fractionation of proteins</title><p>Biochemical fractionation was carried out according to previous studies with minor modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. WT (n = 12) and KO (n = 12) mice were sacrificed and lumbar enlargement spinal cord, forebrain cortex, and cerebellum collected. The dorsal part of the spinal cord was separated from the ventral part. The tissues were homogenized in homogenization buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 320 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM leupeptin, and 2 mM pepstatin A] and centrifuged at 1,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant (S1, total soluble fraction) was collected and the pellet (P1, nuclei and debris fraction) discarded.

Evidence from <italic>in vitro </italic>studies shows that PSD-93 clusters and anchors NMDARs at synapses through interaction of its PDZ domains with seven C-terminal amino acids of NR2A and NR2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our quantitative Western blot analysis showed that PSD-93 deficiency significantly reduced the levels of NR2A and NR2B proteins in the synaptosomal membrane fractions of dorsal horn and forebrain cortex but did not affect their expression in the total soluble fractions of these two regions. This finding is consistent with our previous <italic>in vitro </italic>study, which showed that surface NR2A and NR2B expression is dramatically reduced in cultured dorsal horn neurons of KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The data suggest that PSD-93 is required for synaptic expression and localization of NR2A and NR2B in dorsal horn and forebrain cortex. However, PSD-93 deficiency did not markedly change the amounts of NR2A and NR2B in either synaptosomal or total soluble fractions from cerebellum. Hippocampus neurons in PSD-93 KO mice may also express normal levels of NR2A and NR2B at synapses because PSD-93 deletion does not alter NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and potentials in hippocampus neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It appears that the effect of PSD-93 deletion on NR2A and NR2B synaptic expression may be tissue specific in the CNS, although the detailed mechanisms underlying these events are still unclear. PSD-95 and SAP102, two members of the MAGUK family of proteins, also interact with NR2A and NR2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is very likely that PSD-95 and SAP102 compensate for the deficiency of PSD-93 to anchor and target NMDARs at synapses in hippocampus and cerebellum neurons of PSD-93 KO mice.</p><p>Spinal cord and forebrain cortex are two major pain-related regions in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our previous studies demonstrated that PSD-93, NR2A, and NR2B are highly expressed in the superficial dorsal horn of spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Under electron microscopy, the sections from superficial dorsal horn and the anterior cingular cortex of forebrain exhibited double labeling for PSD-93 and NR2A/NR2B in the postsynaptic density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, by co-immunoprecipitation, we found that both NR2A and NR2B were immunopreciptated by PSD-93 antibody in the postsynaptic density fractions of the spinal cord and forebrain cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These findings demonstrate PSD-93 binding to NMDARs in the spinal cord and forebrain cortex <italic>in vivo</italic>. Electrophysiological recordings showed that PSD-93 deletion reduced NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic responses in these two regions of adult mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Behavioral study revealed that mice lacking PSD-93 exhibited blunted NMDAR-dependent persistent pain induced by peripheral nerve injury or injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant, although they displayed intact nociceptive responsiveness to acute pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The present study showed that PSD-93 deficiency significantly inhibited acute and chronic morphine analgesic tolerance, enhancing formalin-induced pain behaviors, and withdrawal-induced jumping following repeated morphine injection. Morphine-induced tolerance, abnormal pain hypersensitivity, and physical dependence are considered to be related to NMDAR-dependent neuronal plasticity in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, it is very likely that these impaired morphine analgesic tolerance and physical dependence in PSD-93 KO mice is attributed to PSD-93 deletion-induced reduction in postsynaptic expression and function of NMDARs in dorsal horn and forebrain cortex neurons. Hippocampal NMDARs play a critical role in neuronal plasticity underlying learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], whereas cerebellar NMDARs are involved in the modulation of motor learning and coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Because PSD-93 deletion does not affect synaptic NMDAR expression and NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic functions in these two non-pain-related regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], PSD-93 deletion does not produce hippocampal and cerebellar dysfunctions, but does attenuate the development of persistent pain and morphine tolerance and physical dependence. Thus, targeted disruption of PSD-93 or perturbing NMDAR-PSD-93 interaction might be a better strategy for prevention and/or treatment of persistent pain and opioid tolerance and physical dependence in clinic.</p><p>It should be noted that PSD-93 also functions as a scaffolding protein to assemble a specific set of signaling proteins around the NMDARs. These signaling proteins, such as neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS), participate in downstream signaling by the NMDARs. The PDZ domain of nNOS interacts with the PDZ domains of PSD-93 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Deleting the PDZ domain from PSD-93 reduces NOS activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Our previous study showed that targeted disruption of PSD-93 gene significantly attenuates the NMDA-stimulated increase in cyclic guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate in the cultured forebrain cortex neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Given that inhibition of nNOS attenuates the development of persistent pain and morphine analgesic tolerance and physical dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], it is very likely that the dissociation of NMDARs from NO signaling caused by PSD-93 deletion is also involved in the mechanism underlying impairing persistent pain and morphine analgesic tolerance and physical dependence in the KO mice. Besides NMDARs and nNOS, PSD-93 binds to other postsynaptic membrane proteins, such as potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], &#x003b4;<sub>2 </sub>glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and the microtubule-associated protein 1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, the detailed mechanism through which PSD-93 deficiency affects the development of neuronal plasticity in persistent pain and morphine tolerance and physical dependence remains to be explored.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study was the first to demonstrate that PSD-93 deletion has distinct effects on synaptic NMDAR expression in the CNS. Blunted NMDAR-dependent neuronal plasticity following repeated morphine injection in PSD-93 KO mice is attributed to PSD-93 deletion-induced alterations of NR2A and NR2B postsynaptic expression in dorsal horn and forebrain cortex neurons, but not in cerebellar neurons. Our findings suggest that PSD-93 might be a potential biochemical target for the treatment of opioid tolerance and physical dependence.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH Grants NS 058886 and NS 057343 and the Johns Hopkins University Blaustein Pain Research Fund (Y.X.T.).
