As a first step towards defining the function of Scp160p, we have characterized the subcellular distribution and <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions of this protein. Using sucrose gradient fractionation studies we have demonstrated that Scp160p in cytoplasmic lysates is predominantly associated with polyribosomes. Furthermore, we have found that Scp160p is released from polyribosomes by EDTA in the form of a large complex of <bold>&#x02265;</bold>1300 kDa that is sensitive both to RNase and NaCl. Using affinity-chromatography to isolate these complexes, we have identified two protein components other than Scp160p: poly(A) binding protein, Pab1p, and Bfr1p. The presence of Pab1p confirms these complexes to be mRNPs. The presence of Bfr1p is intriguing because the null phenotype for this gene is essentially the same as that reported for <italic>scp160</italic>-null cells: increased cell size and aberrant DNA content. These results demonstrate that Scp160p associates with polyribosome-bound mRNP complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>, implicating a role for this protein in one or more levels of mRNA metabolism in yeast.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Scp160p is a 1222 amino acid <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> protein that contains 14 copies of the hnRNP K homology (KH) domain, a highly conserved motif found in many proteins involved in RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c1">1</xref>). KH domain-containing proteins appear to have diverse functions and have been identified in all kingdoms of life, including the ribosomal protein S3 from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c1">1</xref>), Mer1p from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, a meiosis-specific splicing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c1">1</xref>), MEX-3 from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, presumably involved in mRNA localization during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c2">2</xref>), and FMRP, the fragile-X mental retardation protein in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c3">3</xref>). A partial clone of Scp160p, known as HX, was one of the first multiple-KH proteins identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c1">1</xref>).</p><p>Whole cell immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated that Scp160p localizes to the cytoplasm, with enrichment around the nuclear envelope, and what appears to be the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c3">3</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>SCP160</italic> locus in yeast is not lethal, but results in a complex phenotype, including increased DNA content per cell, missegregation of genetic markers during sporulation, and abnormal cell morphology, including increased size and irregular shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c4">4</xref>). Observation of this phenotype led to the hypothesis that Scp160p may function in regulating ploidy during cell division. More recently, Weber and colleagues demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA binding activity of Scp160p using northwestern blot analyses; the protein was found to bind efficiently to ribohomopolymers and rRNA, but not to tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c5">5</xref>). Cell fractionation studies revealed that a large percentage of Scp160p associates with membrane-pellets, and is released by treatment with either 10 mM EDTA or 500 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c5">5</xref>). While these authors interpreted these results to suggest that the nuclear envelope&#x0002f;ER localization of Scp160p was due primarily to interactions of the protein with membrane-bound polyribosomes, clear evidence of this association has not been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c5">5</xref>). Currently, the relationship between the phenotype of <italic>scp160</italic> null mutants and the RNA-binding activity of Scp160p remains unclear.</p><p>Scp160p demonstrates significant sequence homology (~23&#x00025; identity and ~40&#x00025; similarity at the amino acid level) to a class of vertebrate KH-domain proteins collectively known as vigilins. First identified in chicken, vigilin homologues have now been found in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c6">6</xref>), <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c7">7</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c8">8</xref>), <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c5">5</xref>) and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. While all of the vigilin proteins studied to date are reported to bind nucleic acid, both the type of nucleic acid bound and the functional significance of these interactions remain unclear. For example, Kruse and colleagues reported from their work with human cells in culture that vigilin may be involved in the binding and transport of tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c11">11</xref>). In contrast, Dodson and Shapiro concluded from their work with <italic>Xenopus</italic> vigilin that, in response to estrogen, the protein bound specifically to the 3&#x02032; UTR of vitellogenin mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c12">12</xref>), potentially stabilizing the message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c13">13</xref>). Lastly, DDP1, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of vigilin, was reported recently to interact with the dodeca-satellite repeat regions of centromeric heterochromatin in embryonic and larval cell nuclei, suggesting a possible role for this protein in heterochromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c8">8</xref>).</p><p>The goal of the present study was to begin elucidating the function of Scp160p in yeast by characterizing the subcellular distribution and macromolecular interactions of this protein. We have demonstrated that Scp160p in cytoplasmic lysates is associated predominantly with polyribosomes, and that following treatment with EDTA, Scp160p remains in an RNase&#x0002f;NaCl-sensitive complex of apparent molecular weight approximately &#x02265;1300 kDa. Affinity purification of this complex revealed the presence of poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1p), a well-characterized component of eukaryotic mRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c15">15</xref>). Finally, a third abundant protein component of this complex was identified as Bfr1p, a protein not previously reported to associate with mRNPs. While the function of Bfr1p remains unknown, gene deletion reportedly leads to a phenotype remarkably similar to that of <italic>scp160</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c16">16</xref>). These results indicate a role for Scp160p in mRNA metabolism in yeast, and by extension, support results seen with <italic>Xenopus</italic> vigilin in its interactions with mRNA. To our knowledge, the data reported here demonstrate Scp160p to be the first example of a KH-domain protein that functions as a component of polyribosome-associated mRNP complexes in the yeast, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids, yeast strains and culture conditions</title><p>All recombinant DNA manipulations were performed according to standard techniques and utilized <italic>E.coli</italic> strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene).

In brief, a 100 ml culture of yeast was grown in either YEPD or Hartwell synthetic medium, to early-log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0003d; 1.0), at which time cyclohexamide (Sigma) was added directly to the culture to a final concentration of 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml.

Western blot analyses of gradient fractions with an &#x003b1;-FLAG antibody (M2, Boehringer Mannheim), revealed a 160 kDa band that was most abundant in the denser fractions, consistent with the location of polyribosomes (&#x0003e;80S) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f2">2</xref>A, solid arrow). A convenient internal control for these gradients was provided by an unknown endogenous yeast cross-reacting protein at ~100 kDa, that exemplified the migration pattern of a free protein, appearing only in the upper fractions of the gradient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f2">2</xref>A, open arrow).</p><p>To determine whether the migration pattern of Scp160p in these sucrose gradients truly reflected association with yeast polyribosomes, lysates were pre-treated with either 30 mM EDTA or 50 U&#x0002f;ml RNase One (Promega) immediately prior to sucrose gradient fractionation. EDTA chelates Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> cations, resulting in the dissociation of the small and large ribosomal subunits, reflected in gradient profiles (OD<sub>254</sub>) by the disappearance of 80S monosomes and polyribosomes along with a marked increase in the abundance of free ribosomal subunits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f2">2</xref>B). Under these conditions, the greatest intensity of FLAG&#x02013;Scp160p signal was seen only in the upper-most fractions of the gradient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f2">2</xref>B). Alternatively, pre-treatment of lysates with RNase, which results in inter-ribosomal severing of translating messages, gave rise to a large pool of single 80S ribosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f2">2</xref>C). Again, FLAG&#x02013;Scp160p was shifted to the uppermost fractions of these gradients. Although some of the Scp160p signal was detected in fractions larger than 40S, the migration pattern of the 100 kDa cross-reacting protein in these experiments indicated that RNase treatment caused an apparent diffusion of material in the upper portion of the gradient.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of Scp160p-containing complexes following EDTA and RNase treatment</title><p>Gel-filtration chromatography was used to determine the apparent molecular weight of Scp160p following its release from polyribosomes by both EDTA and RNase treatment. Lysates were prepared as described above for sucrose gradient analysis, but were instead size fractionated over a Sephacryl S-300 Hi-Prep column, with an inclusion cut-off of 1300 kDa. As expected, Scp160p from untreated lysates eluted in the void volume, confirming its association with large complexes, ostensibly polyribosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f3">3</xref>A, solid arrow). In EDTA treated lysates, all Scp160p signal was still detected in the void volume, indicating it remained in a complex of &#x0003e;1300 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f3">3</xref>B, solid arrow). In contrast, limited RNase treatment (10&#x000a0;min) resulted in the appearance of an Scp160p-containing species of ~450 kDa, in addition to a fraction still visible in the void (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f3">3</xref>C, solid arrow). More extensive RNase treatment (30 min) led to complete conversion to the 450 kDa species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f3">3</xref>D, solid arrow). Sequential treatment, first with RNase, then with EDTA, also resulted in a 450 kDa species (data not shown), suggesting that all components of this apparent 450&#x000a0;kDa complex were also present following EDTA treatment alone. As before, the 100 kDa, endogenous &#x003b1;-FLAG cross-reacting protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f3">3</xref>, open arrows) served as a convenient internal control, eluting from the column at a volume consistent with its expected monomeric size.</p><p>To characterize further the stability of the large (apparent molecular weight <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>1300 kDa), EDTA-resistant complex, lysates were treated with increasing concentrations of NaCl prior to size fractionation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f3">3</xref>, panels E, F and G). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f3">3</xref>E, at 75 mM NaCl, the large complex remained intact. However, at a NaCl concentration of 150 mM, the Scp160p complex was partially reduced to 450 kDa, with some signal still remaining in the void (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f3">3</xref>F, solid arrow). Following treatment with 1 M NaCl, Scp160p was only visible as the 450 kDa species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f3">3</xref>G, solid arrow). The fact that RNase treatment and high salt both generated Scp160p species of similar apparent molecular weight suggests that these high salt concentrations resulted in the disassociation of RNA, and perhaps other components, from Scp160p.</p></sec><sec><title>Pab1p and Bfr1p are present in EDTA-resistant Scp160p-containing complexes</title><p>To determine if the <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>1300 kDa Scp160p-containing complexes remaining after EDTA treatment were mRNPs, we assayed for the presence of the yeast poly(A) binding protein, Pab1p, following &#x003b1;-FLAG affinity purification as illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f4">4</xref>. Pab1p is an abundant and well-characterized component of mRNP complexes in yeast, as well as higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c25">25</xref>). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f5">5</xref>A and B, Pab1p did co-purify with FLAG&#x02013;Scp160p; moreover, treatment with RNase immediately prior to FLAG-purification completely abolished this interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f5">5</xref>C), indicating an RNA-dependant association between these two proteins.</p><p>We also probed the isolated complexes for the presence of another abundant mRNP-component protein, Pub1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c26">26</xref>). Pub1p, as opposed to Pab1p, is not reported to associate with polyribosomes, and is hypothesized to bind a pool of non-translatable mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c23">23</xref>). As predicted, Pub1p did not co-purify with Scp160p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f5">5</xref>D). The absence of Pub1p in Scp160p-containing complexes served as a negative control, demonstrating that abundant RNA-binding proteins did not co-purify non-specifically by this protocol. In addition, we performed mock purifications using lysates from yeast expressing the wild-type allele of <italic>SCP160</italic> without the FLAG epitope (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f5">5</xref>F), or with an unrelated FLAG-tagged protein, human galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f5">5</xref>G, lower panel). In neither case did Pab1p bind and elute from the FLAG affinity column. Finally, no bands were visible by colloidal G250 Coomassie staining of samples from the mock (wild-type) preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f5">5</xref>E), further demonstrating the specificity of this procedure.</p><p>By colloidal G250 Coomassie staining (Materials and Methods) of the FLAG-purified complex, we observed in addition to Scp160p, two major bands, at ~70 kDa and ~55 kDa, which ostensibly represent co-purifying proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f5">5</xref>A, bottom panel). Western blot analysis suggested that the ~70 kDa species is Pab1p. To identify the 55 kDa protein, that band was excised from the gel, and sent to the Keck microchemical facility at Yale University for analysis by in gel tryptic digestion, followed by MALDI-mass spectrometry. The results of these analyses clearly identified the unknown protein as Bfr1p. To confirm this result, an N-terminal HA tag was engineered onto the genomic BFR1 locus in strains expressing FLAG-tagged or wild-type Scp160p. Scp160p complexes were then isolated from both of these strains using the protocol described above. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f6">6</xref>, an HA-tagged protein of ~55 kDa (center panel) appears in &#x003b1;-FLAG column elutions only when FLAG&#x02013;Scp160p is also present (top panel). No signal is visible in mock purifications of extracts where Scp160p is not FLAG-tagged (bottom panel).</p></sec><sec><title>Monomeric Scp160p migrates as a ~450 kDa protein under native conditions</title><p>As a first step to characterize the post RNase&#x0002f;NaCl 450 kDa Scp160p species we compared it with Scp160p over-expressed and purified from an exogenous host, the yeast <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>. The purified N-terminal FLAG&#x0002f;hexahistidine-tagged Scp160p was run over an S300 gel filtration column; 2 ml fractions were collected and analyzed by &#x003b1;-FLAG western blot. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f7">7</xref>A, purified Scp160p eluted at a volume consistent with a &#x0003e;443 kDa protein. To confirm that no other proteins were associated with the purified Scp160p, 12 &#x000b5;l of the protein was run on SDS&#x02013;PAGE and subjected to colloidal G250 Coomassie staining before loading on the S-300 column (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f7">7</xref>B). As shown, no bands other than Scp160p were visible.</p><p>Several KH-domain proteins, including Sam68 and FMRP, have been reported to form homodimers <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c27">27</xref>). Therefore, we explored the possibility that the ~450 kDa Scp160p species might contain two or more copies of Scp160p. To test this hypothesis, yeast expressing FLAG&#x02013;Scp160p were transfected with a centromeric plasmid, YCplac22&#x02013;HA&#x02013;Scp160p, encoding a distinct, HA-tagged allele of the protein. The functionality of this tagged protein had previously been demonstrated by polyribosome association as well as complementation of the null morphological phenotype in cells expressing only HA&#x02013;Scp160p (data not shown). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f7">7</xref>C, when yeast co-expressing the two alleles were lysed and the FLAG-tagged protein was isolated as described above, no HA&#x02013;Scp160p co-purified with the FLAG&#x02013;Scp160p. These data strongly suggest that Scp160p does not form homo-dimers or higher-order multimers <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that the ~450 kDa species of Scp160p observed is simply the monomeric protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The data presented here demonstrate two main points regarding the biochemical associations and function of Scp160p in yeast. First, the sucrose gradient fractionation data clearly demonstrate that Scp160p exists primarily associated with large complexes, likely to be polyribosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first time a vigilin family member has been shown to associate with polyribosomes in this manner. Interestingly, Weber and colleagues did not observe sucrose gradient fractionation data consistent with polyribosome association of Scp160p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c5">5</xref>). These authors hypothesized that Scp160p associates only with membrane-bound polyribosomes, and that Scp160p is not found complexed with cytosolic polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c5">5</xref>). Our data do not support this hypothesis, since unlike Weber and colleagues, we were able to detect significant amounts of Scp160p associated with polyribosomes without using detergents during preparation. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the lysate buffer utilized by that group contained 100 mM NaCl, whereas our buffer contained 50 mM KCl. Our data shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd275f3">3</xref> suggest that 100 mM NaCl may have caused an instability in the Scp160p&#x02013;RNA interaction, leading to release from polyribosomes during their procedure. Secondly, Weber&#x02019;s lysate buffer reportedly contained heparin to inhibit ribonucleases; a number of reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c29">29</xref>) suggest that heparin can disrupt RNA&#x02013;protein interactions. Although we have not in the past included heparin in any of our experiments, we have observed disruption of the polyribosome association in buffer containing residual diethylpyrocarbonate, another inhibitor of ribonucleases (data not shown).</p><p>Second, our data provide compelling evidence that Scp160p is released from polyribosomes as a component of an mRNP complex. Since Scp160p does not remain associated with either single ribosomes or ribosomal subunits following treatment with EDTA or RNase, it seems unlikely that Scp160p is a constitutive component of the translational machinery. Partial purification of the EDTA-resistant Scp160p complexes allowed us to demonstrate the presence of Pab1p but not Pub1p in these preparations, which is consistent with the idea that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes as a component of mRNP complexes. Previously, Scp160p had been shown to bind ribohomopolymers and rRNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, although the <italic>in vivo</italic> nucleic acid targets of Scp160p were unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c5">5</xref>). The presence of Pab1p in RNase-sensitive Scp160p complexes indicates that Scp160p is primarily bound to polyadenylated RNAs. Whether or not Scp160p binds only specific sets of mRNAs will be the subject of future studies.</p><p>In addition to Scp160p and Pab1p, we have identified a third component of the complex, the protein Bfr1p. The gene, <italic>BFR1</italic>, was originally identified in a screen for high-copy suppressors of Brefeldin-A induced lethality, suggesting a role in the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c16">16</xref>). Interestingly, however, <italic>bfr1</italic> null mutants do not demonstrate any defects in the secretory pathway, but rather display similar phenotypes to <italic>scp160</italic> null mutants, most notably increased ploidy and increased cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c16">16</xref>). It is therefore unclear whether Bfr1p is capable of functioning in both RNA metabolism and secretion directly, or if the Scp160p&#x02013;Bfr1p complex regulates the expression of one or more secretory genes at the post-transcriptional level. Additionally, two-hybrid analysis indicated an interaction of Bfr1p with the protein Bbp1p, a component of the mitotic spindle apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c30">30</xref>). While Bbp1p is an essential gene, overexpression leads to a phenotype similar to both <italic>bfr1</italic> and <italic>scp160</italic> null strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd275c30">30</xref>). Future work will address the functional relationship between Scp160p and Bfr1p including the possibility that these proteins represent a regulatory mechanism connecting the translational machinery with cell division and&#x0002f;or the secretory pathway.</p><p>Following treatment with either RNase or &#x0003e;150 mM NaCl, Scp160p remained as an apparent ~450 kDa species. Considering that purified Scp160p alone also migrates at this size, we conclude that this apparent complex may consist only of Scp160p, although the presence of other small components cannot be ruled out at this time. Furthermore, by utilizing yeast co-expressing two distinct epitope-tagged versions of Scp160p, we have ruled out the possibility of self-association of Scp160p. Although both tagged proteins appear functional, it remains a formal possibility that the tags somehow prevented formation of FLAG&#x02013;HA hetero-complexes. Nonetheless, it seems most likely that native Scp160p monomers may simply migrate aberrantly under native conditions due to an unusual shape or some other physical property.</p><p>In conclusion we have shown convincing evidence that Scp160p exists in yeast cytoplasmic extracts primarily associated with polyribosomes. We have purified Scp160p following disruption of polyribosomes with EDTA, and identified two associated proteins: Pab1p and Bfr1p. The presence of Pab1p suggests that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes as a component of an mRNP, demonstrating Scp160p to be the first <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> multiple-KH domain protein characterized to function in this way.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd275f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Epitope-tagged and deletion alleles of Scp160p expressed in yeast.
