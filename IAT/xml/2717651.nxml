To define the molecular architecture of this critical kinetochore network, we sought to determine the full complement of CCAN components and to define their relationships. This work identified a centromere protein S (CENP-S)&#x02013;containing subcomplex that includes the new constitutive kinetochore protein CENP-X. Both CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient chicken DT40 cells are viable but show abnormal mitotic behavior based on live cell analysis. Human HeLa cells depleted for CENP-X also showed mitotic errors. The kinetochore localization of CENP-S and -X is abolished in CENP-T&#x02013; or CENP-K&#x02013;deficient cells, but reciprocal experiments using CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells did not reveal defects in the localization of CCAN components. However, CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells show a significant reduction in the size of the kinetochore outer plate. In addition, we found that intrakinetochore distance was increased in CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells. These results suggest that the CENP-S complex is essential for the stable assembly of the outer kinetochore.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The centromere is essential for faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis. The kinetochore is assembled on centromeres to form a dynamic interface with microtubules from the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>). To understand kinetochore structure and the mechanisms related to chromosome segregation, it is critical to define the identity, organization, and functional roles of the numerous kinetochore proteins.</p><p>In recent years, multiple kinetochore proteins have been identified in vertebrate cells using a combination of approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Okada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hori et al., 2008a</xref>). These studies have revealed that a constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) of proteins associates with centromeres throughout the cell cycle and provides a platform for the formation of a functional kinetochore during mitosis. Other kinetochore proteins, including the KNL1&#x02013;Mis12 complex&#x02013;Ndc80 complex (KMN) network, are targeted to kinetochores by CCAN-containing prekinetochores during G2 and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cheeseman et al., 2008</xref>) to establish a fully assembled kinetochore capable of interacting with spindle microtubules and facilitating faithful chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DeLuca et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, 15 proteins (centromere protein C [CENP-C], H, I, K to U, and W) have been identified as CCAN components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hori et al., 2008a</xref>). Based on a combination of functional and biochemical analyses, we and others have previously demonstrated that the CCAN is divided into several subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Okada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McClelland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hori et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">b</xref>).</p><p>CENP-S was originally identified as copurifying with CENP-M or -U and was verified as a CCAN component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>). However, CENP-S was not detected as a stoichiometric interacting partner in the CENP-H&#x02013;containing complex in our biochemical purifications from DT40 or HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Okada et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we sought to define the relationship between CENP-S and the other CCAN subcomplexes. In this study, we identify a new CENP-S&#x02013;interacting protein and define a function for the CENP-S&#x02013;containing complex in stable outer kinetochore assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>CENP-X is a component of the CCAN</title><p>Our previous purifications using epitope-tagged CENP-H, -I, or -O did not isolate CENP-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Okada et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that CENP-S represents a distinct component of the CCAN from the CENP-H&#x02013; and CENP-O&#x02013;containing complexes. To assess this more closely, we fractionated protein extract from DT40 cells by gel filtration chromatography and analyzed each fraction by Western blot analysis with antibodies against CENP-O or -S. The profile of CENP-S was clearly distinct from that of CENP-O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), suggesting that the CENP-O&#x02013;containing complex does not contain CENP-S. To confirm the results of the gel filtration analysis, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments with cell lines in which endogenous CENP-P (a CENP-O complex protein) or CENP-S was completely replaced with CENP-P&#x02013;Flag or CENP-S&#x02013;Flag, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Mass spectrometry indicated that the CENP-P&#x02013;Flag IPs primarily contained CENP-O, -P, -Q, -R, and -50 (U) but not CENP-S, which is consistent with our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hori et al., 2008b</xref>). Similarly, in CENP-S&#x02013;Flag IPs, we did not observe clear bands at the expected sizes for the CENP-H or -O complex proteins on silver-stained gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We also confirmed the coprecipitation using high sensitivity mass spectrometry analyses. Finally, we performed IPs with cell lines in which endogenous CENP-H or -N was completely replaced with CENP-H&#x02013;Flag or CENP-N&#x02013;Flag, and we similarly did not detect CENP-S in either IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These results suggest that CENP-S can be separated from the rest of the CCAN and is distinct from the CENP-H&#x02013; or the CENP-O&#x02013;containing complex. However, we note that CENP-T was detected in CENP-S IPs using high sensitivity mass spectrometry analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Consistent with this, gel filtration chromatography of DT40 extracts revealed two peaks of CENP-S migration, one of which co-migrates with a CENP-T peak, although the proportion of the CENP-S that co-migrates with CENP-T is minor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200903100/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). CENP-T was also detected by Western blot analysis in CENP-S IPs, but the coprecipitation efficiency of CENP-T with CENP-S is not high (Fig. S1). Considering these data, we conclude that the CENP-S complex is distinct from the CENP-T complex, although CENP-S may associate weakly with the CENP-T complex.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of the CENP-S&#x02013;associated protein CENP-X.</bold> (A) Immunoblots of DT40 cell extracts fractionated on a Superose 6 gel filtration column using antibodies against anti&#x02013;CENP-O or &#x02013;CENP-S.

We determined the amino acid sequences of the peptides from this band and found that this corresponds to the D9 (Stra13) protein (amino acid sequence from ChEST533l10 clone). We will refer to D9 (Stra13) as CENP-X based on the results of the localization experiments described in the next paragraph. The human homologue of Stra13 (CENP-X) was reported as a protein whose expression is increased upon retinoic acid induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Scott et al., 1996</xref>). To confirm the interaction between CENP-S and -X, we generated DT40 cell lines in which endogenous CENP-X was completely replaced with CENP-X&#x02013;Flag and used these to conduct IPs with anti-Flag antibodies. Western blot analysis with anti&#x02013;CENP-S or anti-Flag antibodies indicated clear coprecipitation of CENP-S and -X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). To determine whether the interaction between CENP-S and -X is conserved in humans, we conducted similar IPs from HeLa cell lines stably expressing GFP<sup>LAP</sup>&#x02013;CENP-S or GFP<sup>LAP</sup>&#x02013;CENP-T. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of CENP-X (Stra13; NCBI Protein database accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="genpept" xlink:href="NP_659435">NP_659435</ext-link>) in CENP-S IPs but not in CENP-T IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the localization of CENP-X, we generated a DT40 cell line in which endogenous CENP-X was completely replaced with CENP-X&#x02013;GFP.

We also confirmed the colocalization with anti-Flag antibodies in cells in which endogenous CENP-X was completely replaced by CENP-X&#x02013;Flag (Fig. S1). Based on the copurification with CENP-S and its constitutive localization to centromeres, we conclude that CENP-X is a new component of the CCAN.</p></sec><sec><title>Both CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient DT40 cells are viable but show defects in mitotic progression</title><p>To understand the function of the CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X complex and its relationship to other kinetochore components, we generated loss-of-function DT40 mutants for CENP-S and -X (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200903100/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>).

To determine the consequences of loss of CENP-S and -X, we first examined the growth curves for CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells. Under standard growth conditions, these knockout (KO) cells grew with similar growth rates to wild-type cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200903100/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). We also observed a slight accumulation of G2/M cells in both CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cell lines compared with wild-type cells by FACS analysis (Fig. S3). In addition, we observed a three- to fourfold increase in the number of apoptotic cells in these mutants compared with control cells based on DAPI staining with microscopic analysis, which may reflect an accumulation of mitotic defects.</p><p>To examine the presence of any errors in mitosis, we visualized the behavior of individual CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells expressing histone H2B-RFP. Time-lapse imaging of wild-type and CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) indicated the presence of some mitotic defects in the absence of CENP-S. Although most CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells progressed through mitosis, these cells took a mean of 25.1 &#x000b1; 6.4 min (&#x000b1;SD; <italic>n</italic> = 42) to progress from prophase to anaphase, which is significantly longer than the time observed in wild-type cells (19.3 &#x000b1; 4.3 min; <italic>n</italic> = 36; P = 0.000012). In addition, we observed that &#x0003e;30% of CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells displayed anaphase bridging of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, CENP-S KO 1&#x02013;3). These results indicate that CENP-S is important for proper mitotic progression and chromosome segregation in DT40 cells even though it is dispensable for viability in a population.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Both CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient DT40 cells are viable but show defects in mitotic progression.</bold> (A, left) Dynamics of chromosomes in wild-type (WT) or CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells visualized by time-lapse observation of living cells.

Cells with KOs of CENP-O class proteins do not exit mitosis after release from a nocodazole block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Minoshima et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we tested the ability of CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells to recover from spindle damage (Fig. S3 C). We treated cells with nocodazole for 12 h and then removed the drug and examined the entry of the cells into interphase. Wild-type cells progressed to G1 phase immediately, and &#x0003c;10% were mitotic 4 h after release from the nocodazole block. In contrast, &#x0223c;60% of CENP-50 (U) (a CENP-O class protein)&#x02013;deficient cells were mitotic 4 h after release from the nocodazole block, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Minoshima et al., 2005</xref>). In CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells, &#x0223c;15% of cells at 4 h were mitotic after release from the nocodazole block. Although this suggests a slight defect in the recovery from spindle damage in CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells compared with wild-type cells, the defect is minor compared with CENP-50 (U)&#x02013;deficient cells. These results suggest that CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X function is distinct from the CENP-O class of proteins.</p><p>Finally, we also analyzed the mitotic behavior after depletion of human CENP-X by siRNA-based knockdown in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In contrast to DT40 cells, CENP-X RNAi in HeLa cells resulted in numerous mitotic defects. Although we observed a small subset of CENP-X&#x02013;depleted cells in which chromosomes were largely aligned at a metaphase plate, numerous instances of moderately and highly misaligned chromosomes were observed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This strong defect in chromosome alignment is qualitatively similar to our previous analyses of CENP-K&#x02013; and CENP-W&#x02013;depleted HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Okada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hori et al., 2008a</xref>). However, in contrast to CENP-K and -W depletions, we did observe some examples of cells that had apparently entered anaphase based on the presence of separated sister kinetochores.</p><p>To determine whether CENP-X has overlapping functions with other CCAN proteins, we also conducted double depletions between CENP-X and CENP-Q, -K, or -W by RNAi. This strategy previously demonstrated a synergy between CENP-K and human KNL1 for assembly of the human kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cheeseman et al. 2008</xref>). However, double CENP-X/CENP-Q&#x02013;, CENP-X/CENP-K&#x02013;, and CENP-X/CENP-W&#x02013;depleted cells did not show synergistic phenotypes compared with the singly depleted cells (unpublished data). In total, these results suggest that depletion of human CENP-X causes defects that are distinct from those associated with other CCAN components and suggests that CENP-X plays a critical role in proper chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetochore localization of the CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X complex occurs downstream of the CENP-H complex but is distinct from the CENP-O complex</title><p>To define the relationship of CENP-S and -X to the other components of the CCAN, we next conducted localization experiments.

In total, these localization experiments demonstrate that kinetochore targeting of the CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X complex occurs downstream of the CENP-H complex and is distinct from CENP-C and the CENP-O complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetochore outer plates of CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells are smaller than those of wild-type cells</title><p>Although we did not observe an apparent reduction in the kinetochore localization of established CCAN proteins in CENP-S&#x02013; or CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), it is possible that CENP-S and -X play a role in controlling outer kinetochore assembly. To determine whether CENP-S or -X play a global role in controlling the assembly of non-CCAN proteins, we examined the structural morphology of the kinetochore outer plate by EM. For these experiments, we imaged 30&#x02013;40 170-nm-thick serial sections for individual mitotic cells treated with nocodazole. In both CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells and wild-type DT40 cells, we observed similar numbers of clear electron-dense kinetochore outer plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). We also observed a similar number (26.6 &#x000b1; 8.8) of outer plates in CENP-50 (U)&#x02013;deficient cells. In contrast, we observed that CENP-H deficiency causes a severe reduction in the number of visible outer plates (unpublished data), as previously shown for CENP-T deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hori et al., 2008a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>The length of the outer plate and the distance of the interkinetochore in CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells.</bold> (A) Electron micrograph showing a typical image of the kinetochore outer plate in wild-type (1 and 1&#x02032;) or CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells (2 and 2&#x02032;).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, the length of outer kinetochore plates varied even in individual cells. In wild-type cells, we observed a main peak of plate length of &#x0223c;200 nm and a shoulder peak of &#x0223c;300 nm, with a mean plate length of 227 nm (&#x000b1;70.5 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). In CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells, we observed a main peak of &#x0223c;150 nm and a shoulder peak of &#x0223c;240 nm, with a mean size of 185 nm (&#x000b1;61.7 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The plate length of CENP-50 (U)&#x02013;deficient cells (261 &#x000b1; 148.5 nm) was not significantly different from that of wild-type cells. These data suggest that CENP-S is involved in the formation of a functional kinetochore outer plate, which is essential for kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachment and faithful mitotic progression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> have previously reported that outer plate morphology is altered after treatment of siRNA against CENP-I. The contribution of CENP-S to the formation of a functional kinetochore may function coordinately with the CENP-I pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Intrakinetochore distance is increased in CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells in the absence of tension</title><p>During our analysis of outer plate structure by EM, we observed that the distance between the outer plate and electron-dense chromatin region in CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells was longer than that in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Therefore, we measured the distance in &#x0223c;150 kinetochores from our EM analysis for both CENP-S&#x02013;deficient and wild-type cells and found that the distance in CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells (29.9 nm) is significantly longer than that in wild-type cells (23.9 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). The distance in CENP-50 (U)&#x02013;deficient cells was 26.3 nm, which is slightly longer than that in wild-type cells but shorter than that in CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells. Recent studies suggested that the condensin complex regulates inter- and intrakinetochore distances under tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Maresca and Salmon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Uchida et al., 2009</xref>). However, inter- and intrakinetochore distances are not changed in condensin-null DT40 cells in the absence of tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ribeiro et al., 2009</xref>), which suggests that there is a mechanism to prevent the kinetochore from stretching in the absence of external force. Our EM analysis was performed after treatment with nocodazole, which eliminates kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachments and spindle forces. To confirm the EM observations, we stained chromosomes with anti&#x02013;CENP-T (an inner kinetochore protein) or anti-Ndc80 (Hec1; an outer kinetochore protein) antibodies after nocodazole treatment and measured the distances between sister kinetochores in CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient and wild-type cells. The distance between Ndc80 at two paired sister kinetochores was increased in CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells. In contrast, the distance between CENP-T between two paired inner kinetochores was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). These results indicate that the intrakinetochore distance is increased in both CENP-S and &#x02013;CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells and that this occurs structurally between the inner kinetochore protein CENP-T and the outer kinetochore protein Ndc80.</p></sec><sec><title>CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells display reduced localization of outer kinetochore proteins</title><p>The EM analysis suggests that there are defects in the proper formation of a functional kinetochore outer plate in CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells. Therefore, we next analyzed the localization of outer kinetochore proteins in CENP-S&#x02013; or CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells. The KMN network is located at the outer plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">DeLuca et al., 2005</xref>) and has a central role in forming kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>). Although the KMN network subunits KNL1, Mis12, and Ndc80 all localized to kinetochores in CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient DT40 cells, we found that the signal intensities of Ndc80 (&#x0223c;80% relative to control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>) and KNL1 (not depicted) were reduced in CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells relative to controls.

The CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X complex is essential for the stable assembly of outer kinetochore proteins.

In CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells, the amount of KNL1 and Ndc80 at kinetochores is reduced, and CCAN structure is less tight, which causes kinetochore to be overstretched (right).

In total, these results demonstrate that the assembly of the outer kinetochore components KNL1 and Ndc80 is compromised in CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells, which causes reduced outer plate formation.</p></sec><sec><title>A functional role for the CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X complex in the assembly of a kinetochore structure</title><p>Based on phenotype analysis of CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells and our previous work on the function and organization of the other CCAN components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Okada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hori et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">b</xref>), we propose a model in which the CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X complex is essential for the stable assembly of outer kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Although CENP-S has a potential histone-fold domain, the significance of this domain to the function of CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X complex is unclear. As the data in this study indicate, the CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X complex functions downstream of other components of the CCAN, and depletion of the CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X complex does not affect the localization of other CCAN proteins. Thus, the CENP-S&#x02013;CENP-X complex may directly allow the outer kinetochore to form efficiently and stably on the CCAN platform.</p><p>We also found that the intrakinetochore distance was increased in CENP-S&#x02013; and CENP-X&#x02013;deficient cells in the absence of tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Combined with our EM analysis, the inner kinetochore structure appears to be stretched in CENP-S&#x02013;deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, right). To our knowledge, these are the first proteins that have been identified with a role in kinetochore assembly related to the structure of the intrakinetochore distance in the absence of tension. Although this function may not be essential under all circumstances, as is seen for the null phenotype in DT40 cells, the ability to assemble a coherent kinetochore structure capable of resisting the force from the spindle microtubules and preventing merotelic attachment to opposing spindle poles is critical to the integrity of this important cell division structure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Molecular biology, cell culture, and transfection</title><p>Chicken target disruption constructs for each gene were generated such that genomic fragments encoding several exons were replaced with drug resistance cassettes under control of the &#x003b2;-actin promoter.
