It is important to determine how this process is regulated in enterocytes, the absorptive cells of the intestine, as prolonged postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis. During the postprandial period, dietary lipids, mostly triglycerides (TG) hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes, are combined with bile products and reach the apical membrane of enterocytes as postprandial micelles (PPM). Our aim was to determine whether these micelles induce, in enterocytes, specific early cell signaling events that could control the processes leading to TRL secretion.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The effects of supplying PPM to the apex of Caco-2/TC7 enterocytes were analyzed. Micelles devoid of TG hydrolysis products, like those present in the intestinal lumen in the interprandial period, were used as controls. The apical delivery of PPM specifically induced a number of cellular events that are not induced by interprandial micelles. These early events included the trafficking of apolipoprotein B, a structural component of TRL, from apical towards secretory domains, and the rapid, dose-dependent activation of ERK and p38MAPK. PPM supply induced the scavenger receptor SR-BI/CLA-1 to cluster at the apical brush border membrane and to move from non-raft to raft domains. Competition, inhibition or knockdown of SR-BI/CLA-1 impaired the PPM-dependent apoB trafficking and ERK activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These results are the first evidence that enterocytes specifically sense postprandial dietary lipid-containing micelles. SR-BI/CLA-1 is involved in this process and could be a target for further study with a view to modifying intestinal TRL secretion early in the control pathway.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The increased incidence of metabolic disorders (obesity, metabolic syndromes and diabetes) and the ensuing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases are linked to the significant changes in dietary habits that have occurred in recent decades, among which is an increase in fat intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Shikany1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Marked and prolonged postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, characterized by the accumulation of apolipoprotein B-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), is a significant contributor to the development of dyslipidemia and a known risk factor for atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Tomkin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Enterocytes in the intestine, the first organ to come into contact with digestion products, transfer dietary lipids to the organism and largely contribute to the production of TRL. It is thus important to characterize the mechanisms involved in the control of lipid absorption in these cells, especially those modulating the synthesis and secretion of TRL, as this could lead to the development of drugs acting on the early control steps in the intestinal transfer of dietary lipids, which could be used to reduce postprandial hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>The absorption of lipids through the intestine is no longer considered a passive process but rather an active regulation of highly polarized mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Mu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. During the postprandial period, dietary lipids, mostly triglycerides (TG), after being hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes into fatty acids (FA) and monoglycerides (MG) and solubilized by bile salts and lipids in the intestinal lumen, are supplied to enterocytes as postprandial micelles (PPM). After absorption of FA and MG by enterocytes, TG must be re-synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and associate with the structural apolipoprotein (apo) B48, and apoA-I and apoA-IV to produce chylomicrons, the intestinal postprandial form of TRL that are secreted into lymph and then into the general circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Mu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Davidson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The small intestine must adapt to the variations in lipid load and composition that occur daily between postprandial and interprandial periods (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Drozdowski1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>). The adaptation of enterocyte function has mainly been studied in terms of the effect of dietary lipids on gene expression and the action of transcription factors (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Sanderson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>At the same time, the small intestine signals nutrient abundance to the organism and contributes to satiety by the release of hormones and enteropeptides from enteroendocrine cells and by the secretion of chylomicrons and apoA-IV, a satiety signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Qin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, by enterocytes (for reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Raybould1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Cummings1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>). However, most studies on the effects of dietary lipids in the small intestine do not relate the structural aspects of lipid supply to enterocytes to the specificity of the effects. More precisely, they do not address whether the &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; mode of delivering dietary lipids to the apical pole of enterocytes as complex micelles, known to be critical for intestinal lipid intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Nordskog1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, is required to induce the effects reported. While some mechanisms by which enteroendocrine cells sense lipids have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-McLaughlin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, it is not known whether enterocytes sense dietary lipids. Previous works from our group indicated that there is some sensing of micellar dietary lipids by enterocytes as they demonstrated that the apical supply of postprandial micelles (mimicking those present in the intestinal lumen <italic>in vivo</italic> after a meal) induced specific effects in Caco-2/TC7 cells, a model reproducing in culture most of the morphological and functional characteristics of enterocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Chantret1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Zucco1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These effects involved the rapid displacement of the apical brush-border-associated pool of apoB towards intracellular secretory compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Morel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and the intracellular neosynthesis of TG, leading to the secretion of TRL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Chateau1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the apical supply of PPM induced the activation of apoA-IV transcription via the transcription factor HNF-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Carriere1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, a process also recently reported to occur in pig enterocytes <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Leng1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These PPM-induced effects were not obtained by the apical supply of albumin-bound fatty acids or of PPM lacking some component(s) or by supplying plasma fatty acids at the base of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Morel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Carriere1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These results indicated that the apical supply of fatty acids was not sufficient to trigger the cascade of events leading to the secretion of TRL and suggested that TRL secretion could involve an initial step whereby complex dietary lipid-containing micelles are sensed via a receptor located at the apical membrane of enterocytes, which would induce specific signals.</p><p>Our aim was thus to analyze the early events that are specifically induced by the apical supply of PPM and to determine the molecular mechanisms of PPM sensing in enterocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Chemicals and antibodies</title><p>Unless indicated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma France.

As early as 5 min after PPM supply, we observed an increase in the phosphorylation of five protein kinases, namely PAK1/2/3, MEK1, p38&#x003b1; MAPK, ERK1/2 and PKA C&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004278-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). Of these, MEK1, responsible for the activation of ERK1/2 in the canonical ERK pathway, was phosphorylated at three phosphosites (T385, S297 and T291). There was also an increase in the phosphorylation of the CREB1 protein, a target transcription factor of MAPK pathway (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Lang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>). None of these effects were observed when IPM was supplied to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004278-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>) even after 15 min (data not shown). As most of the kinases that were activated after PPM supply belong to the MAPK signaling pathway, we focused on ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, two kinases downstream in this pathway. PPM supply specifically increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK by 5 min and 2 min respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004278-g002"><bold>Figure 2B and 2C</bold></xref>) in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004278-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>) as determined by immunoblotting.</p><fig id="pone-0004278-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004278.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Trafficking of apoB is specifically induced by alimentary lipid-containing micelles.</title><p>Confocal image of apolipoprotein B (apoB, red channel) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI, used as a brush-border marker, green channel) localizations in differentiated Caco-2/TC7 cells cultured in the absence (control) or presence of postprandial (PPM) or inter-prandial (IPM) micelles added at the apical pole of the cells for 20 min.

This sensing step involves the clustering of SR-BI/CLA-1 at the apical membrane, a process associated with SR-BI/CLA-1 function in other cell models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Peng1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, and its recruitment into raft domains, that are known to contain various signaling molecules, including MAP kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Pike1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The localization of SR-BI/CLA-1 in raft domains differs from the observation of Hansen et al. (2003) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Hansen1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. This could be explained by differences in the experimental conditions used; these authors studied the lipid raft association of SR-BI in membrane preparations from intestinal mucosa scrapings of fasted pigs. One hypothesis is that the raft association of SR-BI depends on the nutritional status or on other environmental factors. It should be noted that the subcellular localization of SR-BI varies in different nutritional and hormonal conditions in adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Tondu1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-YvanCharvet1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>SR-BI/CLA-1 has been extensively studied in terms of its involvement in cholesterol transport in the liver and in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-VanEck1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, a role for SR-BI in lipid sensing in vascular endothelial cells has been described. In these cells, where SR-BI acts as a cholesterol sensor of HDL at the plasma membrane, the interaction with its ligand leads to a sequential activation of protein kinases that stimulate eNOS enzymatic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Assanasen1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Mineo1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> and Rac GTPase activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Seetharam1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of SR-BI/CLA-1 in the intestine remains controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Labonte1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Bietrix1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. It was previously thought that SR-BI/CLA-1 was responsible for the absorption of micellar cholesterol from the intestinal lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Levy1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Rhainds1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Hauser1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. However, deficiency of intestinal cholesterol absorption is not observed in SR-BI knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Mardones1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> and NPC1L1 was discovered to be the major intestinal transporter of cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Altmann1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> together suggesting that SR-BI/CLA-1 may play another role in enterocytes. The newly assigned role of SR-BI/CLA-1 as a sensor of lipid micelles in enterocytes, described here, is in accordance with results showing that 1) SR-BI/CLA-1 binds not only high-density lipoproteins but also lipid structures devoid of apolipoproteins like PPM, 2) the three-dimensional structures of SR-BI/CLA-1 ligands are important in modulating its activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Rhainds1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and 3) various SR-BI/CLA-1 ligands trigger MAPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Baranova1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Grewal1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> and PI3K/Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Mineo1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> signaling pathways. Furthermore, the overexpression of SR-BI in the intestine leads to increases in cholesterol absorption and triglyceride secretion indicating a functional role for SR-BI in triglyceride lipid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Bietrix1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our observations suggest that interaction between PPM and SR-BI/CLA-1 induces the establishment of a signaling platform in the brush border membrane of enterocytes that leads to the activation of cellular events, namely the activation of MAPK kinases and the trafficking of apoB, the structural protein involved in TRL assembly and secretion, from apical towards basolateral domains. A link has been made between apoB secretion and MAP kinase activation <italic>in vivo</italic> in fructose-fed hamsters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Federico1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. In this insulin resistance model, characterized by overproduction of hepatic VLDL and intestinal apoB-containing lipoproteins, basal levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 are higher in enterocytes and there is less intestinal apoB48 synthesis and secretion after inhibition of the ERK pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Federico1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently it has been shown that TNF-&#x003b1;-dependent overproduction of intestinal apoB-containing lipoproteins is mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway in hamster enterocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Qin2">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism by which SR-BI/CLA-1-mediated PPM sensing leads to apoB delocalization and MAP kinase activation may also involve SR-BI/CLA-1 partners through protein-protein interactions. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SR-BI/CLA-1 contains a PDZ-interacting domain. PDZK1 has been shown to be involved in the hepatic expression of SR-BI/CLA-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Yesilaltay1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> and PDZK1 knockdown in mouse models results in a decrease of SR-BI expression in the liver and intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Kocher1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. PDZK1 could thus mediate signaling events triggered by SR-BI/CLA-1.</p><p>That SR-BI may also participate to later intracellular events leading to TRL secretion, is suggested from a previous report by Hansen et al. (2003) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Hansen1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, pig intestinal explants were incubated with a lipid mixture containing corn oil, cholesterol, bile and pancreatin, i.e. mimicking the composition of lipid digestion products in the intestinal lumen, like the PPM used in our study. After three hours of incubation, SR-BI/CLA-1 was endocytosed from the brush border membrane of enterocytes and accumulated in newly formed cytosolic lipid droplets but not in secreted lipoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Hansen1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It should be recalled that, during the postprandial period, besides being secreted as TRL newly synthesized TG accumulate in cytosolic lipid droplets that can be remobilized and directed towards the endoplasmic reticulum lumen to be secreted as TRL, as observed in enterocytes <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Robertson1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Alqub1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref> and in Caco-2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Chateau1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004278-Pauquai1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our results provide evidence for an enterocyte sensing of alimentary lipid-containing micelles, which could prepare these absorptive cells for the massive postprandial availability of lipids, and that SR-BI/CLA-1 participates early in this process at the apical membrane of enterocytes. Changes in PPM sensing, and in the resulting secretion of TRL, could be caused by factors such as diet, hormones or pharmaceutical compounds, which modify the expression and/or activity of SR-BI/CLA-1, a new target in studying how the early stages of the intestinal transfer of dietary lipids is controlled.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank D.
