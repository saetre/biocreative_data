Three human &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR subtypes have been cloned and named &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-ARs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These receptors regulate several important central and peripheral processes, such as neuronal excitability, vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle contraction, and cellular growth and differentiation. The three &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR subtypes are structurally and pharmacologically distinct, but all couple through G<sub>q/11</sub> to cause activation of apparently similar intracellular signaling pathways.</p><p>The last four amino acids of the intracellular C-tail of the &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR, GEEV, matches the motif G(D/E)XV shown previously to interact with the class III PDZ domain of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Experiments using the yeast two-hybrid system showed previously that a protein corresponding to the last 114 amino acids of the rat &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR (previously referred to as &#x003b1;<sub>1C</sub>-AR) interacted strongly with the PDZ domain of nNOS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Since the corresponding amino acids at the C-terminus of &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub> (PGQF) and &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-ARs (ETDI) would not be predicted to interact with this PDZ domain, an interaction between &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs and nNOS could represent an interaction unique to this subtype.</p><p>PDZ domains are protein-binding modules involved in assembly of signaling complexes and subcellular protein targeting[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. For example, NMDA receptors in cultured cortical neurons associate with nNOS through PSD-95, a protein containing three PDZ domains[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Consequently, NMDA receptor activation increases nitric oxide production and neurotoxicity; while suppression of PSD-95 expression inhibits these responses. These results suggest that the PDZ domains of PSD-95 may facilitate the assembly of signaling complexes involving both NMDA receptors and nNOS, and the increases in intracellular Ca2+ caused by NMDA receptor activation may facilitate nNOS activation.</p><p>Since &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR activation also increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we studied the interaction between this receptor and nNOS. We wanted to determine whether full-length &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs interact with full-length nNOS, whether the interaction is subtype-specific, and whether it involves the GEEV motif in the C-terminal tail. We co-expressed epitope-tagged full length or C-terminally truncated &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-ARs with nNOS in HEK-293 cells and examined the ability of anti-Flag and anti-nNOS antibodies to immunoprecipitate both proteins. We found that nNOS does interact with full-length &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs, but that it also interacts with other &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR subtypes and &#x003b2;-ARs. In addition, the interaction does not require the C-terminal tail, confirming that it is not specific to the GEEV motif.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Co-immunoprecipitation of nNOS with HF&#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs</title><p>To study the interaction between &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs and nNOS, HEK-293 cells were transfected with rat nNOS and selected with geneticin (400 &#x003bc;g/ml). Western blots using an anti-nNOS antibody showed a strong immunoreactive band of ~170 kDa corresponding to nNOS in stably transfected cells as expected, but little or no signal in untransfected cells (data not shown). Expression of nNOS was similar to that observed with equal amounts of rat brain membrane protein run in parallel, suggesting similar expression levels. HEK-293 cells stably transfected with nNOS were co-transfected with the cDNA encoding HF&#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs. Expression levels of transiently transfected &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-ARs in these cells ranged from 100&#x02013;500 fmol/mg protein, also similar to levels observed in rat brain. Cells were then solubilized, immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 affinity resin, eluted, and blotted with anti-Flag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) or anti-nNOS antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Western blots of anti-Flag immunoprecipitates showed that HF&#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs migrated as monomers of ~50 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and also appeared as dimers and trimers, as reported previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Immunoprecipitation of HF&#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs with anti-Flag affinity resin resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of nNOS, as revealed by the 170 kDa band detected in immunoblots using anti-nNOS antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Note that nNOS immunoreactivity was not present in anti-Flag affinity resin immunoprecipitates from solubilized HEK-293 cells not transfected with HF&#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), showing that co-immunoprecipitation of nNOS requires presence of the tagged receptor construct.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag M2 affinity resin of solubilized HEK-293 cells co-expressing nNOS and HF-tagged &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR (Flag-A/nNOS) or HEK-293 expressing only nNOS (HEK/nNOS).

Previous work using a yeast two hybrid assay showed that the C-terminal 114 amino acids of rat &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs (referred to by the previous name of &#x003b1;<sub>1C</sub>-) strongly interacted with residues 1&#x02013;111 of nNOS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The bradykinin B2 receptor, also a G protein coupled receptor, has been shown to bind directly to the oxygenase domain of nNOS and form an inhibitory complex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and it has been proposed that nNOS is released and activated upon receptor stimulation. The domain of the bradykinin B2 receptor that interacts with nNOS is in the C-tail shortly after the predicted 7<sup>th</sup> transmembrane domain, and spatially similar but structurally dissimilar domains of the rat angiotensin AT1 receptor and human endothelin-1 ETB receptors have been proposed to block endothelial NOS (eNOS) activity, possibly through a similar mechanism[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore we wanted to determine whether there was a specific interaction between full-length &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs and nNOS in intact cells.</p><p>Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that epitope-tagged &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs do interact with full-length nNOS when expressed together in HEK-293 cells. Immunoprecipitation of HF&#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs from cells stably expressing nNOS caused co-immunoprecipitation of nNOS. Similarly, immunoprecipitation of nNOS caused co-immunoprecipitation of HF&#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs. This interaction appeared to be specific, since nNOS was not immunoprecipitated by anti-Flag affinity resin in cells not transfected with tagged receptors, and tagged receptors were not immunoprecipitated by anti-nNOS antibody in cells not expressing nNOS.</p><p>These results support an interaction between nNOS and &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs, which could be due to the previously reported interaction of the receptor C-terminus and the PDZ domain of nNOS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, this hypothesis is weakened by the unexpected observation that nNOS also co-immunoprecipitates with both &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-ARs. There is little or no homology between the C-terminal sequences of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-ARs, and neither &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub> nor &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-ARs contain the GEEV motif predicted to mediate the interaction between &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs and nNOS. However, nNOS was found to co-immunoprecipitate with both HF&#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>- and HF&#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-ARs after co-expression in HEK-293 cells. These interactions could be observed by blotting for the tagged receptors after immunoprecipitation with anti-nNOS antibody, or by blotting for nNOS after immunoprecipitation of the tagged receptors with anti-Flag antibody. Direct comparison of &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-ARs in the same experiment showed similar degrees of interactions of all three subtypes with nNOS (data not shown), further demonstrating that this interaction is not specific to the &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub> subtype.</p><p>We examined the role of the C-terminal tail in this interaction by constructing receptors in which the C-terminus was truncated. Studies with HF&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR subtypes with short (~20 aa) C-terminal tails suggested that the C-terminal tails are not required for interaction with nNOS. Following transfection into nNOS-expressing cells, immunoprecipitation of all three C-terminally truncated HF&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR constructs caused co-immunoprecipitation of nNOS similar to that observed with full-length receptors. Although PDZ domains of some proteins, such as PSD-95 and syntrophin, can bind internal peptide sequences that fold as &#x003b2;-fingers and mimic canonical C-terminal peptides[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], there is very little homology between the intracellular loops of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR subtypes, making it unlikely that there is a common internal amino acid sequence involved in interaction with nNOS.</p><p>Since we found nNOS to co-immunoprecipitate with all three &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR subtypes, we also determined whether it would directly associate with &#x003b2;-ARs. Flag-tagged &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-ARs were transfected into cells stably expressing nNOS, and after solubilization and immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag M2 affinity resin we again found co-immunoprecipitation of nNOS. Since &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-ARs show no sequence homology to &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AR subtypes in their intracellular domains, this further supports the conclusion that interaction with nNOS is not localized to discrete intracellular domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that full-length &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs do interact with nNOS; however this interaction is not subtype-specific since &#x003b1;<sub>1B</sub>- and &#x003b1;<sub>1D</sub>-ARs showed similar interactions. The interaction did not require the receptor C-terminus, and similar interactions were observed with &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-ARs. This data does not support a proposed specific interaction between the &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-AR C-terminus and the nNOS PDZ domain suggested by studies with fusion proteins.

Materials were obtained from the following sources: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM); L-NAME; norepinephrine ((-)-arterenol); streptomycin, penicillin, Flag peptide, anti-Flag M2 affinity resin, HRP-conjugated anti-Flag M2 antibody and goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma, St Louis, MO); geneticin; n-Dodecyl-&#x003b2;-D-maltoside (Calbiochem); anti-nNOS rabbit polyclonal antibody, Protein A-agarose resin (Santa Cruz); rabbit polyclonal dual phospho-specific anti-ERK antibody, PNGase F (New England Biolabs); and ECL reagent (Amersham).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK-293 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Medium with sodium pyruvate, 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/l streptomycin, and 100 U/l penicillin at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Confluent plates were subcultured at a 1:3 ratio. PC12 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Medium containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 1.4% glutamine, 20 mM Hepes, 100 U/l streptomycin, 100 U/l penicillin, 10% donor horse serum, and 5% fetal bovine serum. For measurement of ERK phosphorylation, 35 mm dishes of PC12 cells were seeded at a density of 600,000 cells/2 ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Transfections</title><p>Receptor coding sequences were generated by PCR, sequenced, and subcloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pDT containing sequential N-terminal hexahistidine and FLAG (HF) epitopes as previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. HEK-293 cells (150 mm plates) were transfected with 50 &#x003bc;g cDNA encoding the rat isoform of nNOS by calcium phosphate precipitation, and stably transfected cells selected with geneticin (400 &#x003bc;g/ml). cDNAs encoding each of the HF-human &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-ARs were transfected into parental HEK-293 cells or cells stably transfected with nNOS by calcium phosphate precipitation and cells harvested 48&#x02013;72 h later. The density of HF&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-ARs was measured by specific binding of [<sup>125</sup>I]-HEAT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and ranged from 100&#x02013;500 fmol/mg protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>HEK-293 cells expressing HF-tagged &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-ARs, nNOS, or both, were harvested by scraping and fractionated by repeated centrifugation and homogenization. Cell lysates (1&#x02013;2 mg protein) were solubilized in 1X buffer (25 mM Hepes and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) with 2% n-Dodecyl-&#x003b2;-D-maltoside for 90 min at 4&#x000b0;C in buffer A (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (aprotinin 2 &#x003bc;g/ml, leupeptin 2 &#x003bc;g/ml, pepstatin 2 &#x003bc;g/ml, benzamidine 2 &#x003bc;g/ml, PMSF 2 mM, and EDTA 50 mM). Solubilized samples were centrifuged, the supernatant diluted 10-fold with buffer A containing protease inhibitors, and incubated with 100&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;l anti-Flag M2 affinity resin for 90 min at 4&#x000b0;C with gentle rotation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Alternatively, the supernatant was incubated with 5 &#x003bc;l of anti-nNOS rabbit polyclonal antibody (200 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 90 min at 4&#x000b0;C and then incubated with 20 &#x003bc;l Protein A-agarose overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Immunoprecipitated material was recovered by centrifugation and washed at least 4 times with buffer A containing protease inhibitors. After washing, samples immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag affinity resin were eluted with 100 to 200 &#x003bc;l buffer A containing 400 &#x003bc;g/ml Flag peptide, while samples immunoprecipitated with anti-nNOS antibody were eluted with 40&#x003bc;l of 2X Laemmli loading buffer. All samples were deglycosylated after immunoprecipitation by treatment with 1 &#x003bc;l PNGase F for 2 h at room temperature. Aliquots of 30 &#x003bc;l were separated by 4&#x02013;20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with anti-Flag M2 antibodies conjugated to HRP (1:600) or anti-nNOS rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000) followed by goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:15,000). Proteins were visualized by ECL.</p></sec><sec><title>ERK phosphorylation in PC12 cells</title><p>Confluent PC12 cells stably transfected with HF-&#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-ARs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (~1 pmol/mg of protein) were serum-starved for 2 h before use, and incubated with or without l-NAME (500 &#x003bc;M/30 min). Cells were then incubated with norepinephrine or other agonists for 15 min and lysed with Laemmli sample buffer.
