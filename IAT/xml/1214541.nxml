Two examples of these linkages include Ceg1, a component of the mRNA capping enzyme, and the chromatin elongation factors Spt4&#x02013;5, both of which have recently been shown to play a role in the normal splicing of several genes in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Using a genomic approach to characterize the roles of Spt4&#x02013;5 in splicing, we used splicing-sensitive DNA microarrays to identify specific sets of genes that are mis-spliced in <italic>ceg1, spt4,</italic> and <italic>spt5</italic> mutants. In the context of a complex, nested, experimental design featuring 22 dye-swap array hybridizations, comprising both biological and technical replicates, we applied five appropriate statistical models for assessing differential expression between wild-type and the mutants. To refine selection of differential expression genes, we then used a robust model-synthesizing approach, Differential Expression via Distance Synthesis, to integrate all five models. The resultant list of differentially expressed genes was then further analyzed with regard to select attributes: we found that highly transcribed genes with long introns were most sensitive to <italic>spt</italic> mutations. QPCR confirmation of differential expression was established for the limited number of genes evaluated. In this paper, we showcase splicing array technology, as well as powerful, yet general, statistical methodology for assessing differential expression, in the context of a real, complex experimental design. Our results suggest that the Spt4&#x02013;Spt5 complex may help coordinate splicing with transcription under conditions that present kinetic challenges to spliceosome assembly or function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><sec id="st1"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Splicing is a key process for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and is credited as being the main reason for the extraordinary complexity of the human proteome relative to the human genome. Accurate splicing is crucial for normal protein function; aberrant transcripts due to splicing mutations are known causes for 15&#x00025; of genetic diseases. Therefore, elucidation of splicing mechanisms will not only help in understanding the complexity and diversity of higher organisms, but also potentially aid in new therapeutic strategies for treatments of splicing-related genetic disorders. It has been previously shown that splicing has important links to other steps involved with gene expression. In this study, the authors pursue a genome-wide approach, using yeast-based, splicing-sensitive, DNA microarrays in order to further characterize the roles of select splicing factors. They devise novel statistical and computational methods that enable identification of specific sets of genes that are mis-spliced in the chosen splicing factors. Follow-up investigation of known attributes of the genes so elicited indicates that these factors may help coordinate splicing and transcription in situations where additional energy is required to effect splicing.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Xiao Y, Yang YH, Burckin TA, Shiue L, Hartzog GA, et al.

After a gene is transcribed into pre-mRNA, the introns are removed from the transcript and the exons are joined by the spliceosome. This reaction, splicing, can also be used to create multiple transcripts from a single gene. For example, a particular exon may be included in one version of an mRNA, and skipped in another. This process of alternative splicing is subject to regulation in response to tissue, developmental, and environmental cues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;. In humans, most genes are subject to splicing and more than half are likely subject to alternative splicing, which is credited as the most important source for the extraordinary enrichment in complexity of the human proteome relative to the genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;.

Therefore, elucidation of splicing mechanisms will not only help us understand the operating mechanisms underneath the functional complexity and diversity of higher eukaryotes, but also aid in new therapeutic strategies for treatments in splicing-related genetic disorders.</p><p>Although the different steps of gene expression are typically studied in isolation, it is clear that there are important functional links between them &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b02">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. For example, the process of capping the 5&#x02032; end of pre-mRNAs is thought to influence both transcription and splicing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, the rate of transcription elongation appears to influence splicing and alternative splice site choice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, a number of pre-mRNA processing factors are recruited to transcripts via interaction with RNA polymerase II &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, a comprehensive description of mRNA synthesis will require an understanding between these functional linkages of steps in gene expression.</p><p>Traditionally, gene expression is studied on an individual gene basis by ad hoc experiments. With the advent of eukaryotic genomic sequences, a global genomic view of mRNA production is achievable, and recently, several large-scale gene expression profiling experiments utilizing microarray technology have provided an unprecedented amount of information regarding the mechanisms underlying its regulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b09">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a simple yeast that has been used as a model to study eukaryotic gene expression, presents a convincing entry point to embark on this task. The yeast genome is completely sequenced and well annotated, and the splicing machinery of yeast is well conserved with that of humans. Among the more than ~5,800 genes in the yeast genome, only about 250 of them possess introns and only a handful have multiple introns or are alternatively spliced &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;. However, these 250 intronic genes give rise to 27&#x00025; of the transcripts synthesized by the cell, an indication of the importance of splicing in yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Clark et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d; designed a DNA microarray that allows the simultaneous analysis of splicing and mRNA levels in yeast. To discriminate between spliced and unspliced transcripts, oligonucleotide probes on these arrays were designed to detect the splice junctions (SJ), introns, and second exons of intron-containing genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). SJ are found only in spliced transcripts, whereas introns exist only in unspliced transcripts and splicing intermediates. Second exons are present in both spliced and unspliced transcripts and are good indicators of total transcript level. To detect these different classes of transcripts, the arrays are competitively hybridized with probes derived from control and experimental yeast strains. For several splicing mutants, Clark et al. compared their whole genome splicing data to traditional molecular analyses of a small number of transcripts and found that reliance on only one or two genes as reporters may lead to misinterpretation of the role of a factor in splicing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the whole genome approach provides a more reliable method for assessing the role of particular factors in splicing.</p><p>Burckin et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d; recently used splicing-sensitive DNA microarrays to analyze 80 different yeast strains carrying mutations in genes encoding components of the gene expression machinery. Using clustering and machine learning techniques, they compared gene expression patterns in these mutants and discovered functional roles for specific factors at multiple steps in the gene expression pathway, further confirming the coordination and coupling of the machineries along the pathway.</p><p>Previously, Hartzog et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d; found evidence that the chromatin elongation factors Spt4 and Spt5 play a role in RNA processing in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Spt4 and Spt5 form a complex that regulates transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. This complex is conserved across eukaryotes and has been proposed to both facilitate transcription by removing a nucleosomal barrier to transcript elongation and also suppress inappropriate transcription by reassembling nucleosomes behind transcribing polymerase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;. The recent finding that Spt5 interacts physically and genetically with pre-mRNA capping factors suggests a role for Spt4&#x02013;Spt5 in capping &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Because pre-mRNA capping is thought to increase the efficiency of splicing, Lindstrom et al. further analyzed splicing in <italic>spt4</italic> and <italic>spt5</italic> mutants and found that several genes were not spliced with normal efficiency &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;. In the splicing array study described above, Burckin et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d; found extensive but not universal splicing defects in <italic>spt4</italic> and <italic>spt5</italic> mutants. Interestingly, they also found that the capping enzyme appears to play an essential role in splicing. Thus, their genome-wide analysis of splicing provided particularly striking examples of linkages between steps in gene expression. However, the experimental design of that study precluded identification of specific genes dependent upon particular factors for their splicing.</p><p>Such identification is the purpose of our present study. While we also utilize splicing-specific DNA microarrays, we do so in the context of an experimental design that enables elicitation of specific intron-containing genes that are mis-spliced in <italic>spt4, spt5,</italic> or <italic>ceg1</italic> mutants. In addition, we examine the aberrant splicing patterns caused by several phenotypically distinct <italic>spt5</italic> mutations that had not been previously examined. Our primary data analytic task is therefore the determination of the set (possibly empty) of genes that have altered expression as reported by the SJ and intron probes. To do this, we assayed each mutant multiple times and then employed a recently devised statistical framework that robustly and efficiently identifies genes exhibiting differential expression (DE) in the mutants.</p><p>Many methods have been advanced for this task of identifying differentially expressed genes. Fold change has been extensively used to yield lists of genes that have altered expression beyond a prescribed threshold. Despite its methodological simplicity and intuitive appeal, fold change lacks a statistical framework (there is no accommodation of expression variation) and is biased toward selecting genes at low expression levels. Another class of frequently used methods treats the task of comparing expression levels in different biological states as a univariate testing problem, employing various corrections for test multiplicity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Kerr et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d; propose using traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques, since these readily handle known sources of variation due to, for example, dye labeling and sample or array replicates. By removing these effects from the estimation of the error term, we achieve a reduction in this term and correspondingly sharper inferences. Wolfinger et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d; extend the ANOVA framework by treating some factors, for example, dyes and arrays, as random representatives of a large population (that is, as random effects) resulting in a mixed model. There are several Bayesian alternatives to the above approaches &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d;, as well as some intermediary approaches that yield regularized <italic>t</italic> statistics &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our study employs a complex experiment design, featuring 22 dye-swap array hybridizations comprising both biological and technical replications (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). As elaborated in the next section, we initially analyzed these data with four ANOVA mixed models and the semiparametric hierarchical mixture model (SHMM) of Newton et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b31">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Instead of arbitrating between these models and picking a single model on which to base DE declarations, we exploit the fact that all five models are estimating the same quantity and employ a novel synthesizing scheme &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;, Differential Expression via Distance Synthesis (DEDS), to derive a list of differentially expressed genes in <italic>spt</italic> mutants. This method compares favorably with the best individual models, while enjoying improved robustness properties &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Further analysis of such genes, whose splicing is altered in <italic>spt</italic> mutants, reveals common biochemical characteristics and attributes, which may provide new insights into the mechanisms of RNA processing and its connections to transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental Design and Data Pre-Processing</title><p>In yeast, <italic>SPT4</italic> is a non-essential gene encoding a 102-amino-acid protein, and <italic>spt4&#x00394;</italic> (null) mutants display mutant phenotypes and genetic interactions consistent with an elongation defect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>SPT5</italic> encodes a large protein, and <italic>spt5</italic> mutations typically display mutant phenotypes and genetic interactions similar to those observed for <italic>spt4</italic> mutations, although they are often phenotypically more severe, consistent with the fact that <italic>SPT5</italic> is essential for life &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;. In this work, we have analyzed an <italic>spt4</italic> null mutation, and three partial loss-of-function mutations in <italic>SPT5</italic>. Two of these, <italic>spt5&#x02013;4</italic> and <italic>spt5&#x02013;194,</italic> encode versions of Spt5 that are defective for binding Spt4 (GAH, J. Yamada, and T. Egelhofer, unpublished data).

The Spt5&#x02013;242 protein still binds Spt4, even at the non-permissive temperature (GAH, J. Yamada, and T. Egelhofer, unpublished data). In addition, we include analysis of <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250,</italic> a temperature-sensitive mutation that causes rapid inactivation of the capping enzyme at the non-permissive temperature &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Two independent mRNA samples were prepared from each mutant, fluorescently labeled, and then hybridized to the splicing arrays competitively with a probe derived from wild-type cells. Experiments were performed using a replicated dye-swap study design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, there were four arrays (A1&#x02013;A4) for each mutant versus wild-type experiment. The first mRNA sample was hybridized to arrays A1 and A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), and the second was hybridized to A3 and A4. In A1 and A3, the mutant mRNA sample was labeled with Cy5 dye, and the wild-type sample was labeled with Cy3. The dye assignment was reversed for arrays A2 and A4. In addition to these 20 mutant arrays (four arrays &#x000d7; five mutants), there were two separate wild-type self-hybridization experiments, in which the wild-type was labeled with both Cy5 and Cy3. These self-hybridizations serve as technical replicates, that is, as controls for variation in labeling and hybridization.</p><p>To provide a global view of splicing defects in the <italic>ceg</italic> and <italic>spt</italic> mutants, we plotted unnormalized log intensity values for signals from the two channels, mutant against wild-type, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Points that represent individual array features are color coded so that exon, SJ, intron, and intronless gene features can be visually differentiated. Genes lying on the diagonal have a ratio close to 1, and their expression in the mutants is therefore largely unaffected. For <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250,</italic> shown in the lower right panel, introns (light blue points) deviate noticeably from the diagonal toward the <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250</italic> axis. This is a clear indication of intron accumulation in the <italic>ceg1</italic> mutant. SJ (dark blue points) in <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250,</italic> on the other hand, largely display ratios of less than 1, indicating a decrease in SJ formation. Taken together, an accumulation of introns and loss of SJ in <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250</italic> is indicative of a splicing defect. Compared with <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250</italic>, the four <italic>spt</italic> mutants exhibit fewer alterations in splicing, with <italic>spt5&#x02013;194</italic> most severely affected, in agreement with its phenotypic characteristics. A control plot from the wild-type self-hybridization is depicted in the upper left panel. As expected, no separation is observed in introns and SJ, and all points conform closely to the diagonal.</p><p>Boxplots of normalized ratios of splicing-related probes stratified by mutants are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g004">Figure 4</xref>. The general trend of the SJ probe ratios shows a shift from the horizontal zero line in the negative direction, signaling a decreased expression of SJ in the mutants. The <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250</italic> mutant showed the largest decrease, and <italic>spt5&#x02013;194</italic> was the most severely affected of the <italic>spt</italic> mutants. The boxplots of the exon probe ratios display a similar pattern of change&#x02014;the expression of exon probes was also decreased in the mutants. This is consistent with the idea that the majority of the exon 2 probe signal for a transcript is derived from mRNA, which is stable and long-lived in comparison to pre-mRNA. It is of interest to investigate if the decrease of the SJ probe and exon probe ratios is correlated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g005">Figure 5</xref> displays the scatterplots between ratios of these probes. The upper panel shows evident correlation between SJ and exon ratios. In contrast to the exons and SJ, ratios of the intron probes do not show any shift from the horizontal zero line, but spread for the mutants is nonetheless increased. Furthermore, there is no obvious correlation between the intron and exon ratios. In both plots, however, the spread of the cloud of points is mutant dependent and related to the severity of splicing defects. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g004">Figure 4</xref>, it is clear that several of the mutants tested, <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250, spt5&#x02013;194,</italic> and <italic>spt5&#x02013;242,</italic> cause strong decreases in exon and SJ signals and, more idiosyncratic, gene-specific changes in intron signals. Do these changes reflect altered transcription, splicing, RNA decay, or a mixture of potential defects? To focus on alterations of splicing efficiency independent of changes in transcription, we used the intron accumulation (IA) and SJ indices of Clark et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;, which normalize ratios of intron and SJ signals to the ratios measured for the second exon. The SJ index is the change of the SJ probe signal normalized by the change of overall gene expression level as measured by the related exon probe signal: <italic>SJ</italic> &#x0003d; log(<italic>SpliceJunction<sub>mut</sub></italic>/<italic>SpliceJunction<sub>wt</sub></italic>)/(<italic>Exon<sub>mut</sub></italic>/<italic>Exon<sub>wt</sub></italic>). Similarly, the IA index is obtained as the normalized change of the intron probe signals: <italic>IA</italic> &#x0003d; (<italic>Intron<sub>mut</sub></italic>/<italic>Intron<sub>wt</sub></italic>)/(<italic>Exon<sub>mut</sub></italic>/<italic>Exon<sub>wt</sub></italic>). Relating changes in the SJ and intron signals to changes in the second exon takes into account changes in overall expression level that may occur as a result of alterations in other steps of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>DE Models</title><p>The experimental design of the splice mutant study motivated the use of four different mixed ANOVA models in addition to the SHMM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t001">Table 1</xref>). These were separately applied to the two splicing indices. The four ANOVA models are distinguished by including wild-type self-hybridizations or not and allowing gene-specific heterogeneity or not.

This methodology was selected for the following reasons: (i) the SHMM is non-parametric where there is sufficient information (lots of genes) and parametric where there is limited information (observations per gene), and this synthesis makes for an appropriately balanced strategy; and (ii) as is standard, our ANOVA approaches treat gene <italic>(G),</italic> mutant <italic>(V),</italic> and gene&#x02013;mutant interactions <italic>(GV)</italic> as fixed effects. Thus, there is no information sharing between genes. The SHMM achieves such sharing and does so in a more principled and flexible manner than some of the ad hoc approaches proposed that yield regularized <italic>t</italic>-statistics &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b35">35</xref>&#x0005d;. The SHMM also has limitations, the foremost of which perhaps is the adequacy of the parametric assumptions. The extent of such assumptions has been appreciably relaxed compared to the preceding fully parametric treatment of Kendziorski et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, diagnostic tools are provided for assumption checking. Additionally, the present implementation supports only two group comparisons. Thus, there is some potential efficiency loss for the nested design employed in the splice study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

Rather than trying to arbitrate between models and pick a single model on which to base DE declarations, or informally distilling sets of genes that are differentially expressed under two or more models, we applied DEDS here as a robust means to refine selection of DE genes as furnished by the above five individual models. The simple underlying principle of DEDS is that genes that are highly ranked (as being differentially expressed) by all five models are more likely to be truly differentially expressed than genes that are high only for a single model. Further details concerning DEDS are provided in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;, while an algorithm outline is sketched in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.</p><p>The task of identifying differentially expressed genes consists of two components: (i) ranking genes in order of evidence for DE; and (ii) declaration of a set of DE genes by thresholding the ranked list. Here, we examine the robustness of DEDS with respect to both components. A comparison of ranking of DE genes by DEDS and individual measures, using an example based on the IA indices of <italic>spt5&#x02013;242,</italic> is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g006">Figure 6</xref>A. Ranks are logged so that correlations of DE genes (low ranks) are more clearly displayed. We see a similar level of concordance between ranks from DEDS and individual models. The numbers of genes identified as differentially expressed by DEDS under false discovery rates (FDR) 0.01 and 0.05 for SJ as well as IA indices are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t003">Table 3</xref>. To examine the stability of the DE findings, we assessed the impact of scale choice of measures and the interrelated choice of distance metric. We investigated all combinations of (raw, logarithm) <italic>p</italic>-value scales &#x0002a; (Euclidean, city block) distances. Representative results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g006">Figure 6</xref>B. Genes are ordered according to their DE significance by the raw/Euclidean combination, so that the black points are monotone by definition. The dashed gray line marks the 0.05 <italic>q</italic>-value threshold. The corresponding numbers of declared DE genes for these four combinations range from 145 to 163, of which 139 are common to all four combinations. This demonstrates that, for the splice array experiment, DEDS-based selections of DE genes are largely insensitive to the different scales and distance metrics examined. This concordance, evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g006">Figure 6</xref>, pertains to the IA index and the <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250</italic> mutant. Analogous concordance was observed for the SJ index and the other mutants.</p><p>The observation of greater numbers of genes identified as differentially expressed based on the IA index data than on the SJ data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t003">Table 3</xref>) reinforced the finding in Clark et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d; that IA indices are a more sensitive indicator for splicing defects. The splicing defect in the yeast capping enzyme mutant <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250</italic> is catastrophic, whereas in the <italic>spt4</italic> and <italic>spt5</italic> mutants fewer genes exhibit a splicing defect.

To validate our findings, we have used quantitative RT-PCR (QPCR) analysis to quantitatively examine five intron-containing genes, as well as two unspliced genes, in all five mutants. We previously performed a qualitative analysis of three of these genes, <italic>U3B, RPS25A,</italic> and <italic>RPL26A,</italic> and found that they were inefficiently spliced in <italic>spt4</italic> and <italic>spt5</italic> mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;. By choosing primers that flank the intron&#x02013;exon2 junction, we can specifically detect unspliced pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). We also picked primers to detect either the second exon, or spliced mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). As with the microarrays, we can normalize changes in pre-mRNA levels to changes in spliced mRNA or total mRNA (that is, exon2).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t004">Table 4</xref>, the results of the RT-PCR analysis generally agreed with the microarray analysis. Strikingly, in the four <italic>spt</italic> mutants, genes identified by DEDS showed an absolute increase in pre-mRNA levels, while in the <italic>ceg1</italic> mutant none of the pre-mRNAs showed an absolute increase as compared to wild-type. After normalizing the pre-mRNA signals to the spliced mRNA or second exon signals to account for potential changes in transcription or transcript stability, <italic>ceg1</italic> also showed a splicing defect as predicted by DEDS. Furthermore, the performance of DEDS was superior to the four ANOVA models and equivalent to the SHMM in terms of numbers of false positives and negatives over all five mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010039-st002">Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Description and Analysis of DE Genes</title><p>There are likely multiple molecular mechanisms by which different genes were differentially expressed in the mutants discussed here. To account for some of these mechanisms, we subdivided the lists of DE genes with a <italic>q</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 (controlling FDR) before further analysis. First, we reasoned that positive and negative changes in IA likely occurred via different molecular mechanisms. Therefore, for each of the five mutants examined, the DE genes were divided into lists of genes with either positive or negative fold change (here, fold change refers to the IA index). Second, because ribosomal protein genes represent a large fraction of all spliced genes in yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;, and because they are subject to a common mode of regulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;, we further subdivided our lists of DE genes into sublists of ribosomal (RP) and non-RP genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t005">Table 5</xref>). Finally, we focused upon the IA index, as it is more sensitive to alterations in splicing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>For the <italic>spt5</italic> and <italic>ceg1</italic> mutants, a large majority of the DE genes encoded RP proteins, whereas only ~40&#x00025; of all intron-containing genes encode RP proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t005">Table 5</xref> and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;). Furthermore, a number of translation and rRNA processing factors are among the non-RP genes found in our analysis, and it is possible that these genes are regulated by the same strategies as the RPs. Interestingly, for those DE genes with a negative fold change&#x02014;that is, those that were apparently spliced more efficiently&#x02014;we found no RP genes. This suggests that the genes with a negative or positive fold change in the IA index have distinct dependencies upon Spt4&#x02013;Spt5 and Ceg1.</p><p>We next asked if the genes identified in this analysis shared any particular attributes. It has previously been noted that introns in yeast display a bimodal distribution of sizes and positions within genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;. RP protein genes have large introns that occur relatively early in a pre-mRNA, whereas non-RP genes typically have smaller introns that occur somewhat later in the mRNA. Furthermore, RP genes are highly transcribed, whereas non-RP genes tend to be less highly transcribed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore compared the transcription rates and size and positions of introns within the DE genes that displayed a positive fold change (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t006">Table 6</xref>). In the <italic>ceg1</italic> mutant, the set of DE genes had no unusual properties other than the non-RP DE genes being transcribed somewhat more frequently than the average non-RP gene. In the <italic>spt</italic> mutants, intron position of the DE genes was not significantly different from the average for RP and non-RP genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t006">Table 6</xref>). In contrast, in the <italic>spt5&#x02013;4</italic> and <italic>spt5&#x02013;194</italic> mutants, the non-RP DE genes shared attributes of RP genes: they tended to have longer introns and be more highly expressed than the typical non-RP gene. The non-RP DE genes in the <italic>spt4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>spt5&#x02013;242</italic> mutants represent an intermediate case; their introns are not significantly longer than those of the typical non-RP intron-containing genes, but they are more highly transcribed.</p><p>The DE genes with a negative fold change appear to represent a distinct class of genes. First, they encoded only non-RPs. Second, they resembled the typical non-RP intron-containing genes in that they had short introns; however, they were expressed at even lower levels than the typical non-RPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t007">Table 7</xref>), contrary to the DE genes with positive fold changes. Again, this is consistent with the idea that these genes were differentially expressed for reasons distinct from those leading to DE of genes with a positive fold change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we showcased splicing array technology and developed methodologies for its analysis in the context of a real, complex experimental design. We applied four ANOVA mixed models and a SHMM, and used DEDS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d; to derive a list of DE genes. The DEDS algorithm synthesizes statistics or methods that estimate the same quantity of interest. The underlying principle behind DEDS is that genes that are highly ranked by different methods are more likely to be truly differentially expressed than genes that rank highly on a single measure. In our previous work, we have evaluated DEDS on diverse datasets, featuring both one-channel Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays and two-channel spotted arrays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Using a set of spike-in (Affymetrix) datasets, where differentially expressed genes are known, we demonstrated that DEDS compares favorably with the best individual statistics while enjoying robustness properties lacked by the individual statistics &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Previous to this and other microarray studies, only four genes had been identified and confirmed for splicing defects in <italic>spt4</italic> and <italic>spt5</italic> mutants using traditional molecular techniques &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, Burckin et al. have used splicing-sensitive DNA microarrays to compare patterns of splicing defects across a diverse set of mutations affecting gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;, but this and the previous study lacked a statistical or quantitative framework for rigorous determination of specific genes that were differentially expressed. Here, we have used splicing-sensitive DNA microarrays combined with DEDS to analyze all known intron-containing genes in the yeast genome and to specifically identify those genes whose proper splicing is dependent upon <italic>SPT4, SPT5,</italic> or <italic>CEG1</italic>. Despite the differences in experimental goals and designs, the findings of these two studies are nonetheless consistent. In Burckin et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;, the analyses using hierarchical clustering and support vector machines showed that the overall impact of the loss of Ceg1 function in vivo is nearly identical to that of bona fide splicing factors, which is in line with the large number of DE genes we found whose splicing is abnormal in <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t003">Table 3</xref>). Also in our previous study, <italic>spt4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>spt5&#x02013;194</italic> mutants displayed a lesser splicing defect than the <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250</italic> mutant, which is again consistent with our current findings. Comparison of the lists of DE genes for the five mutants examined here revealed that most of the genes that were differentially expressed in the <italic>spt</italic> mutants were also differentially expressed in the <italic>ceg1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010039-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010039-st001">Table S1</xref>). The <italic>spt5&#x02013;242</italic> mutant differed from the other <italic>spt5</italic> mutants in that it did not preferentially affect the splicing of non-RP genes with long introns. We do not understand the mechanistic basis for this observation, although it is consistent with our previous observations that this <italic>spt5</italic> mutation is phenotypically distinct from other <italic>spt5</italic> alleles and therefore may cause a distinct biochemical defect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b38">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data further suggest that Spt4&#x02032;s contribution to splicing is modest, as only a handful of genes were differentially expressed in the <italic>spt4</italic> mutant. This is consistent with the observation that, in contrast to <italic>SPT5, SPT4</italic> is not essential for life. Furthermore, this observation suggests that the defects caused by the <italic>spt5&#x02013;4</italic> and <italic>spt5&#x02013;194</italic> mutations extend beyond the Spt4 binding defect we have observed for the Spt5&#x02013;4 and Spt5&#x02013;194 proteins. Since there is currently no evidence that Spt4 functions independently of Spt5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d;, these observations suggest that Spt4 assists in, but is not essential for, the functions of Spt4&#x02013;Spt5 in splicing.</p><p>The smaller number of DE genes in the <italic>spt</italic> mutants compared to <italic>ceg1&#x02013;250</italic> may indicate a lesser effect on splicing rather than an effect on a distinct subset of intron-containing genes. It is interesting to note, however, that highly transcribed genes with long introns&#x02014;that is, RP genes and a subset of non-RP genes with long introns&#x02014;were most sensitive to the <italic>spt</italic> mutations. These data suggest that the Spt4&#x02013;Spt5 complex may play a particular role in coordinating splicing with transcription under conditions that present kinetic challenges to the spliceosome or its assembly, that is, when splice sites are widely separated, increasing the separation in time and space between the synthesis of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites, or when a gene is highly transcribed, creating the need for rapid and repeated assembly of spliceosomes over one site on a gene. In addition, these data are consistent with recent evidence demonstrating an effect of RNA polymerase II elongation rates on alternative splicing in higher eukaryotes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b40">40</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, the non-RP genes spliced more efficiently in the <italic>spt</italic> mutants tend to be transcribed less frequently than the average non-RP gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0010039-t007">Table 7</xref>). Thus, as is the case for transcription, the Spt4&#x02013;Spt5 complex may have both positive and negative effects on splicing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, this is consistent with previous observations that altered transcription elongation may lead to increased splicing, presumably due to increased opportunities for recognition of suboptimal splice sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010039-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

Several genes were omitted from these analyses because there was no good data concerning their transcription frequency or intron position or size. In addition, Mtr2, which has multiple, overlapping introns, was considered to have a single intron for this analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010039-st001">Table S1</xref>). To determine if the properties of DE genes in a mutant were significantly different from those of all RP or non-RP intron-containing genes, we used a non-parametric resampling method.
