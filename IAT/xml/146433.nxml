Here we show that human and mouse SRP9/14 bind with high affinities to other Alu-like RNAs of different evolutionary ages including the neuron-specific BC200 RNA. The relative dissociation constants of the different RNA-protein complexes are inversely proportional to the evolutionary distance between the Alu RNA species and 7SL RNA. In addition, the human SRP9/14 binds with higher affinity than mouse SRP9/14 to all RNAs analyzed and this difference is not explained by the additional C-terminal domain present in the anthropoid SRP14. The conservation of high affinity interactions between SRP9/14 and Alu-like RNAs strongly indicates that these Alu-like RNPs exist in vivo and that they have cellular functions. The observation that human SRP9/14 binds better than its mouse counterpart to distantly related Alu RNAs, such as recently transposed elements, suggests that the anthropoid-specific excess of SRP9/14 may have a role in controlling Alu amplification rather than in compensating a defect in SRP assembly and functions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
