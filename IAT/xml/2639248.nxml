It develops through premalignant changes that are characterized by high levels of keratin 14 (K14) expression in the airway epithelium and evolve through basal cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia and dysplasia to carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> and invasive carcinoma. In order to explore the impact of K14 in the pulmonary epithelium that normally lacks both squamous differentiation and K14 expression, human keratin 14 gene <italic>hK14</italic> was constitutively expressed in mouse airway progenitor cells using a mouse Clara cell specific 10 kDa protein (CC10) promoter. While the lungs of CC10-hK14 transgenic mice developed normally, we detected increased expression of K14 and the molecular markers of squamous differentiation program such as involucrin, loricrin, small proline-rich protein 1A, transglutaminase 1 and cholesterol sulfotransferase 2B1. In contrast, wild-type lungs were negative. Aging CC10-hK14 mice revealed multifocal airway cell hyperplasia, occasional squamous metaplasia and their lung tumors displayed evidence for multidirectional differentiation. We conclude that constitutive expression of <italic>hK14</italic> initiates squamous differentiation program in the mouse lung, but fails to promote squamous maturation. Our study provides a novel model for assessing the mechanisms of premalignant lesions <italic>in vivo</italic> by modifying differentiation and proliferation of airway progenitor cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Squamous cell carcinoma (SQCA) of the lung accounts for &#x0223c;20% of human lung cancers in the USA and is strongly linked with cigarette smoking. Lung SQCA and its precursor lesions express high levels of keratin 14 (K14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In many epithelia, including that of skin, esophagus and tongue, squamous differentiation represents a normal pathway of differentiation, whereas in other tissues, including the epithelial lining of conducting airways, it occurs under pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Morphologic and biochemical studies have indicated that squamous differentiation is a multistage process and involves the sequential expression of many specific genes including keratins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>Keratins form a cytoplasmic network of 10&#x02013;12 nm wide intermediate filaments and are classified into acidic type I keratins K9&#x02013;K23 and basic type II keratins K1&#x02013;K8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). They occur as heterodimers, whose expression is dependent on the type of the epithelium. K14 is an epidermal keratin, which is paired with keratin 5 (K5) and located in the proliferating basal cell layer of stratified squamous epithelia. On the other hand, K8 and 18 are the keratins in non-cutaneous, single-layered epithelium including normal airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). There is emerging evidence that cytokeratins are important scaffolding proteins that may impact many cellular functions ranging from cell signaling to proliferation and apoptosis in addition to their more traditional role in structural support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>SQCA is the only human lung cancer type, whose premalignant lesions are well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). It is thought to develop from K14-positive basal cells through hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia and dysplasia to <italic>in situ</italic> and invasive carcinoma, whereas normal airway epithelium lacks any signs of squamous differentiation. In mouse lung, SQCA and K14-containing cells are exceedingly rare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgn190/DC1">supplementary Figure 1s</ext-link> is available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online).

Here, we show evidence that constitutive expression of <italic>hK14</italic> initiates squamous differentiation pathway in CC10-hK14 transgenic (TG) mouse lung as evidenced by the expression of squamous differentiation markers of the cornified cell envelope (CCE) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). TG animals displayed multifocal airway cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia and lung tumors with increasing age. While there was no histological evidence for overt squamous maturation, tumors displayed immunohistochemical evidence for multidirectional differentiation, suggesting that <italic>hK14</italic> modulates divergent pathways in the lung.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of hK14 construct</title><p>We cloned <italic>hK14</italic> from human epidermal keratinocytes (ScienceCell Research Laboratories, San Diego, CA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using high-fidelity enzyme <italic>pfu</italic> (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgn190/DC1">supplementary Figure 2s</ext-link> is available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online).

Multiple lines of the CC10-hK14 TG mice revealed a 4- to 7-fold relative increase in the mRNA of <italic>hK14</italic>. Moreover, the protein levels of K14 were comparable with the levels observed in human bronchial epithelial cells, which were used as a positive control.</p><p>The constitutive expression of hK14 under the mCC10 promoter was well tolerated in the airways that normally express K8 and K18 of simple epithelium. The type II keratin K5 mRNA, which is normally the partner for the type I keratin K14, was slightly downregulated (data not shown). However, the expression of K5 was strong in the basal cells and squamous metaplasias of TG mice that also expressed high levels of K14 providing the preferred and conceivably stabilizing partner (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Our results are in accordance with previous studies in which simple epithelial cells transfected with either an ectopic type I (K14) or type II (K6) epidermal keratin. The foreign proteins were merely incorporated into the existing endogenous keratin network without induction of partner or host keratins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).</p><p>The strongest functional evidence that constitutive expression of <italic>hK14</italic> in the lung may have an impact on squamous pathway of differentiation came from the induction of involucrin, loricrin and other markers of CCE in the CC10-hK14 TG mice. In the epidermis, the plasma membrane of terminally differentiated, dead keratinocytes is replaced by insoluble cross-linked proteins and lipids called the CCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), whereas in the human lung cancer cells CCE formation can be induced <italic>in vitro</italic> by calcium ions serving as evidence for squamous differentiation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>The molecular changes in CC10-hK14 TG mice were accompanied by histological changes that were distributed from trachea to peripheral airways. This is consistent with the fact that unlike in humans, where Clara cells are restricted to the peripheral lung, mice have abundant CC10-containing cells also in trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). One of the alterations was multifocal Clara cell hyperplasia, suggesting that <italic>hK14</italic> elicited a proliferative response. Other abnormalities were basal cell hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia/dyplasia, which are common early lesions in human squamous cell carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) but rare in WT mouse lungs. The origin of basal cells in the murine lung is uncertain. Like Clara cells, they mature late during embryogenesis. Studies on injury and vitamin A deficiency have suggested that secretory or Clara cells are pivotal for the regeneration of basal cells of tracheobronchial epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). We speculate that the expression of <italic>hK14</italic> under the mCC10 promoter might have targeted a common embryonal precursor cell, which then gave rise both to presecretory (pre-Clara cells) and prebasal cells by the end of the pseudoglandular period in the embryonic lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). In addition to Clara cells, <italic>hK14</italic> transgene may have triggered a proliferative response also in basal cells.</p><p>Despite the proliferative phenotype in the airways of TG mice, the expression of <italic>hK14</italic> had limited impact on tumorigenesis, which requires the accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic changes probably to occur with the increasing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). While the number of animals was too small to reach a definite conclusion, 67% of the CC10-hK14 mice had lung tumors at 21 months of age in comparison with 46% of WT mice. The tumor incidence cited in the literature for old (24 months) FVB mice is even lower (38%). Taken together, this data may warrant further examination of the role of <italic>hK14</italic> in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Histologically, the tumors ranged from adenomas to poorly differentiated carcinomas that might have been expected as the expression of K14 in the TG lungs was not associated with overt keratinization. On the other hand, the impact of <italic>hK14</italic> manifested in the simultaneous expression of diverse markers such as the alveolar type II cell marker proSP-C, airway secretory (Clara) cell marker CC10, epidermal K14 and CCE proteins, suggesting multidirectional differentiation.</p><p>There are few previously reported mouse models of lung SQCAs. In one study, eight different inbred mouse strains were exposed to <italic>N</italic>-nitroso-tris-chloroethylurea by skin painting and five developed both SQCAs and characteristic precursor lesions that were positive for the epidermal keratins K5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Wang <italic>et al.</italic> also conducted linkage analyses and found specific loci that were associated with susceptibility to SQCA. There were marked differences between the strains in the ability to develop SQCAs. Interestingly, as with the tendency to form pulmonary adenomas, FVB mice were in the middle of the spectrum and developed low multiplicity of tumors that correlated with less frequent precursor lesions as well. It would be interesting to see if the constitutive expression of <italic>hK14</italic> in a more susceptible strain would result in more pronounced squamous metaplasias than the ones observed in the present study utilizing FVB mice. In another study, a somatically activatable mutant Kras-driven model of mouse lung cancer was used to evaluate the role of LKB1 and other tumor suppressors in lung carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Inactivation of LKB1 resulted in aggressive and highly metastatic tumors, 60% of which revealed squamous or mixed squamous histology although there was no evidence of squamous precursor lesions in the airways. In contrast, our results suggest that the constitutive expression of <italic>hK14</italic> is only weakly oncogenic.</p><p>In conclusion, constitutive expression of <italic>hK14</italic> in the lung resulted in increased expression of K14 and squamous differentiation program. The mice demonstrated multifocal alterations in the airways ranging from hyperplasias to squamous metaplasia that were reminiscent of precursor lesions of human pulmonary SQCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgn190/DC1">Supplementary Figures 1s</ext-link>&#x02013;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgn190/DC1">4s</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgn190/DC1">Table Is</ext-link> can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/">http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This research was funded by the Intramural Research Program of the <grant-sponsor>National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="bgn190_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bgn190_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>CCE</term><def><p>cornified cell envelope</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CC10</term><def><p>Clara cell specific 10 kDa protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hK14</term><def><p>human keratin 14</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IHC</term><def><p>immunohistochemistry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mCC10</term><def><p>mouse Clara cell 10 kDa protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mRNA</term><def><p>messenger RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p>polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Q-RT&#x02013;PCR</term><def><p>quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SQCA</term><def><p>squamous cell carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TG</term><def><p>transgenic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WT</term><def><p>wild-type</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We thank Dr Francisco DeMayo for CC10 antibody and promoter, Dr Shyh-Ing for the gift of <italic>K5</italic> and <italic>K14</italic> clones, Dr Kunio Nagashima for ultrastructural analysis, Dr Miriam Anver for her professional expertise in mouse necropsies, Dr Lala Wakefield for insightful discussions on lung tumorigenesis in old mice and Dr Sandra Jensen-Taubman and Xu Naizhen for technical help.</p><p><italic>Conflict of Interest Statement:</italic> None declared.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Keratin expression in human tissues and neoplasms</article-title><source>Histopathology</source><year>2002</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>403</fpage><lpage>439</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12010363</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tsubokawa</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Heterogeneity of expression of cytokeratin subtypes in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung: with special reference to CK14 overexpression in cancer of high-proliferative and lymphogenous metastatic potential</article-title><source>Pathol.
