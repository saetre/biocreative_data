DCs and T cells are the major cellular components of afferent lymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), but very few DCs enter efferent lymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Inflammatory stimuli increase the rate of afferent lymphatic DC output by approximately an order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). However, inflammatory stimuli are not required for DC and T cell entry into afferent lymphatics, because the recovery of these cells from lymph in the steady state is still substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Indeed, the projected afferent lymphatic DC output is high enough to fully supply all lymph node DCs, even considering a short DC lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Thus, from these early observations, it seemed quite plausible that lymph was the major source of lymph node DCs in general. Reinforcing this possibility were other early studies revealing that DCs purified from the spleen can, upon adoptive transfer, immigrate to lymph nodes through lymphatic vessels but not through the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Furthermore, revelations that the steady-state turnover of pulmonary DCs is very rapid fit well with the interpretation that this fast turnover was linked to a high rate of DC entry into afferent lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Functionally, DCs that migrate through afferent lymph to lymph nodes in the steady state transport parenchymal antigens from various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), and such transport may facilitate the initiation of peripheral immune tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), possibly working in concert with other mechanisms that give rise to tolerance within lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>More recently, our understanding of DC homeostasis in lymph nodes has evolved to include not only lymph-migrating DCs but also a role for DCs that enter from blood vessels, the specialized high endothelial venules, to maintain specific DC subsets, notably plasmacytoid DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and mouse CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Accordingly, a recent review of DC biology suggested that half of the DCs within lymph nodes enter from the bloodstream, including the full complement of these specialized subsets, but the other half of DCs were still believed to arise from lymph-migrating tissue DCs (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). This conclusion was based in part on the notion that it is possible to readily identify which DCs traveled to lymph nodes through afferent lymph based on combinations of various markers, such as higher expression of MHC II in the steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). However, the relationship between DCs bearing such markers and their presumed precursors derived from upstream tissue has not been established.</p><p>Our past studies on the role of monocytes as a potential source of lymph-trafficking DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) fueled our interest in the relationship between nonlymphoid organ DCs and lymph node DCs. Several recent studies have concluded that spleen DCs do not arise from monocytes using adoptive transfer approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). In addition, a study in parabiotic mice suggested that monocytes are also not precursors for lymph node DCs, because blood monocytes and lymph node DCs exchanged between parabionts to differing extents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Strikingly, one of these studies indicated that, in strong contrast to spleen DCs, monocytes are precursors of peripheral nonlymphoid organ DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), implying for the first time that DCs in lymphoid organs may have a distinct origin from DCs in nonlymphoid organs. However, little lineage analysis has been conducted in lymph nodes, which in contrast to the spleen, are positioned to serve as a nexus wherein lymphoid organ&#x02013;resident DCs and nonlymphoid organ DCs would converge, presumably in equal proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), to interact with lymphocytes and drive immune responses.</p><p>Indications that nonlymphoid organ DCs may arise from monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), in contrast to other DCs, suggested to us an approach to analyze the proportion of lymph node DCs that might arise from DCs originating in upstream tissues. In this study, we used a popular reporter mouse line that uses the lysozyme promoter, active in many monocytes, to drive <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) that subsequently removes a stop cassette upstream of enhanced GFP (EGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Studies in this model fit well with the evidence that nonlymphoid organ and spleen DCs may be unrelated in origin and, most importantly, reveal that, against expectations and prevailing models in the field, only a minority of lymph node DCs in the steady state arises from DCs residing in upstream nonlymphoid organs. Instead, DCs that migrate through lymphatics from upstream tissues contribute substantially to the pool of lymph node DCs, mainly during inflammatory states.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Illustration of the utility of lysozyme M (LysM)&#x02013;Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice to assess DC relationships with monocytes or other DC populations</title><p>LysM is expressed by neutrophils and macrophages. Accordingly, LysM-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) have been widely used to generate cell type&#x02013;selective deletions of floxed genes or expression of floxed reporter markers, especially Rosa26 promoter-driven reporter genes. In these mice, <italic>Cre</italic> activity removes a stop cassette upstream of the floxed reporter in neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Neutrophils are not considered candidates for DC precursors, but monocytes may be precursors for at least some DC populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). If only some DCs are derived from monocytes, and if the lysozyme promoter has low activity in other DC precursors, then the LysM-Cre reporter mice would be a useful tool to trace relationships between monocytes and DCs and possibly between different DC populations in vivo.</p><p>When we analyzed blood monocytes in LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice in the steady state, the two subsets of circulating CD115<sup>hi</sup> blood monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) differed in the percentage that was EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (sometimes called Gr-1<sup>hi</sup> monocytes) were on average 55% EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, whereas the Ly-6C<sup>lo</sup> monocyte subset (sometimes called Gr-1<sup>lo</sup> monocytes) averaged 75% EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Since their discovery in mice, these two subsets have not been further subdivided, and accordingly, we found no obvious differences in cell-surface markers between EGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocyte subpopulations. Furthermore, transfer of EGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> monocytes into congenic recipient mice revealed that, 1 d later, many of the transferred EGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> monocytes had become EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (unpublished data), indicating that EGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> monocytes do not maintain a distinct population from EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes. Instead, the failure of EGFP to be uniformly expressed by a given monocyte subset in blood is more likely caused by the stochastic failure of strong lysozyme promoter usage or Cre-mediated excision of the stop cassette in the reporter construct.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>EGFP reporter expression in LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice by blood monocytes and spleen macrophages or DCs.</bold> (A) EGFP frequency in blood populations was analyzed. CD115 and Gr-1/Ly-6C stainings identified blood monocyte subsets in wild-type C57BL/6 mice, Rosa26-EGFP knock-in mice, or LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice. The percentage of each subset that expressed EGFP was analyzed. High side scatter (SSC) and lower levels of CD115 expression were used to discern neutrophils. Low SSC CD115<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, which are mostly lymphocytes, were evaluated to measure the extent of promiscuous usage of the lysozyme promoter (reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). (right) Plot shows the percentage of EGFP of various blood populations in all mice enrolled in this study (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 60). (B) The percentage of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in CD115<sup>hi</sup> bone marrow cells in LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice was analyzed and plotted. A panel of lineage markers was first used to narrow down bone marrow cells that might be monocytes or MDPs. Bone marrow monocytes were CD115<sup>hi</sup> cells that coexpressed the lineage markers Gr-1 and/or CD11b (lineage stain 2), whereas MDPs were lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD115<sup>hi</sup> cells (reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Data represent the mean &#x000b1; SEM. (C) Stainings for CD11c, CD11b, CD8&#x003b1;, and B220 defined conventional DC subsets and other populations in steady-state spleens of LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice or Rosa26-GFP knock-in mice. Conventional DCs correspond to populations 1 (CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs), 3 (CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs), and 4 (plasmacytoid DCs). Macrophages comprise gates 6 and 7, and gate 5 includes monocytes (reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). The percentage of EGFP in these and other designated populations was normalized to the percentage of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the same mouse. In the graphs, all mice studied are compiled, and each data point corresponds to one mouse. Two to three mice per group were handled per experiment. Horizontal bars on scatter plots represent means. In B, two experiments were performed with three mice in each.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052839f01"></graphic></fig><p>In blood, CD115<sup>lo</sup> cells are granulocytes, mostly high-scatter neutrophils, and 93% of these cells were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> on average, consistent with the expectation that the lysozyme promoter is most strongly transcribed in these cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Because of a low level of utilization of the lysozyme promoter by hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), populations other than neutrophils and monocyte-derived cells, such as lymphocytes, were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at a low frequency, but this frequency (6% EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> on average; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) was substantially less than that of neutrophils or monocytes. As expected, control WT naive mice had no EGFP expression, whereas mice that have EGFP knocked into the Rosa26 locus for constitutive expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>) showed that &#x0003e;98% of monocytes were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, thus indicating that the Rosa26 promoter is constitutively active in these cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><p>In the bone marrow, monocytes are mainly Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), and these monocytes were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at a frequency similar to their blood counterparts, averaging 50% EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In contrast, the recently described macrophage DC progenitors (MDPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), identified as CD115<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to a lower frequency (14% on average; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><p>Although not all monocytes were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, we reasoned that populations of DC subsets derived from monocytes should express EGFP at a percentage at least equal to the percentage of monocytes that scored positive. If the lysozyme promoter remained or became active during the differentiation of DCs after the monocyte stage, the percentage of DCs positive for EGFP might exceed that of monocytes. However, DCs positive for EGFP at a percentage sufficiently high to meet the criterion for potentially being derived from monocytes would not prove that they originated from monocytes. Nonetheless, as long as the Rosa26 promoter upstream of the EGFP reporter remained active, DC populations expressing a much lower fraction of EGFP than blood monocytes certainly could not be derived primarily from monocytes, and most importantly, EGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC populations could not be descendents of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs or monocytes.</p><p>Thus, we next analyzed DC subsets in the spleens of LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice to determine if their propensity to express EGFP may differ from that of monocytes, as might be expected from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). When total CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were considered, EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> frequency more closely matched that of MDPs than monocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). To assess spleen DCs more carefully, we analyzed various DC subsets by further flow cytometric staining and gating. Conventional DCs in the spleen are CD11c<sup>hi</sup> cells that differentially express CD8&#x003b1; and CD11b, and based on these gates, we separately evaluated EGFP expression in these subsets, labeled as populations 1&#x02013;3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). CD11c<sup>int</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup>B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were plasmacytoid DCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, population 4). Other CD11c<sup>int</sup> or CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup> populations that expressed high CD11b were likely splenic monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), and these could be divided in three populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, labeled populations 5&#x02013;7). In our analyses, we used monocytes as a reference population to normalize the data and draw a direct comparison to monocytes. In every mouse analyzed, we calculated the percentage of EGFP expressed in a given spleen DC or macrophage population and divided this value by the percentage of Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes that were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the same mouse, because DCs might arise from Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in some tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). If the percentage of a given DC subset that was EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was similar to Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, then the product of this division would produce a value of 1. Ratios substantially &#x0003c;1 would indicate populations that could not have received a majority of precursor input from monocytes or any other EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population. In the spleen, all DC subsets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, gated populations 1&#x02013;4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>) exhibited a low level of EGFP expression and, fitting with previous conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), did not meet the criterion for a potentially close relationship with monocytes. Failure to meet this criterion was not caused by inactivity at the Rosa26 promoter, because CD11c<sup>hi</sup> and CD11c<sup>int</sup> cells were uniformly EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in control Rosa26-EGFP knock-in mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In contrast to DCs, monocytes and macrophages in the spleen (gated populations 5&#x02013;7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>) met or exceeded the minimal criterion for possible derivation from monocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), serving as a positive control for the approach taken.</p></sec><sec><title>Reporter expression by nonlymphoid organ DCs is distinct from spleen DCs in the steady state</title><p>Next, we examined peripheral organ DCs in skin, lung, and small intestine in the steady state. Skin DCs were separated into epidermal DCs (Langerhans cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) and dermal DCs that, as a whole, are CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and MHC II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, Dermal 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). These tissue DC populations showed a much higher frequency of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells than that observed for spleen DCs, and overall, the frequency of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> skin DCs resembled the frequency seen in Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> blood monocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). As noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), CD11b<sup>hi</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells in the dermis could be separated into MHC II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and MHC II<sup>&#x02212;</sup> populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, Dermal 2 and 3, respectively). These cells likely include macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), with considerable heterogeneity in CD11b<sup>hi</sup> MHC II<sup>lo</sup> cells. Overall, these populations also showed a frequency of EGFP expression that resembled Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>EGFP reporter expression in LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice by DCs and macrophages from skin, lung, and small intestine.</bold> (A) Single-cell suspensions were prepared from the epidermis and dermis.

However, this population was also CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), resembling a subset of CD11c<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>lo</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in nearby Peyer's patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>) and CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymph node DCs in general. Indeed, this population may not be part of the LP proper but instead may be a contaminant from Peyer's patches, as we noticed that the population became progressively reduced in frequency (down to 4% of recovered DCs) as our skills in the dissection of the Peyer's patches away from the LP improved. Another population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, gate 2/LP2) expressed intermediate levels of EGFP that did not reach the frequency of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells observed in monocytes but that maintained a frequency higher than spleen DCs. These cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, gate 2/LP2) are likely the DCs that populate the villi of the intestine and upper LP layers, because in some mice, we recovered DCs from villous tips that were removed while stripping the intestinal epithelium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, Villi DC), and the LP DCs recovered from these villi appeared identical in phenotype (not depicted) and EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> frequency to LP2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><p>Considering data from all of these organs together, we conclude that most nonlymphoid organ DCs or their precursors use the lysozyme promoter in the steady state. This feature distinguishes them from spleen DCs and is consistent with, but does not prove, that the origins of nonlymphoid organ DCs may be distinct from spleen DCs, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Nonlymphoid organ&#x02013;derived DCs are scarce in lymph nodes</title><p>Because it is thought that lymph nodes receive substantial seeding by DCs that emigrate from upstream nonlymphoid organs through the afferent lymphatics (see Introduction), we expected to find that lymph node DCs, and discrete subpopulations of DCs in particular, would express a higher frequency of EGFP than observed in spleen DCs. However, the frequency of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells within lymph node DC subpopulations was much like that of spleen DCs, with the exception of skin-draining lymph nodes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;C</xref>). This could not be attributed to loss of reporter expression through failure to use the Rosa26 promoter, because all lymph node cells and all CD11c<sup>int</sup> and CD11c<sup>hi</sup> cells that would be candidate DCs were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in Rosa26-EGFP knock-in mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>EGFP reporter expression in LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice by DCs within lymph nodes that drain intestine, lung, or skin.</bold> Stainings for CD11c, CD11b, B220, and CD8&#x003b1; were used to delineate various DC subsets within lymph nodes.

The lack of EGFP expression in most lymph node DCs was not likely caused by dilution of EGFP during the proliferation of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs that migrated in from the upstream organs, because if the proliferation of DCs accounted for loss of EGFP, we would expect to find DCs with a range of reduced EGFP intensities in the draining lymph node representing DCs that had divided different numbers of times since leaving the upstream organ; instead, EGFP intensity was not different between nonlymphoid organ EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs and draining lymph node EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, even in the lung, where it has been shown that DC turnover is especially rapid (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081430/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081430/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>Like the other lymph nodes, most skin-draining lymph node DCs were EGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, but certain populations of DCs within skin-draining lymph nodes, especially those that were langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Expression of langerin, found on all epidermal DCs and a small fraction of dermal DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), is considered a long-lasting marker of DCs that survey the skin and enter skin-draining lymph nodes through lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>).

Collectively, skin-draining lymph nodes contrasted with other lymph nodes examined, as they showed evidence of containing tissue-derived DCs, with up to 20% of the total lymph node DCs (&#x0223c;10% langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells plus half of the DCs in gate 2 equals &#x0223c;20%; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>) possibly arriving from skin lymphatics.</p><p>DCs highly enriched in MHC II were observed in skin- and lung-draining lymph nodes, present on average in 17 and 9% of total CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, respectively.

Because migrating DCs have sometimes been defined by being MHC II<sup>hi</sup> to a level elevated over other DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), we assessed the frequency of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells within gated MHC II<sup>hi</sup> lymph node DCs. The frequency of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MHC II<sup>hi</sup> DCs was, like langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, elevated in this gate relative to lymph node DCs overall. However, the percentage of MHC II<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells that were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>) fell short of that observed in monocytes and in upstream tissue DCs (compare <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref> with <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), suggesting that many but not all of the MHC II<sup>hi</sup> DCs might arise from defined, upstream tissue DC populations. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), the MHC II<sup>hi</sup> DC gate was partially redundant with the langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gated DCs, because in our analysis 31 &#x000b1; 2% of MHC II<sup>hi</sup> DCs were also langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). There was no difference in the EGFP frequency in either langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or langerin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MHC II<sup>hi</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>), suggesting that some of the MHC II<sup>hi</sup> DCs may be migratory dermal DCs that are langerin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and that overall EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MHC II<sup>hi</sup> DCs were equivalent to the sum of langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in gates 1 and 4 and DCs in gate 2, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>.</p><p>Given that EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs could not give rise to EGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs, the failure to observe substantial EGFP expression in the vast majority of lymph node DC populations suggests that upstream organ DCs do not substantially populate lymph nodes in the steady state and certainly cannot account for as many as half of lymph node DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).

To consider this possibility and to be certain that migratory DCs could be detected as EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in lymph nodes if they were present, we experimentally induced large-scale DC migration by applying a fluorescent contact sensitizer to the skin, thereby using one of the most established DC migration assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>).

As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), the migrating population observed in lymph nodes 1 d after sensitization were mainly langerin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (not depicted), which are thought to arise from dermal langerin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), such as the CD11b<sup>hi</sup> populations observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>. In the draining lymph node, TRITC<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs represented &#x0003e;30% of all lymph node DCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and fell within gates 2 and 4, as shown for skin-draining lymph nodes in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref> (compare <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref> with <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, middle).

Overall, CD11c<sup>hi</sup> TRITC<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the lymph node phenotypically resembled and showed a similar EGFP frequency as the Dermal 1 population in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, and CD11c<sup>int</sup> TRITC<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells most closely matched the Dermal 3 population in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

As mentioned earlier, CD103 expression marks approximately half of the pulmonary DCs, and its expression persists after the DC migrates to the downstream, lung-draining lymph node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). We therefore monitored expression of CD103 by CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs in the lung-draining lymph node to determine the frequency of this migrated population therein. CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs fell within the gate of CD11c<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>lo</sup> DCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). These CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in the lymph node reflected a frequency of EGFP expression expected from analysis of upstream tissue CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>lo</sup> DCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>) but comprised a very small component within the gate (&#x0003c;10% gated, and 4% of lymph node DCs overall) when noninflamed lymph nodes from mice treated with PBS were examined (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). However, when we treated mice intranasally with LPS to greatly enhance DC migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) and examined the lymph node 24 h later, CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs were the dominant population in the same gate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, top left dot plots), and quantification of their absolute (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) and relative (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>) frequency confirmed that CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs were now the majority (60%) of the gated CD11c<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>lo</sup> DCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>) and represented 25% of the lymph node DCs overall. LPS treatment led to an increase in the absolute number of all DC populations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>), but migratory populations such as the CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs were disproportionally increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>; and not depicted). CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to a similar normalized frequency as their upstream tissue counterparts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). LPS increased the proportion of all lymph node DC subsets that expressed EGFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>), but because it also increased the frequency of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes and tissue DCs, it scarcely altered the normalized data. Taking these observations together, we conclude that inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS or mediators like TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1 induced during contact sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>), are generally necessary to provoke substantial accumulation of upstream tissue-derived DCs within lymph nodes that enter by way of the afferent lymphatic vessels, and that, in contrast and against our expectations, in the steady state the lymph node contains few nonlymphoid organ&#x02013;derived DCs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Historically, several observations led to the development of the view that lymph node DCs arose substantially from lymph-borne DCs that originated in upstream tissues. First, DCs in cannulated afferent lymph are relatively abundant and are clearly involved in transporting antigen. In contrast, committed DC precursors are sparse in the circulation of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Furthermore, when afferent lymphatics are severed, the lymph node becomes nearly void of DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>) and antigen presentation is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Recently, the idea that specialized DC subsets&#x02014;plasmacytoid and CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs&#x02014;enter the lymph node from the bloodstream has been introduced, but this understanding has not modified the belief that many lymph node DCs arise from interstitial nonlymphoid organ DCs that mobilize through lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and may even mature in the steady state as they migrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In this study, we present surprising evidence that most steady-state DCs in lymph nodes that drain a variety of organs by and large do not originate from upstream tissue DCs. Instead, we find that it is only during inflammation that tissue-derived DCs comprise a major fraction of lymph node DCs.</p><p>The model system used herein used LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice that &#x0201c;report&#x0201d; expression of LysM in neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages by irreversibly inducing EGFP expression. A much lower frequency of expression is observed in T and B cells, stemming from promiscuous activation of the LysM promoter in some hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Although macrophages continue to express lysozyme as they mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), this gene is not considered to be a marker for DCs and may be turned off developmentally upon induction of DC differentiation. The current study's comparison between tissue DC populations and those in the lymph node was possible because many tissue DCs, but not most lymph node or spleen DCs, expressed EGFP downstream of lysozyme promoter usage. The discrepancy in the frequency of the EGFP reporter between splenic and nonlymphoid organ DCs is consistent with the possibility that nonlymphoid organ DCs may derive from monocytes or some other lysozyme-positive precursor, but that most lymph node or spleen DCs do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Both lymph node and spleen DCs more closely expressed the frequency of EGFP observed in bone marrow DC precursors called MDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), which do not inevitably differentiate into monocytes and may shut off EGFP as they differentiate into alternative end-stage cells, including DCs. Although complementing former adoptive transfer studies, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) our approach has the advantage of permitting examination of mice with no previous experimental manipulation, thus truly maintaining the steady state. In addition, we examined whole populations, rather than a small proportion of transferred cells that require extrapolation, to make conclusions about what might have occurred in most members of a given population. Though our data are consistent with the possibility that nonlymphoid organ DCs may arise from monocytes, and indeed we used Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes as a reference population throughout this study, our approach cannot prove an origin from monocytes for any population. However, because EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells cannot be precursors for EGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells in these mice, the strength of the model lies in its power to reveal which relationships between populations cannot be true.</p><p>Based on the fact that nonlymphoid organ DCs are frequently EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice and lymph nodes DCs are not, we conclude that nonlymphoid organ DCs cannot account for the origin of most steady-state lymph node DCs, with the exception of discrete populations of skin DCs, such as langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, in skin-draining lymph nodes. Because lung and airway DCs are well characterized and possess durable markers such as CD103 that independently enable tracking in the steady state, this conclusion is particularly clear and striking when lung-draining lymph nodes are examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). In the small intestine, little information is available as to which LP population best migrates into lymphatics. We found one population of LP DCs with a very low frequency of EGFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, LP1), such that if they migrated substantially to lymph nodes in the steady state they would go undetected by our method. However, the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype of these cells is more consistent with the possibility that they are contaminants from Peyer's patches rather than part of the LP proper. The major CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>MHC II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell we identified in the LP expressed a high frequency of EGFP, but little is known about how efficiently these cells migrate into lymphatics. DCs at the epithelial interface migrate to lymph nodes after capturing luminal intestinal antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). The CD11b<sup>hi</sup> population that was recovered in both the terminal villi and LP preparations is likely to correspond to this DC, given that it copurified to some extent with the epithelium. These DCs had an overall lower frequency of EGFP expression than blood monocytes, suggesting against previous conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) that they are not completely derived from monocytes. However, a low level of contamination from Peyer's patch DCs might also, as an artifact, reduce the frequency of EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in this population. In any case, though lower in EGFP frequency than monocytes, these villi/LP CD11b<sup>hi</sup> DCs were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to a greater extent than any DC subset in the mesenteric lymph node, supporting the conclusion that these DCs did not comprise a major fraction of DCs in the mesenteric lymph node but are present only to a minor degree.</p><p>A caveat to our approach might be that the EGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs within a tissue preferentially have the capacity to migrate to lymph nodes. However, this is quite unlikely for several reasons. First, in all cases in which we can identify small populations of tissue-derived DCs, by gating on langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in skin-draining lymph nodes or CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11b<sup>lo</sup> DCs in lung-draining lymph nodes, we see a close reflection of the EGFP frequency observed in the corresponding upstream tissue DC population. Second, during inflammation, upstream tissue-derived DCs are quite abundant in lymph nodes, and there is no bias toward EGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs. Thus, in all cases in which we analyze DCs confirmed to migrate from upstream organs to lymph nodes, we observe the expected frequency of EGFP. Finally, momentarily disregarding an approach based on analysis of EGFP frequency in LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice, an examination of total numbers of CD11b<sup>lo</sup>CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in steady-state versus inflamed lung-draining lymph nodes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, bottom graphs) leads to a similar conclusion as that drawn from data that depend on the premises made in studies of LysM-Cre &#x000d7; Rosa26-stop<sup>flox</sup>EGFP mice.</p><p>Although we conclude that the presence of nonlymphoid organ DCs is more minimal than expected in lymph nodes, this finding does not necessarily dispel the possibility that there is a relatively high frequency of DCs trafficking through lymph constitutively. For example, the lifespan of lymph-migrating DCs, especially in the steady state, may be quite brief within downstream lymph nodes. All of the available evidence indeed suggests that DC turnover in general is very rapid in lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Skin-resident dermal and epidermal DCs may in particular survive and persist in lymph nodes longer than other DC populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). Our finding that these skin DC populations were the most enriched nonlymphoid organ&#x02013;derived DCs in all lymph node examined corresponds with the idea that lifespan may be the major regulator of the presence of migratory tissue DCs within the lymph node.</p><p>Even as ephemeral constituents within lymph nodes, migratory DCs could still play a major role in immunity in the steady state. However, their failure to accumulate in lymph nodes for substantial durations fits best with a role in which they supply antigen, already processed or not, to other DCs within lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Transfer of antigen from migratory DCs to other DCs may be at least as substantial, or more so, in the steady state as it has been proposed to be during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). The appearance of parietal antigens in CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), a population of so-called lymph node&#x02013;resident DCs that our data uphold do not derive from upstream tissue DCs, suggests that even large fragments of tissue antigens are not restricted within the lymph node to migratory DCs but are instead readily shared with other DCs. Alternatively, migratory DCs may often possess a phenotype distinct from that expected. CD11c<sup>int</sup>CD11b<sup>hi</sup> lymph node cells are not considered by most to be classical DCs, and they share this phenotype with Ly-6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>), making it tempting to consider all such cells as putative monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Cells with this phenotype were abundant in steady-state lymph nodes, were EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> like upstream tissue counterparts, and may reflect an important DC type with the capacity to directly present antigen or transfer it to other DCs. Particle-bearing, phagocytic monocyte-derived DCs that emigrate from skin to lymph nodes also express low levels of CD11c and very high levels of CD11b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Yet, little consideration has been given to the possibility that these cells have an important role in steady-state lymph nodes or, ultimately, in antigen presentation, in part because of the evidence that CD11c<sup>hi</sup> cells are required for immune priming, even when CD11c<sup>int</sup> cells are not deleted in CD11c-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>).</p><p>Because we cannot link lymph node DCs substantially to upstream tissue DCs, more credence may be given to the possibility that lymph node DCs mainly enter lymph nodes during the steady state through high endothelial venules. This notion still requires direct experimental support. Another interesting possibility to be investigated in future work is that the upstream tissue feeds the lymph node with DCs that enter through lymphatics, but that these cells circulate in lymph in an unexpected form, other than as descendents of tissue-resident DCs. The recent evidence that hematopoietic progenitor cells are found in lymph raises the possibility that they might seed the lymph node, although these progenitors were not retained in lymph nodes themselves and were argued to play a more important role in generating tissue DCs during inflammation rather than lymph node DCs in the steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). As our findings challenge long-held views about the role of steady-state trafficking DCs in comprising lymph node populations of DCs, the present work highlights the need to investigate in more detail how lymph nodes are populated by DCs in the steady state, and the relationship between lymph-migrating and nonmigratory DCs in presenting antigen under homeostatic conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>LysM-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) were crossed to a reporter strain in which the Rosa26 promoter is upstream of a floxed stop cassette and the EGFP gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).
