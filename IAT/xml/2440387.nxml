Not surprisingly, members of this pathway are highly conserved even between vertebrates and invertebrates. There is one notable exception, Hairless, which acts as a general Notch antagonist in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Hairless silences Notch target genes by assembling a repressor complex together with Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] and the co-repressors Groucho (Gro) and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). Now with the availability of genomic databases, presumptive Hairless homologues are predicted, however only in insect species. To further our understanding of Hairless structure and function, we have cloned the <italic>Hairless </italic>gene from <italic>Apis mellifera </italic>(<italic>A.m.H</italic>) and characterized its functional conservation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <italic>Apis </italic>Hairless protein is only one third of the size of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>orthologue. Interestingly, the defined Suppressor of Hairless binding domain is interrupted by a nonconserved spacer sequence and the N-terminal motif is sufficient for binding. In contrast to <italic>Apis </italic>Hairless, the <italic>Drosophila </italic>orthologue contains a large acidic domain and we provide experimental evidence that this acidic domain is necessary to silence Hairless activity in vivo. Despite the dramatic size differences, <italic>Apis </italic>Hairless binds to the <italic>Drosophila </italic>Hairless interactors Su(H), Gro, CtBP and Pros26.4. Hence, <italic>Apis </italic>Hairless assembles a repressor complex with <italic>Drosophila </italic>components that may have a different topology. Nevertheless, <italic>Apis </italic>Hairless is sufficient to repress the Notch target gene <italic>vestigial </italic>in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Moreover, it is able to rescue <italic>Hairless </italic>mutant phenotypes, providing in vivo evidence for its function as a bona fide Notch antagonist.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first interspecies-complementation analysis of the Hairless gene.

The communication is established by signaling pathways that allow information to be sent from one cell to a neighboring cell. This information enables the receiving cell to adopt a different cell fate. One of the best studied signaling pathways that coordinate developmental decisions is the Notch pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It was first described in the process of lateral inhibition in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: within a cluster of equipotential cells destined to adopt the same cell fate, one cell gains the ability to inhibit adjacent cells to engage differentiation by means of activating Notch. Notch signaling also plays important roles in asymmetric cell divisions that result in differential cell fate decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, local Notch activity can induce the formation of developmental boundaries as seen during wing margin formation in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>It is not surprising that this fundamental pathway is highly conserved in eumetazoans and is crucial at many different developmental stages in a variety of different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The pathway is initiated by the binding of the ligands, Delta or Serrate (Delta-like and Jagged in mammals), presented on one cell to the Notch receptor on the adjacent cells. As a consequence, the intracellular Notch domain is cleaved and migrates into the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional activator complex by binding, together with co-activators, e.g. Mastermind (Mam), to the transcriptional regulator CSL (<bold>C</bold>SF or RBP-J<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>in mammals, <bold>S</bold>uppressor of Hairless (Su(H) in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <bold>L</bold>ag-2 in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. CSL belongs to the family of rel DNA binding molecules and allows for context specific transcriptional activation of target genes of the Notch signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Hairless (H) acts as a general antagonist of this pathway. H binds to Su(H) and, by recruiting the co-repressors Groucho (Gro) and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), converts Su(H) into a repressor of the Notch target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In this complex H acts as molecular linker between Su(H) and the co-repressors. Since H retains repressor activity even in the absence of co-repressor binding, it is thought that it impedes formation of the Notch-Su(H)-Mam activator-complex on its own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Given the high conservation of Notch signaling components, e.g. the human and fly CSL orthologues share approximately 80% identity over large parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], one might expect a H homologue to likewise antagonize Notch signaling in mammals. However all attempts from many groups including ours failed so far to identify a vertebrates <italic>H </italic>gene. With the rational that sequences mostly relevant for H function should be conserved over larger evolutionary distance, we started to search for <italic>H </italic>genes in further remote species. Our molecular analysis of the <italic>H </italic>orthologue from the distantly related <italic>Drosophila hydei </italic>species revealed that <italic>H </italic>is indeed a relatively fast evolving gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Hence, H functional domains may have evolved beyond recognition over time or may be present in different molecules in mammalian species. With more and more genome sequences available, we could identify <italic>H</italic>-like genes in several insect species. From the available genomic sequence projects, we characterized <italic>H </italic>orthologues and found that the <italic>A. mellifera Hairless </italic>gene (<italic>A.m.H</italic>) is a good candidate to investigate H structure and function in more detail. The phylogenetic distance from <italic>Drosophila </italic>to <italic>Apis </italic>is estimated at 250&#x02013;300 million years and is considerably greater than to <italic>Anopheles </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In contrast to the <italic>Anopheles H </italic>gene, which is larger than the <italic>Drosophila </italic>orthologue <italic>D.m.H</italic>, the <italic>Apis H </italic>gene is much smaller. Moreover, the honeybee brain sequencing project confirmed that <italic>A.m.H </italic>is expressed in honeybee. We cloned the gene from an <italic>Apis mellifera </italic>cDNA library and tested <italic>A.m.H </italic>gene function in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Notably, the orthologous proteins are only 54% identical, and A.m.H is only about 36% of the size of D.m.H. Despite the small size, A.m.H contains the characteristic interaction domains and is able to bind to the <italic>Drosophila </italic>proteins Su(H), Gro, CtBP and Pros26.4 as does D.m.H. Most surprisingly, A.m.H retains functional activity in the fly, where it can rescue <italic>H </italic>loss of function mutant phenotypes. Moreover, when overexpressed, <italic>A.m.H </italic>induces typical H gain of function phenotypes indicative of antagonizing Notch signaling in a variety of tissues and developmental processes. Considering the vast size difference, a repressor complex assembled by A.m.H might have a different topology than that of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Nevertheless, A.m.H is sufficient to repress the Notch target gene <italic>vestigial </italic>during wing development of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In contrast to A.m.H, the <italic>Drosophila </italic>H protein contains a large acidic domain and we provide experimental evidence that this acidic domain silences H activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, our work shows that the Su(H) binding domain previously defined in D.m.H can be separated into two distinct domains, and that the N-terminal domain is sufficient for Su(H) binding. In summary, our work provides evidence for the in vivo function of <italic>Apis Hairless </italic>as a bona fide antagonist of Notch signaling. This evolutionary comparison may help us to eventually identify all the relevant structural domains and cofactors of Hairless, thereby furthering our understanding of the repressor-complexes that down-regulate Notch signaling.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Conservation of H structural domains in various insects</bold>.

There is ample genetic evidence showing that <italic>H </italic>is involved in manifold developmental processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. So far it remains open, whether this reflects solely its central role in Notch signaling or whether H is involved in other pathways as well. H is a novel protein that is quite large and may contain more than the already established functional domains. A comparison with the orthologues from <italic>D. hydei </italic>(D.h.H) and <italic>A. gambiae </italic>(A.g.H) identified several conserved domains of presumed functional significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Experimental analysis of <italic>D. hydei </italic>showed that the D.h.H protein with 1158 residues is somewhat larger than the D.m.H orthologue that spans 1077 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The A.g.H is even larger and comprises approximately 1300 residues based on an in silico prediction (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Meanwhile several additional genome sequences have been published. The available databases show that <italic>H </italic>orthologues are present in all Drosophilids (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and several other dipterans, as well as in other insect orders including Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera that are considerably further diverged (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). However, to date we could not detect clear H orthologues in species others than insect species, even when using the most highly conserved H domains (see below). The phylogenetic distance between Nematocera dipterans, like <italic>A. gambiae </italic>and <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, and the Cyclorrapha to which Drosophilidae belong, is about 200 &#x02013; 250 millions years, whereas about 250 &#x02013; 300 million years are estimated between dipterans and the other insect orders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A comparison of the presumptive H orthologues reveals a surprisingly high degree of divergence and highlights conserved domains all the more. These domains characterize the H protein and its function. They include the Su(H) binding domain (SBD), the Gro binding domain (GBD) and, at the very C-terminus a binding sequence for CtBP (CBD) that are remarkably well conserved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;D</xref>). The SBD maps to D.m.H residues 232 to 337, a region that is nearly identical in all Drosophilids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, in further diverged insects including <italic>Anopheles </italic>the SBD is split by a less well conserved stretch (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The GBD has been mapped to nine residues in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is extremely well conserved in the insect H orthologues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The CBD is nearly invariant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><p>The structure of the SBD in the further diverged insects led us to address whether the entire region is needed for Su(H) binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). In fact we found that the N-terminal portion (NT, L<sup>171 </sup>to S<sup>270</sup>) was sufficient for Su(H) binding, in agreement with earlier results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and bound as well as the entire SBD (NT-CT, L<sup>171 </sup>to H<sup>357</sup>). In contrast, the C-terminal portion (CT, R<sup>267 </sup>to H<sup>357</sup>) did not bind to Su(H) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The H orthologue from <italic>Apis mellifera</italic></title><p>To further our understanding of H function, we analyzed the <italic>Apis mellifera H </italic>gene (<italic>A.m.H</italic>) in more detail. Since there was neither a good annotation of the <italic>A.m.H </italic>gene nor a complete EST sequence available, we cloned <italic>A.m.H </italic>from an <italic>Apis </italic>cDNA library. However, the largest clone missed the start codon by 22 bases as predicted from an incomplete EST-sequence (see Methods). For subsequent in vivo analyses, we extended this cDNA clone by in vitro mutagenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The H orthologue of <italic>Apis mellifera</italic></bold>.

The cDNA has an open reading frame of 392 codons, which is only ~36% of D.m.H. Accordingly, the calculated molecular weight of A.m.H protein is ~44.5 kDa, whereas that of D.m.H is ~110 kDa.</p><p>Despite its small size, A.m.H contains the characteristic H protein domains, i.e. the SBD, the GBD and the CBD, and they are well conserved (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Three nuclear localization signals are predicted in D.m.H; two are identical in A.m.H, the third is slightly variant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). D.m.H is a highly basic protein with an isoelectric point (pI) of 10.4; A.m.H is likewise basic with a pI of 10.85. Both proteins contain acidic stretches, however, only the one located within the SBD is conserved (red arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Unlike D.m.H, the honeybee H protein does not contain the large acidic domain downstream of the SBD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, asterisk). Using the standard parameters of the BESTFIT program, the two orthologues share 54% identity. Under relaxed conditions that allow an overall alignment, the two protein sequences are 70% similar and 63% identical (see Methods).</p></sec><sec><title>A.m.H protein recapitulates D.m.H protein-protein interactions</title><p>The three H domains SBD, GBD and CBD serve as binding sites for the proteins Su(H), Gro and CtBP, respectively.

This was not certain since the A.m.H SBD shows just 79% similarity and 72% identity to the <italic>Drosophila </italic>SBD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). However, full length A.m.H bound to D.m.Su(H), whereas a N-terminally truncated protein that lacks the SBD, A.m.H 4-1 did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>A.m.H interacts with D.m.H partner proteins</bold>.

However, binding of full length A.m.H protein to D.m.Gro protein was not seen in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This was unsurprising, since full length D.m.H binds rather weakly to Gro, whereas it binds very strongly to a short peptide containing the GBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Likewise, strong binding was observed with a corresponding small peptide (S<sup>262 </sup>to P<sup>309</sup>) spanning the A.m.H GBD, as well as with the N-terminally truncated A.m.H 4-1 construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by a point mutation within the A.m.H GBD: an exchange of Tyrosine 264 to Alanine was sufficient to completely abrogate binding to Gro (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), just like the corresponding mutation in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The weak binding of Gro to full length H proteins from either species may perhaps result from the three dimensional structure of H which then must be likewise retained by the tiny A.m.H protein.</p><p>The CBD of honeybee and fly H orthologues are identical (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Therefore, the observed strong interaction between A.m.H and <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>CtBP was expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Mutation of A.m.H CBD* completely eliminated binding to D.m.CtBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) just like the respective D.m.H mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], confirming the specificity the A.m.H CBD. Finally, we tested interaction of A.m.H with Pros26.4. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the full length A.m.H as well as the N-terminally truncated A.m.H 4-1 both bound to the N-terminal part of Pros26.4 (Dm-S4-1), just like D.m.H. The Pros26.4 binding domain in D.m.H maps roughly between the GBD and the CBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, this region of A.m.H is only 21% of the D.m.H size and contains very few similarities.

Dependent on the time point of H overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), ectopic bristles (primarily microchaete), bristle loss or shaft duplications are observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Ectopic bristles form from extra sensory organ precursors that arise when Notch-mediated lateral inhibition is blocked. Indeed, furry flies are generated if hs-AmH is induced during late third larval instar to early pupal stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B, C</xref>). These ectopic sense organs contain the full complement of cells, since we find the corresponding neurons and thecogens in pupal nota (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B', C'</xref>). The outer bristle organ is derived from the pIIa daughter cell, which is generated by a Notch dependent unequal division of the sensory organ precursor cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Repressing this step during midpupal stages causes a transformation to inner cell fates at the expense of outer cell fates (pIIa to pIIb; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Accordingly, we find bald patches on the outside (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) and pair-wise duplication of inner cell types (neuron plus thecogen) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D'</xref>). Finally, Notch signaling is required to differentiate the socket from the shaft cell and the thecogen from the neuron. If these late steps are impeded by overexpression of A.m.H, a socket to shaft transformation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>) and a thecogen to neuron transformation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D', E'</xref>) is the consequence. Overall, overexpression of A.m.H has the same effects on bristle development as that of D.m.H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition to the bristle phenotypes, wing phenotypes similar to those of hs-DmH were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F, G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These include irregularities in the bristle pattern along the wing margin, as well as thickened veins that frequently end in broadened deltas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>). In addition to these well characterized phenotypes, we noted an elongation of the entire wing along the proximo-distal axis giving the wings a lanceolate appearance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F, G</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>A.m.H overexpression antagonizes Notch signaling in the process of bristle and wing development</bold>. A) Scheme of bristle organ development. After being singled out from a proneural cluster by lateral inhibition, a sensory organ precursor (SOP) divides unequally to produce two daughter cells (pIIa, pIIb), destined for outer and inner cell fate, respectively. pIIa gives rise to shaft and socket cells, and pIIb eventually to neuron and thecogen. A Notch signal is required for proper designation of cells depicted in red color. B) Thorax of a wild type fly. Note typical arrangement of macrochaete and regular spacing of microchaete, each consisting of a shaft and a socket. B') The underlying cell pair consists of a thecogen (red) and a neuron (light blue). Size bar; 10 &#x003bc;m. C) Early heat induction (black dash; about 5 days after egg deposition) of hs-AmH during larval to pupal transition interferes with lateral inhibition. As a result ectopic SOPs form, each giving rise to a complete bristle organ. Accordingly, additional thecogen/neuron pairs are detected inside (C'; size as in B'). The resultant flies are furry compared to the wild type. D) Later heat shock (blue dash; about 5 days 18 hours after egg deposition) leads to a transformation of outer pIIa to inner pIIb cell fate. Accordingly, neither shafts nor sockets develop, and the flies have bald patches. D') As expected, additional inner cell pairs of thecogen (red) and neuron (light blue) develop (arrow). Moreover, a transformation of thecogen to neuron is observed, giving rise to a neuron doublet (arrowhead). Same size as in B'. E) Heat shock at an even later phase (red dash; about 6 days after egg deposition) causes socket to shaft transformation most easily seen on the head. Consequently, two shafts arise from a bristle organ (black arrowhead). A partial transformation of the socket gives the appearance of a triple shaft (white arrowhead). E') Transformation of inner cell types, thecogen to neuron, is observed as well. In extreme cases, all four bristle cells are transformed to neurons (light blue), giving rise a neuron quadruple (arrow). Size is as in B'. F) The wing of a control fly shows the five longitudinal veins that end thinly at the margin (see enlargement F'). Mechano- and chemosensory bristles cover the anterior, and hairs the posterior wing margin in a regular pattern (anterior is up). G) Heat induction of hs-AmH affects the veins, now ending in typical deltas (arrowhead; see enlargement G'), and the bristles as described above, leaving the impression of a 'sloppy' margin (arrow). In addition, the wing is elongated along the proximo-distal axis, giving it a more lanceolate overall appearance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2148-8-175-5"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Tissue specific repression of Notch signaling in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>by Apis H</title><p>Notch signaling is involved in a plethora of developmental processes; a well studied example is the formation of the wing margin. During larval life, the presumptive wing margin is established in the wing imaginal disc by activation of the Notch pathway along a dorso-ventral boundary. A number of Notch target genes are subsequently activated including <italic>wingless, vestigial </italic>and <italic>cut</italic>, that are critical for patterning and outgrowth of the wing as well as the specification of wing marginal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. If Notch activity is down-regulated in the respective cells, adult wings are incised as exemplified in heterozygous <italic>Notch </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Likewise, wing margin defects develop if <italic>D.m.H </italic>is overexpressed in a spatially and temporally regulated manner in larval wing discs due to a local down-regulation of Notch activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Using the Gal4-UAS system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], <italic>A.m.H </italic>was locally overexpressed using the omb-Gal4 driver line that drives expression in the central part of larval wing discs. This caused extremely deep incisions in the adult wing, and the central wing blade was completely absent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Quite surprisingly, A.m.H is able to convert Su(H) into a repressor even more efficiently as D.m.H in the context of wing margin formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this conversion is largely dependent on the co-repressors Gro and CtBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Accordingly, mutant UAS-AmH constructs defective in either binding of Gro (UAS-AmHG*), of CtBP (UAS-AmHC*), or both (UAS-AmHGC*) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) were overexpressed. For each construct at least three independent lines were analyzed that gave similar results. Although we cannot exclude quantitative differences in the expression levels of individual lines, the phenotypic differences were very consistent. UAS-AmHG* caused a less extreme wing nicking than full length A.m.H (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), albeit the phenotype was still very strong and clearly stronger than obtained with D.m.H. Much weaker phenotypes were obtained upon overexpression of AmHC* and even weaker with AmHGC* (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), in accordance with the idea that both co-repressors are required for H repressor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As already noted for D.m.H, CtBP seems to be the more important co-repressor since loss of CtBP binding reduces H activity more strongly than loss of Gro binding. Notably, overexpression of AmHGC* resulted in shortened longitudinal veins L4 and L5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) like DmHGC* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This phenotype is very similar to the dominant wing phenotype of H mutants, raising the possibility of dominant negative effects. Interestingly the AmHGC* double mutant still retains notable repressor activity as seen by the incisions of the wing margin that are caused by its overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Hence, A.m.H is able to antagonize Notch signaling independent of co-repressors Gro and CtBP as was noticed before with the <italic>Drosophila </italic>orthologue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Because the small size of A.m.H leaves little room for additional binding domains, it seems not very likely that other, yet unidentified co-repressors confer this repressor activity. Perhaps, some Notch target genes require co-repressors for full silencing whereas others like <italic>vg </italic>do not. In the latter cases, H may directly interfere with the recruitment of intracellular Notch or Mam to the activation complex.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>A.m.H recruits <italic>Drosophila </italic>co-repressorsand downregulates transcription of the Notch target gene <italic>vestigial</italic></bold>.

Overexpression of these constructs results in deep wing incisions, ranging from nearly complete loss of the wing blade to large notches. Note shortening of longitudinals L4 and L5 upon overexpression of UAS-AmHGC* which cannot recruit any co-repressor (arrowheads). Control flies are omb-Gal4 &#x000d7; UAS-lacZ.

Compared to the normal expression of the <italic>lacZ</italic>-reporter gene, beta-galactosidase was almost completely absent in areas, where full length A.m.H was overexpressed, reflecting its repressor activity on the vg<sup>BE </sup>enhancer element. At the same time, the presumptive wing blade was notably distorted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), which is typical of full length D.m.H overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Overexpression of AmHG*, resulted in a likewise inhibition of vg<sup>BE</sup>-lacZ expression, however, the wing disc had only little or no morphological defects (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In contrast, mutation of the CBD interfered strongly with A.m.H repressor activity, since overexpression of AmHC* caused only a small gap in the vg<sup>BE</sup>-lacZ pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In the absence of co-repressor binding (AmHGC*), no or very little down-regulation of vg<sup>BE</sup>-lacZ was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The acidic domain in <italic>Drosophila </italic>H attenuates its repressor activity</title><p>Since the rescue capacities of the heat shock A.m.H constructs were reduced compared to similar D.m.H constructs, we were surprised by the strong wing defects of the omb-Gal4&#x0003e;UAS-AmH flies (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). These phenotypes were much stronger than those effected by a likewise overexpression of UAS-DmH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B, C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. What could be the reason? Despite the much smaller size of A.m.H, the overall organization of the two orthologues is similar. There is, however, a striking difference with regard to a large acidic domain (AD) in D.m.H just C-terminal of the SBD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), which is completely absent from A.m.H (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Our earlier work suggested that the acidic domain might attenuate H repressor activity in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To strengthen this hypothesis, we generated the D.m.H UAS-H&#x00394;C3 and UAS-H&#x00394;AD constructs both lacking the acidic domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Both constructs were overexpressed using the omb-Gal4 driver line. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>, D.m.H protein lacking the acidic domain is much more potent than full length D.m.H or A.m.H. The resultant wings are barely recognized as such since only the hinge region is present (H&#x00394;AD; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>) or little of the wing blade remains (H&#x00394;C3; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). The fact that H&#x00394;C3 gives milder phenotypes than H&#x00394;AD suggests that regions important for normal H repressor activity are lost in this larger deletion as well. These findings strongly support the notion that the acidic domain antagonizes the repressor activity of D.m.H. Hence, the stronger overexpression phenotypes obtained with A.m.H in the wing nicely fit this hypothesis because of the missing acidic stretch in the <italic>Apis </italic>H orthologue.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>The acidic domain in D.m.H attenuates H repressor activity</bold>.

Recent data provide evidence that H assembles a repressor complex on Notch target genes by linking Su(H) with the two co-repressors Gro and CtBP. Binding of H to the Pros26.4 subunit of the proteasome is unrelated to Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, it reduces H protein stability. Therefore, Pros26.4 indirectly plays a positive role in the Notch signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our data show that A.m.H physically interacts with any of these four <italic>Drosophila </italic>proteins in an in vitro assay. Moreover, we show that relevant mutations in the A.m.H GBD and CBD eliminate binding to the respective co-repressors. These data highlight the importance of the mutated residues for the binding to the respective partner. Interestingly, the A.m.H double mutant retains repressor activity independent of the co-repressors, suggesting that it may interfere with the assembly of the Su(H)-Notch-Mam activator complex. A similar intrinsic repressor activity was already observed for the corresponding D.m.H*GC mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This intrinsic repressor activity has been conserved through considerable evolutionary time and we hope to be able to localize the responsible domain by further comparison and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. Taken all together <italic>Apis H </italic>is a mini-gene in comparison to the <italic>Drosophila </italic>orthologue. Interestingly this small gene mimics <italic>H </italic>function in <italic>Drosophila </italic>almost completely. This was very surprising since H executes its functions solely through protein-protein interactions. From the functional complementation we conclude that A.m.H must be able to assemble an effective repressor complex together with the <italic>Drosophila </italic>proteins Su(H), Gro and CtBP. However, whereas D.m.H is rather big with roughly 120 kDa and hence provides a sufficiently large surface area for the binding of all three proteins at once, A.m.H. has a predicted size of only about 45 kDa. For example, any of its <italic>Drosophila </italic>partners has a considerably larger molecular weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Hence, one might expect steric hindrance in a repressor complex containing A.m.H plus <italic>Drosophila </italic>components. Because A.m.H functions well in the fly, it must allow for a topology similar to D.m.H. In this case, the interaction domains SBD, GBD and CBD must be in likewise close proximity in D.m.H, whilst the intervening, non-conserved sequences loop out. A structural analysis of Hairless proteins is required to eventually resolve the conformation of the repressor complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Notch signaling pathway in the honeybee</title><p>In this work, we have used A.m.H for a structure-function analysis of fly Hairless. We do not know, whether A.m.H has the same antagonistic role during Notch signaling in the honeybee as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Since we cannot genetically manipulate the honeybee in the same way as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we cannot address this question directly. Instead, we searched the honeybee database for other components of the Notch pathway (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). In fact, we found single orthologues of Notch, Su(H), Gro and CtBP that are extremely well conserved in <italic>Apis</italic>, and one reasonably well conserved Mam orthologue. Moreover, predicted Notch target genes <italic>m&#x003b3;</italic>, <italic>m&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>m&#x003b2;' </italic>and <italic>m&#x003b1; </italic>that form the honeybee <italic>E(spl)-C </italic>have been already described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We were surprised, however, by the low conservation of <italic>Apis vestigial (vg)</italic>. The A.m.vg protein has a similarity of 63% and an identity of 58% to D.m.vg (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). This is the lowest conservation rate of any Notch pathway component we have looked for. We were curious whether the boundary enhancer, where Su(H) binds to, is present within the presumptive <italic>A.m.vg </italic>gene. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this enhancer is located in the first intron and contains a single Su(H) binding site on the minus-strand with the core sequence GTGAGAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The corresponding intron in the honeybee <italic>vg </italic>gene comprises over 30 kb and more than 20 possible Su(H) target sequences (Genomatrix), three with the identical core sequence on the minus-strand. Taken together, these findings imply that the entire Notch signaling cascade is conserved in <italic>A. mellifera</italic>.</p><p>In addition, our data indicate that A.m.H antagonizes Notch signaling in the honeybee also by the assembly of a repression complex consisting of A.m.Su(H) and the co-repressors A.m.Gro and A.m.CtBP. This is based on the high conservation of the three orthologues as well as their binding sites within A.m.H and on the direct protein interactions between A.m.H and the <italic>Drosophila </italic>Su(H), Gro and CtBP proteins (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). The structure of the activation complex from mammals as well as from <italic>C. elegans</italic>, comprising Notch, Mam-like protein and DNA-bound CSL has been elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and we do not expect it to be much different in fly or honeybee. Differences may arise for target genes such as <italic>E(spl) </italic>or <italic>vg</italic>, which eventually implement Notch signals. The Apis <italic>E(spl) </italic>homologues possess typical Su(H) binding sites in their enhancer-promoters, indicating their importance in the Notch signaling pathway for honeybee development as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Notch antagonists in higher eukaryotes</title><p>Hairless is the general antagonist of the Notch signaling pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. To date, H has no known homologue in higher eukaryotes other than insects, in contrast to the other Notch pathway members that are well conserved from worm and fly to human. Strikingly, the Su(H) protein, which directly binds to H, shares 82% amino acid identity with its mouse orthologue RBP-J<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>over large protein portions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This is surprising and leads to speculations. For example, it was postulated that H is the counterpart of the Msx2-interacting nuclear target protein (MINT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, the corresponding <italic>Drosophila </italic>protein is encoded by <italic>split ends (spen) </italic>and has been proposed to integrate information from several different signaling pathways. Recently it has been shown to function also as genetic antagonist of certain Notch dependent processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A vertebrate H homologue has not yet been identified based on sequence conservation, presumably due to a high degree of divergence. One experimental approach to eventually identify such a homologue is to analyze the H structure in detail and to characterize important functional domains. The H orthologue from the honeybee will help us in this process. We have shown that A.m.H functions as a bone fide Notch antagonist in the fly despite considerable divergence with regard to size and amino acid sequence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>PCR and cloning strategies</title><p>An <italic>Apis mellifera </italic>embryonic cDNA Uni-ZAP XR library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] was screened with a PCR-probe (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

For both databases, we used the <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>protein sequence as search sequences. Similarity and identity scores were calculated using BESTFIT. Because standard conditions only align the best conserved domains, we relaxed the parameters such that the entire protein sequence was aligned (gap weight 1, length weight 1, maximum penalty length 30).
