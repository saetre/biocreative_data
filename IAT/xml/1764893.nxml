These receptor families are thought to receive chemosensory information from a wide spectrum of odorant and pheromonal cues that influence critical animal behaviors such as feeding, reproduction and other social interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using genome database mining and other informatics approaches, we identified and characterized the repertoire of 54 intact "V2R-like" olfactory C family GPCRs in the zebrafish. Phylogenetic analysis &#x02013; which also included a set of 34 C family GPCRs from fugu &#x02013; places the fish olfactory receptors in three major groups, which are related to but clearly distinct from other C family GPCRs, including the calcium sensing receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptors, GABA-B receptor, T1R taste receptors, and the major group of V2R vomeronasal receptor families. Interestingly, an analysis of sequence conservation and selective pressure in the zebrafish receptors revealed the retention of a conserved sequence motif previously shown to be required for ligand binding in other amino acid receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on our findings, we propose that the repertoire of zebrafish olfactory C family GPCRs has evolved to allow the detection and discrimination of a spectrum of amino acid and/or amino acid-based compounds, which are potent olfactory cues in fish. Furthermore, as the major groups of fish receptors and mammalian V2R receptors appear to have diverged significantly from a common ancestral gene(s), these receptors likely mediate chemosensation of different classes of chemical structures by their respective organisms.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The vertebrate olfactory system receives and decodes sensory information from a myriad chemical cues. The first step in this process is the recognition of these cues by receptors expressed by the primary sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium (reviewed in refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Receptor-mediated activity within the population of olfactory sensory neurons is then interpreted by the brain to identify the molecular nature of the odorant stimulus. A large multigene family thought to encode odorant receptors was initially identified in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and belong to what is now referred to as the "OR" superfamily of odorant receptors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). The predicted structure of these receptors exhibits a seven transmembrane domain topology characteristic of the "A family" or rhodopsin class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The size of the OR gene family in mammals is extremely large and is estimated to contain over 1000 individual genes in some species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the fish, the size of the OR repertoire appears to be much smaller and appears to contain only ~40 to ~140 genes, depending on the species examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. More recently, members of the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family were shown to be expressed in mouse olfactory neurons and are thought to mediate the reception of amine-based chemosensory cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Two types of GPCRs unrelated to the OR or TAAR families are expressed in the mammalian vomeronasal organ: the V1R receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and the V2R receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The V1R receptors are expressed within the subpopulation of G<sub>&#x003b1;i</sub>-expressing VNO sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Genome-wide surveys have revealed the presence of approximately 100 V1R genes in the mouse genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The V2R receptors belong to the "C family" of GPCRs, which includes the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), extracellular calcium sensing receptors (CaSR), and GABA-B receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Members of this receptor family are characterized by their long N-terminal extracellular domain, which contains the primary determinants for ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). The mouse and rat genomes each encode approximately 60 V2R genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; these receptors are expressed in the subclass of G<sub>&#x003b1;o</sub>-expressing neurons in a pattern complementary to V1R/G<sub>&#x003b1;i </sub>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Because of their expression in the vomeronasal organ &#x02013; a structure specialized for the detection of non-volatile cues, including pheromones &#x02013; the V1R and V2R receptors have been widely postulated to represent pheromone receptors (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated that specific V1R- and V2R-expressing vomeronasal neurons respond to known pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; however, formal proof that the V1R and V2R are pheromone receptors awaits a direct demonstration of ligand-receptor interactions between such compounds and these receptors.</p><p>In the fish, receptors belonging to the C family of GPCRs have been shown to be expressed in the olfactory epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The olfactory C family GPCRs are expressed by the subpopulation of microvillous sensory neurons in the fish's single olfactory organ, distinct from the ciliated sensory neurons which express members of the OR family of odorant receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Significantly, two orthologous receptors from the goldfish and zebrafish (called receptor 5.24 and receptor ZO6, respectively) are activated by amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], which are potent feeding cues in fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These observations raise the possibility that the olfactory C family GPCRs as a group represent a family of amino acid-sensing receptors in teleost fish.</p><p>To gain insights into the evolution and function of olfactory C family GPCRs, we performed an analysis of this receptor gene family in the zebrafish, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>. Through genome database mining of the zebrafish genome sequence provided by the Sanger Institute <italic>Danio rerio </italic>Sequencing Project, we identified and characterized the complete repertoire of olfactory C family GPCRs. Our analysis identified 62 genes (54 encoding intact, full-length receptors), which can be divided into 21 subfamilies. Although two of the intact zebrafish receptor genes appear to be orthologous to mammalian V2R or V2R-like genes, the major group of zebrafish receptors form a clade distinct from the mammalian V2R receptors. In addition, our analysis of the zebrafish receptors revealed &#x02013; in all family members &#x02013; a conserved signature motif previously shown to be involved in ligand binding in other amino acid-sensing receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In contrast, other amino acid positions predicted to form contact sites in the ligand binding pocket show marked divergence within the zebrafish receptor family. Together these observations suggest that the zebrafish olfactory C family GPCRs comprise a family of receptors that has evolved to recognize a diverse array of amino acid and/or amino acid-based ligands.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Prediction of zebrafish OlfC genes</title><p>The second (Zv2) and third (Zv3) draft zebrafish genome assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] of whole genome shotgun sequence (5.7&#x000d7; coverage) were searched for <italic>OlfC </italic>gene sequences using homology to known fish OlfC proteins as a guide. A final search of the sixth draft assembly (Zv6) with the identified <italic>OlfC </italic>genes revealed no additional sequences. The resulting genes were then mapped to the Zv6 assembly.</p><p>In contrast to the typically uninterrupted coding sequence of <italic>OR </italic>genes, the intron-exon structure of the genes encoding the C family GPCRs comprises a minimum of 6 exons (e.g., see ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). Our gene prediction strategy was to combine a low-threshold BLAST search with profile Hidden Markov Model-(HMM) based gene prediction with the program Genewise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This process was repeated in an iterative fashion, as follows. The zebrafish genome assembly was subjected to TBLASTN search using known full-length olfactory C family GPCRs from zebrafish, goldfish and fugu. Initial query sequences included goldfish olfactory receptors 5.24, 5.3, GFB1, and GFB8, zebrafish ZO6, and fugu Ca02.1, Ca09, Ca12, Ca13 and Ca15.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The gene prediction program Genewise was then run on the genomic sequences surrounding each unique BLAST hit using a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) of the gene family (see Methods for details). The Genewise predictions were examined manually and extended to appropriate start and stop codons based on alignment of the amino acid translation to known or previously predicted olfactory C family GPCR sequences. Splice site predictions were also edited when possible to minimize the occurrence of gaps at splice junctions in the alignment and maintain intron positions with respect to the amino acid sequence alignment. At this stage, predicted genes highly similar to the CaSR, mGluRs and T1Rs were set apart from the putative olfactory sequences. In each round, the newly-predicted genes were added as queries for the next BLAST search, and a new profile HMM was constructed for use in the next round of gene prediction. The family of putative olfactory C family GPCRs is designated "<italic>OlfC</italic>" for <underline>Olf</underline>actory <underline>C</underline> family GPCR (see below for discussion regarding nomenclature).</p><p><italic>OlfC </italic>gene sequences were considered intact if they 1) begin with a signal sequence, 2) end in a stop codon after the seventh predicted transmembrane domain, 3) show significant alignment to all six stereotypical OlfC exons, and 4) possess no internal frame shifts, significant deletions (excluding those caused by gaps in the genome assembly) or stop codons. Predicted genes were categorized as full-length pseudogenes if they at met the first three criteria but failed the fourth. Sequences were considered partial genes if they failed one of the first three criteria but met the fourth. Finally, predicted genes were considered partial pseudogenes if they failed all four criteria.</p><p>Using these criteria, our search identified 54 intact <italic>OlfC </italic>genes, 2 partial genes, 3 full-length pseudogenes and 1 partial pseudogene, for a total of 60 sequences. Two additional partial pseudogenes (too small to meet our length threshold) were recently reported by Hashiguchi and Nishida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; see below). We therefore included them in the total count of 62 <italic>OlfC </italic>genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; [see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>]) but excluded them from further analysis. All full-length genes exhibit a conserved gene structure, with the protein coding sequence encoded by 6 exons [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">Additional file 5</xref>]. Variation in exon length is evident, even within individual subfamilies, although variation in exon length is greater between subfamilies [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>]. Interestingly, however, the phases of intron/exon boundaries within codons are strictly conserved across all members of the family [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of zebrafish <italic>OlfC </italic>genes.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Intact genes<sup>a</sup></bold></td><td align="center">54</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Partial genes<sup>b</sup></bold></td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Full-length pseudogenes<sup>c</sup></bold></td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Partial pseudogenes<sup>d, e</sup></bold></td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Total<sup>e</sup></bold></td><td align="center"><bold>62</bold></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a </sup>Intact genes are defined as those sequences that 1) contain a leading signal sequence, 2) end in a stop codon after the seventh predicted transmembrane domain, 3) show significant alignment to all six stereotypical OlfC exons, and 4) possess no internal frame shifts, significant deletions (excluding those caused by gaps in the genome assembly) or stop codons.</p><p><sup>b </sup>Partial genes comprise those sequences that fail one of the first three criteria (above) but meet the fourth.</p><p><sup>c </sup>Sequences are categorized as full-length pseudogenes if they meet the first three criteria but fail the fourth.</p><p><sup>d </sup>Sequences that fail to meet all four criteria are categorized as partial pseudogenes.</p><p><sup>e </sup>Includes two partial pseudogenes identified in [37] but not identified in this study.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>A recent study based on the 4<sup>th </sup>assembly of the draft zebrafish genome (Zv4) identified a total of 89 OlfC sequences, including 38 partial sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Forty of the 89 sequences appear to have frame shifts or stop codons. We ascribe the discrepancies with our results in part to the difference in genome assemblies used for the two analyses (Zv4 alone vs. the Zv2, Zv3 and Zv6 assemblies used here). In the present analysis, we found that many of the non-overlapping sequences previously identified as distinct genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] in fact map to a smaller set of common, intact genes (note the clustering of multiple, previous gene designations to single identified genes in [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>]). We also found that all full-length <italic>OlfC </italic>gene sequences have a conserved gene structure [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>]; previously reported variations to this organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] are likely due to sequencing errors in earlier genome assemblies and inaccuracies in gene predictions. Overall, our analysis identified all but two pseudogenes found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] plus an additional three intact genes, one partial gene and one full-length pseudogene. Based on these observations and the higher quality of our gene models (as evidenced by the greater proportion of complete gene sequences in the present analysis), we believe that our study provides a more accurate representation of the zebrafish <italic>OlfC </italic>gene family.</p><p>In addition to the 62 OlfC sequences described above, our analysis also identified other C family GPCRs in the zebrafish genome: one putative calcium sensing receptor and 4 T1R-like putative taste receptors. Our search for these other receptor sequences was not exhaustive, however; it is therefore possible that additional paralogs of these receptors escaped identification in our analysis. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that the four T1R-like receptors are highly similar to the three previously-identified classes of T1R taste receptors in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]: T1R1 (zebrafish T1Ra), T1R2 (zebrafish T1Rb1 and T1Rb2), and T1R3 (zebrafish T1Rc) (see below).</p><p>The identity of the <italic>OlfC </italic>gene family as a bona fide olfactory receptor family was confirmed by RNA in situ hybridizations. Probes for 46 intact <italic>OlfC </italic>genes were hybridized individually to zebrafish olfactory epithelium (T. Alioto, P. Luu, E. VanName, J. Fan, J. Ngai, unpublished results; [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>]). Of this group, 42 gave detectable signal in olfactory sensory neurons. Forty probes localized to cells in a punctate pattern consistent with the expression of one or a few receptor genes per neuron. Two receptors, OlfCa1 and OlfCc1, exhibited broad expression in a large fraction of neurons. These receptors are orthologous to goldfish receptors 5.24 and 5.3, respectively, which were previously shown to be expressed widely in the goldfish olfactory epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. OlfCc1 and goldfish receptor 5.3 are orthologous to the mammalian V2R2 vomeronasal receptor, which is expressed in a large fraction of vomeronasal neurons and co-expressed with other "punctate" V2R receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Together our results suggest that OlfCa1 and OlfCc1 &#x02013; which comprise two clades distinct from the main group of zebrafish OlfC receptors (see below) &#x02013; are the two broadly expressed receptors of the repertoire and are co-expressed with a single "punctate" receptor in each sensory neuron.</p></sec><sec><title>OlfC nomenclature and classification</title><p>Olfactory receptors belonging to the "OR" superfamily have been classified into monophyletic groups, with family members sharing greater than 40% amino acid identity and subfamily members sharing greater than 60% amino acid identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In the case of the zebrafish <italic>OlfC </italic>genes, we found that a subfamily threshold of 65% amino acid identity worked best for the generation of monophyletic clades, which we believe correspond to groups of recently duplicated <italic>OlfC </italic>genes. Using this threshold as an operational guideline, we classified the zebrafish <italic>OlfC </italic>genes into 21 subfamilies, with 17 containing full-length <italic>OlfC </italic>gene sequences [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>] (see below for phylogenetic reconstructions). The average percent identity between subfamilies is approximately 46%, with the maximum observed percent identity between any two OlfCs of different subfamilies being 61%. The average percent identity among members within a subfamily is ~81%, with the minimum identity between any two members of any subfamily being 72%.</p><p>To unify the naming for zebrafish <italic>OlfC </italic>genes, we propose a revised nomenclature based on the following rationale. First, the prefix "OlfC" was adopted as the designation for the <underline>Olf</underline>actory <underline>C</underline> family GPCRs identified in this and previous studies. In addition to reflecting the olfactory-specific nature of these receptors, this designation is consistent with our phylogenetic analysis (see below), which indicates that the OlfC receptors form a family distinct from other C family GPCRs, including the mammalian V2R receptors. Both newly-predicted and previously-described zebrafish <italic>OlfC </italic>genes were named (or re-named) according to subfamily membership. Subfamilies were designated by letters starting with "a" and ending with "y" (skipping "i," "l," "o," and "p"). Within subfamilies, <italic>OlfC</italic>s were numbered sequentially according to genomic position, if known. The new nomenclature showing subfamily membership and correspondence to previously-identified zebrafish <italic>OlfC </italic>genes is shown in Supplementary Materials [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic distribution of zebrafish OlfC genes</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>V2R </italic>and <italic>OlfC </italic>genes are clustered in the rodent and fugu genomes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the present study, we found that 59 of the 62 identified zebrafish <italic>OlfC </italic>genes map to known chromosomal locations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>]). Fifty seven genes reside in three clusters, with 39 genes on chromosome 18, 12 genes on chromosome 17, and 6 genes on chromosome 11; one gene each localizes to chromosome 16 and chromosome 20. From our analysis of the Zv6 genome assembly, there is little evidence for large segmental duplications of receptor-containing loci; we find only a few instances of apparent interchromosomal duplications resulting in subfamily members residing on two chromosomes (subfamily g on chromosomes 17 and 18, subfamily d on chromosomes 11 and 18, and subfamily m on chromosomes 11 and 17). In most cases, genes within a given subfamily are found in the same chromosomal cluster and share a common transcriptional orientation. Together these observations suggest tandem duplication(s) as the primary mechanism for expansion of the <italic>OlfC </italic>gene repertoire.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>OlfC </italic>genes are clustered in the zebrafish genome</bold>. Zebrafish <italic>OlfC </italic>genes were mapped to the Zv6 draft genome assembly. Shown are the positions of predicted <italic>OlfC </italic>genes in three clusters on chromosomes 11, 17 and 18 as well as the two singlets on chromosomes 16 and 20. Subfamily members are in most cases found in contiguous clusters and often share the same transcriptional orientation. The interrupted coding sequence of OlfCg7 (in brackets) is likely due to the unfinished state of scaffold 2506 in the Zv6 genome assembly. Also shown are non-OlfC RefSeq sequences and zebrafish mRNAs from the UCSC genome browser [78].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-7-309-1"/></fig><p>A previous analysis placed the zebrafish <italic>OlfC </italic>genes on ten chromosomes, with two major clusters of 34 genes on chromosome 18, 10 genes on chromosome 17, and none on chromosome 11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, in the present analysis using the more recent Zv6 genome assembly, we found that the <italic>OlfC </italic>genes with identifiable chromosomal locations map only to chromosomes 11, 16, 17, 18 and 20; many of the genes localized by Hashiguchi and Nishida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] to the seven other chromosomes were partial sequences that ultimately map to the major clusters on chromosomes 11, 17 and 18 in the updated Zv6 genome assembly. In addition, Hashiguchi and Nishida identified two possible instances of recent tandem duplications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]: one within the cluster on chromosome 18 resulting in a near-perfect 64 kb duplication with 3 <italic>OlfC </italic>genes, and another between chromosomes 17 and 20, yielding an apparent 60 kb duplication with 4 genes. However, our analysis of these regions using the Zv2, Zv3, Zv5 and Zv6 assemblies indicates that these apparent duplications represent artifacts caused by errors in the Zv4 genome assembly. With the exception of 2 pseudogenes, all of the 89 OlfC sequences identified previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] were detected with our gene mining pipeline and all of them (including the 2 pseudogenes) are accounted for in our analysis. Largely consistent with our gene predictions and chromosomal mapping, a more recent report by Hashiguchi and Nishida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] based on the Zv5 assembly identified 57 zebrafish OlfC sequences (46 encoding potentially functional genes) that were localized to chromosomes 5, 17 and 18.

To this end, phylogenetic trees of the 57 full-length OlfC sequences (54 intact genes and 3 full-length pseudogenes) and other C family GPCRs were constructed using maximum likelihood or neighbor joining algorithms (see Methods). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the results of a phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum likelihood analysis, which classifies the full-length zebrafish OlfC genes into monophyletic clades representing 17 subfamilies showing on average 46% inter-subfamily identity.

The subfamilies in turn cluster into 3 larger groups: Group I, the largest group, consisting of 52 intact genes and 2 full-length pseudogenes; Group II, consisting of a single intact gene; and Group III, containing one intact gene plus a full-length pseudogene. All OlfC groups form clades that are clearly distinct from the CaSR, mGluR, and T1R-like taste receptor families. Group I and Group II genes reside on a common branch of the phylogenetic tree; their proximity to the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) suggests a previous duplication and expansion from a most recent common ancestral gene (MRCA) shared by the present-day CaSR.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogeny of the zebrafish OlfC family</bold>.

Reconstructions using either maximum likelihood (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) or neighbor joining (data not shown) place Group III closer to the putative taste receptors than to the Group I and Group II OlfC receptors, suggesting an MRCA for the T1R and Group III receptors not shared with the Group I or Group II receptors. However, based on amino acid sequence similarity alone, Group III is roughly equidistant from Group I/Group II (average 31% identity) and the family of T1R-like putative taste receptors (average 29% identity). While this apparent discrepancy could be explained by the longer branch lengths of the T1R family, suggestive of accelerated functional/sequence divergence, conclusions about the origins of the Group III OlfC receptors should be tempered by these latter observations.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of fish OlfC and mammalian V2R receptors</title><p>To gain additional insight into the evolution of the OlfC receptor repertoire, we compared the zebrafish OlfC sequences to mammalian V2R receptors, OlfC receptors identified in two other teleost fish species (goldfish and fugu), and other C family GPCRs. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using intact genes from zebrafish (63 genes), mouse (72 genes), goldfish (4 genes), and fugu (34 genes) (see Methods for the list of genes included in this analysis). A phylogenetic tree generated using maximum likelihood is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.

In addition to their sequence similarity, members of this group are expressed broadly in their respective organisms' sensory epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], reflecting a conserved mode of gene regulation. Group III appears to contain a single receptor in the zebrafish (OlfCa1), goldfish (receptor 5.24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]), fugu (179742), or mouse (gprc6a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]); mammalian gprc6a shows about 40% amino acid similarity to the corresponding fish receptors in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The zebrafish, goldfish and mouse receptors in Group III have all been shown to be activated by amino acid ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

Thus, while these receptors appear to be orthologous, their regulation in tissue-specific gene expression has diverged significantly between fish and mammals.</p><p>The 19 identified fugu OlfC receptors [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">Additional file 6</xref>] can be placed into 10 of the 21 subfamilies defined above for the zebrafish (subfamilies a, c, h, j, k, q, r, t, u and v). Four fugu receptors (744432, 611613, 594197, and 744222) cannot be classified into these subfamilies and thus form four fugu-specific subfamilies. We conclude from this comparison that the OlfC family had already diverged into the present-day subfamilies in the most recent common ancestor of the cyprinid (zebrafish and goldfish) and pufferfish lineages, prior to the cyprinid-pufferfish split (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]). Subsequent differential gene expansion (mainly evident in the zebrafish branch) and gene loss (more prevalent in the fugu branch) probably occurred following speciation of these two teleost lineages.</p></sec><sec><title>Patterns of sequence conservation and divergence implicate the OlfC receptors as a family of amino acid-binding proteins</title><p>We next examined the patterns of sequence conservation and divergence within the zebrafish OlfC receptor family in order to gain insights into the possible functions of these receptors. A sequence logo created from the alignment of full-length zebrafish OlfC amino acid sequences highlights a number of conserved motifs among members of the family (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In addition to the clear conservation of the cysteine residues of the cysteine-rich domain and heptahelical transmembrane (TM) domains (both of which are important structural elements in this class of GPCR), several stretches of residues in the ligand-binding N-terminal domain (NTD) are also conserved. These NTD residues largely correspond to secondary structure elements such as the core alpha helices in lobe 1 and the beta strands in lobe 2, as well as sites predicted to interact with bound ligand (see below and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Overall, the NTD shows less conservation than the cysteine-rich and TM domains, consistent with these latter domains' roles in receptor structure and coupling to intracellular signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence logo of the zebrafish OlfC family</bold>.

It is instructive to consider this question in the context of the structure of C family GPCRs. The ligand-binding NTD of C family GPCRs is thought to adopt a conformation resembling a bilobate clamshell-like structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Stabilization of the closed conformation of the clamshell &#x02013; through interactions between bound ligand and the inner faces of the two lobes (lobes 1 and 2) &#x02013; leads to receptor activation. For amino acid-binding receptors, the binding pocket formed by the two lobes of the clamshell can be divided into two regions: a proximal pocket, comprising residues that interact with the glycine moiety of the amino acid ligand (&#x003b1;-carboxylate, &#x003b1;-amino and &#x003b1;-proton), and a distal pocket, comprising residues that interact with the ligand's R group side chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Studies on a wide variety of amino acid-binding proteins have identified a core "signature" motif of 5 residues within the proximal binding pocket that participate in critical interactions with the amino acid ligand ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Thus, the presence of the ligand-binding signature motif in a given receptor would be consistent with the receptor's possible function in amino acid sensing. An additional 3 conserved residues predicted to be involved in structural interactions in the hinge region have also been identified in the amino acid receptors ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Although still subject to experimental validation, together with the core 5-site motif these latter 3 sites have been proposed to comprise an 8 residue signature of amino acid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>We have shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] that the amino acid-binding core signature motif is present in goldfish receptor 5.24, a Group III OlfC receptor that is activated by amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; mutagenesis of any one of the 5 signature motif residues in receptor 5.24 results in a profound decrease in receptor activation by ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The corresponding 5 amino acids in OlfCa1 (previously named ZO6), the zebrafish ortholog of goldfish receptor 5.24 that is also activated by amino acids, are fully conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We were therefore interested in determining to what extent the amino acid-binding signature motif is conserved within the zebrafish OlfC receptor family, and by inference whether the OlfC receptors may constitute a family of amino acid receptors.</p><p>We addressed this issue using two tools for mapping amino acid substitutions to relevant sites in the receptor structure: (1) a sequence logo representation of residues predicted from our previous structure-function studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] to be involved in amino acid binding, including the aforementioned 8 residue signature motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), and (2) a representation of conservation and divergence overlaid on our structural model for the ligand-binding NTD of OlfCa1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]). Three salient features are evident from this analysis. First, the 8 residue signature motif (S150, S/T173, R188, D193, Q196, Y221, G222, D/E307 in OlfCa1 coordinates) is highly conserved in the zebrafish OlfC family (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), as well as in the fugu OlfC receptors [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">Additional file 6</xref>]. Similarly, a high level of conservation is seen for residues forming the surface of the proximal binding pocket (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These observations suggest that the OlfC receptors as a group are capable of binding to amino acids and their derivatives. Second, a sequence logo of the mouse V2R receptors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) shows that, with the exception of the Group II V2R2 receptor(s), the amino acid-binding signature motif is absent from the mammalian V2R receptors. Since the signature motif is strictly required for amino acid binding in all C family GPCRs identified to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], Group IV and Group V V2R receptors have likely evolved to receive non-amino acid stimuli; the probable functional divergence of the V2R and OlfC receptors mirrors the phylogenetic divergence of these two receptor families (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). What, then, are the cognate ligands for the V2R receptors? Recent studies have implicated the V2R receptors in detecting MHC peptides and other conspecific peptide cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. We speculate that since such peptides are likely too large to fit within the conventional clamshell binding pocket, they may instead activate the receptor by allosteric interactions on the exterior of the NTD or cysteine-rich domain, similar to the allosteric activation of T1R sweet receptors by peptide sweeteners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. It should be noted that fish also appear to choose mating partners based on MHC haplotype, presumably via an olfactory-mediated process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]; the OlfC receptors may therefore mediate chemoreception of peptide cues via such allosteric interactions, distinct from "orthosteric" ligand binding interactions within the conventional clamshell binding pocket.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acid conservation and selective pressure displayed on a structural model of the OlfC N-terminal ligand-binding domain</bold>.

Together with the conservation of proximal pocket residues (including those comprising the signature motif), these observations suggest that the OlfC receptor family has evolved to detect and discriminate a diverse spectrum of amino acids and/or amino acid derivatives. Consistent with this multiplicity of putative amino acid receptors, physiological studies have provided evidence for multiple, overlapping pathways used by the fish olfactory system to detect this class of chemical cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Interestingly, behavioral studies in catfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] have shown that fish are able to discriminate between amino acids. The future elucidation of the ligand specificities of individual, cloned OlfC receptors should allow an understanding of how this receptor family subserves the physiologic and behavioral discrimination of amino acid-based chemical structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Adaptive evolution of OlfC receptors</title><p>Our analysis of sequence conservation within the receptor structure revealed a striking degree of divergence in a considerable portion of the NTD &#x02013; the region of C family GPCRs responsible for ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. While sequence conservation is usually a clear indicator of important function (for example, structural elements necessary for the correct folding of protein domains), lack of conservation is more difficult to interpret. On the one hand, the observed variation might represent relaxed selective pressure consistent with lack of sequence-related function. For example, some loop regions might only function to connect secondary structural elements &#x02013; their length being important but not their particular sequence. The observed sequence diversity could therefore be the result of genetic drift, with polymorphisms in the population being fixed at a rate consistent with the absence of selective pressure. On the other hand, adaptive evolutionary processes may have driven diversification of protein function (e.g., to allow the recognition of a different chemical ligands by recently-duplicated receptors) via selection on specific residues or protein regions.</p><p>We used the relative frequency of non-synonymous vs. synonymous codon substitutions to assess the selective processes acting on the <italic>OlfC </italic>receptor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In the absence of positive or negative selection, the number of non-synonymous changes relative to the number of possible non-synonymous changes (dN) is equal to the number of synonymous changes relative to the number of possible synonymous changes (dS) &#x02013; i.e., dN/dS = 1. Significant deviations of dN/dS from unity reflect selection on the sequence; a dN/dS ratio &#x0003e; 1 indicates that a region has undergone positive selection, whereas a dN/dS ratio &#x0003c; 1 indicates negative or "purifying" selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. For the present analysis, we aligned a set of 50 full-length intact zebrafish OlfC coding sequences and calculated dN and dS values, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. We first made these calculations separately for two broad regions of the receptor: the NTD and the combined cysteine-rich plus TM domains (CTD). Both the NTD and CTD appear to be under negative or purifying selection (dN/dS = 0.216 and dN/dS = 0.124, respectively). However, the NTD displays a significantly higher average dN/dS ratio than the CTD (p = 3.02 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-112</sup>). These observations are consistent with a scenario in which there is an overall relaxed negative selection on the N-terminal sequence, which may have permitted OlfC receptors to adapt their binding affinities to different odorants.</p><p>What evolutionary processes may have acted on individual sites within the receptor structure? We hypothesize that highly conserved sites within the proximal binding pocket &#x02013; i.e., those involved in binding the common glycine moiety of all amino acid ligands &#x02013; might be expected to have undergone negative or purifying selection. Conversely, sites comprising the distal pocket may have undergone positive selection as the receptors evolved to recognize amino acids with different side chains. To test these ideas, we performed a site-by-site analysis of dN/dS ratios using the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A p value derived from a two-tailed extended binomial distribution was used to assess significance at each site. Tests on simulated data (S.L.K. Pond and S.D.W. Frost, methods available in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]) show that p values less than or equal to 0.1 identify nearly all true positives with a false positive rate generally below the nominal p value; for actual data, the number of true positives at a given false positive rate is lower.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> shows the probability for each codon site being under positive or negative selection (dN/dS values different than dN/dS = 1.0) on a snake plot of a representative OlfC amino acid sequence, OlfCa1. By this analysis, only one site, M436 in OlfCa1, appears to be under positive selection (dN/dS &#x0003e;1 with p &#x0003c; 0.1). It is unclear what role this position may play in receptor function. Based on existing models of C family GPCR structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], this site resides within or near the hinge of the ligand-binding clamshell. The apparent positive selection acting on this site may therefore indicate its importance in modulating some aspect of ligand binding or receptor activation. It is also possible that the identification of this site represents a false positive from this analysis.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Sites under positive and negative selection in OlfC coding sequences</bold>.

Interestingly, many (but not all) of the predicted distal pocket sites appear to be under relaxed or neutral selection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These results are also shown overlaid on the structural model for OlfCa1 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In this representation, surface residues predicted to interact with the bound ligand's glycine moiety show clear evidence of negative selection (dN/dS &#x0003c; 1 with p &#x0003c; 0.1), whereas those lining the distal pocket show a relaxation of this negative selection (p &#x0003e; 0.1). Together these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the proximal pocket sites are under strong purifying selection, which has maintained the ability of the OlfC receptors to bind amino acid ligands. The apparent relaxation of negative selection on distal pocket sites may reflect the adaptation of these receptors to recognize different amino acids or their derivatives.</p><p>Overall, our site-by-site analysis of dN/dS ratios reveals a striking absence of sites exhibiting signs of positive selection. This may be due to the dominating influence of negative or purifying selection throughout the receptor coding region. Alternatively, since non-synonymous substitutions are thought to occur only sporadically over evolutionary time, the signatures of less recent substitutions may no longer be evident. In addition, the power to detect adaptive evolutionary events at the level of individual codons decreases in proportion to the time since the event occurred due to saturation by synonymous substitutions. Thus, our inability to detect such events may indicate that they occurred early in the evolution of this gene family.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We describe here a comprehensive analysis of the OlfC receptor family &#x02013; the repertoire of C family GPCRs expressed in the zebrafish olfactory system. Fifty four intact genes comprise this family, which by phylogenetic analysis is distinct from other C family GPCRs. A comparison with OlfC receptors identified in fugu suggests that the 25 present-day subfamilies identified in zebrafish and fugu probably existed in the most recent common ancestor of the cyprinid and pufferfish lineages. Interestingly, the major group of fish OlfC receptors is distinct from the mammalian vomeronasal V2R receptors, suggesting that these two groups of genes evolved to accommodate different chemosensory cues and/or physiological functions in the fish and mammalian lineages. Consistent with this notion, our analysis of sequence conservation and selective pressure indicates that the zebrafish OlfC family retains a binding pocket signature motif common to all amino acid receptors characterized to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; this signature motif is similarly conserved in the fugu OlfC receptors. Thus, the fish OlfC receptors likely evolved to allow the detection and discrimination of amino acids, which are potent olfactory cues for teleost fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. By way of contrast, the amino acid-binding signature motif is not present in the vast majority of V2R receptors, suggesting that the mammalian V2R receptors became specialized to detect chemosensory cues of a chemical composition different from amino acids. The present results lay the foundation for future studies aimed at elucidating the ligand specificities and structure-function relationships of individual OlfC receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Iterative data mining</title><p>Genome-wide searches of the second (Zv2) and third (Zv3) draft zebrafish genome assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] were performed several times using the predicted OlfCs from each previous round to increase our querying power.

Protein translations of the predicted genes were aligned with ClustalW. In order to determine appropriate start and stop codons as well as correct mis-predicted intron-exon junctions, we visually inspected the genomic sequence in conjunction with the alignment of the translations. High quality predictions, defined as unambiguous well-aligned splice junctions and ungapped genomic sequence, were used in the next iteration (TBLASTN, HMM construction, Genewise prediction, hand annotation). Final mapping of genes to the Zv6 assembly was performed using Exonerate 1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] to align the predicted CDS sequences against the genome sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Alignment and tree construction</title><p>For multiple alignments of OlfC genes, MAFFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] was run with the "localpair" option (all pairwise local alignment information is provided to the objective function) and a maximum of 1000 iterations. Gaps were inspected manually and edited in XCED. Both MAFFT 5.0 and XCED are available in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. The sequence segments corresponding to the signal peptide (up to the first conserved cysteine residue) and C-terminal tails were trimmed for all alignments. The neighbor-joining algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] as implemented by PFAAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]) was used to generate unrooted phylogenetic trees from these alignments using the BLOSUM 50 similarity matrix; positions with greater than 50% gaps were excluded. One thousand bootstraps were performed to assess the support at each tree node. Maximum likelihood analysis was carried out using PHYML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]) on the same processed amino acid alignments described above. Bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates was carried out using the JTT model of amino acid substitution. The consensus tree including bootstrap support for each node was plotted for each dataset using either ATV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]) or <italic>unrooted </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>] (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]).
