We identified the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), whose RNA level increased as a gene product particularly sensitive to the variation of the level of glucose in culture media. We investigated the kinesis of the TXNIP RNA and protein in response to glucose and the relationship between this protein and the related thioredoxin (TRX) in regulating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MDA-MB-231 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>MDA-MB-231 cells were grown either in 5 or 20 mM glucose chronically prior to plating. For glucose shift (5/20), cells were plated in 5 mM glucose and shifted to 20 mM at time 0. Cells were analyzed with Affymetrix Human U133A microarray chip and gene expression profile was obtained. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot was used to validate the expression of TXNIP RNA and protein in response to glucose, respectively. ROS were detected by CM-H2DCFDA (5&#x02013;6-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) and measured for mean fluorescence intensity with flow cytometry.

The increased level of TXNIP RNA is followed by increased level of protein that is associated with increasing levels of ROS and reduced TRX activity. The inhibition of the glucose transporter GLUT1 by phloretin notably reduces TXNIP RNA level and the inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase activity by SB203580 reverses the effects of TXNIP on ROS-TRX activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we show that TXNIP is an oxidative stress responsive gene and its expression is exquisitely regulated by glucose level in highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>We have recently described the gene expression profile (GEP) of the highly metastatic breast cancer-derived MDA-MB-231 cells in response to hyperglycemia <italic>in vitro </italic>tissue culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Among all the RNAs that showed significant changes in response to increased level of glucose, the level of RNA of the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), also known as vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>up-regulated protein-1 (VDUP-1) was one of the most representatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The emphasis on the role of both insulin and insulin-like growth factors 1 (IGF-1) or IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), together with the insulin-mediated regulation of fat distribution, availability of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and sex hormones in the regulation of proliferation and growth of breast derived cells, has undermined the relevance of glucose by itself in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

To assess whether p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway affected hyperglycemia-regulated TXNIP/TRX/ROS axis, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with 20 &#x003bc;M of the specific kinase inhibitor SB203580. As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, TXNIP RNA level significantly dropped from 1.81 &#x000b1; 0.14 to 0.94 &#x000b1; 0.09 (p &#x0003c; 0.05) concordantly with the decreased ROS level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, from 38.5 &#x000b1; 0.4 to 11.8 &#x000b1; 0.2; p &#x0003c; 0.05). On the other hand, TRX activity significantly increased with the inhibitor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, from 0.320 &#x000b1; 0.02 to 0.581 &#x000b1; 0.04, p &#x0003c; 0.05). These data favor the functional relevance of p38 MAP kinase in metastatic breast-cancer derived cells MDA-MB-231 similarly to ASMCs as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that the metabolic condition of hyperglycemia affects the level of both TXNIP RNA and protein in breast-cancer derived cells MDA-MB-231. Thus the persistent elevation of TXNIP protein is strictly correlated with the persistency of the elevation of the glucose level and is very sensitive to its magnitude. In our cellular model, we have reproduced the conditions of postprandial hyperglycemia by shifting the glucose level from 5 to 20 mM and the conditions of insulin-resistant hyperglycemia (diabetes) by maintaining the cells "chronically" and stably at 20 mM glucose. We show that hyperglycemia by itself has a major impact on both the level of TXNIP and the regulation of ROS level/TRX activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. The regulation of TXNIP RNA level is related to the intracellular level of glucose and is notably reduced by the inhibition of the glucose transport. In fact, the increased uptake of glucose is relevant in regulating this function as demonstrated by the inhibition of the glucose transporter. Although phloretin did not completely inhibit the glucose-effect, the compound notably reduced TXNIP RNA. This observation may be explained by the presence of other GLUT proteins responsible for the glucose transport not inhibited by phloretin (<italic>e.g</italic>., compare 5 mM vs 20 mM in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) as previously shown in breast cancer-derived cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the statistically significant reduction of TXNIP RNA obtained with phloretin-mediated inhibition of the major glucose transporter GLUT1 present in MDA-MB-231 cells supports the relevance of the intracellular glucose in the regulation of the TXNIP expression in MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><p>These data validate GEP reported by us and others that TXNIP represents a gene whose regulation is highly sensitive to glucose levels in metastatic breast cancer-derived MDA-MB-231 cells and in murine pancreatic &#x003b2; cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We also show that the regulation of the TXNIP/TRX/ROS axis is associated with p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway. These data are in agreement with previous observations in different cell models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, considering that MDA-MB-231 cells may have an increased baseline "hyperactive" MAP kinase activity due to ras-oncogene protein family dysregulation, the functional relevance of p38 MAP kinase in this and other breast cancer-derived cell lines needs to be further explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As shown herein, TXNIP-inhibiting TRX activity is highly regulated by glucose, hitherto we suggest that this protein may play a major role in translating the biological consequences of a metabolic condition such as diabetes in cancer biology. Recent studies have related the effect of hyperglycemia to increased generation of ROS and to greater DNA oxidative damage as main mechanism of accelerated aging and atherogenesis in the microangiopathic complications of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although the relevance of diabetes in the pathogenesis and clinical course of tumors in general and particularly of breast cancer has been controversially debated, we illustrate for the first time in this context the molecular relationship between hyperglycemia and increased ROS production in a cancerous cellular model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Our study opens new avenues for the investigation of the consequences of the described hyperglycemia-TXNIP-TRX-ROS axis on susceptibility to oxidative stress in oncogenesis and tumor progression. Although it has been proven that exogenous overexpression of TXNIP suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, it has only been more recently that apoptosis and "glucotoxicity" have been related through TXNIP in murine pancreatic &#x003b2; cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, in the current exploratory study, we did not address the ultimate effect of hyperglycemia-mediated TXNIP expression on apoptosis. Furthermore, it has been shown that glucose consumption rate is lower in non-invasive MCF-7 cells versus metastatic breast cancer-derived MDA-MB-231 cells used in the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Gatenby et al. showed that up-regulation of glycolysis leads to microenvironmental acidosis as an evolutionary mechanism for the metastatic cell to adapt to the acidic microenvironment and promote proliferation and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although the adaptive mechanism was well described, the question whether hyperglycemia represents a favorable or unfavorable condition for the cancerous cell that highly depends upon glycolysis was not posed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Hitherto, future studies are warranted to assess whether hyperglycemia-induced TXNIP/TRX/ROS biology is a prerogative of MDA-MB-231 cells or it extends to other breast cancer-derived cell lines independently from their hormonal receptor status (estrogen receptors) or signaling pathways (ras mutations, p38 MAKP milieu, etc.). Although various studies have recently addressed the relevance of TXNIP in cancer biology, our study is the first one relating this protein to metabolic conditions of hyperglycemia/diabetes and oxidative stress in the same context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Even though the incompleteness of this exploratory work that was meant to validate the preliminary findings of increased level of TXNIP observed in GEP in response to hyperglycemia hampers the understanding of the ultimate consequence of increased ROS for the growth of tumor cells in the metabolic conditions of hyperglycemia, we are confident that further investigative work will lead to the identification of the molecular mechanisms relating diabetes to cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Conclusively, we show that hyperglycemia finely regulates the expression of TXNIP in breast-derived cancer cells MDA-MB-231. The increased level of the protein leads to increased ROS levels through TRX reduced activity that is reversed by p38 MAP kinase inhibition. We describe an important signaling pathway that might be involved in diabetes-mediated oxidative stress in cancer. Our findings support further investigation in this perspective.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>Gene array profile (GPE); Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP); Vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>up-regulated protein-1 (VDUP-1); Insulin-like growth factors 1 (IGF-1); IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs); Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG); Carbohydrate response elements (ChoRE); Thioredoxin (TRX); Reactive oxygen species (ROS); 5&#x02013;6-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA); Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1); aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs).</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FT has planned the project, designed the experimental plan and drafted the manuscript.
