Several hundred thousand humans are infected with African sleeping sickness, but this number would be much higher if not for a natural defense molecule found in human blood. The trypanosome lytic factor (TLF) is a minor subclass of high-density lipoprotein that contains two proteins found only in primates, apolipoprotein L-1 and haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr). In this paper, we show that Hpr contributes to TLF toxicity to trypanosomes because it binds hemoglobin (Hb). We found that when Hb is bound to TLF, it is rapidly taken up by the parasite and activated within the acidic environment of the parasite's digestive organelle, the lysosome. Within the lysosome, Hb releases iron, inducing a chemical reaction that produces free radicals that damage membranes and contributes to trypanosome killing. Usually, free Hb is rapidly cleared from the circulation of mammals because of the organ damage free Hb can cause. Trypanosome infection results in breakage of red blood cells and the release of large amounts of Hb. We postulate that trypanosome infection causes increased vascular levels of Hb, resulting in the formation of TLF&#x02013;Hb complexes that may be important in &#x0201c;arming&#x0201d; the human innate immune system to clear the circulation of certain African trypanosomes.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Widener J, Nielsen MJ, Shiflett A, Moestrup SK, Hajduk S (2007) Hemoglobin is a co-factor of human trypanosome lytic factor.

Hb was absent from TLF purified from freshly collected human plasma using a gentle immunoabsorption protocol. Nevertheless, Hb bound to purified native Hpr, as well as TLF, with high-affinity and stimulated <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> killing in vitro. The association of Hb with Hpr significantly increased TLF binding to <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>. Furthermore, both an iron chelator and a free radical scavenger inhibited cell lysis, suggesting a direct role for Hb-derived iron in <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> killing by TLF.

Unlike the &#x0201c;two-step&#x0201d; method that initially uses high-salt density ultracentrifugation followed by immunoaffinity chromatography to purify TLF, the one-step method eliminates the possible loss of apolipoproteins during the high-salt centrifugation step &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. These methods allowed us to make two comparisons: First, a comparison of proteins purified by the one-step purification protocol with proteins purified by the two-step purification protocol. Second, it allowed us to compare the composition of TLF purified by the one-step purification method using antibodies to ApoL-1 or Hpr.</p><p>Previous analysis of the protein composition of TLF, purified by the two-step procedure, demonstrated the presence of ApoA-1, ApoL-1, Hpr dimer, and Hpr tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030129-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Comparison of proteins purified by the two procedures by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis showed that the protein compositions were similar in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030129-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This shows that high-salt density ultracentrifugation used in the two-step protocol does not dramatically change the protein composition of the TLF particle. Two differences were noticed. First, the ratio of Hpr dimer to tetramer was higher in samples purified using the single-step immunoabsorption method. Second, there was a reduction in sub-stoichiometric proteins in preparations of TLF purified by the two-step purification method. Specifically, a significant amount of Hp, albumin, and transferrin was detected by SDS-PAGE, western blotting, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the one-step purified material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030129-g001">Figure 1</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030129-g001">1</xref>C, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0030129-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The protein composition of samples purified by anti-Hpr or anti-ApoL-1 absorption was indistinguishable. The similar ratio of Hpr and ApoL-1, in the samples purified with anti-Hpr and anti-ApoL-1, indicates that most serum Hpr and ApoL-1 are assembled into the same HDL. The major proteins present in samples purified by anti-ApoA-1 immunoaffinity chromatography were ApoA-1, Hp, and transferrin.

The increased lytic activity of the samples purified by the two-step procedure may be due to the increased purity of these samples.

Prior to lysis, dextrans were seen throughout the cytoplasm indicating that TLF&#x02013;Hb caused the lysosomal membrane to breakdown, releasing the large fluorescein-conjugated dextrans. Based on the pharmacological inhibition of TLF&#x02013;Hb killing by deferiprone and DPPD, we postulate that membrane lipid peroxidation plays a major role in lysosomal membrane breakdown followed by cell lysis. This does not argue against a role of ApoL-1 in TLF killing of <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b025">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

In vitro studies reported here leave little doubt that Hb association with Hpr enhances TLF binding to and killing of <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>. However, when TLF is isolated from normal human donors, Hb is absent. This apparent paradox can be explained when one carefully considers the early physiological events associated with trypanosome infection. During infection of animals by African trypanosomes, there is substantial hemolysis, and in some cases, the hematocrit can drop by as much as 50&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b042">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. The exact cause of hemolysis is not known, but blood cell production increases during infection, so the decrease in hematocrit is not due to decreased erythrocyte production but rather to hemolysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Hemolysis results in the release of large quantities of Hb, most of which will be bound and removed by circulating Hp &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. During a trypanosome-induced acute phase response in calves, levels of Hp are reduced to undetectable levels 8 d post-infection, presumably due to removal of Hp from the circulation after Hp&#x02013;Hb complexes have formed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. In mice, Hp levels initially increase after trypanosome infection, and then decline &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Consistent with the studies in animals, human trypanosome infections also result in substantial hemolysis and release of free Hb &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. While Hp initially binds all free Hb, the clearance of the Hp&#x02013;Hb complex would result in a significant drop in Hp levels to the point where Hpr would become a major Hb-binding protein. Thus, as Hp levels decrease and TLF&#x02013;Hb levels increase, there may be a substantial stimulation of TLF activity.</p><p>A second factor may influence the formation of TLF&#x02013;Hb complexes in the circulation of humans. Previous studies have reported the incidence of both genetic and phenotypic ahaptoglobinemia in African populations, perhaps due to reduced severity of malaria infection in Hp-negative individuals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b051">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. In some regions where malarial infections are prevalent, the frequency of ahaptoglobinemic individuals can be as high as 48&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. In these individuals, Hpr-associated TLF could be the primary Hb-binding protein.</p><p>We have previously postulated that ApoL-1 and Hpr act synergistically in <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> killing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030129-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. We now propose an avenue by which TLF activity is increased when Hpr and ApoL-1 are present in the same HDL particle. First, Hb binding to TLF stimulates endocytosis of TLF&#x02013;Hb by increased receptor affinity. Second, TLF&#x02013;Hb provides iron that initiates Fenton chemistry, leading to lysosomal membrane breakdown while ApoL-1 forms pores in membranes, disrupting the ability of the cell to regulate osmosis.</p><p>The results presented here support the hypothesis that formation of the Hpr&#x02013;Hb complex within the TLF particle plays a role in human serum killing of <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>. Hb seems to induce increased binding of TLF to the parasite and contributes directly to toxicity in the lysosome. This suggests that parasite-induced hemolysis stimulates innate immunity against the parasite in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Human serum preparation and immunoaffinity chromatography.</title><p>Blood was collected from healthy human volunteers and was maintained on ice or at 4 &#x000b0;C throughout the fractionation procedure.
