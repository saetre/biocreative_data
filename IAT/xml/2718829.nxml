In the cortex, Sez-6 plays a role in specifying dendritic branching patterns and excitatory synapse numbers during development.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The distribution pattern of Sez-6 in the retina was studied using a polyclonal antibody that detects the multiple isoforms of Sez-6. Prominent immunostaining was detected in GABAergic, but not in AII glycinergic, amacrine cell subpopulations of the rat and mouse retina. Amacrine cell somata displayed a distinct staining pattern with the Sez-6 antibody: a discrete, often roughly triangular-shaped bright spot positioned between the nucleus and the apical dendrite superimposed over weaker general cytoplasmic staining. Displaced amacrines in the ganglion cell layer were also positive for Sez-6 and weaker staining was occasionally observed in neurons with the morphology of alpha ganglion cells. Two distinct Sez-6 positive strata were present in the inner plexiform layer in addition to generalized punctate staining. Certain inner nuclear layer cells, including bipolar cells, stained more weakly and diffusely than amacrine cells, although some bipolar cells exhibited a perinuclear &#x0201c;bright spot&#x0201d; similar to amacrine cells. In order to assess the role of Sez-6 in the retina, we analyzed the morphology of the Sez-6 knockout mouse retina with immunohistochemical markers and compared ganglion cell dendritic arbor patterning in Sez-6 null retinae with controls. The functional importance of Sez-6 was assessed by dark-adapted paired-flash electroretinography (ERG).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we have reported the detailed expression pattern of a novel retinal marker with broad cell specificity, useful for retinal characterization in rodent experimental models. Retinal morphology, ganglion cell dendritic branching and ERG waveforms appeared normal in the Sez-6 knockout mouse suggesting that, in spite of widespread expression of Sez-6, retinal function in the absence of Sez-6 is not affected.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Seizure-related gene 6 (<italic>sez-6</italic>) is expressed in the developing and adult mouse brain and retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Gunnersen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Blackshaw1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> in addition to other neural tissues.

Two protein isoforms (Sez-6 type I and type II) are cell-surface proteins tethered by a single transmembrane domain while the third, Sez6 type III, is a secreted protein identical to the amino terminal sequences of type I and type II except for 18 C-terminal amino acids.

Using established cell-type specific markers we compared retinal morphology and composition in Sez-6 wild-type and knockout mice. Dendritic arbor patterning of retinal ganglion cells was examined in the Sez-6 knockout line crossed with a Thy1-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) transgenic mouse line.

Briefly, animals were anaesthetized following overnight dark adaptation with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (50&#x02236;10 mg/kg). Corneas were anaesthetized with topical 0.5&#x00025; proxymetacaine (Ophthetic, Allergan, Frenchs Forest, New South Wales, Australia) and pupils dilated with 0.5&#x00025; tropicamide (Mydriacyl; Allergan, Frenchs Forest, New South Wales, Australia). Full-field flash ERGs were recorded with stainless steel electrodes (active &#x02013; cornea, inactive &#x02013; mouth, reference - tail). Responses were amplified (gain&#x000d7;5000; &#x02013;3 dB at 1 Hz and 1 kHz, ADInstruments, USA) and digitized at 10 kHz over a 200 ms epoch. The stimulus was a commercial photographic flash unit (Metz Mecablitz 60CT4) delivered via a Ganzfeld sphere, and stimulus energy was attenuated by the addition of neutral density filters. Signals were collected over three light intensities (1.4, 1.7 and 2.0 log cd s m<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>). Cone and rod contributions to the ERG waveform were isolated via a paired-flash protocol as described in Phipps et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Phipps1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Phipps2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This involved two flashes presented in succession with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 0.8 s. The short ISI ensures that rod responses have not recovered when the second flash is presented, resulting in a cone only response to the second flash. Rod contributions were isolated by subtraction of the cone waveform from the mixed rod/cone ERG waveform (signal collected from the first flash).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>ERG component analysis</title><p>Photoreceptor function was assessed by modelling the leading edge of the a-wave (PIII model) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Phipps2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, using a modified version of the Hood and Birch model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Hood1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006546.e001"/></disp-formula>where PIII gives the summed photocurrent as a function of luminous exposure <italic>i</italic> (cd.s.m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and time, <italic>t</italic> (in seconds).

In addition, a sub-population of retinal ganglion cells morphologically similar to alpha RGC's (or subtype A1 in the classification of Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Sun1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>) was detected with the Sez-6 antibody (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006546-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>;). Interestingly, the discrete brighter staining in bipolar and ganglion cells was also positioned in an apical orientation with respect to the nucleus. Bipolar cell apical dendrites were positive for Sez-6 and the OPL was stained significantly more in wild-type retina than the low level non-specific staining observed in this layer in Sez-6 knockout retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006546-g002">Fig. 2A,E cf. 2C</xref>). The distinct perinuclear staining pattern of Sez-6 in amacrine and bipolar cells was reminiscent of that observed by others using an antibody to the 58 kDa resident protein of the trans-Golgi network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Morgans1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine whether Sez-6 was localized to the Golgi apparatus, we conducted double-staining for Sez-6 and a marker of the cis-Golgi network, GM130 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Although labelling was observed in essentially the same cell populations, we observed little sub-cellular colocalization of these two markers (data not shown).</p><p>Further characterization of Sez-6 expression was subsequently carried out in the rat retina to facilitate double-immunostaining of Sez-6 with a range of well-characterized markers that are unique to specific retinal subpopulations. In rat retinal sections immunostained for GABA and Sez-6, a significant proportion of amacrines in the INL and displaced amacrines in the GCL exhibited double staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006546-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, asterisks). Interestingly, while all GABAergic amacrines in the INL were Sez-6 positive, we observed Sez-6 immunoreactive amacrines in the INL that were GABA negative and, in some cases these appeared to be aligned with Sez-6 positive/GABA negative cells in the GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006546-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, arrowheads). Some cells in the middle to upper region of the INL displayed weaker GABA staining and these more weakly-staining neurons were also Sez-6 positive. In the IPL, two broad bands of GABA-immunoreactive processes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006546-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, square brackets). The inner band was found to overlay one of the distinct Sez-6 positive strata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006546-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, lower horizontal bar) while the second stratum displaying more intense Sez-6 reactivity was flanked by the GABA-positive regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006546-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, upper horizontal bar). Thus, there are neuronal processes containing Sez-6 that are clearly GABA-negative, consistent with our observation that some amacrine cell somata show the same profile.</p><fig id="pone-0006546-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006546.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Immunostaining for Sez-6 and retinal subtype markers.</title><p>Rat retina vertical sections double stained for Sez-6 (red) and (in green): (A) GABA &#x02013; non-GABAergic amacrine and putative displaced amacrine cells are marked (arrowheads) while double-labelled amacrine cells are marked with asterisks.

Since Sez-6 is expressed in bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells as well as amacrine cells, we reasoned that lack of Sez-6 could affect the extent and/or branching of ganglion cell dendritic arbors by altering inputs to these cells. We analysed dendritic arborization of retinal ganglion cells (labelled with YFP) in flat mounted retinae from Sez-6 WT and KO mice crossed with Thy1-YFP line H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006546-g005">Fig. 5A &#x00026; B</xref>; 6 retinae per genotype).

Sez-6 is expressed most strongly in amacrine cells and labels most, if not all, GABAergic amacrines with a characteristic punctate pattern. This distribution of Sez-6 immunostaining, in an intense spot positioned apically to the nucleus, was reminiscent of the pattern obtained with the cis-Golgi apparatus marker, GM130 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> although we did not observe overlap of the Sez-6 staining pattern with that of GM-130. A very similar apical &#x0201c;cap&#x0201d; staining pattern has also been reported for soluble guanylate cyclase in cortical pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Polleux1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The significance of this observation is not clear although it is interesting to note that soluble guanylate cyclase/cyclic GMP signaling is involved in neuron polarization and oriented dendritic outgrowth during development.</p><p>As described above, not all Sez-6 positive amacrine cells were GABAergic. Additionally, the central region of the IPL contained Sez-6 positive processes flanked by the two broad strata labelled with GABA. From these observations, we conclude that Sez-6 also labels a population of glycinergic amacrine cells. As AII amacrine cells are the most abundant glycinergic subtype in the rat retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Menger1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, we investigated whether Sez-6 was expressed in this subtype (marked by parvalbumin staining) however we observed no co-localization of Sez-6 and parvalbumin in AII amacrine cells. Nevertheless, Sez-6 may serve as a useful marker of amacrine cells in the rodent retina as it is expressed by the majority of GABAergic amacrine subtypes and some (non-AII) glycinergic amacrine cells. Additionally, the Sez-6 antibody weakly labelled other neuronal cell types including bipolar and horizontal cells although specific Sez-6 immunostaining was notably absent from photoreceptors.</p><p>Given the range of retinal cell types expressing Sez-6 and the role Sez-6 plays in shaping the dendritic arbor and excitatory connectivity in cortical pyramidal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Gunnersen2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, it was surprising that ERG analyses failed to reveal any functional consequences of Sez-6 absence in the retina. As a mass electrical potential, the ERG trace represents the summed activity of the entire retinal circuitry. It is therefore possible that single cell electrophysiological analysis would be required to detect putative functional abnormalities in subsets of amacrine cells that may arise from Sez-6 gene inactivation. Examples in the literature of normal ERG responses in gene knockout mice include the G-substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Nakazawa1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, mouse retinal degeneration B2 (rdgB2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Lu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>) and transthyretin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Bui2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> null mouse lines. Like Sez-6, G-substrate and rdgB2 are expressed in subsets of amacrine and ganglion cells. The normal ERG responses in the rdgB2 and transthyretin knockout mice were attributed to likely functional compensation mechanisms and this explanation could well apply to the results obtained here. Sez-6 is a member of a gene family and the two closest family members (Sez6L and Sez-6 L2) are also expressed in eye (according to expressed sequence tag expression profiles and the GENSAT database). The developmental profiles of Sez-6 and Sez6L2 mRNA expression in the retina, revealed by in situ hybridization, are highly similar (see Table S5 Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Blackshaw1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>; Sez6L2 is also known as Psk-1). Therefore, it seems likely that one or more Sez-6 family members can functionally compensate for the lack of Sez-6 in the retina.</p><p>Activity-mediated interactions between RGCs and bipolar and amacrine cells are known to be important for maturation of the RGC dendritic arbor, including the pruning of branches to form ON or OFF sublaminae in the IPL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Lohmann1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Wong1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Tian1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the expression of Sez-6 in amacrine cells as well as weaker expression in bipolar and ganglion cells, we had hypothesized that the dendritic patterning of the ganglion cells themselves may be altered in Sez-6 knockout mouse retina. We were unable to detect any gross abnormalities in retinal morphology or in the dendritic arborization patterns of large-field retinal ganglion cells in Sez-6 knockout mice. In this study, we did not specifically examine whether the developmental pruning of bistratified to monostratified RGC dendritic arbors might be delayed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Tian1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> although this question would be well worth investigating in future <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006546-Mumm1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we have determined that Sez-6 is broadly expressed in the retina with a strong and characteristic staining pattern in amacrine cells. Despite this widespread expression, the absence of Sez-6 did not appear to result in morphological or functional abnormalities. Future studies that address Sez-6 redundancy and functional compensation by other members of the gene family will throw additional light on the function of Sez-6.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The
