In standard broiler breeders hens genetically selected for high growth rate the reproductive function is clearly dysfunctional. Feed restriction is needed during reproductive development to limit the formation of excessive numbers of ovarian yellow follicles arranged in multiple hierarchies. To determine whether leptin is involved in the nutritional and reproductive interactions controlling follicular hierarchy in hens, blood leptin levels and ovarian expression of the leptin receptor mRNA were determined during follicle maturation in three chicken lines; a slow growing broiler "Label" genotype without reproductive dysfunction, a fast growing "Standard" genotype fed ad libitum or restricted and a fast growing "Experimental" line with intermediate reproductive performance levels. Whereas expression of the leptin receptor mRNA did not change in the theca, it clearly decreased with follicular differentiation in the granulosa of slow growing hens. In fast growing standard hens fed ad libitum and presenting significant reproductive dysfunction, the decrease was disrupted and dramatic up-regulation of granulosa cell expression of the leptin receptor was observed. On the other hand, feed restriction decreased the overall level of expression of the leptin receptor mRNA and restored the decrease with follicular growth. The level of expression of the leptin receptor probably modulates the action of leptin on follicular differentiation. Since blood leptin and other metabolic factors were not affected by the genotype or by nutritional state, the factors involved in the regulation of leptin receptor gene expression remain to be determined. This study demonstrates the involvement of leptin in the nutritional control of reproduction in birds. Leptin action on the ovary probably controls follicular hierarchy through the regulation of steroidogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The ovary of the mature hen contains a hierarchy of yellow yolky follicles and several thousand smaller follicles from which the large yolky follicles are recruited. The yellow follicles are arranged in a size hierarchy and are committed to ovulation. In each follicle, the granulosa cells are surrounded by theca tissue and are separated from it by a basement membrane. Each compartment of the largest yellow follicles (theca and granulosa cells) can be anatomically separated to follow the individual functions of these two ovarian compartments in follicle growth and differentiation. At an early stage of follicular development the small ovarian follicles produce estrogens and androgens. As follicles begin to sequester yolk their production of estrogens from theca cells decreases to become very low at ovulation. As follicles are recruited into the yolky follicular hierarchy, estrogen and androgen production by theca cells diminishes and production of progesterone by granulosa cells increases. The largest F1 yellow follicle then attains the highest progesterone production at the time of ovulation.</p><p>In most domestic animals, reproductive function is considerably affected by nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Various hormones, including growth hormone, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and insulin, have been proposed as potential mediators affecting reproductive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, the interactions between the reproductive endocrine axis and the metabolic axis have not been clearly determined. Leptin represents also a good candidate for such reproductive-metabolic interactions. Leptin, the protein hormone synthesized and secreted mainly by adipose tissue, has primarily been shown to regulate food intake and energy expenditure (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). Recent studies have demonstrated that leptin may also be involved in the regulation of reproductive mechanisms in human and rat ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Exogenous leptin can rescue reproductive function in ob/ob leptin-deficient mice that are not only obese but also infertile. This leptin action is independent from weight loss since feed restriction in ob/ob female mice fails to restore fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Leptin can also advance the onset of puberty or at least reverse the delay caused by feed restriction in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In chickens, leptin attenuates the negative effects of fasting on ovarian function. Injections of leptin during fasting delays cessation of egg laying, attenuates regression of yellow hierarchical follicles, alters ovarian steroidogenesis and limits apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Leptin exerts its effect by binding to a receptor which belongs to the cytokine receptor super-family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The chicken leptin receptor has been cloned and sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Its expression at the level of the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] suggests that leptin might act directly on the ovary to regulate chicken reproductive function.</p><p>Standard broiler breeders have been submitted to high selection pressure on growth and feed efficiency. Male traits have been favoured resulting in poorer reproductive performances of the hens. As a result of such selection, broiler breeder hens are subject to metabolic disorders and reproductive dysfunction. Overfeeding during reproductive development is associated with the formation of excessive numbers of ovarian yellow follicles which can be arranged in multiple hierarchies, with increased production of unsettable eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Severe feed restriction during rearing reduces the production of yellow follicles, the incidence of double ovulation and considerably improves the laying rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Up-regulation of yellow follicles has been related to excessive recruitment and rapid growth rate of follicles to maturity, especially under ad libitum feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the mechanisms that regulate these processes are still not fully explained.</p><p>This study investigated the potential involvement of leptin and its receptor in ovarian abnormalities observed in broiler breeder hens fed ad libitum. We aimed to determine the evolution of leptin receptor gene expression in both granulosa and theca cells from the four largest yellow follicles of 32 week-old hens during the laying period. The effects of genotype and diet on plasma leptin levels and ovarian expression of the leptin receptor gene were also quantified. For this purpose standard broiler breeder hens fed ad libitum or feed-restricted were compared to a French "Label" genotype and a dwarf "Experimental" line. Compared to fast growing standard broiler breeders, the French "Label" is a dwarf, slow-growing broiler genotype and the "Experimental" line is a dwarf genotype with a growth potential of progeny chicks close to that of the standard broiler chicks. The "Experimental" line is specifically selected for reproductive traits and viability at partial expenses of growth performances. The "Label" line tolerates ad libitum feeding of breeders and does not have reproductive problems under ad libitum feeding whereas the &#x000ab;Experimental&#x000bb; line can be fed ad libitum on a low energy diet during the growing period but presents more reproductive problems than the Label genotype but less than the standard genotype fed ad libitum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Three lines of broiler breeder hens supplied by Hubbard primary breeder (Chateaubourg, France) were used in this experiment. The S line is a standard fast growing broiler, the French Label (L) line is a slow growing broiler breeder strain used for the quality market and the experimental (E) line is a broiler breeder strain bearing the "dw" dwarf gene. This strain has a decreased need for rationing. S and L hens were given the same regime in accordance with Hubbard nutritional recommendations (2724 kcal/kg) in fine meal form. During the growing period (0&#x02013;20 weeks), half of the S hens were feed restricted (SR) on the same diet in order to match a reference body weight curve provided par Hubbard primary breeder, the other half (SA) and all the L hens were fed ad libitum. The feed intake was equivalent to 37% of the SA group up to point of lay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A special diet was designed for the E hens, consisting of a series of finely ground meal diets with a lower energy content (2550 kcal/kg). The interest of the E group is mainly practical, it represents an actual alternative for severely restricted standard broiler breeder hens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Transition between the grower and breeder feed occurred at 20 weeks of age for the ad libitum-fed hens (L, SA and E). Transition occurred at the beginning of laying for the restricted hens that were then allowed ad libitum access to food.</p><p>At 32 weeks of age, blood samples were collected from 12 hens of each experimental group (SA, SR, E and L) and six hens were sacrificed by an overdose of pentobarbital (Sanofi-Sant&#x000e9; Animale, Libourne, France). The ovaries and liver were immediately removed. Granula and theca compartments from the first (F1), second (F2), third (F3) and fourth (F4) largest ovarian yellow follicles were dissected as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Since SA birds presented a greater average number of yellow follicles per ovary (9.36, 8,00, 7.42, and 6.33 yellow follicles/ovary for the SA, SR, E and L hens respectively) and a higher proportion of pairs of yellow ovarian follicles undergoing simultaneous development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], follicles were assigned to the same follicular rank when the difference of weight between two follicles was of 0.4 g or less. In that case, one follicle per pair was collected and dissected. Tissues were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until used for total RNA extraction. This experiment was carried out with due regard to the legislation governing ethical treatment of animals, and investigators were certificated by the French government to carry out animal experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and leptin receptor RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from liver, granulosa and theca cells using RNA InstaPure (Eurogentec, Angers, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

Five microliters of cDNA dilution was added to the PCR Master Mix to a final volume of 25 &#x003bc;l. The following PCR protocol was used on the ABI Prism 7000 apparatus (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France): initial denaturation (10 min at 95&#x000b0;C), followed by a two-step amplification program (15 sec at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C) repeated 40 times. Quantification was performed using ABI integrated software as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. 18S ribosomal RNA was chosen as the reference gene. The level of 18S RNA was determined using the Pre-developed TaqMan Ribosomal RNA control kit (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The results were expressed as the leptin receptor mRNA/18S RNA ratio. Each PCR run included a no template control and replicates of control and unknown samples.

Since leptin receptor mRNA levels did not follow a normal distribution (skewness of 5.48 and Kurtosis of 32.88), they were log transformed. The resulting distribution was closer to the normality with skewness of 0.87 and kurtosis of 0.69. Variance analysis was performed on transformed data.</p><p>As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, expression of leptin receptor mRNA in granulosa cells from the L genotype clearly decreased as the follicle developed. Significant statistical differences were measured between hierarchical yellow follicles at each stage. In the E line, expression of the leptin receptor mRNA decreased between F4 and F1 yellow follicles. However the high variability of the expression of leptin receptor mRNA in F4 follicles prevented the decrease from reaching statistical significance. Compared to the L line, the level of expression of the leptin receptor in the granulosa cells was lower in the E group, especially for the F4 and F3 yellow follicles but statistical significance was reached only for the F4 follicles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In the S line fed ad libitum, expression of the leptin receptor in the granulosa was dramatically up-regulated. This up-regulation was clearly evident in F4 F3 and F1 follicles. Wide variability was also observed in F4 and F3 follicles. Feed restriction of the standard hens (SR) induced a general decrease in the expression of leptin receptor mRNA. The overall level of expression of the leptin receptor mRNA measured in the SR line was similar to that observed in the L and E lines.

However, statistical significance was reached only for the restricted SR birds.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Lipid and hormone plasma levels.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center"><bold>E</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>L</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>SA</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>SR</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Leptin (ng/ml)</td><td align="center">1.68 &#x000b1; 0.17</td><td align="center">2.08 &#x000b1; 0.23</td><td align="center">2.06 &#x000b1; 0.19</td><td align="center">1.97 &#x000b1; 0.21</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Insulin (pmol/ml)</td><td align="center">118.6 &#x000b1; 17.9</td><td align="center">101.1 &#x000b1; 12.0</td><td align="center">129.7 &#x000b1; 29.7</td><td align="center">128.3 &#x000b1; 16.3</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Glucose (mmol/l)</td><td align="center">10.99 &#x000b1; 0.39</td><td align="center">10.60 &#x000b1; 0.22</td><td align="center">11.10 &#x000b1; 0.22</td><td align="center">10.71 &#x000b1; 0.33</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Triglycerides (mmol/l)</td><td align="center">31.36 &#x000b1; 1.89</td><td align="center">33.48 &#x000b1; 1.63</td><td align="center">25.01 &#x000b1; 3.41</td><td align="center">19.15 &#x000b1; 3.34*</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Phospholipids (mmol/l)</td><td align="center">12.10 &#x000b1; 0.29</td><td align="center">12.75 &#x000b1; 0.47</td><td align="center">10.53 &#x000b1; 1.14</td><td align="center">11.04 &#x000b1; 1.24</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Cholesterol (mmol/l)</td><td align="center">9.16 &#x000b1; 0.39</td><td align="center">9.48 &#x000b1; 0.40</td><td align="center">8.40 &#x000b1; 0.63</td><td align="center">9.07 &#x000b1; 0.77</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SEM (n = 12). * indicates statistical difference (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><title>Discusssion</title><p>Several studies conducted on theca and granulosa cells have shown that leptin may have direct negative effects on ovarian steroidogenesis in various mammalian species. Leptin inhibits insulin-induced progesterone and 17&#x003b2;-estradiol production by isolated bovine granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and impairs the hormonally-stimulated in vitro release of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol by rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In granulosa cells from fertile women, leptin inhibits FSH and IGF-I stimulated estradiol production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] Since leptin has a more potent inhibitory action of insulin-induced aromatase activity of granulosa cells from small than large follicles, it has been proposed that the numbers of leptin receptors in granulosa cells might decrease as follicles develop in order to make mature Graafian follicles less sensitive to the negative action of leptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. As shown in this study and in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the leptin receptor was expressed in the hen ovary in both granulosa and theca cells, suggesting a direct action of leptin at the level of the ovary. It seemed that leptin might affect ovarian steroidogenesis in laying hens during fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] but the involvement of leptin on steroidogenesis during normal follicle development remained to be determined. In this study we demonstrated that the direct action of leptin on the ovary might be modified during follicle development since the level of expression of its receptor clearly decreased during maturation of yellow follicles. This decrease was particularly evident in slow growing broiler breeder hens from the "Label" genotype and from the feed-restricted standard line. Given that fast growing chickens (ad libitum-fed standard and Experimental broiler breeder hens) have the highest reproductive problems, genetic or nutritional control of the growth rate might regulate ovarian leptin receptor gene expression and improve reproductive function. Such evolution of receptor expression in the follicular hierarchy has previously been shown for the FSH receptor. FSH-stimulated steroidogenesis declined during follicle maturation and was associated with a decrease in FSH receptor numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Conversely, the expression of mRNA encoding the IGF-I receptor and the related efficacy of binding of IGF-I to granulosa cells increased as the follicle matured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Since leptin receptor gene expression was modified during follicle development, leptin might also be involved in regulation of the follicular hierarchy and onset of preovulatory steroidogenesis, as has been proposed for gonadotrophins and growth factors including FSH and IGF-I.</p><p>Unlike mammals, progesterone in chickens is synthesized and secreted mainly by granulosa cells whereas theca cells generate estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Progesterone produced by granulosa cells from mature follicles provides the positive feedback necessary to stimulate a preovulatory surge of LH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. IGF-I has been involved in the regulation of ovarian steroidogenesis in both mammals and birds. IGF-I stimulates progesterone production from avian granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] whereas it up-regulates estradiol from mammalian granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Since leptin is considered to be an inhibitor of insulin and IGF-I action on steroidogenesis in mammals, leptin might have similar negative action in birds. Thus, the decrease in its receptor in the granulosa suggests that the inhibiting action of leptin would decrease during follicle development and consequently favours the stimulatory effect of gonadotrophins and IGF-I on follicular maturation. This hypothesis is also consistent with the weaker steroidogenic response of granulosa cell culture of ad-libitum fed standard broiler breeder hens when stimulated by IGF-I compared to granulosa cell culture from feed-restricted birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Moreover, Onagbesan et al (2004) demonstrated in an experiment similar to that performed in the present study and using the same genotypes that plasma progesterone levels were clearly affected in SA birds. They demonstrated that plasma progesterone levels remained relatively stable between 25 and 37 weeks of age in the E, L and SA birds with a significant lower level in the SA birds (2.2 &#x000b1; 0.62 ng/ml for SA birds compared to 3.9 &#x000b1; 0.36 and 4.2 &#x000b1; 0.54 for L and E birds respectively). In restricted standard birds, plasma progesterone levels dramatically increased and reached values (3.8 &#x000b1; 0.26 ng/ml) closed to that measured in the E and L lines (Onagbesan et al., 2004, data from progesterone levels were personal communication from Dr Onagbesan, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium).</p><p>The erratic pattern of oviposition in standard broiler breeder hens fed ad libitum has been previously demonstrated to be related to abnormal maturation of steroidogenesis, particularly in the two largest yellow follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Since F2 and F1 yellow follicles presented similar endocrine profiles, the preovulatory surge of LH probably triggers ovulation of the two largest follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In this study we have shown that ad libitum feeding of broiler breeder hens dramatically up-regulated expression of the leptin receptor in the granulosa cells of yellow follicles and changed the evolution of expression of this receptor with follicle development. These results suggest a strong action of leptin on the ovaries of ad libitum fed birds. Feed restriction reduced the level of expression of the leptin receptor and on the whole restored the evolution of expression of the receptor with follicle maturation. Since ad libitum feeding affects the hierarchical endocrine order of the follicles, as a potential inhibitor of hormonally induced avian steroidogenesis leptin represented a good candidate to explain the affects of follicular hierarchy. Up-regulation of the expression of the leptin receptor gene was also demonstrated in the liver. This up-regulation may be related to the control of lipogenesis. The liver plays a key role in lipid metabolism and lipogenesis in avian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and the standard broiler breeder hens were the fattest birds of this experiment.</p><p>Since expression of its receptor was dramatically up-regulated in SA hens, leptin probably played an important role in the increased number of large yellow follicles and abnormal follicle hierarchy. However the factors involved in regulation of the expression of the leptin receptor within the hen ovary remains to be determined. Among the plasma hormones and lipids analyzed in this study only triglycerides were found to be different between strains, with a lower level in the restricted standard broiler breeder hens that were also the leanest birds. Down regulation of the expression of the leptin receptor by homologous and heterologous signals have previously been demonstrated in both mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Leptin and insulin are able to down-regulate expression of the chicken leptin receptor in vitro. In the present study, plasma leptin and insulin levels were similar for each genotype and were not altered by feed restriction in the standard genotype. We have previously demonstrated that during the first 5 weeks of age, plasma leptin levels remained relatively stable in both broiler and layer chicken despite increased body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However the absence of leptin levels differences may be related to the fact plasma leptin levels were measured at 32 weeks of age. SR birds were relaxed at the start of lay, switched to breeding feeding and allowed ad libitum access as the other groups of birds. We therefore suggested that leptin and insulin are probably not involved in the regulation of ovarian leptin receptor gene expression in ad libitum or feed-restricted standard broiler breeder hens.</p><p>Evidence of the regulation of expression of the leptin receptor gene in the granulosa related to follicle maturation and nutritional state strongly suggest that leptin played an important local and sequential role in the dysfunction of the follicular hierarchy observed in standard broiler breeder hens fed ad libitum. This study suggests that the level of expression of the leptin receptor regulates the action of its ligand at the level of the ovary. This provides an interesting perspective to understanding the physiological role of leptin in the ovary.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the "5<sup>th </sup>Framework Program Grant" from the European Community (QLRT-2000-1732).
