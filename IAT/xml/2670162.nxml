It plays an important role in mitochondrial structure and function and stabilizes respiratory chain super complexes and individual electron transport complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). The CL biosynthetic pathway is well characterized in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and the enzymes catalyzing the three sequential reactions involved are all associated with mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). CL synthesis shares the same precursor, CDP-diacylglycerol, with the main cellular phospholipids, yet it differs significantly from other phospholipids in its acyl-chain composition that is characterized by a high degree of unsaturated fatty acids. Although cardiolipin was believed to be essential to support mitochondrial function, mutants defective in cardiolipin synthase (Crd1p) are viable and display only moderate defects of mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). More severe is a defect in the first committed step of CL synthesis, catalyzed by phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase Pgs1p/Pel1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). <italic>pgs1</italic> mutants are temperature-sensitive, unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources for growth, and petite lethal, <italic>i.e.</italic> dependent on intact mitochondrial DNA for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). More subtle mitochondrial phenotypes emerge from alterations of cardiolipin acyl-chain remodeling. &#x0201c;Premature&#x0201d; cardiolipin synthesized by Crd1p undergoes significant remodeling of its acyl-chain composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Mature CL in yeast contains mainly palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and oleic acid (C18:1), which distinguishes CL from most other phospholipids by its high degree of unsaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). In humans, a severe genetic disorder, the Barth syndrome, is associated with defective CL acyl-chain remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). This disease is caused by mutations in the <italic>TAZ</italic> gene encoding Tafazzin, for which a functional ortholog also exists in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Tafazzin and its yeast counterpart Taz1p are shown to function as transacylases with substrate specificity for either lyso-PC or monolyso-CL (MLCL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). The yeast mutant <italic>taz1</italic> shows dramatic alterations in the cardiolipin fatty acid pattern, an accumulation of MLCL, and a decreased overall CL content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). A model for CL acyl-chain remodeling postulated by Xu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) suggests an active deacylation-reacylation cycle between CL and MLCL. The transacylase Taz1p catalyzes the reacylation of MLCL to CL, but it does not possess any phospholipase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Thus, the activity generating MLCL, presumably a mitochondrial CL-specific phospholipase A (PLA), remained to be identified.</p><p>In this work we show that the yeast open reading frame <italic>YGR110W</italic> encodes a mitochondrial protein, which functions as PLA <italic>in vitro</italic> and is involved in generating MLCL <italic>in vivo</italic>. Ygr110wp deacylates <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized CL with a clear substrate preference for palmitic acid residues. We hence term the gene <italic>CLD1</italic>, encoding a cardiolipin-specific deacylase.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Media and Growth Conditions</italic>&#x02014;Yeast strains were grown in YPD medium at 30 &#x000b0;C on a rotary shaker with vigorous aeration.

The protein shows distant homology to the mammalian protein CGI-58, which is an activator of the major mammalian triglyceride lipase ATGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>) and was recently shown to act as a lysophosphatidic acyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). The amino acid sequence of Ygr110wp contains an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold and features a conserved serine residue embedded in a <sup>228</sup>A<italic>X</italic>S<italic>X</italic>G<sup>232</sup> motif. This motif is a variation of G<italic>X</italic>S<italic>X</italic>G, which is commonly found in esterases, acyltransferases, and lipases. Sequence alignments of Ygr110wp unveiled similarities to bacterial lysophospholipase domains (COG 2267) and a hydrolase/acyltransferase domain (COG 0596). The structural motif <sup>424</sup>H<italic>XXXX</italic>D<sup>429</sup> is indicative of glycerolipid acyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) and is also present in the homologous protein, Ict1p, which was recently described as an acyl-CoA-dependent lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Taken together, these data suggested a possible function for Ygr110wp as a lipase or acyltransferase. The hydrophobicity plot indicates a lack of transmembrane domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), and no specific subcellular targeting signals were predicted by <italic>in silico</italic> analyses.</p><p><italic>Ygr110wp Localizes Exclusively to Mitochondria but Is Not Essential for Mitochondrial Function</italic>&#x02014;To obtain further insight into the function of Ygr110wp we investigated the subcellular localization by fluorescence microscopy of a C-terminal GFP fusion protein expressed from plasmid pYGR110W-GFP in wild-type cells. Ygr110wp-GFP was detected exclusively in mitochondria, as determined by co-staining with the mitochondria-specific vital dye, MitoTracker&#x000ae; Red (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). This specific mitochondrial localization of Ygr110wp was also confirmed by cell fractionation (see below).</p><p>The mitochondrial localization of the protein prompted us to investigate the impact of a mutation on mitochondrial function. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, deletion of <italic>YGR110W</italic> did not affect growth on glucose or on non-fermentable carbon sources at various temperatures, unlike the <italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, which showed reduced growth at 37 &#x000b0;C on glycerol/ethanol-containing media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).

Cells were grown to late exponential phase on glucose media, and lipids were extracted and analyzed as described under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures.&#x0201d; No significant differences were observed in cellular lipid composition and fatty acid distribution between wild-type and mutant cells (data not shown). Because Ygr110wp is a mitochondrial protein, we then specifically focused our attention on mitochondrial lipids and determined the fatty acid composition of mitochondrial phospholipids individually. Mitochondria were isolated from the <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394; mutant and from wild-type cells, and phospholipids were extracted and separated by two-dimensional TLC. Lipid spots were scraped off for determining the acyl-chain composition by GC/MS. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the deletion of <italic>YGR110W</italic> had a dramatic and specific effect on the composition of fatty acids in cardiolipin.

Taz1p was therefore proposed to be involved in the reacylation of MLCL specifically with unsaturated fatty acids. Because <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394; mutants displayed a similar reduction in unsaturated fatty acids of CL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), we tested them for a potential accumulation of MLCL, as described by Vaden <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>).

Because the level of CL was higher in the <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394;<italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant than in the <italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394; single mutant, this phenotype is not due to an overall reduced CL content; the <italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394; single mutant showed only a weak growth phenotype at 30 &#x000b0;C (Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2<italic>B</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6<italic>C</italic></xref>). These findings confirm that both proteins function in the same pathway.</p><p>Lack of any MLCL in the <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394; mutant strongly suggests that it is not defective in a pathway that operates in parallel to Taz1p, as an acyltransferase. Moreover, expression of GST-Ygr110wp in the <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394;<italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant led to an accumulation of MLCL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>lane 2</italic>) and thus provides further strong evidence that Ygr110wp indeed generates the substrate for the Taz1p reaction, <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this work we show that Ygr110wp is part of the remodeling process of CL, which involves deacylation-reacylation of premature CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). The dimeric phospholipid CL is predominantly enriched in the inner membrane of mitochondria, and its fatty acid pattern displays a high degree of unsaturation compared with other phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Defects in CL remodeling were shown to be causative for the Barth syndrome, a severe disease that may lead to cardiac failure in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). The Barth syndrome results from mutations in the <italic>TAZ</italic> gene, which leads to a dramatic decrease in total CL, an accumulation of MLCL, and absence of unsaturated CL species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).</p><p>Remodeling of acyl chains in phospholipids involves sequential actions of phospholipases and acyl transferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). The mitochondrial yeast protein Taz1p was shown to function as a transacylase with substrate specificity for either MLCL or lysophosphatidylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Due to the fact that <italic>TAZ1</italic> deletion mutants accumulate MLCL, Taz1p was proposed to catalyze the reacylation of MLCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). The first step in the remodeling cycle, however, requires a phospholipase activity that generates MLCL.</p><p>We found that the previously uncharacterized yeast protein Ygr110wp functions as mitochondrial phospholipase. Overexpression of a GST-Ygr110w fusion protein stimulated mitochondrial phospholipase activity &#x0003e;3-fold in a commercial <italic>in vitro</italic> assay that relied on <italic>sn2</italic>-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine as the substrate. Furthermore, Ygr110wp also showed significant CL-specific phospholipase activity against CL enriched in C<sub>16:0</sub><italic>in vitro</italic>. Additional evidence for this CL-specific PLA activity is derived from the following data: (i) The localization of Ygr110wp to mitochondria indicates that this enzyme is involved in a mitochondrial process. (ii) The mutant <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394; shows a specific deficiency in CL fatty acid composition that is not observed in other cellular or mitochondrial phospholipids. Thus mitochondrial phospholipids other than CL can be excluded as substrates for Ygr110wp. (iii) A deletion of <italic>YGR110W</italic> in a <italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394; mutant background prevents the formation of MLCL that accumulates in the <italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394; mutant lacking the CL specific transacylase. (vi) Overexpression of GST-Ygr110wp in a <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394;<italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant induces accumulation of MLCL, which requires PLA activity.</p><p>Furthermore, we show that Ygr110wp preferentially catalyzes the removal of C<sub>16:0</sub> from premature CL <italic>in vivo</italic>. A deletion of <italic>YGR110W</italic> resulted in a 2.4-fold increase of palmitic acid in CL, on the expense of the unsaturated fatty acid species. In addition, overexpression of GST-Ygr110wp in <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394; mutant strains reduced the high amount of C<sub>16:0</sub> in cardiolipin of mutant cells to wild-type level.</p><p>Interestingly, we detected an elevated relative amount of C<sub>18:0</sub> of in CL, at the expense of C<sub>16:1</sub>, in <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells overexpressing GST-Ygr110wp. In contrast, no changes in CL fatty acids were observed in the wild-type upon GST-Ygr110wp overexpression. From these findings we assume that CL remodeling is dependent on a stoichiometric balance of all components involved, perhaps in a specific lipid remodeling complex.</p><p>A deletion of <italic>YGR110W</italic> resulted in an aberrant fatty acid pattern in CL, but total CL was not decreased and no accumulation of MLCL was detected, which is in contrast to <italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394; mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). In addition, we did not observe significant growth defects on media containing ethanol or glycerol as carbon sources for the <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394; single mutant, indicating that an increased level of saturated fatty acids in CL of the mutant is not sufficient to impair mitochondrial function. However, we observed a severe growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources for the <italic>ygr110w</italic>&#x00394;<italic>taz1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant, which proves that Ygr110wp and Taz1p are involved in the same pathway.</p><p>We propose that Ygr110wp functions as the phospholipase upstream of Taz1p, generating MLCL for Taz1p-dependent reacylation with unsaturated fatty acids. The preferred removal of C<sub>16:0</sub> from cardiolipin by Ygr110wp is contradictory to a recent model for the exchange of acyl groups in <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The authors suggested that specific fatty acids may accumulate in CL by concerted action of acyl-specific inflow and nonspecific outflow. On the basis of our <italic>in vivo</italic> results the outflow of acyl residues from CL has also to be considered a specific process. We propose a model in which enzymes with phospholipase A or B activity specifically detach saturated C<sub>16:0</sub> or C<sub>18:0</sub> acyl chains from <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized CL to generate MLCL, which will be subsequently reacylated specifically by transacylases, such as Taz1p. Thus the exchange of the CL acyl chains may require the coordinated action of multiple phospholipases and transacylases, each of them showing specificities for degree of unsaturation but also for acyl-chain length. Cld1 (<underline>c</underline>ardio<underline>l</underline>ipin-specific <underline>d</underline>eacylase 1) encoded by gene <italic>YGR110W</italic> is the first phospholipase activity identified so far that preferentially removes C<sub>16:0</sub> acyl chains from cardiolipin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank W.
