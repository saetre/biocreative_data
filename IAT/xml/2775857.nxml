It is distributed throughout Korea, China, and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). <italic>Lindera</italic> species, including <italic>L. lucida</italic>, <italic>L. strychnifolia</italic>, <italic>L. aggregate</italic> and <italic>L. chunii</italic> are important medicinal plants. The fruit of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> is used as a traditional medicine for analgesic, digestive, diuretic, anti-dote, and antibacterial purposes; also, its leaves have been used as a folk medicine for stomach-ache, thirst, and neuralgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Cyclopentenediones, farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors, and anti-tumor compounds were isolated from the methanolic extract of the fruits of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). These compounds strongly inhibit human colon tumor cells and exert their anti-tumor activity by inducing apoptosis through the caspase-3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Also, three lignans isolated from a methanol extract of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity using three cancer cell line assays, and among these compounds, methyllinderone showed significant cytotoxicity against mouse melanoma, human acetabulum fibrosarcoma, and myelogenous leukemia cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>The rapid component of a cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current (I<sub>Kr</sub>) is known to play a critical role in repolarization of action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). I<sub>Kr</sub> is one of the targets for antiarrhythmic therapy, since the blocking of this current is expected to increase the action potential duration (APD) and thereby increase the refractory period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It has been shown that the human <italic>ether-a-go-go</italic>-related gene (<italic>HERG</italic>) encodes a major component of the I<sub>Kr</sub> and that congenital mutation of HERG results in long QT syndrome, which shows a high risk of sudden death due to torsade de pointes type ventricular arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). While HERG K<sup>+</sup> channels control electrical activity in excitable cells, these channels are also significantly expressed in non-excitable cells. High levels of HERG mRNA are detected in various cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and the overexpression of <italic>ether-a-go-go</italic> gene (<italic>EAG</italic>) channels enhances aggressive growth of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Moreover, E-4031, a specific HERG channel blocker, reduced proliferation of uterine cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Therefore, the cytotoxic effect of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> for the cancer cell lines could be caused by the modulation of HERG K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have investigated the effect of extracts of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> on the HERG current, a molecular equivalent of I<sub>Kr</sub>, using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system. We found that <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> blocked the HERG channel, resulting in a shift in voltage-dependence of channel activation and reduction of maximum conductance (g<sub>max</sub>). We have also examined the HERG-blocking effects of several fractions of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic>, and the H<sub>2</sub>O and BuOH fractions exhibited the strongest changes in V<sub>1/2</sub> (the potential required for half-maximal activation) and g<sub>max</sub> (maximum conductance) among the solvent fractions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of extract from <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic></title><p>The leaves of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> were collected in October 2005 at Jeju Island, Korea. The samples were cleaned, dried at room temperature for two weeks, and ground into a fine powder. The dried materials (100 g) were extracted with 80% methanol (MeOH) at room temperature for 24 hr and then concentrated under a vacuum. The resulting MeOH extract (32 g) was suspended in water (1 L) and successively partitioned with hexane (1 L&#x000d7;3), chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>; 1 L&#x000d7;3) ethyl acetate (EtOAc; 1 L&#x000d7;3), and n-butanol (BuOH; 1 L&#x000d7;3), to give hexane (0.9892 g), CHCl<sub>3</sub> (1.6209 g), EtOAc (3.0058 g), BuOH (6.8221 g) and H<sub>2</sub>O (18.5571 g) fractions, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of <italic>HERG</italic> in oocytes</title><p>Complementary <italic>HERG</italic> (accession no.

Stage V-VI oocytes were surgically removed from female <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (Nasco, Modesto, CA, U.S.A.) that was anesthetized with 0.17% tricane methanesulphonate (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). Using fine forceps, theca and follicle layers were manually removed from oocytes, which were injected with 40 nL of cRNA (0.1-0.5 &#x000b5;g/&#x000b5;L). The injected oocytes were maintained in modified Barth's solution containing 88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 0.4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.33 mM Ca (NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and 50 &#x000b5;g/mL gentamicin sulphonate.

All salts were purchased from Sigma Chemicals. The effects of the MeOH extract and solvent fractions on the HERG current were observed by adding 100 mg/mL stock solution of either MeOH extract or solvent fractions to the external solutions at suitable concentrations (0.01-300 &#x000b5;g/mL) shortly before each experiment. None of the final concentrations from any of the solvents exceeded 0.1%. Solutions were applied to the oocytes by continuous perfusion of the chamber while recording. Solution exchanges were completed within 3 min, and the HERG current was recorded after 5 min when the solution exchange was completed. The effects of several concentrations of MeOH extract, BuOH fraction, and H<sub>2</sub>O fraction on the HERG currents were determined after the currents showed reversibility when washed with normal Ringer's solution. It took about 10 min to wash out &#x02264;30 &#x000b5;g/mL MeOH extract or BuOH and H<sub>2</sub>O fractions, and about 20 min to wash out &#x02265;50 &#x000b5;g/mL. In experiments with 50-100 &#x000b5;g/mL BuOH and H<sub>2</sub>O fractions, HERG currents usually (-80% of cells examined) showed &#x0003e;90% recovery after 20 min washing with normal Ringer's solution. If the oocyte did not recover current after 30 min of washing with normal Ringer's solution, it was not used further. Currents were measured at room temperature (21-23&#x02103;) with a two-microelectrode voltage clamp amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, U.S.A.). Electrodes were filled with 3 M KCl and had a resistance of 2-4 M&#x003a9; for voltage-recording electrodes and 0.6-1 M&#x02126; for current-passing electrodes. Stimulation and data acquisition were controlled with Digidata and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA, U.S.A.).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical evaluations</title><p>All data are expressed as mean&#x000b1;SE.

Throughout the experiments, the holding potential was held at -70 mV, and the repolarization potential was constantly held at -60 mV for the analysis of tail currents (I<sub>tail</sub>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> shows an example of a voltage-clamp recording from a <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte and representative current traces for control conditions and after exposure to 100 &#x000b5;g/mL MeOH extract of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic>. Under control conditions, depolarizing steps activated time-dependent outward currents. The amplitude of the outward currents measured at the end of the pulse (I<sub>HERG</sub>) increased with more positive voltage steps, reaching a maximum value at 0 mV. Depolarizing steps to even more positive values caused a current decrease, resulting in a negative slope of the I-V curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Current-voltage relationships for I<sub>HERG</sub> obtained at various concentrations of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> extract are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>. As the concentration of the extract progressively increased, the amplitude of I<sub>HERG</sub> showed a dose-dependent decrease.</p><p>After the depolarizing steps, repolarization to -60 mV induced outward I<sub>tail</sub>, which had an amplitude even larger than that of I<sub>HERG</sub> during depolarization. This is a characteristic property of HERG currents, which is due to rapid recovery from inactivation and a slow deactivation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The amplitude of I<sub>tail</sub> increased with depolarizing steps from -50 to +20 mV, and was then superimposed on further depolarizing steps to +40 mV. When 100 &#x000b5;g/mL MeOH extract of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> was added to the perfusate, both I<sub>HERG</sub> and I<sub>tail</sub> were suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, bottom panel). The amplitude of I<sub>tail</sub> was normalized to the peak amplitude obtained under control conditions at maximum depolarization and was plotted against the potential of the step depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The normalized I<sub>tail</sub> reflects a voltage-dependent activation of the HERG channels. Data obtained under control conditions were well fitted by the Boltzmann equation, with half-maximal activation (V<sub>1/2</sub>) at -15.2 mV. As the concentration of the MeOH extract of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> was increased, the peak I<sub>tail</sub> amplitude decreased, indicating that the g<sub>max</sub> of HERG channels is decreased by <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Voltage-dependent HERG channel blockade by <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic></title><p>For further analysis, we normalized the values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> to the respective maximum value at each concentration to examine a possible activation curve shift induced by the MeOH extract of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, the activation curves at control, 10, 20, and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL of MeOH extract are shifted to the right according to increases in concentration, while the activation curves at 200 and 300 &#x000b5;g/mL MeOH extract basically overlapped. The V<sub>1/2</sub> calculations were consistent with this finding, yielding values of -15.2&#x000b1;0.42, -14.2&#x000b1;0.28, -8.36&#x000b1;0.35, 3.21&#x000b1;0.69, 1.10&#x000b1;0.59, -3.85&#x000b1;1.97, and -2.38&#x000b1;0.83 mV at control, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 300 &#x000b5;g/mL MeOH extract, respectively (n=8). Thus, the V<sub>1/2</sub> values for experiments run in the presence of 10-100 &#x000b5;g/mL MeOH extract significantly increased according to concentration (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, n=8), whereas those for experiments run in the presence of 200 and 300 &#x000b5;g/mL, relatively high concentrations, are not significantly different from each other (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05, n=8). These findings indicate that MeOH extract of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> may change activation gating at 10-100 &#x000b5;g/mL, while those high concentrations such as 200 and 300 &#x000b5;g/mL have induced maximal effects on HERG channel current.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> on the activated current-voltage relationship</title><p>In addition, the effect of MeOH extract of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> on activated currents was tested. The activated current-voltage relationship was obtained with the use of a voltage-clamp protocol shown at the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>. A depolarizing pulse to +50 mV, which induced a full activation, was followed by various levels of test pulses. The amplitude of the current was measured at its peak before deactivation occurred, and then the data were normalized to the respective maximal currents in the control. Next, the normalized data were averaged and plotted against the test potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The activated current-voltage relationship showed a typical inward rectification of the HERG channel due to the rapid inactivation. The MeOH extract of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> reduced the current within the wide range of membrane potentials from -140 to +30 mV concentration-dependently. Also, the reversal potentials before and after treatment with 10, 100, and 300 &#x000b5;g/mL MeOH extract were -91.3&#x000b1;1.9, -90.5&#x000b1;2.3 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05, n=9), -85.8&#x000b1;2.4, and -77.5&#x000b1;3.2 mV, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, n=9). Considering that K<sup>+</sup> channel has relatively high selectivity for the permeating ion, K<sup>+</sup> rather than Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup>, the MeOH extract at relatively high concentrations of 100 and 300 &#x000b5;g/mL, could perturb the ion-selectivity of HERG channel by inducing non-specific membrane permeabilization or membrane leakage.</p></sec><sec><title>Fraction-dependent inhibition of HERG channels by <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic></title><p>Next, we examined the effect of several solvent fractions of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> on the HERG current by comparing the changes of I<sub>HERG</sub> and I<sub>tail</sub> by each solvent fraction, using the hexane fraction, CHCl<sub>3</sub> fraction, EtOAc fraction, BuOH fraction, and H<sub>2</sub>O fraction at the same concentrations (100 &#x000b5;g/mL) using the same protocol as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> shows an example of a voltage-clamp recording from the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte cell with the representative current traces from a cell in control and after exposure to 100 &#x000b5;g/mL of each solvent fraction.

In contrast, 100 &#x000b5;g/mL of the BuOH fraction or the H<sub>2</sub>O fraction inhibited both I<sub>HERG</sub> and I<sub>tail</sub> relatively strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, lower panels). The amplitudes of I<sub>HERG</sub> and I<sub>tail</sub> were normalized to the peak amplitude obtained under control conditions and were plotted against the potential of the step depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>, respectively). Then, we normalized values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> to the respective maximum value at each fraction to examine possible activation curve shifts induced by fractions of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, the activation curves in the control oocytes, as well as those treated with the hexane fraction and CHCl<sub>3</sub> fraction, basically overlapped, whereas the curves for the EtOAc fraction, BuOH fraction, and H<sub>2</sub>O fraction were shifted rightward.

Dose-response relationships were obtained at -30, 0, and +30 mV, and the data were fitted by Hill equations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), giving IC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.4&#x000b1;0.71, 23.4&#x000b1;2.43, and 39.5&#x000b1;7.83 &#x000b5;g/mL, and Hill coefficients of 5.97&#x000b1;10.7, 1.39&#x000b1;0.19, and 1.51&#x000b1;0.42 at -30, 0 and +30 mV, respectively (n=6), suggesting that the BuOH fraction-induced blockade of I<sub>tail</sub> progressively decreases with increasing depolarization. Collectively, these findings indicate that the BuOH fraction of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic>-induced blockade of I<sub>tail</sub> is voltage-dependent.</p></sec><sec><title>Time dependence of HERG channel inhibition by H<sub>2</sub>O and BuOH fraction</title><p>In addition, we found that the block of HERG currents by H<sub>2</sub>O fraction and BuOH fraction of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> showed relatively weak time dependence. We activated currents using a protocol containing a single depolarizing step to 0 mV for 8 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). After obtaining the control measurement, 100 &#x000b5;g/mL of the H<sub>2</sub>O fraction was applied while holding the channels in the closed state at -70 mV and the recordings were made. Analysis of the test pulse after H<sub>2</sub>O fraction application showed an increase of blocking to 74% at 8 sec in a representative cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The fractional sustained current (obtained by normalizing the currents with H<sub>2</sub>O fraction of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> relative to control currents) decreased slightly with ongoing depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). At the beginning of the pulse, the fractional current was 0.378&#x000b1;0.065 of the control, and it declined slightly to 0.259&#x000b1;0.088 after 1 sec at a test potential of 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>; n=5). These findings indicate that HERG channels are greatly blocked by H<sub>2</sub>O fraction of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> at the holding potential. Similar to the results obtained from the H<sub>2</sub>O fraction, the BuOH fraction of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> also shows relatively weak time-dependent block of HERG current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C, D</xref>). In a representative cell, 100 &#x000b5;g/mL BuOH fraction application showed an increase of blocking to 79% at 8 sec, and the fractional sustained current slightly decreased with ongoing depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). At the beginning of the pulse, the fractional current was 0.349&#x000b1;0.052 of the control, and it declined slightly to 0.246&#x000b1; 0.067 after 1 sec at a test potential of 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>; n=5). These findings indicate that HERG channels are also greatly blocked by BuOH fraction of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> while remaining at the holding potential.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our results indicate that extracts of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> is an inhibitor of HERG channels. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> were -50 &#x000b5;g/mL (at +40 mV) for HERG channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Due to the specific properties of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system, such as the vitelline membrane and egg yolk, higher extracellular concentrations of the drug are required to block HERG channels than to inhibit native I<sub>Kr</sub> in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that various K<sup>+</sup> currents are associated with the proliferation of cancer cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels has been shown to play a role in the physiological regulation during proliferation of human prostate, neuroblastoma or medulloblastoma cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> currents (I<sub>K</sub>) have been shown to correlated with mitogenesis and to constitute an link between cytokines activated signaling cascade and cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). HERG has been found abundantly expressed in a variety of tumor cells of different histogenesis where it plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of their neoplastic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The high frequency of expression of HERG in primary human endometrial cancers, as compared to normal and hyperplastic endometrium, has candidated this protein as a potential marker of cancerous versus hyperplastic endometrial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Several models have been proposed to explain the involvement of K<sup>+</sup> channels in mitogenesis. Cone and Tonigier have suggested that K<sup>+</sup> channel activity would determine a shift in the resting membrane potential of cells, this latter event being mitogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Since the fruit and leaves of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> show anti-tumor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), our results suggest that <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic>-induced block of the HERG channel could change the resting membrane potential, which may contribute to the anti-tumor effects in various cancer cell lines.</p><p>The use of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> as an antimicrobial or anticancer agent has been suggested. It has been shown that the extract from <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> showed over 90% antimicrobial activity, according to an in vivo bioassay method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Lee et al. reported that methyllinderone, one of the compounds isolated from a EtOAc fraction of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> methanol extract, showed significant cytotoxicity against three cancer cell lines with ED<sub>50</sub> values of 2.2-8.3 &#x000b5;g/mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Considering that H<sub>2</sub>O and BuOH fractions had relatively higher effects on V<sub>1/2</sub> and g<sub>max</sub> than EtOAc fraction, compounds other than methyllinderone could block the HERG channel.</p><p>HERG channel blockers have been shown to inhibit the channels in a voltage-dependent manner, suggesting that these drugs bind to the open or inactivated state of HERG channels. For example, haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and two histamine receptor antagonists, terfenadine and astemizole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), have been found to preferentially bind to the inactivated state of HERG, whereas the gastrointestinal prokinetic agent cisapride has been shown to block the channel in its open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). We have shown here that the amplitudes of maximum I<sub>HERG</sub> and the maximum I<sub>tail</sub> were decreased by <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> extract, and the blockade of I<sub>tail</sub> magnitude by BuOH and H<sub>2</sub>O fractions increased with more negative voltages, which decrease the open probability and inhibit inactivation. Also, the voltage dependence of the HERG channel blockade by the BuOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) and H<sub>2</sub>O fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) indicate that this drug preferentially blocks HERG channels in the closed state rather than either the open or inactivated states. Consistent results were that <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> blocks HERG channel at the holding potential rather than at the depolarizing pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Considering that the V<sub>1/2</sub> values of activation curves in the absence and presence of 10-100 &#x000b5;g/mL <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> extract significantly increased according to concentration, our findings suggest that <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> blocks closed state HERG channels and concomitantly changes activation gating. In addition, the shift in V<sub>1/2</sub> and the reduction in g<sub>max</sub> were greatly affected by the BuOH and H<sub>2</sub>O fractions rather than the hexane fraction, CHCl<sub>3</sub> fraction, or EtOAc fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This finding suggested that the active ingredients inhibiting HERG channel should be included in more polar solvent than non-polar solvent.</p><p>Shifting of the voltage dependence of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) by positively charged molecule could be considered to be a general phenomenon caused by a non-specific surface charge effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This effect is thought to reflect the binding of the molecule to diffuse or aggregate negatively charged moieties near the outer mouth of the channels, altering the voltage field that is sensed by the channel gating mechanism. According to this hypothesis, current activation and deactivation should be affected to the same extent by <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic>. However, there was a larger increase of activation time constant than the decrease of deactivation time constant (n=3, data not shown). In addition, the g<sub>max</sub> of HERG channels (current magnitude at highly depolarized potentials where there is already a high probability of opening) was significantly reduced by <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), which cannot be explained by the surface charge theory. Therefore, we excluded the surface charge theory as a main mechanism of the <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> effect.</p><p>There are several studies showing the effect of <italic>Lindera</italic> species (Lauraceae) on K<sup>+</sup> channels. Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) suggested that the cardioprotective effect by <italic>L. strychnifolia</italic> was due to the opening of the mitochondrial K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in cardiac myocytes, because the improvement of myocardial dysfunction after global ischemia by <italic>L. strychnifolia</italic> was completely abolished by pre-treatment with a mitochondrial K<sub>ATP</sub> channel blocker, 5-HD. In rat isolated ventricular myocytes, dicentrine, an aporphine alkaloid isolated from the root of <italic>L. megaphylla</italic>, prolongs the APD<sub>50</sub> and reduces the rate of action potential upstroke, indicating that dicentrine may possess anti-arrhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Also, it has been shown that the IK in guinea pig ventricular myocytes was inhibited by dicentrine, with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 3 and 10 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Although it has not been reported that <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> prolongs the APD or induces cardiac arrhythmia to our knowledge, our results suggest that <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> blocks the HERG channel, a major component of the I<sub>Kr</sub>, which could make the heart prone to arrhythmia since I<sub>Kr</sub> is one of the targets for antiarrhythmic therapy and the blocking of this current is expected to increase the APD and thereby increase the refractory period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown here that <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> blocks HERG channel, resulting in a shift of voltage-dependence of channel activation and reduction of g<sub>max</sub>, and that the H<sub>2</sub>O and BuOH fractions exhibits the strongest changes in V<sub>1/2</sub> and g<sub>max</sub> among the solvent fractions. Considering that <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> have been used as a folk medicine and shows anticancer activity and that HERG channel is important target regulating proliferation of the tumor cells and determining cardiac APD, our results could explain the anticancer effect and potentially arrhythmogenic effect of <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by the research grant of the <funding-source>Cheju National University</funding-source> in 2006.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>BY</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Monbographic study of the Lauracea in Korea</article-title><source>Kor J Plant Tax</source><year>1988</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>133</fpage><lpage>151</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name><name><surname>Hisada</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Inagaki</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Terpenses of <italic>Lindera erythrocarpa</italic></article-title><source>Phytochemistry</source><year>1973</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>233</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name><name><surname>Hisada</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Inagaki</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Constituents of <italic>Lindera erythrocarpa</italic></article-title><source>Phytochemistry</source><year>1973</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>472</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>HY</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Son</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>BM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cyclopentenediones, inhibitors of farnesyl protein transferase and anti-tumor compounds, isolated from the fruit of <italic>Lindera erythrocarpa</italic> Makino</article-title><source>Bioorg Med Chem</source><year>2005</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>6182</fpage><lpage>6187</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16055336</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Baek</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>HB</given-names></name><name><surname>Kho</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cytotoxicity of Lignans from <italic>Lindera erythrocarpa</italic> Makino</article-title><source>Nat Prod Sci</source><year>2002</year><volume>8</volume><fpage>100</fpage><lpage>102</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sanguinetti</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Jurkiewicz</surname><given-names>NK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Two components of cardiac delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current.
