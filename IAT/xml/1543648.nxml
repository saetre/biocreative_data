Among them, <italic>Candida albicans </italic>is the most frequently isolated fungal pathogen in humans and has caused morbidity in seriously debilitated and immunocompromised hosts. Coinciding with the increased usage of antifungal drugs, the incidences of drug resistance have also increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Overexpression of <italic>CDR1</italic>, an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, has been shown to be the major mechanism for the drug resistance of clinical isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Mutations on <italic>CDR1 </italic>in <italic>C. albicans </italic>have resulted in an increased susceptibility to azole drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which is consistent with the observation that overexpression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>contributes to the drug resistance of clinical isolates of <italic>C. albicans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>is increased approximately 4-fold in <italic>Catup1/Catup1 </italic>mutant cells, which are predominately in the hyphal form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This data suggests that CaTup1 acts as a negative regulator of <italic>CDR1</italic>. Recently, two transcription factors, <italic>CaNDT80 </italic>and <italic>CaTAC1</italic>, have been identified as positive regulators of <italic>CDR1 </italic>in <italic>C. albicans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Previous works have demonstrated that biological fluids such as human serum can have profound effects on antifungal pharmacodynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. During an infection, the <italic>C. albicans </italic>cells exist in the host body and are surrounded by blood and other body fluid, where they encounter the antifungal drugs. In this study, we have found that the wild-type SC5314 cells but not the <italic>cdr1/cdr1 </italic>mutant cells became more susceptible to fluconazole, a commonly used antifungal drug, when the medium contained serum. To investigate the regulation of <italic>CDR1 </italic>in the presence of serum, we have constructed a <italic>CDR1 </italic>promoter-Renilla luciferase gene (<italic>CDR1p-RLUC</italic>) reporter to monitor the activity of <italic>CDR1 </italic>promoter in <italic>C. albicans </italic>under different conditions. In conclusion, serum increases the drug susceptibility by repressing the expression of <italic>CDR1</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To determine if serum has any effect on the drug susceptibility of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we have determined the growth of cells in the presence of different concentrations of fluconazole and in the absence or presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. The wild-type cells but not the <italic>cdr1/cdr1 </italic>mutant cells became more susceptible to fluconazole when the medium contained serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The growth of the wild-type cells was less inhibited by 0.125 mg/l fluconazole in serum-free medium than that in serum-containing one (vertical dotted line). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fluconazole of the <italic>cdr1/cdr1 </italic>mutant cells (0.0625 mg/l) was lower than that of the wild-type cells (0.25 mg/l). This is consistent with the previous reports that mutations on <italic>CDR1 </italic>have resulted in an increased drug susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The MIC of fluconazole of the wild-type cells was 2-fold lower in serum-containing medium than that in serum-free one (0.125 mg/l vs. 0.25 mg/l).</p><p>It is generally accepted that overexpression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>is the major mechanism for the drug resistance of clinical isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our finding that the wild-type cells but not the <italic>cdr1/cdr1 </italic>mutants became more susceptible to fluconazole in serum-containing medium led us to further investigate the effects of serum on <italic>CDR1 </italic>expression. First of all, we have constructed a <italic>CDR1p-RLUC </italic>reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The construct was integrated into the <italic>CDR1 </italic>locus and its activities under different conditions in different strains were determined. The results are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The <italic>C. albicans </italic>cells containing <italic>CDR1p-RLUC </italic>were harvested after being grown in Synthetic Dextrose (SD) liquid medium in the absence or presence of 100 mg/l of miconazole at 35&#x000b0;C for one hour. The expression of <italic>CDR1p-RLUC </italic>was induced approximately 2-fold by miconazole (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, comparing bar 1 to bar 2). This datum is consistent with the previously report that the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>is induced by miconazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and also suggests that the activity of <italic>CDR1p-RLUC </italic>can refer the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>under our experimental setup.</p><p>To determine the effect of serum on the expression of <italic>CDR1</italic>, we have measured the activities of <italic>CDR1p-RLUC </italic>in <italic>C. albicans </italic>cells that were grown in SD liquid medium in the absence or presence of 10% fetal bovine serum at 35&#x000b0;C for one hour. Surprisingly, the serum repressed the expression of <italic>CDR1p-RLUC</italic>. In the presence of the serum, the expression of <italic>CDR1p-RLUC </italic>was reduced to 50% of that in the absence of the serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, comparing bar 1 to bar 3). To determine if human serum also has the same effect, we have also cultured the cells in the presence of 10% human serum from two healthy volunteers. Interestingly, like the fetal bovine serum, the human sera also reduced the expression of <italic>CDR1p-RLUC </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, comparing bar 1 to bars 4 and 5).</p><p>This datum suggests that if the activity of <italic>CDR1p-RLUC </italic>echoes the expression of endogenous <italic>CDR1</italic>, the level of <italic>CDR1 </italic>mRNA would be reduced when <italic>C. albicans </italic>cells were grown in the presence of serum. To investigate this hypothesis, we have measured the level of <italic>CDR1 </italic>mRNAs in different strains by real-time PCR. In the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, the level of <italic>CDR1 </italic>mRNA in the wild-type cells was reduced to approximately 50% of that in the absence of the serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, comparing bar 1 to bar 2), which re-assured the result of the activity assay with <italic>CDR1p-RLUC</italic>. These results conclude that serum represses the expression of <italic>CDR1</italic>. Since serum is a key stimulant for hyphal formation of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we would like to determine whether its effect on <italic>CDR1 </italic>expression is due to a factor solely present in serum or common in other hypha-inducing media also. Consequently, we have determined if 5 mM N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (Glu-NAc), a known inducer for germ tube formation of <italic>C. albicans </italic>would alter the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Unlike serum, Glu-NAc did not have effect on the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, comparing bar 1 and bar 3). This result suggests that the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>is not repressed by every hypha-inducing medium. This is consistent with the previously reported that the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>is increased in <italic>Catup1/Catup1 </italic>mutant cells, which are predominately in hyphal form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Recently, CaNdt80 has been identified as a positive regulator of <italic>CDR1 </italic>in <italic>C. albicans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To investigate if serum represses the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>via CaNdt80, we have also determined the level of <italic>CDR1 </italic>in <italic>Candt80/Candt80 </italic>mutant cells. The expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>was reduced 50% by the null mutation of <italic>CaNDT80 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, comparing bar 1 to bar 4), which is consistent with our previous finding that CaNdt80 regulates <italic>CDR1 </italic>positively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. If regulating the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>by serum is independent of the activity of CaNdt80, the level of <italic>CDR1 </italic>mRNA in the <italic>Candt80/Candt80 </italic>mutant cells would be significantly reduced in the presence of serum. Otherwise, it will not (if there is any). Our data showed that although 10% fetal bovine serum further reduced the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>in the <italic>Candt80/Candt80 </italic>mutant cells, the effect was mild (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, comparing bar 4 to bar 5).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found that the wild-type cells became more susceptible to fluconazole when the medium contained serum. Furthermore, the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>is repressed significantly by serum according to the activity of the reporter and <italic>CDR1 </italic>mRNA level. The level of <italic>CDR1 </italic>mRNA was only mildly reduced by serum in the <italic>Candt80/Candt80 </italic>mutant cells suggesting the major, if not the sole, regulatory ability of serum may be through the activity of CaNdt80. However, we still can not rule out the possibility that serum may also act through Tac1 and/or other unidentified regulators. It will be interesting to investigate the coordination between CaNdt80 and Tac1 in regulating the expression of <italic>CDR1 </italic>in the presence of serum.</p><p>The standard antifungal susceptibility testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which is conducted in the absence of serum, is unreliable in predicting the clinical outcome of therapies, especially for systemic infections. Our finding may explain the existence and persistence of such a discrepancy between the susceptibilities of <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains and media</title><p>Strains of <italic>C. albicans </italic>used in this studyare as following: SC5314, the wild-type control strain; DSY448, <italic>ura3</italic>&#x00394;:: &#x003bb;<italic>imm434</italic>/<italic>ura3</italic>&#x00394;:: &#x003bb;<italic>imm434</italic>; DSY448, <italic>ura3</italic>&#x00394;:: &#x003bb; <italic>imm434</italic>/<italic>ura3</italic>&#x00394;:: &#x003bb;<italic>imm434 cdr1::hisG/cdr1::hisG-URA3-hisG</italic>, a gift from Dr. D.
