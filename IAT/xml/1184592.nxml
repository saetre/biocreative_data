The temporal requirements for insulin signaling during development are, however, unknown. Using a temperature-sensitive insulin receptor (<italic>Inr</italic>) mutation in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> we show that the developmental requirements for Inr activity are organ specific and vary in time. Early in development, before larvae reach the &#x0201c;critical size&#x0201d; (the size at which they commit to metamorphosis and can complete development without further feeding), Inr activity influences total development time but not final body and organ size. After critical size, Inr activity no longer affects total development time but does influence final body and organ size. Final body size is affected by Inr activity from critical size until pupariation, whereas final organ size is sensitive to Inr activity from critical size until early pupal development. In addition, different organs show different sensitivities to changes in Inr activity for different periods of development, implicating the insulin pathway in the control of organ allometry. The reduction in Inr activity is accompanied by a two-fold increase in free-sugar levels, similar to the effect of reduced insulin signaling in mammals. Finally, we find that varying the magnitude of Inr activity has different effects on cell size and cell number in the fly wing, providing a potential linkage between the mode of action of insulin signaling and the distinct downstream controls of cell size and number. We present a model that incorporates the effects of the insulin-signaling pathway into the <italic>Drosophila</italic> life cycle. We hypothesize that the insulin-signaling pathway controls such diverse effects as total developmental time, total body size and organ size through its effects on the rate of cell growth, and proliferation in different organs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Studies using a temperature-sensitive insulin receptor elucidate the temporal requirements for insulin signaling in Drosophila; insulin signaling at different times during development affects many characters, such as total developmental time, total body size and organ size.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development in multicellular animals is a process that involves both tight control and flexibility in the regulation of cell size and cell number. Tight control is necessary to produce an animal in which each organ is of an appropriate size relative to the whole body. Flexibility is necessary to produce an animal in which the whole body is of an appropriate size relative to environmental conditions. One key environmental factor shown to influence size is nutrition. In animals as diverse as humans and flies, malnutrition delays development and reduces adult body and organ size. Recent studies indicate that the insulin-signaling pathway (Gene Ontology ID GO:0008286) coordinates growth with nutritional condition in most metazoans, and is remarkably conserved. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> expression of insulin-like peptides is nutritionally regulated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;, as is expression of IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) in developing rats &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Flies carrying mutations of the insulin receptor <italic>(Inr)</italic> and mice carrying mutations of the IGF1 receptor show delayed development and growth deficiency with a reduction in body and organ size &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b03">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;. These and similar &#x0201c;knock out&#x0201d; experiments have demonstrated the gross effects of the insulin-signaling pathway on adult phenotype. Nevertheless, little is known of how the pathway acts during development to affect changes in the adult. In mice, such elucidation is hampered by the inaccessibility of the developing fetus enclosed in the uterus. In flies, however, developing larvae can be easily studied and manipulated.</p><p>Here we explore the temporal requirement for insulin signaling in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster.</italic> In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> development proceeds through three larval instars to pupariation, pupation, and finally adult eclosion. Feeding is restricted to the first (L1), second (L2), and most of the third (L3) instar. Early in the third instar, the larvae reach a &#x0201c;critical size&#x0201d; at which point they have acquired sufficient nutrients to complete development in the absence of food &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b07">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;. After critical size is attained, larvae stop feeding, leave the food, and search for a pupariation site. There is, however, a delay between the time critical size is reached and the time larvae stop feeding and reach their maximum body size. Both critical size and the time between reaching critical size and the cessation of feeding are unaffected by nutrition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Consequently, nutrition ostensibly affects final adult size through the amount of feeding in the fixed period between critical size and pupariation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Because feeding affects final size only in the period between critical size and pupariation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;, one may predict that insulin signaling affects size only during the same period. However, organ growth continues well after pupariation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d; and is autonomously modulated by the insulin-signaling pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Insulin signaling may therefore continue to influence size after pupariation. Details of the temporal requirements for insulin signaling are unknown in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> but a recent study on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> forkhead transcription factor (dFOXO) suggests that they vary during development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Unphosphorylated dFOXO negatively regulates growth, but activation of the insulin receptor signaling pathway induces dFOXO phosphorylation, excluding it from the nucleus and inhibiting its activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Constitutive activation of dFOXO in the first and second instars causes developmental arrest, whereas dFOXO activation in the third instar causes a reduction in adult size &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Work on <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> also indicates that the timing requirements for insulin signaling might vary during the lifecycle. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the pathway acts during early development to regulate diapause, and during adulthood to influence ageing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Resolving the links between larval size, nutrition, and developmental progression on the one hand, and the time-dependence of insulin-pathway gene effects on the other, requires a more precise understanding of the temporal requirements for insulin signaling during development.</p><p>We have used a temperature-sensitive mutation of the insulin receptor to investigate the role of the insulin-signaling pathway during different stages of development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. By reducing insulin receptor activity at different points in development, we identify the periods of development during which insulin signaling affects adult phenotype. We show that total developmental time is affected by changes in insulin signaling only if those changes occur early in development, before a larva has reached critical size. In contrast, final body and organ size are affected by changes in insulin signaling only if those changes occur late in development, once a larva has passed critical size. Insulin signaling continues to influence organ size, but not body size, after larvae have stopped feeding and throughout much of pupal development. Not all organs respond equally to changes in insulin signaling, however. We find that the genitals show a limited response to suppression of insulin signaling in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies, implicating insulin signaling in the control of allometries.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Temperature-Sensitive Suppression of the Insulin Receptor</title><p>During a study of the interaction of environmental factors and the insulin-signaling pathway, we discovered that flies trans-heteroallelic for insulin receptor mutations <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup></italic> and <italic>Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> show a temperature-sensitive suppression of the insulin pathway. We initially reared <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies, wild-type Oregon-R flies, and flies homozygous for <italic>chico<sup>1</sup></italic>, at 18 &#x000b0;C, 25 &#x000b0;C, and 29 &#x000b0;C, and measured the wing areas of the adults. Chico is the fly ortholog of the insulin receptor substrate. <italic>chico<sup>1</sup></italic> is a null mutation, and homozygotes show a partial loss of insulin receptor function with a more than 50&#x00025; reduction in body size relative to wild-type and a much reduced viability &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Both Oregon-R and <italic>chico<sup>1</sup></italic> homozygote flies showed a smaller wing area with higher rearing temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The response to temperature is the same in both genotypes (the lines relating wing size to temperature are parallel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g001">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that temperature influences size independent of the insulin-signaling pathway. However, <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies have a wing size similar to Oregon-R flies when reared at 18 &#x000b0;C but a wing size similar to <italic>chico<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants when reared at 25 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies show temperature-sensitive suppression of Inr activity. Changing the rearing temperature does not, however, simply switch Inr &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies. At 18 &#x000b0;C, <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies have smaller wings than wild-type flies, suggesting that the insulin receptor is still partially suppressed at this temperature. Additionally, very few <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies survived to adulthood when raised at 25 &#x000b0;C. and none survived at 29 &#x000b0;C. The difference between <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies reared at 18 &#x000b0;C and 25 &#x000b0;C appears, therefore, to be a consequence of the degree to which Inr is suppressed.</p><p>To confirm that these temperature-dependent effects were due to changes in Inr activity, we assessed the activity of the insulin-signaling pathway in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies reared at different temperatures. First, we looked at the cellular localization of dFOXO in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> late third instar larvae reared at 17 &#x000b0;C and at 24 &#x000b0;C. Down-regulation of the insulin-signaling pathway dephosphorylates dFOXO and causes it to move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Antibody stains with anti-dFOXO show an increase in nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of dFOXO in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> larvae when reared at 24 &#x000b0;C relative to 17 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g002">2</xref>B). We did not observe change in nuclear versus cytoplasmic staining for <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup></italic> or <italic>Inr<sup>GC25</sup>/TM6B-Tb</italic> controls reared at 17 &#x000b0;C versus 25 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g002">2</xref>D). Second, we assessed Inr activity in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> second instar larvae using the <italic>tGPH</italic> reporter gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>tGPH</italic> is under the control of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x000df;-tubulin promotor and produces a GFP (green fluorescent protein) fused to the pleckstrin homology domain of the receptor for phosphoinositides-1. Under the action of phosophoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), this fusion protein, GPH, becomes localized to the cell membrane. PI3K is itself activated by the insulin receptor, and so increased localization of GPH to the cell membrane indicates increased Inr activity. In <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> larvae reared at 15 &#x000b0;C, GPH is localized to the membrane, but this localization is lost when the larvae are moved to 25 &#x000b0;C for 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g002">2</xref>F). Localization does not appear to be lost at 25 &#x000b0;C in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup></italic> or <italic>Inr<sup>GC25</sup>/TM6B-Tb</italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g002">Figure 2</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g002">2</xref>H). The phenotypic effects of temperature on <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies do, therefore, appear to be a consequence of temperature-sensitive suppression of the insulin-signaling pathway. However, we do not know the molecular basis for the temperature sensitivity of the <italic>Inr</italic><sup>E19</sup><italic>/Inr</italic><sup>GC25</sup> transheterozygotes. It may arise from temperature-sensitive expression of one or both of the mutant alleles or from decreased function of the mutant receptor at higher temperatures.</p><p>Due to the low viability of <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies reared at 25 &#x000b0;C, all subsequent experiments involved comparisons of flies reared at 17 &#x000b0;C with flies reared at 24 &#x000b0;C. Further, we used the <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic> siblings reared under identical conditions as controls. <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic> flies show only a moderate reduction in Inr activity and have a slight reduction in body size relative to wild-type &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Because temperature affects overall body-size in wild-type flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;, it is necessary to distinguish between changes in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> phenotype that are a consequence of changes in the level of <italic>Inr</italic> expression from those resulting from changes in rearing temperature. To do this we report the phenotype of <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies as a percentage of the phenotype of <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic> control flies that have undergone temperature shifts at the same developmental time.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Changing Role of Insulin Signaling during Development</title><p>We used the temperature-sensitive <italic>Inr</italic> mutants to investigate the role of the insulin pathway during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. We reduced Inr activity during different periods of development by transferring <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies from a permissive 17 &#x000b0;C to a restrictive 24 &#x000b0;C at different points in development. After the switch, the flies were left to complete development at 24 &#x000b0;C. We were able to identify temperature-sensitive periods (TSPs) during which increasingly earlier switches from 17 &#x000b0;C to 24 &#x000b0;C resulted in increasingly abnormal phenotypes.</p><p>Total developmental time is sensitive to Inr activity only before the middle of the third larval instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Switching <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies from 17 &#x000b0;C to 24 &#x000b0;C changes the time to adult eclosion during the first 9 d of development; the earlier the switch, the greater the delay in eclosion. After the ninth day of development at 17 &#x000b0;C, when the flies are approximately 40&#x00025; through the third instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), a shift to the restrictive temperature does not delay adult eclosion. At 17 &#x000b0;C, <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies show a slight delay in eclosion relative to <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic> flies, suggesting that Inr activity is still a little impaired at this temperature. The delay in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies reared at both 17 &#x000b0;C and 24 &#x000b0;C relative to the <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic> controls occurs predominantly through extension of the third instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, adult wing area is sensitive to Inr activity only during late third instar and early pupation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Switching <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies from 17 &#x000b0;C to 24 &#x000b0;C changes adult wing size between day 9 and 20; the earlier the shift, the smaller the wings The precise TSP of female <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies for wing area may be smaller than implied by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g003">Figure 3</xref>A because the data are based on population rather than individual measures. The wings may be insensitive to changes in Inr activity as early as day 17. Before day 9, however, shifting the flies to the restrictive temperature earlier in development has no additional effect on adult wing size. At 17 &#x000b0;C, the wings of <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies are slightly smaller than in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic> control flies, again suggesting that Inr activity is marginally reduced at this temperature.</p><p>We tested whether total body mass was sensitive to Inr activity over the same period as wing size. We compared the dry mass of adult <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> males reared under several thermal conditions: 24 &#x000b0;C, 17 &#x000b0;C, and a series of samples switched from 17 &#x000b0;C to 24 &#x000b0;C on days 9 through 16 (pupariation is at approximately day 13 at 17 &#x000b0;C). Adult body mass is sensitive to reduction in Inr activity between day 9 and day 13 at 17 &#x000b0;C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Shifting <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies to the restrictive temperature after pupariation, and therefore after larvae have stopped feeding, has no influence on adult mass. Shifting the flies earlier than day 9 has no additional effect on adult body mass.</p><p>Inr activity therefore influences total development time, adult wing size, and adult mass for different periods of development. We tested whether the time at which down-regulation of the insulin pathway switches from delaying development to reducing the size of the resulting flies coincides with attainment of critical size. In practice, the critical size is determined as the size at which 50&#x00025; of larvae proceed to pupariation in the absence of food &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d;. We measured the timing of critical size in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies reared at 17 &#x000b0;C under our experimental conditions and found that it is attained at approximately day 9 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), coinciding with the time at which Inr activity switches from affecting developmental time to body size. Therefore, larval critical size coincides with the shift in Inr function.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>A Reduction in Inr Activity Changes Body Chemistry</title><p>To better understand why reduction of Inr activity after pupariation influenced adult wing size but not overall body mass, we measured the protein, lipid, glycogen, and sugar content of <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies reared at 17 &#x000b0;C up to pupariation, then either switched to 24 &#x000b0;C or maintained at 17 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>Reducing Inr activity after pupariation results in an approximate doubling of free-sugar concentration in <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030289-t001">Table 1</xref>).

We chose the maxillary palp rather than another anterior organ because it is similar in size to the genital arch, allowing us to control for absolute size in this comparison.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows the relative areas of wings, genital arch, and maxillary palps of male <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> and male <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic> flies reared at either 17 &#x000b0;C or 24 &#x000b0;C.

By varying the activity of Inr we have demonstrated that these effects depend on when in development the suppression occurs; Inr suppression affects total developmental time early in development, and body and organ size late in development. The transition from affecting developmental time to affecting body and organ size occurs when the fly reaches the critical size, the point at which development can be completed in the absence of food. The effect of reduced Inr activity on size varies from organ to organ, implicating the insulin pathway in the control of allometry in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In addition, varying the magnitude of Inr activity has different effects on cell size and cell number.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Insulin Signaling, Critical Size, and Developmental Delay</title><p>We found that a reduction in Inr activity after critical size does not delay development (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Therefore reducing Inr activity affects total developmental time by delaying the time at which larvae reach critical size. Critical size has been identified as the key stage in insect maturation that determines the point at which, in holometabolous insects, a larva becomes committed to metamorphosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In Drosophila it is also the minimal viable weight necessary to survive pupation. Consequently, because larvae can complete development without any additional feeding after reaching its critical size, the critical size sets the lower limit of final adult size.</p><p>How insects measure critical size is largely unknown. Our results indicate that a reduction in Inr activity delays the point at which <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae reach critical size. We hypothesize that critical size measurement involves a specific organ or organs, and that it is the slow growth of this organ or organs that delays development in <italic>Inr</italic> mutants. Possible candidates include the imaginal discs and the fat body.

Complete removal of the discs does not, however, delay pupariation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Another organ must therefore measure critical size and initiate pupariation, with the immature imaginal discs inhibiting pupariation.

Inr activity influences adult body size and wing size for different periods of development. As expected, adult body size is influenced by Inr activity only between critical size and pupariation, after which the larva does not feed and becomes a &#x0201c;closed system,&#x0201d; neither gaining nor losing mass. However, insulin signaling continues to influence the final size of adult organs well into the pupal stage. <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies switched from 17 &#x000b0;C to 24 &#x000b0;C at pupariation have the same mass as <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies maintained at 17 &#x000b0;C, but have reduced wings. At the same time, the temperature-shifted flies have a much higher free-sugar concentration as adults. These two findings appear to be linked.

For example, at 17 &#x000b0;C, male <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies have body size, wings, maxillary palps, and genital arches approximately 85&#x00025; of wild-type. Increasing the rearing temperature of <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies from 17 &#x000b0;C to 24 &#x000b0;C, however, causes a further reduction in wing, maxillary palp, and overall body size but does not affect the size of the genital arches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Consequently, flies reared at 24 &#x000b0;C have larger genitals relative to their body and wings compared to flies reared at 17 &#x000b0;C. The apparently restricted response of the genitals to changes in insulin signaling is not a consequence of the particular alleles used in this study: <italic>chico</italic>-mutant clones also have much less of an effect on size when they are in the genital arches than when they are in the maxillary palps.</p><p>The mechanism by which different organs respond differently to changes in insulin signaling is unclear.

In 17 &#x000b0;C <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> males, the genital arches, wings, and maxillary palps are all reduced by approximately the same amount relative to 17 &#x000b0;C <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic>males. In the wing, this reduction in area is a consequence of a reduction in cell size. A further decrease in Inr activity (through an increase in rearing temperature to 24 &#x000b0;C) reduces wing area through a reduction in cell number alone. If the genital arches are like the wing, then their response to insulin signaling may be restricted to changes in cell size and not cell number. The cells of the genital arches may therefore be deficient in components of the insulin-signaling pathway that regulate cell number but not components that regulate cell size.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>A Model of the Insulin-Signaling Regulation of Growth and Development</title><p>The insulin-signaling pathway appears to play a different role after critical size than before. Similarly, a temperature-sensitive lethal mutation, <italic>l(1)ts-1126,</italic> which reduces the rate of cell proliferation in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> delays pupariation when larvae are moved to a restrictive temperature before the third instar, but reduces adult size when larvae are moved to a restrictive temperature late in the third instar &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b29">29</xref>&#x0005d;. The two effects of reduced Inr activity may therefore result from the same process: a reduction in the rate of cell growth and proliferation. We have developed a model of the insulin-signaling regulation of growth and development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030289-g007">Figure 7</xref>). (A similar model has recently been developed by Davidowitz and Nijhout &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d; to explain variation in body size in response to temperature in the tobacco hornworm, <italic>Manduca sexta.</italic>) A reduction in Inr activity prior to critical size slows cell growth and proliferation and delays the time at which the larvae reaches critical size. Critical size is not substantially influenced by nutritional conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d; or insulin signaling in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> although this does not seem to be the case for all insects, for example, <italic>M. sexta</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Once critical size is reached, the time to pupariation and adult eclosion is fixed, as are the remaining periods of growth prior to adult differentiation of individual imaginal discs. The duration of these intervals are uninfluenced by nutritional conditions or insulin signaling. A reduction in Inr activity during these periods also slows cell growth and proliferation, but now reduces the amount of growth attained before differentiation, resulting in smaller organs and a smaller fly. Because different structures grow for different periods, they are sensitive to Inr activity at different times. For example, wing size begins to be insensitive to changes in Inr activity at approximately the same time as cell proliferation ceases, around 25&#x00025; into the pupal stage. Adult body mass becomes insensitive to changes in Inr activity just before pupariation, when the larvae stops feeding and final body size is fixed.</p><p>A key component of this model is that after critical size, the remaining periods of growth of individual imaginal discs and of the body as a whole are fixed and uninfluenced by insulin signaling. Our data show that the length of the period between critical size and pupariation, the remaining period of growth of the body as a whole, is not substantially affected by a reduction in Inr activity. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects, this interval is controlled by endocrine events. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> a small peak in the ecdysteroid titer coincides with attainment of critical size &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b31">31</xref>&#x0005d;, followed by a second peak 12 h later, just before the larvae leave the food &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;. In <italic>M.</italic><italic>sexta</italic> this second peak acts directly on the nervous system to initiate wandering behavior &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;, and the same is likely true for <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d;. The period in which Inr activity can influence final body size is therefore terminated by hormones. Importantly, hormones other than insulin also control the period of cell proliferation in the imaginal discs. For example, in <italic>M.</italic><italic>sexta</italic>, ecdysteroids govern the phases of eye development during metamorphosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;. When the ecdysteroid titer rises above a minimum threshold just before pupariation, it stimulates a wave of cell proliferation to pass across the eye primordium. This proliferation is sustained until the ecdysteroid titer rises above a maximum level in the middle of pupal development, whereupon cell proliferation stops and maturation of the ommatidia begin. These and similar data in other insects &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d;, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b43">43</xref>&#x0005d;, suggest that cell proliferation in imaginal discs may be temporally regulated by thresholds of sensitivities to fluctuating levels of ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone (JH) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b44">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Different organs have different thresholds of sensitivity and hence grow for different periods of time. Insulin signaling may therefore control body and organ size by regulating the amount of growth attained during these periods of cell proliferation.</p><p>This model requires that changes in ecdysteroid and JH levels are unaffected by the insulin-signaling pathway. It is known that adult <italic>Inr</italic> and <italic>chico</italic> mutant flies have reduced levels of JH and impaired ovarian ecdysone synthesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the same hormone fluctuations that putatively control the period of cell proliferation also initiate pupariation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030289-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d; and, because the timing of pupariation is unaffected by Inr activity, it seems likely that the temporal dynamics of the hormonal cascade in the larvae are also unaffected by Inr activity. We predict, therefore, that the insulin-signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation in imaginal discs but that the duration of proliferative phases are controlled by other endocrine cues, such as JH and ecdysteroids, that are themselves unaffected by the insulin-signaling pathway.</p><p>This model demonstrates how the pleiotropic effects of insulin signaling on developmental time and final body and organ size can be separated, and may be available for independent evolutionary modification. For example, changes in the relative size of an organ may occur by organ-specific modifications in its growth response to insulin signaling, through organ-specific changes in the expression of <italic>Inr</italic>, adjustments in Inr activity, or adjustments in the expression and activity of downstream components of the insulin-signaling pathway.

In metazoans in general, each organ has a unique timetable for cellular events in tissue development. Our model, and the data upon which it is based, indicate that in order to understand the effects of insulin signaling on adult phenotype it is necessary to understand how temporal changes in insulin signaling interact with this timetable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mutant stocks</title><p><italic>Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> is a chromosomal inversion with a breakpoint upstream of the <italic>Inr</italic>. <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup></italic> is an uncharacterized mutation induced by ethyl methanosulfonate.

We set up four bottles for each temperature regime, each containing standard yeast cornmeal agar medium. Two were the product of male <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM6B-Tb</italic> and female <italic>Inr<sup>GC25</sup>/TM3</italic> and two were the product of female <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM6B-Tb</italic> and male <italic>Inr<sup>GC25</sup>/TM3</italic>. Each bottle contained between 100 and 200 eggs laid over a 4-h period. Temperature shifts were performed according to the median age of flies in each bottle. Larvae were reared on standard yeast cornmeal agar medium. Total developmental time was not significantly different between <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> flies from the two different crosses, so the data from all bottles maintained under the same temperature regime were pooled (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Measurements and data handling</title><p>Bottles were inspected daily at 4:00 <sc>PM</sc> and any flies that had eclosed in the previous 24 h were collected and preserved in 80&#x00025; ethanol.

Digital images of the wings, maxillary palps, and genital arches were captured and measured using IPLab 3.9 (Scanylitics, Fairfax, Virginia, United States). Wing cell size was estimated using the number of trichomes in a 0.01 mm<sup>2</sup> square between the veins IV and V of the dorsal wing blade. An index of the total number of wing cells was estimated by multiplying the number of trichomes in the area by the total wing size and dividing by 0.01. Dry masses of individual male flies were measured with an analytical balance (Mettler Toledo AX26 DeltaRange; Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, Ohio, United States).</p><p>The total developmental time for each fly was converted into degree-days (DDs) to control for the effects of temperature on growth rates. DD is a measure of the heat accumulation above a minimal temperature (T<sub>o</sub>), and is calculated as:</p><p><disp-formula id="pbio-0030289-e001"><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0030289.e001.jpg" position="float" alt-version="no" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>T</italic><sub>r</sub> is the experimental temperature, and <italic>n</italic><sub>r</sub> is the number of days maintained at <italic>T</italic><sub>r</sub>, summed across all experimental temperatures <italic>j</italic> to <italic>k</italic>. In this case, we used only two experimental temperatures, 17 &#x000b0;C and 24 &#x000b0;C. We calculated the value of <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> such that the developmental time of control <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic> flies was constant, irrespective of temperature regime. To do this we regressed total developmental time in DDs of <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic> flies against the time of their temperature shift from 17 &#x000b0;C to 24 &#x000b0;C, using different values of <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>. The value of <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> that minimized the slope of this regression line was found to be 9.978 &#x000b0;C.

When critical size is reached, the ecdysteroid titer again increases, rising above the maximum threshold for cell proliferation in the imaginal discs.

Because the rate of cell proliferation is slowed, the imaginal discs are smaller when they begin to differentiate, reducing final organ size. Different discs have different thresholds of sensitivity to ecdysteroid and so cease cell proliferation at different times. Hormones other than ecdysteroids may also be involved.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0030289.g007"/></fig><table-wrap id="pbio-0030289-t001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Protein, Sugar, Glycogen, and Lipid Content of <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/Inr<sup>GC25</sup></italic> and <italic>Inr<sup>E19</sup>/TM3</italic> Flies Reared at 17 &#x000b0;C until Pupariation and then Switched to 24 &#x000b0;C or Maintained at 17 &#x000b0;C</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0030289.t001"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> JD, LV, DLS, and AWS conceived, designed, and performed the experiments.
