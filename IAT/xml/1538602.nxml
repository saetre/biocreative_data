As the uterus returns to its prepregnancy state, the involuting uterus undergoes a rapid reduction in size primarily due to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, particularly collagen. Membrane type-I matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is one of the major proteinases that degrades collagen and is the most abundant MMP form in the uterus. Matrix metalloproteinase-2(MMP-2) can degrade type I collagen, although its main function is to degrade type IV collagen found in the basement membrane. To understand the expression patterns of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the rat uterus, we analyzed their activities in postpartum uterine involution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed gelatin zymography, northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry to compare the expression levels of MT1-MMP, MMP-2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and the tissue inhibitors of MMPs-1 and 2 (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) in the rat uterus 18 h, 36 h and 5 days after parturition with their expression levels during pregnancy (day 20).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that both MT1-MMP and MMP-2 localized mainly in the cytoplasm of uterine interstitial cells. The expression levels of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 mRNAs and the catalytic activities of the expressed proteins significantly increased 18 h and 36 h after parturition, but at postpartum day 5, their mRNA expression levels and catalytic activities decreased markedly. The expression levels of MMP-9 increased 18 h and 36 h after parturition as determined by gelatin zymography including the expression levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These expression patterns indicate that MT1-MMP, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may play key roles in uterine postpartum involution and subsequent functional regenerative processes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>During pregnancy, the uterus enlarges, which in rats is mainly caused by an increase in the amount of collagen and hypertrophy of the uterine smooth muscle cells.

Although MT1-MMP is abundant in the uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], little is known about its activity or that of MMP-2 during uterine involution.

These results indicate that MMP-2 and MT1-MMP may play key roles in uterine postpartum involution</p><p>During pregnancy, the uterus is transformed into a large muscular organ sufficient to accommodate the fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid. After parturition, the uterus undergoes involution, a conspicuous feature characterized by the rapid decrease in the amount of collagen resulting from the extracellular degradation of collagen bundles. Activated collagenases cleave the collagen bundles into fragments, which then denature at body temperature into gelatin. Gelatinases then cleave the gelatin in small peptides that are rapidly removed in the blood stream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To better understand the functions of MMPs in various uterine processes, we have initiated studies using a rat model for studying the activities of various MMPs in the uterus during pregnancy and after parturition. MT1-MMP, for example, has various functions that include the degradation of several types of collagen, the activations of other MMPs and activities related to apoptosis. This study showed that the expression levels of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 were significantly increased in the cytoplasm of uterine interstitial cells in the first five days after parturition, which suggests that these two enzymes play important roles in the postpartum involution of the enlarged uterus in rats. Various of MMPs are reportedly involved in tissue remodeling during postpartum uterine involution. Stygar et al. reported that cervical stromal fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells were identified as the main sources of MMP-2, whereas MMP-9 protein was observed only in invading leukocytes. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are involved also in the cervical ripening process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Lyons et al. reported that MMP-9 may be involved in preterm labor, cervical maturity, and postpartum uteruine involution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Roh et al. reported that the proMMP-9 in the uterine tissue maybe related to the remodelling of human myometrium during labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We also consider that MMP-9 is related to postpartum uterine involution from the results of our gelatine zymograpy experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3(a)</xref>).</p><p>Evidence suggests that MT1-MMP causes the degradation of collagen types I, IV and V and elastin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and activates membrane-bound pro-MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Although it is thought that the main function of the activated MMP-2 is the degradation of type IV collagen in the basement membrane, it also cleaves type I collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], which is consistent with the finding that during postpartum uterine involution, MT1-MMP and MMP-2 act together to degrade the abundant type I collagen.</p><p>We found that the time courses of the expressions of MMP-2, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 differed from those described in the reports mentioned above. This difference is reflected in part by the transiently high expression level of TIMP-1 observed 18 h after parturition. Because TIMP-1 is known to bind stoichiometrically to almost all MMP active sites, thereby irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme's activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], its upregulation would be expected to mitigate the effect of the abrupt concurrent increase in MMP expression level. On the other hand, the suppression of TIMP-1 transcription 36 h after parturition would likely contribute to the maintenance of a high MMP activity.</p><p>In contrast to TIMP-1, TIMP-2 transcription was enhanced only slightly 5 days after parturition. Although TIMP-2 exerts a strong inhibitory effect on MMPs similar to TIMP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], it also forms MT1-MMP/TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP/TIMP-2/pro-MMP-2 complexes, which are involved in the activation of pro-MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This suggests that at 18 h and 36 h postpartum the slight increase in TIMP-2 expression level induced proMMP-2 activation. In contrast, the much larger increase in TIMP-2 expression level observed 5 days after parturition, which coincides with the decrease in the activities of MT1-MMP and MMP-2, mediated pro-MMP-2 suppression. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that MT1-MMP, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are time-dependently regulated and play important roles in tissue remodeling during postpartum uterine involution.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (11671637) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan to T.
