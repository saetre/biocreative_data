The detailed structure of one of these genes, mouse gamma 4-crystallin (M gamma 4.1), and its corresponding cDNA has been determined. The gene spans approximately 2.6 kilobases (kb) and contains two introns. The gene predicts a polypeptide of 174 amino acids that shares extensive sequence homology with gamma-crystallin polypeptides of other species. The two similar structural domains of the protein correspond exactly to the second and third exons of the gene, supporting an exon-duplication model of gene evolution. The similarity in structure of this gene to that recently reported for a gamma-crystallin gene of the rat (1) suggests that a common structure may exist for all gamma-crystallin genes of the two species. Moreover, a highly conserved region, 50 nucleotides in length, immediately precedes the TATA box of both the mouse and rat genes, suggesting that this sequence may be important in gene regulation.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0102-a" xlink:role="4521"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4517"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4518"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4519"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4520"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4521"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4522"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4523"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4524"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4525"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4526"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4527"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4528"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00329-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4529"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
