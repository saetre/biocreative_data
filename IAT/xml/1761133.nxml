Five core COPII components Sar1, Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 together are sufficient to generate vesicles from liposomes <italic>in vitro</italic>. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, assembly of COPII occurs stochastically on the ER membrane. In <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), and in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), assembly occurs at specific sites known as transitional ER or ER exit sites (ERES); the reason for this restricted localization is unknown. These sites can form de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), are long-lived, and relatively static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Coat protein II vesicles bud from these sites and then rapidly uncoat with COPII subunits recycling for reassembly on the ER membrane. Mammalian homologues of the minimal COPII machinery necessary to form a COPII coat <italic>in vitro</italic> (Sar1, Sec23/24 and Sec13/31) have all been identified. In addition to these five proteins, the <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly process depends on additional proteins. Sec12 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) catalysing GDP&#x02013;GTP exchange on Sar1, a small GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). This results in recruitment of Sec23, the GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Sar1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>); Sec24, the major cargo-binding component of the coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>); and finally Sec13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and Sec31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) which form heterotetramers and assemble as a cuboctahedral coat on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). A further component, Sec16, has been characterized in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and <italic>P. pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In these organisms, Sec16 encodes a large (&#x0223c;240 kD) protein, which binds to Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Its role appears to stabilize the GTP-bound state of Sar1 and to direct assembly of other COPII subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Notably, Sec16 is required to reconstitute GTP-dependent budding as opposed to vesicle formation in the presence of poorly hydrolyzable GTP analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which COPII assembly is restricted to ERES remains unknown. In mammalian cells, Sec12 and Sar1 are localized uniformly across the ER membrane with some accumulation in to ERES [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and D. J. S., unpublished observations]. In contrast, Sec16 and the downstream COPII proteins, Sec23/24 and Sec13/31, are exclusively localized to punctate structures at, or in the immediate vicinity of, ERES. There has been some debate as to whether a Sec16 orthologue exists in mammals and the only hint to date has been the identification of a protein of &#x0223c;250 kD that cross-reacts with an antibody directed against the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sec16 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Here, we identify and provide initial characterization of the mammalian homologue of Sec16. We show that the human Sec16 is a peripheral membrane protein that is tightly associated with ERES, at which it recycles on and off the membrane. Overexpression or depletion of Sec16 significantly affects membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi apparatus. We also find that Sar1-GTP is required to maintain the localization of Sec16 to ERES and find that Sar1-GTP induces assembly of Sec16 in to higher order structures. Together, our data show that Sec16 defines ERES in mammalian cells.</p><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Sec16 has been identified in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>P. pastoris</italic>. The sequences of these genes show highest homology in a central region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). We have used this region to search the human genome sequence and have identified a previously uncharacterized transcript (KIAA0310; GenBank accession AB002308) encoding the human orthologue of Sec16. Further database searching shows that multiple splice forms of Sec16 are expressed together in the same tissue and that additional species homologues can be found in <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Bos taurus</italic>, <italic>Canis familiaris</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and other species. In all cases, the protein encoded by the gene is large (&#x0223c;250 kD) and shows regions of conservation in the central and C-terminal domains that in yeast bind to Sec23/24 and Sec13/31, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). This suggests a high evolutionary conservation of Sec16 from fungi to vertebrates.</p><p>Endogenous human Sec16 localize exclusively to ERES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>). Enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Sec16 expressed in HeLa cells also localize to ERES. Endogenous Sec16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>), or EGFP-Sec16 at low expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B, C</xref>), co-localized with COPII proteins Sec24C and Sec31A. Localization across the entire ER membrane was not observed. The EGFP-Sec16 puncta co-aligned with the underlying ER membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1D</xref>) as is seen for other COPII components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Consistent with the localization of other COPII components (for examples see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>)), Sec16 was accumulated in the juxtanuclear region of cells. Sec16-positive spots align very closely but are distinct from Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1E</xref> showing endogenous Sec16 and 1F showing GFP-Sec16). The EGFP-Sec16 showed indistinguishable dynamics from other COPII proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Mobility was restricted to small areas and punctate spots of EGFP-Sec16 fluorescence were long-lived and stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2A</xref>). We did not observe any highly mobile EGFP-Sec16-positive structures even at frame rates of up to 50 frames/second. The same localization and dynamics of EGFP-Sec16 was observed in other human cell lines as well as those from rat, monkey and potoroo (data not shown). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-Sec16 expressed at low levels recycled rapidly on and off the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>, solid symbols) as is seen for other COPII subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). This is also consistent with the incorporation of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sec16 in to budding vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). An alternative explanation is that mammalian Sec16 cycles between a membrane-bound (ERES) pool and a cytosolic pool. At high expression levels, no recovery of fluorescence was seen suggesting that EYFP-Sec16 has irreversibly accumulated on the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>, open symbols). Cell fractionation experiments showed that endogenous human Sec16 could be eluted from membranes with high salt concentrations (0.5 <sc>m</sc>) or high pH, but not with 1% Triton-X-100 (TX-100) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with the properties described for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sec16 which is a tightly associated peripheral membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Localization of human Sec16</title><p>A) Immunofluorescence labelling of HeLa cells with anti-Sec16 (red in merge) and anti-Sec24C (green) antibodies.

Expression of EGFP-Sec16 at low levels caused some minor displacement of Sec24C and Sec31A from ERES (especially noticeable in the juxtanuclear region, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B, C</xref>); high expression of EGFP-Sec16 caused a near complete loss of punctate staining of Sec24C and Sec31A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A, B</xref>). High expression of EGFP-Sec16 caused complete relocalization of ER&#x02013;Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC-53) to the ER (confirmed by double labelling with anti-calnexin antibodies, not shown) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, expression of GFP-Sec16 at high levels caused a complete loss of COPI from peripheral puncta leaving only some juxtanuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting an inhibition of early secretory pathway function. This juxtanuclear pool of COPI co-localized with markers of the Golgi apparatus (giantin, not shown) and suggests that there is a Golgi-localized pool of COPI that does not require ongoing COPII function for its association with Golgi membranes.

In cells overexpressing enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP)-Sec16 at high level, export of tsO45-G-YFP from the ER and transport to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4A</xref>, asterisk, 30 min after shift to the permissive temperature) was completely inhibited. Note that the adjacent cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4A</xref> expressing a low level of CFP-Sec16 (localizing exclusively to ERES) shows no inhibition of transport to the Golgi apparatus. Further transport of tsO45-G-YFP to the plasma membrane (PM) (measured 90 min after shift to the permissive temperature) was completely inhibited by high expression of CFP-Sec16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4B</xref>).

Immunoblotting with antibodies directed against Sec16 showed that we were able to efficiently deplete Sec16 with a pool of four duplexes as well as with individual duplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A</xref>). One duplex depleted only one of the two bands observed, suggesting that it is not effective against all splice forms that are expressed in HeLa cells. The role of these different splice forms remains unclear. Depletion of lamin A/C was used as a control and none of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes used caused any changes in expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5A</xref>). Using a pool of four siRNA duplexes targeting Sec16 (Sec16 smartPOOL), we found that depletion of Sec16 resulted in fewer punctate spots of Sec24C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5B</xref>) and Sec31A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5C</xref>) within the cell, particularly significant within the juxtanuclear area. Quantification of the number of spots in the periphery of cells shows a decrease from 25 &#x000b1; 10/10 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> in lamin A/C-depleted cells to 4 &#x000b1; 3/10 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> in Sec16-depleted cells (<italic>n</italic> = 100 cells from three independent experiments). Similarly, ERGIC-53 was seen to be localized to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5D</xref>), fewer punctate spots of COPI were visible in the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5E</xref>), and giantin localization was more dispersed and puncta compared with its typical ribbon-like appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5F</xref>). Ninety-six per cent of cells show these distributions following depletion of Sec16, likely a reflection of siRNA transfection (or depletion) efficiency. The same results were obtained when siRNA experiments were performed both with a pool of four duplexes as well as individual duplexes included in the pool and other independent duplexes, including the one targeting the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of the Sec16 messenger RNA (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>).</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Depletion of Sec16 from human cells disrupts COPII assembly and ER-to-Golgi transport</title><p>A) Depletion of Sec16 expression using siRNA.

In a quantitative assay of tsO45-G transport to the PM, the amount of protein reaching the PM following depletion of Sec16 is approximately 50% for the 30- and 90-min time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6A</xref>). The statistical significance was confirmed using <sc>anova</sc> (asterisks, p &#x0003c; 0.04); differences within an individual experiment were greater than those across the three independent experiments that have been pooled for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6A</xref>. This inhibition of transport results from a delay in ER export and accumulation in the Golgi apparatus, shown by the localization of the protein during the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B</xref>). Note the accumulation of the protein in the Golgi apparatus in Sec16-depleted cells 30 min after shift to the permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B</xref>). We were unable to deplete Sec16 protein levels further with any of the duplexes tested, possibly due to high stability of the protein or reflecting an essential function. Multiple immunoblots show that depletion is a maximum of 80%. Our inability to further deplete Sec16 probably underlies the incomplete inhibition of transport that we observe in the localization and transport assays. Depletion using siRNA is not the same as a gene knockout in yeast (in which all of the protein is absent) and this could explain the lack of complete inhibition of transport seen here.</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>A) Cells depleted of either Lamin A/C or Sec16 were infected with Adenovirus to express tsO45-G-YFP at 39.5&#x000b0;C followed by incubation at 32&#x000b0;C for the times indicated</title><p>Cells were depleted of either Lamin A/C (filled bars) or Sec16 (using a pool of four duplexes, open bars).

Here, we found that in human cells, expression of Sar1-T39N [a GDP-restricted form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>)] resulted in a near complete loss of Sec16 and Sec24 from punctate structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7A</xref>, also Sec31, not shown). Note that Sec16 and Sec24C co-localize in non-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7A</xref>); in Sar1-T39N-transfected cells, those puncta that remain contain both Sec16 and Sec24C (albeit very faintly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7A</xref>, box), suggesting that they are indeed <italic>bona fide</italic> ERES. Quantification shows that &#x0003e;90% of Sec24 was lost from these sites (<italic>n</italic> = 200 ERES from four independent experiments). Expression of ECFP-Sar1-T39N together with Venus-Sec16 resulted in localization of Venus-Sec16 to punctate spots but displacement of &#x0003e;95% of Sec24C from the membrane [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7B</xref> (<italic>n</italic> = 200 ERES from four independent experiments)]. Again the presence of very faint Sec24 localization to these sites strongly suggests that they are indeed <italic>bona fide</italic> ERES. These data suggest that, at endogenous levels of expression, Sec16 requires Sar1-GTP for association with ERES; however, when overexpressed, Venus-Sec16 can assemble at ERES independent of GTP-loading of Sar1. We interpret this as an inherent capacity of the protein to self-assemble that is exaggerated on overexpression. An alternative explanation is that the higher levels of Sec16 resulting from overexpression are able to bind to pre-existing ERES more efficiently. This result is in direct contrast to the situation in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, where expression of Sar1-T34N does not cause a loss of Sec16 or Sec23/24 from ERES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). While this might reflect a difference between these species, it could also be explained by differences in expression level. Previous work has shown that GTP is required with Sar1 to recruit <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sec16 to dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/dioleolyphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPC/DOPE) liposomes (although Sec16 binds independently to other liposomes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). As Sec16 does not become recruited to the entire ER membrane (where Sar1 will become activated by Sec12), the simplest interpretation of our data is that Sar1-GTP is required to maintain the association of Sec16 with ERES, perhaps by preventing its dissociation. Overexpression of GFP-Sec16 overcomes this, such that ERES are maintained even in the presence of Sar1-T39N. These data further support the idea of self-assembly of higher order Sec16 structures.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Sar1-GTP mediates assembly of Sec16 at ERES</title><p>A) Cells expressing ECFP-Sar1-T39N (GDP restricted, blue in merge) were labelled with antibodies to detect endogenous Sec16 (green) and Sec24C (red).

In addition to localizing to these juxtanuclear structures, Sec16 also remained associated, albeit at reduced levels, with peripheral puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7C</xref>, arrowheads). These Sec16 peripheral puncta were not labelled with antibodies against Sec23/24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7C</xref>) or Sec13/31 but were still associated with the ER membrane (data not shown). More than 50 cells were inspected in each of the three independent experiments. Thus, Sec16 localizes to ERES independent of Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 and is therefore a <italic>bona fide</italic> marker of these sites in a way that other COPII proteins are not. This experiment is consistent with recent quantitative data showing that the majority (&#x0223c;80%) of COPII label is associated with free vesicles and tubules and not with the ERES membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Our interpretation is that in the presence of Sar1-H79G, those structures that move to the centre of the cell are these free vesicles and tubules (presumably driven to the centre by a dynein&#x02013;dynactin-based process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>)), while a significant amount of Sec16 remains associated with the ERES. This reinforces the idea that Sec16, rather than the other previously identified mammalian COPII homologues, defines an ERES, while Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 define COPII-coated vesicles.</p><p>Strikingly, when imaging cells expressing both ECFP-Sar1-H79G and Venus-Sec16, we observed the formation of large ring-like structures visible in the cell periphery that were strongly labelled with Venus-Sec16 and also, more weakly, with ECFP-Sar1-H79G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7D</xref>). Three-dimensional rendering revealed these structures to be curved or near spherical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7E</xref>). Immunofluorescence showed that these structures do not contain Sec23/24 or Sec13/31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7F</xref>) but do align with the underlying ER membrane (not shown). These structures were not visible following expression of ECFP-Sar1-H79G alone but only appeared following co-expression of both ECFP-Sar1-H79G and Venus-Sec16. Their size is always limited to a diameter of &#x0003c;2 &#x003bc;m. These higher order structures likely reflect an exaggerated state but implicate Sar1-GTP in the organization and/or maintenance of Sec16-containing structures. However, this assembly does not occur all across the ER membrane but at restricted sites. As shown above, these structures do not contain Sec23/24 or Sec13/31 and so probably represent a hyper-assembled state of Sec16 that is not able to direct further assembly of COPII. These structures contain a significant amount of Sec16 and a small amount of Sar1; it is possible that Sec16 stabilizes a curved membrane domain generated by Sec16-mediated concentration of Sar1-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Alternatively, Sec16 might induce curvature of the membrane in its own right. Similar curved structures have been seen in electron micrographs of cells expressing Sar1-GTP alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Sec16 is known to stabilize the GTP-bound form of Sar1 to facilitate productive budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Furthermore, at high concentrations, Sar1-GTP can induce curvature of membranes and GTP hydrolysis drives vesicle fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). We propose that Sec16 serves to concentrate and stabilize Sar1-GTP, such that this membrane deformation and scission occurs only at ERES rather than all across the ER where Sar1 is less concentrated.</p><p>We conclude that in human cells, Sec16 is required for secretory cargo traffic from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Sec16 and Sar1 appear to have an interdependent relationship, in which the localization of Sec16 to the ER membrane depends on Sar1-GTP. In addition, the stable accumulation of Sar1-GTP&#x02013;Sec23/24-cargo complexes also requires Sec16. We therefore propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8</xref>) as follows. Sar1-GDP (red) can be activated to the GTP-bound state (Sar1-GTP, green) by Sec12 (yellow) at sites all across the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8A</xref>). This would allow continued &#x02018;sampling&#x02019; of membrane proteins (e.g. cargo, blue) for inclusion in budding vesicles and concomitant binding of Sec23/24 (cyan) to both Sar1-GTP and transmembrane cargo. Cargo itself can stabilize the GTP-bound form of Sar1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), which would probably result in recruitment of Sec23/24, which can bind to both Sar1-GTP and cargo directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8B</xref>). Sec12 activates Sar1 with a 10-fold higher turnover rate than the GAP activity of Sec23/24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), which suggests that these complexes would have some stability. This could result in direct recruitment of Sec16 (light magenta), or more likely given the discrete localization of Sec16 to ERES, diffusion of these cargo-Sar1-GTP complexes within the ER membrane, such that they would encounter a Sec16 assembly and be &#x02018;captured&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, Sar1-GTP is not required for recruitment of Sec16 per se but is required to maintain its assembly at ERES. Sec16 can bind Sec23/24 independently of Sar1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and so could act as a reservoir for these COPII subunits. The final budding step requires Sar1-GTP, such that curvature is induced for vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Turnover of GTP by Sar1 could result in disassembly of these complexes. In yeast, Sec16 does not affect the GTPase rate of Sar1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), and so induction of curvature would require some mechanism to maintain a pool of Sar1-GTP. Sec12 does not bind Sec16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) and is not incorporated in to the nascent vesicle and so might not be able to perform this function at these sites. There are two obvious possibilities for the maintenance of Sar1-GTP here. One is that the assembly of Sec16, Sar1-GTP, Sec23/24 and cargo is sufficient to induce membrane curvature (i.e. the onset of vesicle formation), such that Sec13/31 becomes recruited. Sec13/31 in itself forms cages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), suggesting that it might prefer to adopt a curved structure rather than a planar lattice. Sec13/31 further stimulates the GTPase rate of Sar1 above that of Sec23/24 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>); such that Sar1 dissociates from the fully coated, budded vesicle and uncoating is triggered. Alternatively, other components might modulate the GTPase cycle of Sar1 in the same way that Sed4 has been proposed to function in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). We have not been able to identify a mammalian Sed4 homologue by sequence alignment but this does not preclude its existence; another unrelated protein could also perform this function.</p><fig id="fig08" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model to describe Sec16 function in mammalian cells</title><p>A) The small GTPase Sar1-GDP (red) can be recruited to the ER membrane by Sec12 (its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, yellow).

Complexes of Sar1-GTP-cargo-Sec23/24 can diffuse within the plane of the ER membrane. GTP turnover on Sar1 could lead to its dissociation here while cargo and Sec23/24 remain associated. C) Sec16 assemblies could act to capture and stabilize cargo-Sec23/24 complexes either in the presence or absence of Sar1. Sec16 acts to concentrate Sar1-GTP-cargo-Sec23/24 pre-budding complexes such that membrane deformation occurs.

Our data indicate that Sec16 has the capacity to assemble on the ER membrane and that its persistence on the membrane is controlled by the GTPase activity of Sar1. We hypothesize that assembly of Sec16 co-ordinates the assembly of the COPII pre-budding complex of Sar1, Sec23/24 and thereby provides the spatial coordination for rapid, productive COPII budding events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>All cell lines [HeLa (ATCC CRL-2), NRK (ATCC CRL-6509), Hs68 (ATCC CRL-1635), PtK2 (ATCC CCL-56), Vero (CCL-81) or Ad293 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA)] were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum.
