The protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is inactivated in a wide range of human cancers, an alteration that is associated with a poor prognosis. Because PTEN has been reported to play a role in the maintenance of embryonic and tissue-specific stem cells, we investigated the role of the PTEN/Akt pathway in the regulation of normal and malignant mammary stem/progenitor cell populations. We demonstrate that activation of this pathway, via PTEN knockdown, enriches for normal and malignant human mammary stem/progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of PTEN in normal human mammary epithelial cells enriches for the stem/progenitor cell compartment, generating atypical hyperplastic lesions in humanized NOD/SCID mice. Akt-driven stem/progenitor cell enrichment is mediated by activation of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway through the phosphorylation of GSK3-&#x003b2;. In contrast to chemotherapy, the Akt inhibitor perifosine is able to target the tumorigenic cell population in breast tumor xenografts. These studies demonstrate an important role for the PTEN/PI3-K/Akt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell populations and suggest that agents that inhibit this pathway are able to effectively target tumorigenic breast cancer cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Healthy adult tissues are maintained through the regulated proliferation of a subset of cells known as tissue stem and progenitor cells. Many cancers, including breast cancer, also are thought to arise from and be maintained by a small population of cells that display stem cell-like properties. These so-called &#x0201c;cancer stem cells&#x0201d; may also contribute to tumor spread (metastasis), resistance to treatment, and disease relapse. Effective, long-lasting cancer treatments likely will need to target and eliminate these cancer stem cells specifically. Regulatory pathways responsible for maintaining cancer stem cells therefore may be promising targets for treatment. Breast cancers in humans frequently display abnormalities in the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway. We demonstrate using cell culture and a mouse model of breast cancer that stem or progenitor cells in both normal breast tissue and breast tumors are dependent for their continued growth on this pathway and on the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway. We further show that the drug perifosine, which inhibits the kinase Akt, is able specifically to reduce the population of breast cancer stem or progenitor cells growing in mice. Our findings support the idea that drugs that selectively target breast cancer stem cells through the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway may reduce tumor growth and metastasis and result in improved patient outcomes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is increasing evidence that a variety of cancers, including those of the breast, may be driven by a component of tumor-initiating cells that retain stem cell-like properties.

Furthermore, this increase was maintained upon serial passage to tertiary mammospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). To provide additional evidence that this pathway enriches for mammary stem/progenitor cells, we determined the effect of PTEN knockdown on the percentage of cells expressing ALDH as assessed by the Aldefluor assay. Primary NMECs from reduction mammoplasties contain between 4&#x00025; and 9&#x00025; Aldefluor-positive cells, which increases to 14&#x00025;&#x02013;19&#x00025; in primary mammospheres, consistent with the enrichment of stem/progenitor cells when grown in suspension cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000121.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). PTEN knockdown increased the proportion of Aldefluor-positive cells (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) in mammospheres more than 2-fold to 37&#x00025;&#x02013;41&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, knockdown of PTEN resulted in enrichment of mammary stem/progenitor cells in vitro as determined by both mammosphere and Aldefluor assays. We previously observed that while mammary stem/progenitor cells are enriched in mammosphere cultures, they are depleted in attachment cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000121.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).

We used this system to examine the effects of PTEN knockdown on mammary development. Serial dilutions of flow cytometry-sorted cells were introduced into the humanized fat pads of NOD/SCID mice. As indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000121.s008">Table S1</xref>, at all dilutions, NMECs with PTEN knockdown were more efficient in generating outgrowths than DsRed control cells. While at least 10,000 control cells were required for efficient outgrowth formation, as few as 250 PTEN knockdown cells generated outgrowths in 50&#x00025; of the mice, indicating that PTEN knockdown increased the frequency of multipotent mammary stem/progenitors. In addition, we observed significant morphological alterations in structures generated by PTEN knockdown in NMECs compared to DsRed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). PTEN knockdown cells produced much larger structures that displayed significant morphologic alterations. Knockdown of PTEN was confirmed by the lack of PTEN expression in PTEN knockdown outgrowths compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, a and h). We used immunohistochemical staining for markers of myoepithelial, basal, and luminal epithelial cells to ascertain the effects of PTEN knockdown on cellular differentiation. Outgrowths generated by control-infected NMECs consisted of ductal structures that were characterized by a single layer of myoepithelial cells, which expressed smooth muscle actin recapitulating the architecture of normal mammary ducts in humans. In contrast, structures generated by PTEN shRNA-infected cells were characterized by gross disorganization with increased numbers of smooth muscle actin expressing myoepithelial cells distributed throughout the gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, b and i). Glands produced by control cells contained only a small number of cells expressing the primitive cytokeratins 5/6, whereas the frequency of these cells was greatly increased in PTEN knockdown structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, c and j). Examination of epithelial markers also revealed significant differences between structures derived from PTEN knockdown and control cells. In control structures, the majority of the luminal epithelial cells expressed the luminal marker CK18, whereas expression of this marker occurred only in a subfraction of PTEN knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, d and k). Estrogen receptor (ER) was expressed in luminal epithelial cells in structures generated from DsRed control cells, but not in structures derived from PTEN knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, e and l). Furthermore, structures with PTEN knockdown displayed significant increases in proliferating cells as determined by Ki67 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, f and m). Consistent with the in vitro experiments, PTEN knockdown also increased the proportion of cells expressing ALDH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, g and n). These experiments confirm and extend the in vitro findings and suggest that in addition to resulting in enrichment of the stem/progenitor cell pool, activation of the PTEN/PI3-K/Akt pathway affects cellular growth and differentiation. This results in the generation of cells displaying increased proliferation, with aberrant differentiation resulting in increased expression of primitive and basal markers and decreased expression of luminal epithelial markers. All of these histopathologic features are characteristic of atypical ductal hyperplasia, a premalignant lesion that may progress to invasive breast cancer.</p><fig id="pbio-1000121-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000121.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Knockdown of PTEN in NMECs generates disorganized hyperplastic lesions in humanized NOD/SCID mice.</title><p>(A) Human mammary outgrowths generated from control or PTEN knockdown NMECs in humanized NOD/SCID mice exhibited an altered morphology by hematoxylin and eosin staining.

As shown by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), control MCF7 cells expressed PTEN, but not phospho-Akt. Knockdown of PTEN with an shRNA lentivirus resulted in Akt activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). SUM159 cells display a baseline level of phospho-Akt expression, which was further enhanced by PTEN knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). To determine whether reduction of PTEN expression affected the mammary cancer stem/progenitor cell components of these cell lines, we used tumorsphere and Aldefluor assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000121-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, knockdown of PTEN increased tumorsphere formation in both MCF7 and SUM159 breast carcinoma cells.

Although considerable progress has been made in identifying &#x0201c;cancer stem cells&#x0201d; in a variety of hematologic and solid human malignancies, the pathways that drive transformation of these cells are poorly understood.

Compared with differentiated normal mammary epithelial cells in monolayer cultures, mammospheres displayed significantly higher levels of Akt phosphorylation. This was accompanied by increased GSK3-&#x003b2; phosphorylation and &#x003b2;-catenin activation, suggesting that the &#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway may have a role in maintaining mammary stem/progenitor cell population. The Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway has previously been shown to play a role in mammary stem cell function in transgenic mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Brennan1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. To examine the role of these signaling pathways in mammary stem cell function, we used both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. Knockdown of PTEN using a PTEN shRNA lentiviruses resulted in an enrichment of mammary stem/progenitor cells in vitro as evidenced by mammosphere formation and by the expression of ALDH as assessed by the Aldefluor assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Ginestier1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Increases in percentage of Aldelfuor-positive cells and mammosphere formation were seen in PTEN knockdown cells even when they were initially cultured in attached conditions, indicating that PTEN knockdown maintains a higher proportion of mammary stem/progenitors. We have previously demonstrated an enrichment of stem/progenitor cells within the Aldefluor-positive cell population as well as in mammospheres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Ginestier1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Dontu3">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. We next examined the effects of Akt activation via PTEN knockdown on the formation of mammary outgrowths in NOD/SCID mice whose mammary glands were humanized by the introduction of human mammary fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Ginestier1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Proia1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Control structures generated from DsRed-infected NMECs were composed of CK18&#x0002b; epithelial cells, a portion of which also expressed ER&#x003b1;, surrounded by a single layer of smooth muscle actin expressing myoepithelial cells. These structures closely resembled those found in normal human mammary ducts. In contrast, PTEN shRNA lentivirus-infected cells generated hyperplastic structures exhibiting gross tissue disorganization. This was characterized by an increase in cells expressing primitive cytokeratins 5 and 6 and a decrease in cells expressing the luminal marker CK18, indicating an expansion of primitive cells. This was further evidenced by a lack of ER&#x003b1; expression. Furthermore, these disorganized structures contained an increased proportion of proliferating cells, as evidenced by Ki67 expression and an expansion of ALDH1-expressing cells. All of these histologic characteristics resembled those of atypical ductal hyperplasia, one of the most common premalignant lesions in humans that is believed to be a precursor of DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) and invasive ductal carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Arpino1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our studies provide a potential molecular explanation for these findings by suggesting that PTEN knockdown and subsequent Akt activation may regulate mammary stem cell self-renewal with an accompanying alteration in cellular differentiation, events which may be important during the initiating stages of carcinogenesis.</p><p>Utilizing the SP from MCF7 cells, Zhou et al., recently suggested that the PTEN/mTOR/STAT3 pathway is required for the maintenance of breast cancer stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Zhou1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. We detected a 2-fold enrichment of Aldefluor-positive cells in the SP population, suggesting that these assays detect distinct, although partially overlapping, cell populations. We found no evidence for mTOR regulation of normal or malignant mammary stem/progenitor cells. There might be several explanations for this discrepancy. A number of reports have indicated that inhibition of mTOR results in the activation of Akt through a positive-feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Wang2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Sun1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that mammary stem cells are not contained within the SP population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Stingl1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to the report by Zhou et al., we used both pharmacologic and genetic approaches to elucidate the downstream signaling pathways of Akt in both normal and malignant mammary stem/progenitor cells. Treatment of NMECs with the PI3-K inhibitor Ly294002, or the Akt inhibitors IV and perifosine, reduced mammosphere formation and the Aldefluor-positive cell population. The effect of perifosine on the PI3-K/Akt pathway has previously been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Hideshima1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Jin1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been reported that Akt may regulate Wnt signaling through Akt phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3-&#x003b2;, which in turn mediates &#x003b2;-catenin degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Pap1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> or, directly by phosphorylating &#x003b2;-catenin on serine 552, promoting the nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-He1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, by these two mechanisms, Akt activation promotes the activation and accumulation of nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Monick1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. We demonstrated in mammospheres that Akt phosphorylation was associated with increased phosphorylation of GSK3-&#x003b2; and activation of &#x003b2;-catenin. GSK3-&#x003b2; targets &#x003b2;-catenin for ubiquitin-mediated degradation through phosphorylation of its N-terminal serine and threonine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Munemitsu1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. To demonstrate the importance of &#x003b2;-catenin in mammosphere formation, we used a &#x003b2;-catenin shRNA lentivirus to knock down &#x003b2;-catenin expression. This resulted in significantly reduced mammosphere formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the GSK3-&#x003b2; inhibitor Bio rescued the effects of Akt inhibition on mammosphere formation. To examine more directly the activation of the Wnt pathway, we used a TOP-GFP reporter system that is activated by &#x003b2;-catenin signaling. The Akt inhibitor perifosine significantly reduced the proportion of TOP-GFP expressing cells, an effect that was reversed by Bio. The relevance of these findings to mammary development in vivo was determined by examining the expression and cellular localization of phospho-Akt and &#x003b2;-catenin in mammary outgrowths generated from control and PTEN knockdown NMECs. While cells from control outgrowths showed minimal phospho-Akt expression and membranous &#x003b2;-catenin localization, outgrowths from PTEN shRNA lentivirus-infected cells demonstrated increased phospho-Akt expression and nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin localization. The importance of this pathway was demonstrated by the ability of the Akt inhibitor perifosine to completely block mammary development in the mouse model. Together these in vitro and mouse experiments suggest that the effects of Akt on mammary stem/progenitor cells are mediated by GSK3-&#x003b2; phosphorylation and &#x003b2;-catenin activation.</p><p>To determine whether the PTEN/Akt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway also plays a role in the regulation of malignant mammary stem/progenitor cells, we used both breast cancer cell lines and a primary tumor xenograft. Although Hollestelle et al. reported an activating <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation in MCF7 cells, they did not determine whether this mutation resulted in activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Hollestelle1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, Neve et al. screened 38 breast cancer cell lines including MCF7 for various pathways and found that MCF7 cells displayed significantly low levels of the PI3/Akt activation when compared with other cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Neve1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. This was confirmed in a recent report demonstrating that despite harboring a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> helical mutation, MCF7 cells displayed a low level of AKT phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-StemkeHale1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, these authors found no correlation between similar activating mutations of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> in primary tumors and patient survival or the chemoresistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-StemkeHale1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Most importantly, they found no evidence that these mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> resulted in activation of Akt pathway as compared with the wild-type <italic>PIK3CA,</italic> but there was a strong correlation between <italic>PTEN</italic> inactivating mutation and activation of Akt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-StemkeHale1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with latter reports, we found that PTEN knockdown in MCF7 or SUM159 resulted in activation of PI3-K/Akt pathway. We demonstrated that activation of this pathway through knockdown of PTEN significantly increased tumorsphere formation and the ALDH-expressing cell population, indicating an enrichment of cancer stem/progenitor cells. Moreover, enrichment of the cancer stem/progenitor cell population directly correlated with increased tumorigenicity. Since this population mediates tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Korkaya1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, it suggests that Akt activation enhances tumorigenesis through effects on the cancer stem/progenitor cell population. Furthermore, as was the case for NMECs, we demonstrated that Akt effects on mammary carcinoma stem/progenitor cells are mediated by Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. By using the TOP-GFP reporter system, we found that inhibition of Akt signaling significantly reduced the number of GFP-positive cells, an effect that was rescued with the GSK3-&#x003b2; inhibitor Bio. These findings are in agreement with the findings of Li et al., who reported that Wnt-induced mouse mammary tumors show expansion of stem/progenitor population as characterized by increased stem cell markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000121-Li2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

Improved clinical outcomes may require the development of strategies that are able to target this cancer stem cell population. The demonstration that Akt signaling plays a prominent role in stem cell self-renewal makes it an attractive target for such strategies. We used the Akt inhibitor perifosine, an orally bioactive alkylphospholipid, to determine its effects on Aldefluor-positive cell population. We demonstrate both in in vitro and in mouse xenograft models that perifosine is able to target the Aldefluor-positive tumorigenic cell population as determined by the Aldefluor assay and by reduced tumorigenicity upon serial transplantation. Furthermore, tumorigenic Aldefluor-positive cells remaining after perifosine treatment generated secondary tumors that were still sensitive to perifosine. In contrast, the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel, although capable of causing tumor regression, failed to target the Aldefluor-positive cell population. If cancer stem cells indeed contribute to tumor resistance and relapse, then the addition of agents that are capable of targeting these cells may increase the clinical efficacy of current therapies. Our studies identify inhibitors of the PI3-K/Akt/Wnt signaling pathway as potential agents for therapeutic targeting of cancer stem cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Lines and Reagents</title><p>The MCF7 cell line was maintained in RPMI supplemented with 5&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 &#x000b5;g/ml insulin, and antibiotic-antimycotic.
