Its product, L-DOPA, is an established treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that TH regulation influences locomotion. Site-specific phosphorylation of TH at ser31 and ser40 regulates activity. No direct evidence shows that ser40 phosphorylation is the dominating mechanism of regulating TH activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, and physiologically-relevant stimuli increase L-DOPA biosynthesis independent of ser40 phosphorylation. Significant loss of locomotor activity occurs in aging as in PD, despite less loss of striatal DA or TH in aging compared to the loss associated with symptomatic PD. However, in the substantia nigra (SN), there is equivalent loss of DA or TH in aging and at the onset of PD symptoms. Growth factors increase locomotor activity in both PD and aging models and increase DA bioavailability and ser31 TH phosphorylation in SN, suggesting that ser31 TH phosphorylation status in the SN, not striatum, regulates DA bioavailability necessary for locomotor activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology and Principal Findings</title><p>We longitudinally characterized locomotor activity in young and older Brown-Norway Fischer 344 F<sub>1</sub> hybrid rats (18 months apart in age) at two time periods, eight months apart. The aged group served as an intact and pharmacologically-na&#x000ef;ve source of deficient locomotor activity. Following locomotor testing, we analyzed DA tissue content, TH protein, and TH phosphorylation in striatum, SN, nucleus accumbens, and VTA. Levels of TH protein combined with ser31 phosphorylation alone reflected inherent differences in DA levels among the four regions. Measures strictly pertaining to locomotor activity initiation significantly correlated to DA content only in the SN. Nigral TH protein and ser31 phosphorylation together significantly correlated to test subject's maximum movement number, horizontal activity, and duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Together, these results show ser31 TH phosphorylation regulates DA bioavailability in intact neuropil, its status in the SN may regulate locomotor activity generation, and it may represent an accurate target for treating locomotor deficiency. They also show that neurotransmitter regulation in cell body regions can mediate behavioral outcomes and that ser31 TH phosphorylation plays a role in behaviors dependent upon catecholamines, such as dopamine.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>We face an increased probability of reduced mobility (bradykinesia) with advancing age, with a 50&#x00025; risk of this Parkinsonian-like symptom by age 85 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Bennet1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Prettyman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The neurobiological basis of this aging-related impairment to locomotion is crucial to resolve, particularly due to the imminent increase of the elderly population. Aging-related Parkinsonism presents symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease (PD) and, like PD, they are progressive, impair performance of essential locomotor functions, and increase risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, and death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Prettyman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Buchman1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Major dopamine (DA) loss of 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; in the striatum is thought to be required for major symptom presentation in PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Bernheimer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Bezard1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in aged humans and animal models alike, striatal DA loss does not reach symptomatic levels seen in PD, ranging instead from 0 to 50&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Kish1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Haycock1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Throughout the lifespan there is also little if any aging-related loss of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase ((TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for DA biosynthesis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Haycock1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-McCormack1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, which is in stark contrast to the 80&#x00025; loss seen in symptomatic PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Bernheimer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Hornykiewicz1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is curious why aging-related Parkinsonism occurs if DA and TH loss are not equivalent to the symptomatic levels seen in PD. If TH loss does not occur in striatum during aging, it is possible that either decreased striatal TH activity may contribute to Parkinsonism, or decreased TH protein or activity in another DA region is the source of Parkinsonism.</p><p>The activity of TH is regulated by site-specific phosphorylation, but of the three physiologically-regulated sites in the CNS (ser19, ser31, and ser40) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Haycock2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, the site most critical for regulating DA biosynthesis in intact neuropil is unknown. Phosphorylation of TH at ser19 does not directly influence TH activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Haycock3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, but increased phosphorylation of ser40 can increase TH activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Haycock4">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Dunkley1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and is associated with increased DA turnover in neurodegenerative or other CNS disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Salvatore3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Conner1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a certain threshold of phosphorylation may be required to affect DA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Salvatore2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and ser40 phosphorylation is not required for stimulation of L-DOPA biosynthesis by depolarizing stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Harada1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. However, increases in ser31 phosphorylation alone increase L-DOPA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Salvatore2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Understanding the extent to which ser31 or ser40 phosphorylation modulate DA bioavailability in intact neuropil is necessary to define the molecular basis for DA-dependent behaviors, such as locomotion.</p><p>While loss of TH activity may explain variable DA loss in the aged striatum, it is also possible that aging reduces TH protein or activity, and therefore DA bioavailability, in other regions affecting locomotor activity. For example DA signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) affects goal-related locomotor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Parkinson1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> as it does in striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Palmiter1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. However, stimulant-induced increases in DA signaling in NAc are similar between aged and young subjects and thus do not explain reduced stimulant-induced locomotion in aged subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Huang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. A potential explaination is that an intact nigrostriatal pathway may be necessary for stimulant enhancement of locomotor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Beeler1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In this pathway, dopamine is released not only in striatum, but also in the substantia nigra (SN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Cheramy1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Fortin1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Although striatal DA tissue content is &#x0223c;10-fold greater than in SN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Hebert1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Yurek1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, DA in SN has a longer synaptic life than in striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Hoffman1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Rice1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, unlike striatum, aging reduces TH protein in SN and this correlates with motor impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Emborg1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus TH regulation of DA in the SN may affect certain aspects of locomotor activity generation. In fact, decreasing nigral DA release capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Andersson1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> or blocking its post-synaptic actions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Robertson1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Trevitt1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> reduces locomotor activity. Bradykinesia is a common symptom of PD and aging. Similar deficiencies in nigral DA signaling as well as reduced TH protein reported with the onset of PD symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Bezard1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Fearnley1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and in aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Emborg1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Sanchez1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> also point to the possibility that nigral DA bioavailability regulates locomotor activity generation. Aging also reduces nigral TH activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Ponzio1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, and DA loss ranges from 36&#x00025;&#x02013;70&#x00025; in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Rudow1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, non-human primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Irwin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Yurek1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, deficits in TH protein and phosphorylation at the key TH activity-modulating site in SN could be the common source of bradykinesia in PD and in aging.</p><p>Studies with growth factors indicate that nigral TH activity may regulate locomotor activity. GDNF increases locomotor activity in both aging or PD models in conjunction with increased nigral DA tissue content, notably without affecting striatal DA tissue content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Hoffer1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Grondin1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In aged rats, GDNF produces a large increase in ser31 phosphorylation in the SN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Salvatore4">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that the action of GDNF is to reverse possible aging-related reductions in nigral ser31 phosphorylation, thereby increasing nigral DA and locomotor activity as reported. Furthermore, unilateral striatal GDNF administration increases TH phosphorylation bilaterally only in the SN and not striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Salvatore5">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. This may also occur in human, as bilateral motor improvement is reported following unilateral GDNF delivery in PD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Slevin1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, we hypothesized that ser31 phosphorylation of TH in SN may regulate DA bioavailability necessary for particular aspects of locomotor activity. To test this hypothesis we profiled DA tissue content and TH protein and phosphorylation in the nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbens pathways in young and aged rats following longitudinal characterization of inherent locomotor activity. This design, while correlational, provided an intact and pharmacologically-na&#x000ef;ve source of potential endogenous differences in DA bioavailability in DA neuropil in two groups significantly different in locomotor activity to address which TH phosphorylation site normally regulates DA bioavailability and which DA region influences specific aspects of inherent locomotor activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>2.1 Test Subject Selection and Handling</title><p>Young and old rats were chosen for this study because differences in locomotor activity are derived from intact and pharmacologically-na&#x000ef;ve neuropil. Two age groups of Brown-Norway Fisher 344 F<sub>1</sub> hybrid (BNF) rats arrived at the medical center at one and 19 months of age and given food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> for three months prior to the start of any locomotor assessment. All locomotor testing was done between the hours of 0900 and 1700. All animals used in this study were drug na&#x000ef;ve and other than being tested for locomotor activity 17 times for one hour each session, remained in their home cage, singly housed. The BNF strain was selected for this study because aging-related changes in striatal and midbrain DA tissue content are comparable to that in the primates and exhibits reduced locomotion in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Yurek1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Spangler1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, and as discussed in main text), making it arguably the best rat model to address the relative role of the striatal and nigral DA in locomotor activity. Outbred Sprague-Dawley rats also show DA loss in the midbrain like the BNF strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-CruzMuros1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> but may have increased variance in a variety of measures. The inbred Fischer 344, a commonly used strain in aging studies, does not show any significant tissue loss of DA in striatum or midbrain, contrary to findings in human and non-human primates (although release of DA is compromised 50&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Hebert1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>).

This reduction in variance in F<sub>1</sub> hybrids requires fewer animals to attain significance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Sprott1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>2.2 Assessment of Locomotor Activity</title><p>Open-field locomotor activity was determined a total of 17 times in two specific time points, the young being tested at 4&#x02013;5 months and again eight months later at 11&#x02013;12 months, and the older group at 22&#x02013;23 months of age and again eight months later at 29&#x02013;30 months of age. &#x0005b;Neurochemical measures were made only at the 12 and 30 month ages&#x0005d;. Each rat was tested by pairing with the same different age counterpart in separate locomotor test chambers (10 trials in the first period of life and 7 trials in the second period of life eight months later). Spontaneous locomotor activity was assessed in 1 hour duration trials using automated activity chambers (VersaMax Animal Activity Monitoring System, Columbus, OH), which consisted of a 41&#x000d7;41&#x000d7;31 cm<sup>3</sup> plexiglass box with a grid of infrared beams mounted horizontally every 2.5 cm and vertically every 4.5 cm. The beams are generated from monitors connected to a VersaMax analyzer which transmits the number of beam breaks (locomotor activity) to a dedicated computer with VersaMax software to collect and analyze the locomotor measures. Activity data was recorded in four consecutive 15 min samples and the sum total for movement number, total distance (cm), horizontal activity (unitless measure of all horizontal activity), time spent moving (sec) were recorded. Movement speed was calculated by dividing total distance by time spent moving (cm/sec). The typical life-expectancy of the BNF rat is approximately 32 months and thus, the locomotor activities in about one-fourth to one-third of the average life span of the rat were determined for each age group. Combining both operationally-matched age groups, the locomotor activity patterns of virtually the entire adult life span was determined.</p><p>To assess DA tissue content and TH protein and phosphorylation, within 5&#x02013;10 min following the last (17<sup>th</sup>) locomotor test session, the rats were killed in alternating order of young or old, and dorsal striatum, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, and VTA were dissected from 1 mm coronal slices as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Salvatore6">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> and stored on dry ice and &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until processed for DA analysis by HPLC, protein levels, and phosphorylation analysis by western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>2.3 Neurochemistry: Dopamine Analysis</title><p>The analysis of DA tissue content from striatum, SN, NAc, and VTA allowed for two major objectives to be addressed; 1) to determine how TH phosphorylation controls DA biosynthesis capacity in the CNS, and 2) to correlate to measures of locomotor activity with DA tissue content in these four regions. Given the well-established DA hypothesis for locomotion, this experimental design makes it possible to determine whether DA in one or more of these regions influenced locomotion. Our operationally-matched assessment of DA tissue content and TH measures from all four brain regions from each test subject is a novel state-of-the-art approach to equate the DA tissue content resulting from a respective TH protein and TH phosphorylation profile and to determine their contributions to locomotor activity. This addition of locomotor measures to the neurochemical profile is the first known study of its kind, which adds a behavioral component in assessing DA tissue content with TH protein and TH phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Salvatore3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Tissues were sonicated in ice-cold 0.1 M HClO<sub>4</sub>-EDTA buffer.

Determination of DA is calculated based upon percent recovery of the internal standard (N-methyl-dopamine (NMDA), 20 ng/mL) in each sample, the peak height ratios obtained for both DA and NMDA in a standard and in the sample, and the fraction of the aliquot analyzed by HPLC representing the total volume of the sonicated tissue. The acid buffer treatment for HPLC analysis precipitates the protein content inherent in the sample, and this protein pellet was sonicated in 1&#x00025; SDS with 5 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.3) and 1 mM EDTA to determine total protein, TH protein, and site-specific TH phosphorylation.</p><p>We normalized total DA to protein, as opposed to the wet weight of tissue. This was done to control for variances that can arise from contributions of non-protein material. However, this normalization also requires precision dissections for each test subject along the rostral-caudal axis, as the inadvertent additions of non-DA cells in the dissection would increase protein content not related to DA neuropil. For this reason, we present the DA measures as per total DA harvested and as total DA normalized to mg protein. These results were similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008466-t001">Table 1</xref>) and had significant correlation with each other (data not shown). Furthermore, our additional normalization of total DA to total TH harvested in the sample is the strictest normalization to DA neuropil and gives the best insight into endogenous TH

However, total DA recovery in striatum was 3.5-fold greater than in the NAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>), in spite of similar levels of ser31 phosphorylation stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>). Between these regions it appears that the 3- to 4-fold greater level of TH protein in striatum compared to NAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>) influenced their inherent differences in DA.</p><p>These data show that both TH protein levels and phosphorylation at ser31 in intact CNS tissue affect DA tissue content. Thus, multiplying the total TH protein content by TH phosphorylation stoichiometry (effective stoichiometry) at the key regulatory phosphorylation site should represent inherent DA biosynthesis capabilities in DA neuropil. The effective stoichiometry at ser31 should, therefore, reflect the differences in DA content across each region. Indeed, the effective stoichiometry for ser31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>), unlike ser40 or ser19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g002">Fig. 2b, 2c</xref>), had similar region-to-region variance as compared to differences in total DA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>). Notably, this is apparent in comparing striatum to SN, as there was a 25-fold greater level of DA in striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>) and a nearly identical 24-fold difference in effective stoichiometry at ser31 (eight-fold greater TH protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>) times three-fold greater ser31 phosphorylation stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>)). The effective stoichiometry at ser40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>) was only four-fold different between striatum and SN and was not significantly different between SN and nucleus accumbens and as such did not reflect the differences in DA tissue content recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>). These observations clearly show that ser31 phosphorylation, in conjunction with TH protein content, regulates DA bioavailability in the intact nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbens dopaminergic neuropil. In terms of behavioral significance, these findings suggest that ser31 phosphorylation status may drive DA-dependent behaviors from neuroanatomical loci associated with such behaviors.</p><fig id="pone-0008466-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008466.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Tyrosine hydroxylase effective stoichiometry in nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbens pathways.</title><p>Values are obtained by multiplying total inherent TH protein content by phosphorylation stoichiometry in each sample. <bold>a.</bold><bold>Ser31 es</bold>.

Furthermore, loss of nigral TH protein of &#x0223c;40&#x00025;, as seen in the 30-month group in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g007">Fig. 7</xref>), is coincident with PD-like symptoms in PD models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Bezard1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and in human PD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Fearnley1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations in conjunction with our findings, which are coincident measures of both striatal and nigral DA that are associated with longitudinally-characterized locomotor activity, make a case that nigral DA has a role in modulating basal ganglia circuitry to facilitate the generation of locomotor activity.</p><p>Given that both the locomotor activity and DA and TH analyses were conducted in the same rats, a critical importance for phosphorylation at ser31 in regulating DA tissue content and a DA-dependent behavior (locomotion) was revealed. First, the differences in DA tissue content across the four regions did not correspond to total TH protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g001">Fig. 1, a, b</xref>). However, in conjunction with TH protein content, phosphorylation at ser31, but not ser19 or ser40, showed significant differences between striatum, SN, nucleus accumbens, and VTA that reflected the inherent differences in DA tissue content in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g002">2</xref>). The other major indication that ser31 phosphorylation affected DA bioavailability is that the significant loss of DA (along with TH protein loss) in the SN in the aged subjects was associated with a significant decrease in phosphorylation only at ser31. Together, these observations address which TH phosphorylation site regulates DA biosynthesis <italic>in vivo</italic> in intact neuropil: a vital question yet to be answered. However, phosphorylation at ser40 can increase DA biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Waymire1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Dunkley1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. It may that challenges to DA systems such as that in neurodegenerative processes could increase ser40 phosphorylation to an extent that affects DA biosynthesis capabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Salvatore3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Conner1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Still, in intact and drug-na&#x000ef;ve DA pathways, ser31 phosphorylation and TH protein levels appear to regulate basal DA bioavailability. In the SN, these mechanisms may define the maximal locomotor capabilities inherent to our test subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). Determining whether ser31 or ser40 regulate DA biosynthesis in the TH-depleted SN in a PD model is an important next step, particularly since aging may impair compensatory processes that normally replenish DA in the face of TH loss seen in PD and PD models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Collier1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Cass1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our assessment of locomotion took into account that the neurochemical profile attained for each test subject was only a one-time measure. In spite of definite differences in average locomotor activity shown in the test subjects, the test subjects had variable locomotor activity from trial to trial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008466.s006">Fig. S5</xref>). Therefore, a correlation of DA bioavailability with the 17<sup>th</sup> and final trial was essential. On one hand, this correlation might be expected to be the most relevant one because the DA levels inherent in the test subject were temporally matched with the locomotor activity observed. On the other hand, indeterminate factors could also influence locomotion on a trial to trial basis, such as the subject's level of arousal, motivation for food or drink, or circadian type fluctuations that might occur within the 8 hour time window (0900 to 1700) we did our testing. Therefore, average locomotor activity results would attenuate the influence of these indeterminate effects. We found significant correlations with nigral DA content for all comparisons to movement number, horizontal activity, and time spent moving when accounting for these variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008466-t001">Table 1</xref>). It is also possible that trial-by-trial variances in locomotor activity could be related to variances in DA bioavailability, which, like locomotor activity, could fluctuate around a mean value. We also point out that in the minority of observations in the 17 trials, there were some matched test subjects that, in spite of having significant differences in mean activity, had on occasion similar locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008466.s006">Fig. S5</xref>). This observation suggests that other aging-related issues such as muscle function likely did not contribute to the aging-related decline of locomotor activity generation. For if aging-related muscle dysfunction did affect movement generation, an older rat would presumably never generate movement akin to that of a younger rat. The lack of correlation of central DA systems with aging-related muscle function decline has also been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Ossowska1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Aging brings an inherent risk of developing Parkinson's-like symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Fleischman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Murray1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and their incidence increases dramatically from 15&#x00025; of those at age 65 to 52&#x00025; at age 85 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Murray1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that aging-related bradykinesia may not be universal, but the incidence certainly increases with advancing age. The neurobiological basis for the occurrence is not well understood. In our study, it appears that activity levels, which may ultimately be related to nigral ser31 and TH protein levels, at a younger age dictate the locomotor activity with advancing age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). There was a significant decrease in locomotor activity parameters that correlated with nigral DA (movement number, horizontal activity, and time spent moving) between 22 and 30 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). We did not measure DA in the 22-month old rat, but there was a significant decrease in nigral DA in the 30-month rat compared to the 12-month old rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Based upon the locomotor data and the two time points at 12 and 30 months wherein DA was measured, we would predict that nigral DA loss would be less overall at 22 months than at 30 months. Taken together, these data imply that the likelihood bradykinesia occurring with aging may depend upon activity levels at a younger age, and nigral ser31 phosphorylation and TH protein levels could play a role in the inherent risk of developing aging-related Parkinsonism.</p><p>In spite of little or no loss of striatal DA tissue content in the aged test subjects, deficient DA release in aged striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Hebert1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Gerhardt1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, could impact locomotor activity. However, release capacity of nigral DA also decreases to &#x0223c;70&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Gerhardt1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, both regions show diminished DA release capacity with aging. Thus the contribution of diminished DA release in either region to aging-related bradykinesia is not known. However, pharmacological blockade of nigral DA release to the extent seen in aging reduces rotorod performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Andersson1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, which suggests sufficient nigral DA bioavailability is necessary for enabling movements required to negotiate motor tasks. We show nigral DA content in the 30-month old group was &#x0223c;4.3 ng/mg protein or 6.6 ng of total nigral DA in the rostral-caudal extension and this was associated with significant reduction in locomotor activity relative to adult, 12-month old rat, which had &#x0223c;7.6 ng/mg protein or 10.3 ng total nigral DA. The significant correlation of nigral DA with locomotor activity measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008466-t001">Table 1</xref>) and aging-related reductions in nigral DA both make a case that nigral DA bioavailability is involved with the generation of locomotor activity.</p><p>Striatal or accumbal DA content could influence aspects of locomotion not related to its initiation and maintenance, such as movement speed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Parkinson1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Freed1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, movement speed was not significantly different between the two age groups and did not correlate to nigral DA as did the other four parameters measured (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008466-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, movement speed may be independent of the ability to initiate locomotor activity and is likely to be associated with DA signaling in striatum or nucleus accumbens, wherein DA signaling has been linked to motivational states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Palmiter1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Freed1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Everitt1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. We did note a trend toward significance with lifetime and second session average movement speed correlating to total striatal DA recovered. Therefore, experimental manipulation of DA in these regions beyond that produced by aging in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008466-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) could reveal a role for DA in locomotor parameters affected in PD (wherein such major loss is seen) such as movement speed, balance, gait function, and tremor at rest. It must be noted, however, that the inherent ability to generate movement, or readiness, is likely to be associated with DA bioavailability of the nigrostriatal pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Brown1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggest that nigral DA bioavailability is a significant neurobiological component in inherent abilities to initiate volitional movement.</p><p>In summary, longitudinally-characterized locomotor activity patterns of pharmacologically-na&#x000ef;ve rats with intact nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbens pathways showed that nigral DA bioavailability, as regulated by TH protein and phosphorylation at ser31, influenced inherent capacities for the initiation and maintenance of locomotor activity. Reduced nigral, but not striatal, DA was associated with aging-related bradykinesia. We do not imply that striatal or accumbal DA has no influence upon locomotor activity, but it may be that experimental manipulation of DA levels exceeding that seen in this study (15&#x00025; or less DA loss) may be necessary to determine how DA in these regions affects other locomotor parameters. We also show that in intact dopaminergic neuropil, the phosphorylation of TH at ser31, but not ser40, in addition to TH protein, governs DA bioavailability. This is not to say that ser40 phosphorylation could not influence DA biosynthesis capabilities <italic>in vivo</italic>, as certain pathologies or conditions might increase ser40 levels sufficiently enough to impact DA biosynthesis <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Salvatore3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008466-Conner1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, TH protein and phosphorylation at ser31 in the SN was significantly correlated with DA tissue content and with locomotor activity levels. Therefore, studies wherein the regulation of the biosynthesis of DA or other catecholamines, like norepinephrine, is called into question <italic>in vivo</italic> must include analysis of ser31 phosphorylation dynamics. Future studies should address the extent to which changes in ser31 and ser40 phosphorylation, induced via experimental manipulation, affect DA biosynthesis capacity in the regions studied herein. Furthermore, modulation of DA bioavailability through inhibition or augmentation of levels in striatum and SN would determine the extent to which DA in each region modulates particular aspects of locomotor activity. In a larger realm, these results also suggest that focusing on neurotransmitter function solely at terminal fields is insufficient to understand behavior. Clearly, regulation of neurotransmitter function in somatodendritic regions must be considered as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008466.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Critical supporting information for manuscript.</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008466.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008466.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Phosphorylation-state specificity of ser31 antibody produced by 21st Century Biochemicals.
