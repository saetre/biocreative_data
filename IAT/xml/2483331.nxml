Inhibition of these K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or cAMP is coupled to depolarization and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry. The mechanism of ACTH and cAMP-mediated inhibition of bTREK-1 was explored in whole cell patch clamp recordings from AZF cells. Inhibition of bTREK-1 by ACTH and forskolin was not affected by the addition of both H-89 and PKI(6&#x02013;22) amide to the pipette solution at concentrations that completely blocked activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in these cells. The ACTH derivative, <italic>O</italic>-nitrophenyl, sulfenyl-adrenocorticotropin (NPS-ACTH), at concentrations that produced little or no activation of PKA, inhibited bTREK-1 by a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-independent mechanism. Northern blot analysis showed that bovine AZF cells robustly express mRNA for Epac2, a guanine nucleotide exchange protein activated by cAMP. The selective Epac activator, 8-pCPT-2&#x02032;-O-Me-cAMP, applied intracellularly through the patch pipette, inhibited bTREK-1 (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003d; 0.63 &#x003bc;M) at concentrations that did not activate PKA. Inhibition by this agent was unaffected by PKA inhibitors, including RpcAMPS, but was eliminated in the absence of hydrolyzable ATP. Culturing AZF cells in the presence of ACTH markedly reduced the expression of Epac2 mRNA. 8-pCPT-2&#x02032;-O-Me-cAMP failed to inhibit bTREK-1 current in AZF cells that had been treated with ACTH for 3&#x02013;4 d while inhibition by 8-br-cAMP was not affected. 8-pCPT-2&#x02032;-O-Me-cAMP failed to inhibit bTREK-1 expressed in HEK293 cells, which express little or no Epac2. These findings demonstrate that, in addition to the well-described PKA-dependent TREK-1 inhibition, ACTH, NPS-ACTH, forskolin, and 8-pCPT-2&#x02032;-O-Me-cAMP also inhibit these K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels by a PKA-independent signaling pathway. The convergent inhibition of bTREK-1 through parallel PKA- and Epac-dependent mechanisms may provide for failsafe membrane depolarization by ACTH.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; AngII, angiotensin II; AZF, adrenal zona fasciculata; BAPTA, 1,2 <italic>bis</italic>-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N,N,N&#x02032;,N&#x02033;</italic>-tetraacetic acid; NPS-ACTH, <italic>O</italic>-nitrophenyl, sulfenyl-adrenocorticotropin.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cortisol secretion from the adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) occurs under the control of the pituitary peptide ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simpson and Waterman, 1988</xref>). The molecular mechanisms that couple ACTH receptor activation to cortisol production are only partially understood. Early studies established that cAMP was the principal intracellular messenger for ACTH in AZF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haynes and Berthet, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grahame-Smith et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richardson and Schulster, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sala et al., 1979</xref>). ACTH stimulates cAMP synthesis in AZF cells, while cAMP mimics the steroidogenic actions of ACTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haynes et al., 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roesler et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simpson and Waterman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Waterman, 1994</xref>). Accordingly, bovine AZF cells express a high affinity, MC2-R melanocortin receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase through G<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Penhoat et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raikhinstein et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Although cAMP appears to function as the primary intracellular messenger, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> may also act pivotally in ACTH-stimulated corticosteroid secretion. At concentrations that produce little or no measurable increase in cAMP synthesis, ACTH has been reported to increase intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration and stimulate cortisol secretion in bovine AZF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yanagibashi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimoto et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>O</italic>-nitrophenyl, sulfenyl derivative of ACTH (NPS-ACTH) stimulates large increases in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and corticosteroid secretion at concentrations that trigger no measurable increases in cAMP synthesis in either rat or bovine AZF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moyle et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamazaki et al., 1998</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that cAMP and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> are dual messengers that are both required to mediate the full steroidogenic response to ACTH.</p><p>In this regard, a role for electrical events and depolarization-dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry in ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion has been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enyeart et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mlinar et al., 1993</xref>). Specifically, bovine AZF cells express bTREK-1 leak-type K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, which set the resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mlinar et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enyeart et al., 2002</xref>). ACTH receptor activation is coupled to membrane depolarization and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry through the inhibition of bTREK-1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enyeart et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mlinar et al., 1993</xref>). Accordingly, organic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> antagonists inhibit T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels at concentrations that also inhibit ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Enyeart et al., 1993</xref>). The NPS-ACTH&#x02013;stimulated increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in bovine AZF cells is also inhibited by organic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> antagonists at concentrations that inhibit T-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamazaki et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, bTREK-1 appears to link ACTH receptor activation to cortisol secretion through depolarization-dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry.</p><p>The signaling mechanisms by which ACTH inhibits bTREK-1 channels are incompletely understood. They may involve multiple cAMP- and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent pathways. Specifically, neuronal TREK-1 channels are inhibited by cAMP through PKA-dependent phosphorylation of a carboxyl-terminal serine that is also present in bTREK-1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honor&#x000e9;, 2007</xref>). Although native bTREK-1 channels can also be inhibited by this mechanism, ACTH and cAMP inhibit bTREK-1 channels in AZF cells in the presence of any of several PKA antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enyeart et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>While all of the cAMP-dependent actions of ACTH in AZF cells were previously thought to be mediated by PKA, alternative signaling pathways for cAMP-mediated responses are likely present in these cells. Specifically, two cAMP-activated guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Epac1 and Epac2 (also known as cAMP-GEFI and cAMP-GEFII), have been identified and implicated in the regulation of proteins including ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Rooij et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawasaki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holz et al., 2008</xref>). While Epac1 is expressed in many tissues, Epac2 is robustly expressed in selected areas of the brain and the adrenal glands of rats and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawasaki et al., 1998</xref>). This raises the possibility that cAMP-dependent inhibition of bTREK-1 in the adrenal gland is mediated through separate PKA- and Epac2-dependent mechanisms.</p><p>In addition, studies with NPS-ACTH raise the possibility that ACTH might inhibit bTREK-1 by a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent mechanism that is independent of both cAMP and PKA. In this regard, angiotensin II (AngII) which also stimulates cortisol secretion from bovine AZF cells, inhibits bTREK-1 in these cells by separate Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>- and ATP-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomora and Enyeart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enyeart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). Overall, our results and those of other investigators suggest that ACTH may regulate bTREK-1 channels by multiple cAMP- and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent pathways.</p><p>In this regard, Epac1 and Epac2 possess cAMP binding domains that lack a specific glutamate residue present in the binding domain of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Enserink et al., 2002</xref>). Using this information and rational drug design, novel cAMP analogues were developed that, at appropriate concentrations, selectively activate the Epac proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Enserink et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen et al., 2003</xref>). We have used one of these, 8-pCPT-2&#x02032;-O-Me-cAMP, along with other agents involved in cAMP metabolism to further characterize the signaling pathways by which ACTH and cAMP inhibit bTREK-1 in bovine AZF cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether ACTH and cAMP could inhibit bTREK-1 by Epac2 as well as PKA-dependent pathways.</p><p>Some of these results have been reported in abstract form (H.

Third, 8-pCPT-2&#x02032;-O-Me-cAMP inhibited bTREK-1 in twice-patched cells where PKA was first preinhibited by direct application of the two PKA inhibitors to the cytoplasm through the patch pipette. Finally, 8-pCPT-2&#x02032;-O-Me-cAMP was ineffective at inhibiting bTREK-1 channels when Epac2 expression had been suppressed by prolonged exposure of AZF cells to ACTH, or in HEK293 cells that express little or no Epac2.
