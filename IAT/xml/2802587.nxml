Key mechanisms regulating callosal formation include the guidance of axons arising from pioneering neurons in the cingulate cortex and the development of cortical midline glial populations, but their molecular regulation remains poorly characterised. Recent data have shown that mice lacking the transcription factor <italic>Nfib </italic>exhibit callosal agenesis, yet neocortical callosal neurons express only low levels of <italic>Nfib</italic>. Therefore, we investigate here how <italic>Nfib </italic>functions to regulate non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of callosal formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our investigations confirmed a reduction in glial cells at the midline in <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice. To determine how this occurs, we examined radial progenitors at the cortical midline and found that they were specified correctly in <italic>Nfib </italic>mutant mice, but did not differentiate into mature glia. Cellular proliferation and apoptosis occurred normally at the midline of <italic>Nfib </italic>mutant mice, indicating that the decrease in midline glia observed was due to deficits in differentiation rather than proliferation or apoptosis. Next we investigated the development of callosal pioneering axons in <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice. Using retrograde tracer labelling, we found that <italic>Nfib </italic>is expressed in cingulate neurons and hence may regulate their development. In <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, neuropilin 1-positive axons fail to cross the midline and expression of neuropilin 1 is diminished. Tract tracing and immunohistochemistry further revealed that, in late gestation, a minor population of neocortical axons does cross the midline in <italic>Nfib </italic>mutants on a C57Bl/6J background, forming a rudimentary corpus callosum.

Within the cerebral cortex, the corpus callosum (CC), which comprises the largest fibre tract in the brain, provides connectivity between the left and right cerebral hemispheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The flow of information facilitated by this tract plays an integral role in many critical functions, including behaviour, emotion and higher order cognition. Indeed, defective development of this tract in humans is correlated with a large number of syndromes, such as Mowat Wilson syndrome and Aicardi syndrome, as well as disorders including autism and schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Formation of the CC requires a series of dynamic events to be co-ordinated both spatially and temporally during both embryogenesis and the postnatal period. These include correct patterning of the midline, differentiation and specification of callosal neurons within the nascent cortical plate, the development of distinct midline glial populations, targeting of axons to the contralateral hemisphere and the elimination of those supernumerary axons overproduced during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, while the clinical significance of the CC has long been known, our understanding of the molecular determinants underlying formation of this fibre tract remains incomplete.</p><p>Research has begun to identify some of the molecular components regulating different aspects of callosal formation. For instance, the DNA-binding protein Satb2 was recently implicated as a key determinant controlling the specification of callosally projecting neurons within the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, axon guidance cues, including Netrin 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], class III semaphorins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and Slit2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], as well as guidance receptors such as DCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], neuropilin 1 (Npn1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], Robo1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and Ryk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] have been implicated in callosal development. In addition, the activity of callosal neurons during development is known to be required for axonal targeting and specificity through pruning within the contralateral hemisphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Another critical determinant of CC formation is the development of distinct glial populations at the cortical midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Two midline glial populations, the glial wedge and the indusium griseum glia, are believed to regulate callosal development, in part through expression of guidance cues such as Slit2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Given that these glia develop relatively early compared to other cortical glial populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], identifying the factors regulating their development is important for understanding both glial development and axonal guidance. One gene family in particular, the Nuclear Factor One (<italic>Nfi</italic>) transcription factors, has been shown to play a central role in regulating glial development and axon tract formation during embryogenesis. <italic>Nfia </italic>was recently implicated in regulating gliogenesis in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and <italic>Nfia</italic>-deficient mice have been demonstrated to have severely reduced glial formation at the cortical midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>Nfib </italic>has been shown to regulate the formation of glia within the ammonic neuroepithelium of the developing hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Mice lacking <italic>Nfib </italic>have glial defects at the midline, as well as agenesis of the CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but whether these defects are mechanistically related is unknown. Here we demonstrate that neither excessive apoptosis, nor aberrant proliferation at the midline, underlies the glial defect in <italic>Nfib </italic>knockout mice, but rather that radial progenitors fail to differentiate into mature glia. Furthermore, expression of <italic>Slit2 </italic>is diminished at the midline. We also report that cell-autonomous defects in cingulate cortex neurons may contribute to callosal malformation in <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice. Finally, we demonstrate that, at embryonic day 18 (E18), a small population of axons does cross the midline caudally in <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that <italic>Nfib </italic>is critical for the maturation of midline glia that are required for CC formation. Furthermore, defects in Npn1-expressing pioneering neurons may contribute to the callosal dysgenesis evident in <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice, implicating multiple non-cell-autonomous roles for <italic>Nfib </italic>in neocortical callosal formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>NFIB is expressed at the cortical midline</title><p>Although we previously showed by retrograde labelling that NFIB was not highly expressed in neocortical callosal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we wanted to examine what other cells expressed NFIB at the midline. Immunohistochemistry on 6 &#x003bc;m coronal paraffin sections from E18 wildtype brains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) demonstrated the expression of NFIB within the glial wedge and the indusium griseum, two glial populations essential for development of the CC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Expression was also detected in the subcallosal sling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), a stream of cells originating in the subventricular zone that crosses the cortical midline ventral to the developing CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The <italic>Nfib </italic>knockout line was generated with a nuclear-localised <italic>lacZ </italic>reporter gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Expression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase at the cortical midline in E18 heterozygote brains was co-incident with that of NFIB (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), enabling us to use the expression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase as a reliable indicator of those cells expressing NFIB. To determine if the cells in the glial wedge and indusium griseum expressing <italic>Nfib </italic>were in fact glia, we double labelled E18 coronal sections with antibodies against &#x003b2;-galactosidase (a mouse monoclonal antibody) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; a rabbit polyclonal antibody), a marker for mature glial cells. Many &#x003b2;-galactosidase-positive cells in both the glial wedge and the indusium griseum were surrounded by GFAP-positive fibres, indicating that these glial populations are likely to express <italic>Nfib </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of NFIB in midline glial populations</bold>. <bold>(A, B) </bold>Coronal section of an E18 wildtype brain stained with NFIB.

Haematoxylin staining of E18 wildtype and <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient brains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E-H</xref>) supported this finding, indicating that, in rostral sections of the mutant, formation of the CC was impaired.</p></sec><sec><title>Glial development is curtailed at the cortical midline of <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient mice</title><p>The development of mature, GFAP-expressing glial populations at the cortical midline of <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice at E17 was reported to be reduced in the absence of this transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To gain a deeper insight into glial development during callosal formation, we first conducted a time-course of GFAP expression in <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient and littermate control brains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In sections from wildtype mice, GFAP-expressing cells were first seen in the glial wedge at E15, and within the indusium griseum glia and a third midline glial population, the midline zipper glia, at E17 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, C, E</xref>). In the mutant, however, GFAP expression at the cortical midline was delayed until E17, when a small population of GFAP-expressing cells became evident within the glial wedge (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, D, F</xref>). By E18, expression of GFAP within the glial wedge in the mutant had increased, but was still reduced in comparison to that seen in wildtype controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G, H</xref>). Moreover, at this rostro-caudal position, no GFAP expression was observed in the indusium griseum or in the midline zipper glia of the mutant mice. As the indusium griseum contains both glia and neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we also examined the expression of Tbr1, a marker of post-mitotic neurons. These data revealed that neurons were still present in the indusium griseum of mice lacking <italic>Nfib </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>), from which we infer that development of this structure <italic>per se </italic>is not affected. Rather, it is specifically the development of midline glial populations that is aberrant in the <italic>Nfib </italic>mutants.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Reduced expression of GFAP in <italic>Nfib </italic>knockout mice</bold>. <bold>(A-H) </bold>Expression of GFAP at the cortical midline of wildtype (A, C, E, G) and <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient (B, D, F, H) mice.

GFAP expression in the indusium griseum glia (arrowhead) and midline zipper glia (double arrowhead) of the wildtype was also evident from E17 onwards (E, G). However, in the mutant, low levels of GFAP expression in the glial wedge were only observed from E17 onwards (open arrowheads in (F, H)), whereas expression in the indusium griseum glia and midline zipper glia was absent.

To determine which of these processes was responsible for the defect in glial development we observed in <italic>Nfib </italic>null mutants, we first investigated cellular proliferation at the cortical midline. We have demonstrated previously that glia within the glial wedge and indusium griseum are born predominantly between E13 and E15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We therefore analysed proliferation at the cortical midline at these ages in both wildtype and <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient brains using the mitotic marker phosphohistone H3 (PH3; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). As these data revealed no significant difference in the number of PH3-positive cells between <italic>Nfib </italic>mutant and wildtype sections at the cortical midline at E13, E14 or E15 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), we next investigated cell death using the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase 3. Very few cleaved caspase 3-positive cells were seen at the cortical midline of either wildtype or <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient brains, and those that were found were located almost exclusively where the cerebral hemispheres fuse (arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D, E</xref>). Furthermore, we observed no significant differences in apoptotic cell death at the midline between <italic>Nfib </italic>mutants and controls between E14 and E18 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that neither aberrant proliferation nor excessive apoptosis are responsible for the phenotypic abnormalities observed in the absence of <italic>Nfib</italic>.

To determine whether the lack of GFAP-positive midline glia in <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient mice was due to a defect in the differentiation of radial progenitors, we analysed the expression of these markers during development. At E14 in wildtype mice, GLAST expression was observed in the ventricular zone of the cortex, but was higher within the region of the presumptive glial wedge (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). This expression pattern was even more evident in the wild type at E16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). However, in mutant mice, expression of GLAST was clearly diminished in comparison to wildtype controls at both E14 and E16 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B, D</xref>).

We next investigated whether defects in callosally projecting neurons could contribute to the CC defects observed in <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice. Two populations of neurons extend axons that cross the midline via the CC; neocortical callosal neurons and cingulate cortex callosal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The latter are thought to be critical for pioneering callosal tract formation, as neurons from the cingulate cortex are the first to extend axons across the CC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Interestingly, retrograde labelling in early postnatal (P5) wildtype mice has previously shown that most callosally projecting neocortical neurons do not express NFIB at this age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the broad expression pattern of NFIB in the cingulate cortex at E18 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) suggests that, in addition to glial deficits, cell-autonomous neuronal defects within the cingulate cortex may contribute to the callosal phenotype in embryonic <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient mice. To investigate this, we analysed projections arising from the cingulate cortex. Deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) is a marker expressed selectively on callosal axons arising from neurons within the cingulate cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In wild types at E18, DCC-expressing axons could be seen crossing the midline in the dorsal region of the CC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). In the mutant, DCC-expressing axons extended towards the midline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>) but failed to cross. These data indicate that neurons within the cingulate cortex were indeed able to extend axons towards the presumptive CC, and that this was not a growth defect.

Thus, diminished expression of Npn1 on axons emanating from the cingulate cortex could also contribute to the callosal defects observed in <italic>Nfib </italic>knockout mice. To determine if NFIB was expressed in cingulate cortex neurons extending axons across the CC, we performed tract tracing using the retrograde tracer True Blue, which was injected into the cingulate cortex of E17 embryos <italic>in utero</italic>.

L1 is a non-specific marker for axons, and labels axons from both the cingulate cortex and neocortex. As our DCC labelling had indicated that cingulate cortex axons extend towards the cortical midline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), it remained a possibility that the L1-positive axons previously reported at the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] arose not from the neocortex, but from the cingulate cortex. To investigate the origin of axons arriving at the midline, we performed tract tracing by injecting the carbocyanine dye DiI into the neocortex of both wildtype and <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient mice at E18. Coronal sections at rostral and caudal levels in the wild type indicated that DiI-labelled axons were coursing through the CC and ascending into the contralateral hemisphere (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, B, E, F</xref>). At rostral levels in the mutant, DiI-positive axons could be seen approaching, but not crossing, the cortical midline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C, D</xref>). Furthermore, at E18 most callosally projecting neocortical axons located in layers II/III and V, identified by the expression of Satb2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], did not express NFIB (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).

For instance, <italic>Nfib </italic>has been shown to regulate glial differentiation within the ammonic neuroepithelium of the developing mouse hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], while the onset of gliogenesis in the chick spinal cord requires the action of <italic>Nfia </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Namihira and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] demonstrated that within cortical neural progenitor cells at mid-gestation, Notch pathway signalling elicited expression of NFIA, which bound to the promoters of astrocytic genes such as that encoding GFAP, culminating in demethylation and subsequent activation of these glial genes. Our findings are readily accommodated within the conceptual framework provided by these studies, with the impairment of glial maturation at the cortical midline being a direct consequence of radial progenitors failing to differentiate in the absence of <italic>Nfib</italic>.</p><p>Our data indicate that <italic>Nfib </italic>may also contribute to callosal formation via the cell-autonomous regulation of Npn1 within neurons of the cingulate cortex.

This discrepancy could lie in the age of the embryos investigated, given Steele-Perkins and colleagues conducted their analysis at E17, one day prior to when the present analysis was conducted. Furthermore, the previous study analysed the <italic>Nfib </italic>allele on a mixed genetic background (129S6/C57Bl/6J). The 129S6 strain exhibits sporadic occurrence of callosal agenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], which may have contributed to the complete absence of the CC observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The delayed development of the CC we described in this study is of considerable interest, as it raises the possibility that further development of this tract may occur postnatally.

Another possible determinant of CC formation in the mutant is the delayed development of midline glia within both the glial wedge and indusium griseum.

Thus, although differentiation of radial progenitors is delayed in the absence of <italic>Nfib</italic>, compensation by other <italic>Nfi </italic>family members may provide a mechanism for mature glia to eventually form at the cortical midline, thereby enabling development of the CC. Finally, our finding that the anterior commissure and the hippocampal commissure were also disrupted in the <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice could indicate that similar non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, such as the development of midline glial and neuronal sling populations, may underlie the formation of all telencephalic commissures. In conclusion, our data provide a comprehensive insight into the phenotypic abnormalities underlying callosal malformation in <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient mice, and demonstrate that multiple factors contribute to these defects during embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Litters of wildtype C57Bl/6J and <italic>Nfib</italic>-deficient mice, bred at The University of Queensland with approval from the institutional Animal Ethics Committee, were used in this study. The <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>-/- </sup>allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] was backcrossed for more than ten generations onto the C57Bl/6J background. <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mice were bred to obtain wildtype, <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>Nfib</italic><sup>-/-</sup>progeny. No midline defects were detected in wildtype or heterozygote animals. Timed-pregnant females were obtained by placing male and female mice together overnight. The following day was designated as E0 if the female had a vaginal plug. Embryos were genotyped by PCR as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Fixation</title><p>On the required gestational day, embryos were drop-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; E14 and below) or transcardially perfused with 0.9% phosphate buffered saline, followed by 4% PFA (E15 to E18).

Primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were anti-GAP43 (mouse monoclonal, 1/100,000; Chemicon, Bedford, MA, USA), anti-GFAP (rabbit polyclonal, 1/50,000; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (rabbit polyclonal, 1/1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-GLAST (rabbit polyclonal, 1/50,000; a gift from Niels Danbolt, University of Oslo), anti-nestin (mouse monoclonal, 1/1,500; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), anti-tenascin C (rabbit polyclonal, 1/2,000; Chemicon), anti-Tbr1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1/100,000; a gift from Robert Hevner, University of Washington), anti-NFIA (rabbit polyclonal, 1/30,000; Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA), anti-Emx1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1/30,000; a gift from Giorgio Corte, The University of Genova Medical School), anti-Npn1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1/75,000; a gift from David Ginty, Johns Hopkins University) and anti-DCC (rabbit polyclonal, 1/30,000; a gift from Helen Cooper, Queensland Brain Institute). Secondary antibodies used were biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (1/1,000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and biotinylated donkey-anti-mouse IgG (1/1,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). To perform immunofluorescent labelling, sections were incubated overnight with the primary antibody at 4&#x000b0;C. They were then washed and incubated in secondary antibody, before being washed again and mounted. The primary antibodies used for immunofluorescent labelling were anti-phosphohistone H3 (rabbit polyclonal, 1/1,000; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), anti &#x003b2;-galactosidase (1/1,000; Promega, Madison, WI, USA), anti-GAP43 (1/5,000), anti-DCC (1/1,000), anti-GFAP (1/2,000), anti-Satb2 (1/1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti-NFIB (1/1,000).

Brains were sectioned at a thickness of 6 &#x003bc;m. Antigen retrieval was performed using a 10 mM, pH 6 sodium citrate solution, and immunohistochemistry was performed as described above using 3,3' diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. The primary antibody used for immunohistochemistry was anti-NFIB (1/1,000, Active Motif), and a biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) was used at 1/1,000.</p></sec><sec><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>Following immunohistochemistry, sections were imaged using an upright microscope (Zeiss Z1, Zeiss, Goettingen, Germany) attached to a digital camera (Zeiss AxioCam HRc).

Sections were imaged using an upright fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Z1) attached to a digital camera (Zeiss AxioCam HRc). Eight to ten optical sections encompassing the entire 45-&#x003bc;m section were captured with an ApoTome (Zeiss). To calculate the total number of phosphohistone H3-positive cells per unit area at the cortical midline, a 300 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>-boxed region, encompassing the presumptive glial wedge area, was generated using AxioVision software (Zeiss). The number of immunolabelled cells in focus in each optical section of this region was counted and pooled (n = 3 for both wildtype and knockout at all ages).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For all experiments described in this study, sections from three different brains of each genotype were analysed.

A small injection of DiI (in a 10% solution of dimethylformamide; Invitrogen) was then made into the neocortex using a pulled glass pipette attached to a picospritzer. Brains were stored in the dark at 37&#x000b0;C in 4% PFA for at least 4 weeks to allow dye transport. They were then sectioned coronally at 45 &#x003bc;m using a vibratome, and imaged using an upright fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Z1). Nuclei were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue). Three brains were analysed for each genotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Retrograde labelling under ultrasound guidance</title><p>Pregnant mice were anaesthetised with isofluorane (2%) for the duration of the microinjection procedures. The uterine horn was exposed through an incision in the abdominal midline for the purpose of ultrasound- imaging and guided microinjections (Vevo770, VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada). Retrograde labelling of callosal axons with True Blue chloride (Invitrogen) was performed as described previously, with modifications appropriate for ultrasound-guided microinjection <italic>in utero</italic>. Embryos were visualised under a 40 MHz transducer probe (RMV711) and a small volume of the tracer (approximately 250 nL of a 1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L solution) was injected into the cortex of wildtype E17 embryos <italic>in utero </italic>through the uterine wall with the aid of a nanojector (Nanoject II, Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA, USA). Once embryos were injected, the uterine horn was returned to the abdominal cavity, and the incision was sutured. Then, 24 hours later (E18) the embryos were perfused transcardially as described above and processed for NFIB immunohistochemistry. Fluorescence images were obtained with an upright microscope (Zeiss Z1) as described above.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In situ </italic>hybridisation</title><p><italic>In situ </italic>hybridisation was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], with minor modifications.

Briefly, 0.5 &#x003bc;g total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers. qPCR reactions were carried out in a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Life Science, Sydney, Australia) using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen). All the samples were diluted 1/100 with water and 5 &#x003bc;L of these dilutions were used for each SYBR Green PCR reaction containing 10 &#x003bc;L SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 10 &#x003bc;M of each primer, and deionised water. The reactions were incubated for 10 minutes at 95&#x000b0;C followed by 40 cycles with 15 seconds denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C, 20 seconds annealing at 60&#x000b0;C, and 30 seconds extension at 72&#x000b0;C. Primer sequences are available on request.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time PCR data expression and analysis</title><p>After completion of the PCR amplification, the data were analysed with the Rotor-Gene software (Corbett Life Science) and Microsoft Excel. In order to quantify the mRNA expression levels, the housekeeping gene <italic>HPRT </italic>was used as a relative standard. All the samples were tested in triplicate. By means of this strategy, we achieved a relative PCR kinetic of the standard and the sample. For all qPCR analyses, RNA from three independent replicates for both wildtype and <italic>Nfib </italic>mutants were interrogated. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed unpaired <italic>t-</italic>test.
