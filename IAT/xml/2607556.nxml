Hmgcr has also been implicated in the release of the signaling molecule Hedgehog (Hh) from <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells and in the production of an attractant that directs primordial germ cells to migrate to the somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs). The studies reported here indicate that this same <italic>hmgcr</italic>&#x02192;G&#x003b3;1 pathway provides a novel post-translational mechanism for modulating the range and activity of the Hh signal produced by <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells. We show that, like <italic>hmgcr</italic>, <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> and <italic>quemao</italic> (which encodes the enzyme, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthetase, that produces the substrate for geranylation of G&#x003b3;1) are components of the <italic>hh</italic> signaling pathway and are required for the efficient release of the Hh ligand from <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells. We also show that the <italic>hmgcr</italic>&#x02192;G&#x003b3;1 pathway is linked to production of the germ cell attractant by the SGPs through its ability to enhance the potency of the Hh signal. We show that germ cell migration is disrupted by the loss or gain of <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> activity, by <italic>trans</italic>-heterozygous combinations between <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> and either <italic>hmgcr</italic> or <italic>hh</italic> mutations, and by ectopic expression of dominant negative G&#x003b3;1 proteins that cannot be geranylated.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Previous studies have shown that HMGCoA reductase (Hmgcr) is required for the production of a germ cell attractant by the somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs) and for the release of the Hedgehog (Hh) ligand by <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells. However, it was not clear what role mevalonate, the biosynthetic product of Hmgcr, played in either of these processes or whether the <italic>hmgcr</italic>-dependent germ cell attractant corresponds to the Hh ligand (which is known to be expressed by the SGPs). We show here that the downstream target for Hmgcr both in generating the germ cell attractant and in releasing the Hh ligand is the G protein, G&#x003b3;1. G&#x003b3;1 must be geranylated in order to function, and the substrate for this posttranslational modification, geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, is one of the biosynthetic products of mevalonate. In addition to demonstrating a critical role for G&#x003b3;1 (as well as the <italic>hmgcr</italic> isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway) in releasing Hh from <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells, our findings provide additional evidence that Hh protein produced by the SGPs is an <italic>hmgcr</italic>-dependent germ cell attractant.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Two distinct cell types, the primordial germ cells and the somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs), coalesce to form the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic gonad (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Kunwar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Molyneaux1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). These cells arise in different regions of the embryo and are specified by completely different mechanisms. The SGPs are derived from the lateral mesoderm in parasegments 10&#x02013;13 during mid-embryogenesis and are specified by the input from a combination of cell-cell signaling pathways and zygotic patterning genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Boyle1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Boyle2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, the primordial germ cells, or pole cells, are formed on the outside surface of the embryo at the posterior end during the syncitial blastoderm stage and are specified by determinants localized in the posterior pole plasm during oogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Strome1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Mahowald1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In order for pole cells to assemble into a gonad with the SGPs, they must traverse from the posterior end into the middle of the embryo and then subsequently move to the lateral mesodermal cell layer, which contains the newly formed SGPs. This is a multistep process that begins at gastrulation when the pole cells are carried into the interior of the embryo by the midgut invagination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Kunwar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Molyneaux1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. They then pass through the midgut epithelium, and move along the surface of the midgut until they split into two groups. The germ cells in each group migrate laterally and this brings them into contact with the gonadal mesoderm on either side of the embryo. The germ cells align themselves in a row with the SGPs in parasegments 10-13 and these juxtaposed cells coalesce into the embryonic gonad.</p><p>Analysis of the different migration steps has suggested that a combination of repulsive and attractive cues guide germ cell migration through the midgut and toward the somatic gonadal mesoderm. Repulsive clues, whose production depends upon Wunen and Wunen2, are thought to hasten the movement of the germ cells away from the midgut epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-StarzGaiano1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Zhang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Once the germ cells exit the midgut and migrate along its surface, attractive cues produced by the SGPs are thought to entice the germ cells towards that lateral mesoderm and promote their subsequent association with the SGPs.</p><p>One of the first genes implicated in the production of the germ cell attractant by the SGPs was <italic>hmgcr</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-VanDoren1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>hmgcr</italic> is initially expressed broadly in the embryonic mesoderm; however, by the time germ cells commence their migration into the mesoderm, <italic>hmgcr</italic> expression is largely restricted to the SGPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-VanDoren1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>hmgcr</italic> mutants germ cells fail to migrate towards the SGPs and instead either remain associated with the midgut or scatter through the mesoderm. Conversely, ectoptically expressed <italic>hmgcr</italic> can induce germ cells to migrate towards tissues expressing the Hmgcr protein. Another gene that functions to induce migration towards the SGPs encodes the signaling molecule <italic>hedgehog</italic> (<italic>hh</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Deshpande1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Both ectopic expression of Hh and mutations that compromise the production or transmission of the Hh ligand by the SGPs induce mismigration. Since Hh functions as a morphogen in other contexts, one explanation for its effects on germ cell migration is that it acts indirectly by inducing cells to assume a SGP identity so that they can produce the actual attractant. However, a number of findings argue that Hh acts directly as an attractant. For one, the two known receptors of the Hh signal, Patched (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo) are required in the germ cells for their proper migration. In the absence of the Hh ligand, the transmembrane receptor Ptc inhibits the 7-pass transmembrane protein Smo from mediating signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Chen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Alcedo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. When Hh binds to the Ptc receptor, the physical association between these two proteins is thought to relieve the negative influence of Ptc resulting in the relocalization of Smo to the cell membranes, and this in turn activates the signal transduction cascade downstream of the Hh signal. Consistent with their reciprocal functions in <italic>hh</italic> signaling, germ cells compromised for <italic>ptc</italic> or <italic>smo</italic> activity behave differently. For <italic>ptc</italic> the germ cells clump prematurely near the midgut as if they had already received the full Hh signal. For <italic>smo</italic> the germ cells behave as if they are &#x02018;signal-blind&#x02019; and scatter randomly in the posterior of the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Deshpande1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. A second line of evidence supporting a direct role for Hh as the germ cell attractant comes from the discovery that <italic>hgmcr</italic> is required for the release of the Hh ligand by <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells. In embryos compromised for <italic>hmgcr</italic> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Deshpande2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, Hh is inappropriately retained in the <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells. Conversely, the range and strength of the Hh signal can be substantially enhanced by ectopic expression of <italic>hmgcr</italic>. Critically, ectopic <italic>hmgcr</italic> only had an effect on <italic>hh</italic> signaling when it was expressed in cells that normally produce the Hh ligand, while there was no effect when <italic>hmgcr</italic> is ectopically expressed in cells that normally receive the Hh ligand.</p><p>One important issue left unresolved by these studies is how <italic>hmgcr</italic> promotes the release of the Hh ligand by <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells. The <italic>hmgcr</italic> gene encodes HMGCoA reductase which is responsible for the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate. In mammals, mevalonate is a precursor for cholesterol which is used in the modification of the Hh protein. However, providing precursors for cholesterol biosynthesis is not a likely function for <italic>hmgcr</italic> in the <italic>hh</italic> signaling pathway as the genes encoding the enzymes required to synthesize cholesterol from appear to be absent in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Santos1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Mevalonate is also a precursor for many different compounds including carotenoids, isoprenoids, ubiquitones and vitamins A and E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Edwards1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies by Santos and Lehmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Santos1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> on the role of <italic>hmgcr</italic> in germ cell migration have implicated the isoprenoid branch of the mevalonate precursor pathway. The isoprenoids farnsyl-pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) are used in the posttranslational modification of proteins and are covalently attached to the C terminus of target proteins by farnysyl transferase and type I or type II geranylgeranyl transferases respectively. Santos and Lehmann showed that mutations in farnesyl-diphosphate synthetase (<italic>fpps</italic>) (which synthesizes FPP), geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthetase (<italic>qm</italic>) (which in turn converts FPP to GGPP), and geranylgeranyl transferase type I (<italic>&#x003b2;-ggt1</italic>) disrupt germ cell migration. They also found that germ cell migration is perturbed when <italic>fpps</italic> and <italic>qm</italic> are ectopically expressed. Though the effects were much less dramatic than observed for ectopic <italic>hmgcr</italic>, this is not altogether unexpected since these two genes differ from <italic>hmgcr</italic> in that they are widely expressed in mid-to-late embryogenesis.</p><p>While these findings indicate that the pathway leading from <italic>hmgcr</italic> to GGPP is important in germ cell migration because some critical target protein requires geranylation, the identity of this protein and the nature of its function in the production of the germ cell attractant remain to be established. Additionally, Santos and Lehmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Santos1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> did not test whether <italic>hh</italic> signaling also depends upon this same isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. Thus, the possibility remains open, especially if there is another germ cell attractant besides Hh, that <italic>hmgcr</italic> has some other function in <italic>hh</italic> signaling beside the production of isoprenoids. A possible answer to these questions comes from recent studies on cardiac development in flies. Hmgcr and downstream enzymes in the mevalonate pathway are required in cardioblasts to ensure their proper adhesion to the neighboring pericardial cells. Yi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Yi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> found that the endpoint for the isoprenoid branch of the <italic>hmgcr</italic> mevalonate pathway in heart development is the geranylgeranylation of the heterotrimeric G protein &#x003b3; subunit 1 (G&#x003b3;1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Yi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Olson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The C-terminus of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> G&#x003b3;1 protein has the isoprenylation CAAX motif sequence, Cys-Thr-Val-Leu. The leucine residue at the terminal position (X) specifies lipid modification by geranylgeranylation. G&#x003b3;1 requires this modification for membrane association and is inactive when geranylation is blocked. Significantly, <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> would be a quite plausible downstream target for <italic>hmgcr</italic> activity in the <italic>hh</italic> signaling pathway (and thus in the production of the germ cell attractant). Though heterotrimeric G proteins are normally thought to mediate the transduction of extracellular signals by G-protein coupled receptors, recent studies indicate that these G protein complexes have other intercellular functions. In particular, the G&#x003b3;1:G&#x003b2; heterodimer together with G&#x003b1; have been implicated in the transport of cargo from the <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi network (TGN) to the basolateral plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Jamora1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Bard1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The involvement of machinery targeting proteins to the basolateral membrane from the TGN would make sense in the context of <italic>hh</italic> signaling as autoprocessed and fully modified Hh protein is found to preferentially accumulate in a punctate pattern along the basolateral membranes of Hh expressing cells in the embryonic ectoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Porter1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Tabata1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

In wild type wing discs, <italic>hh</italic> expression is confined to the posterior compartment and it orchestrates wing development by signaling to cells in the anterior compartment along the compartment boundary to upregulate the expression target genes such as <italic>ptc</italic> and <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>). In <italic>hh<sup>Mrt</sup>/&#x0002b;</italic> animals, in addition to being expressed normally in the posterior compartment, <italic>hh</italic> is ectopically activated in the anterior compartment of the wing disc. As a result <italic>dpp</italic> is expressed in a pattern that leads to overgrowth of the anterior tissues and the partial duplication of distal wing structures.

To test this idea further, we examined the effects of misexpressing either the wild type G&#x003b3;1 or G&#x003b3;1 proteins that have mutations in the C-terminal CTVL geranylgeranylation motif in the mesoderm using a <italic>twist-GAL4</italic> driver. We anticipated that misexpressing wild type G&#x003b3;1 using the <italic>twist</italic> driver would induce aberrant germ cell migration because it would inappropriately potentiate signaling by <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells elsewhere in the mesoderm such as the fat body precursor cells (FBP). The <italic>hh</italic> signal emanating from these cells would compete with the signal from the SGPs, and this would confuse the migrating germ cells. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000333-g007">Figure 7B</xref> indicate that this expectation is met.

G&#x003b3;1 forms a heterodimer with a second G protein G&#x003b2; and together these two proteins interact with a third G protein, G&#x003b1; to form a heterotrimeric complex. In order to form a functional complex with G&#x003b1; and also interact with other factors and effectors, the G&#x003b2;:G&#x003b3;1 heterodimer must be anchored to the membrane and this is thought to be dependent upon geranylgeranylation of the G&#x003b3;1 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Michaelson1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Schillo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. We reasoned that G&#x003b3;1 mutant proteins that cannot be geranylated would likely behave as dominant negatives because they would compete with the endogenous G&#x003b3;1 protein for complex formation with G&#x003b2;, and thus reduce the effective concentration of functional membrane bound G&#x003b3;1:G&#x003b2; heterodimers. This idea is support by studies on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye specific G&#x003b3; protein G&#x003b3;e. The C-terminal sequence G&#x003b3;e is C-V-I-M which corresponds to the signal for farnesylation rather than geranylgeranylation. Mutations in G&#x003b3;e that eliminate farnesylation have no effect on the formation of G&#x003b3;e:G&#x003b2;e heterodimers; however, these heterodimers do not interact with the membrane and are non-functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Schillo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. When the mutant G&#x003b3;e protein is overexpressed it competes with the endogenous G&#x003b3;e protein for heterodimer formation with G&#x003b2;e, reducing the amount of functional membrane associated G&#x003b3;e:G&#x003b2;e heterodimers and disrupting signal transduction. If gernaylation defective G&#x003b3;1 proteins also behave like dominant negatives, they would be expected to interfere with the efficient release of the germ cell attractant by the SGPs when they are ectopically expressed in mesodermal cells and this should perturb germ cell migration. We tested two different G&#x003b3;1 mutant proteins, one in which the C-terminal CTVL motif is deleted (G&#x003b3;1-&#x00394;CAAX) and the other in which the geranylated Cys residue is replaced by Ser (G&#x003b3;1-C67S) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Edwards1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

The signaling molecule is secreted from <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells and it induces morphogenesis in a concentration dependent fashion in neighboring cells by regulating the transcription of downstream target genes. Several mechanisms control the range and inductive activity of the Hh protein. These include the autoprocessing and lipidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Paulus1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Lee1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Hh has two different lipid modifications that are important for the proper functioning of the Hh ligand. One is the palmitoylation of the N terminus which seems to be critical for signaling activity, while the other is the addition of cholesterol to the C terminus. The C-terminal cholesterol moiety is thought to be important for the dimerization of the Hh protein and for its assembly into LPSs (Large Punctate Particles) prior to secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Porter2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Callejo1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The LPSs appear to be lipid vesicles or micelles and they are thought to provide a hydrophobic environment for the lipid modified Hh which facilitates its movement through the extracellular matrix after it is secreted. The release and subsequent transport of the Hh ligand also requires specialized proteins that function in either Hh producing cells or in cells/compartments that are destined to receive the Hh ligand. The transporter class protein, Disp, and a secreted protein Shifted (Shf) are required in <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells for the efficient release and transmission of the Hh ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Burke1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Caspary1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Gorfinkiel1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>shf</italic> mutants, the basolateral accumulation of Hh protein in the wing disc is disrupted, while apical accumulation appears to be normal. The subsequent transport of the Hh ligand to the receiving cells depends upon the glypicans Dally-like (Dlp) and Dally, which are components of the extracellular matrix, and enzymes that are needed for glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis namely Sulfateless and Tout-velu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Perrimon1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-The1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have previously shown that one such gene encodes the mevalonate biosynthetic enzyme Hmgcr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Deshpande2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that <italic>hmgcr</italic> is required in Hh expressing cells to facilitate the release or transmission of the Hh ligand; however, it was not clear from our studies why the biosynthesis of mevalonate would be important for the release/transmission of the Hh ligand in flies. The obvious explanation, that it is required for the synthesis of the cholesterol that is used to modify Hh, was not likely to be correct as flies do not have the downstream enzymes for cholesterol biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Santos1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In the work reported here we have resolved this question. We show that the downstream target for <italic>hmgcr</italic> in the <italic>hh</italic> signaling pathway is the heterotrimeric G protein, G&#x003b3;1, which must be geranylated in order to be active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Yi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Michaelson1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Chen2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Like <italic>hmgcr</italic> and other genes that are required to promote <italic>hh</italic> signaling, mutations in <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> dominantly suppress the gain-of-function wing phenotypes of <italic>hh<sup>Mrt</sup></italic> in adult flies. In the embryo, the expression of <italic>wg</italic> which is activated by <italic>hh</italic> in the receiving cells is downregulated in both <italic>hmgcr</italic> and <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> mutants. This is also true for the <italic>en</italic> gene which is normally activated by <italic>wg</italic> signaling in <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells as part of the autoregulatory circuit that sustains <italic>hh</italic> and <italic>wg</italic> expression as the embryo develops. These transcriptional defects arise because the Hh signal is not properly conveyed to <italic>hh</italic> receiving cells. In wild type embryos Smo protein is redistributed to the membranes of the receiving cells when they receive the Hh signal transmitted from the neighboring Hh producing cells. As observed for <italic>hmgcr</italic>, Smo protein is not correctly relocalized in <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> mutant embryos, and instead it remains largely cytoplasmic. Finally, in the ectoderm of wild type embryos there is a gradient of Hh protein extending into the parasegment from the two cell wide stripe of <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells. Like <italic>hmgcr</italic>, this gradient is not properly formed in <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> mutant embryos, and instead Hh protein is inappropriately retained in the Hh producing cells.</p><p>Since isoprenoid modifications, either farnesylation or geranylation, are known to be critical for the functioning of the G&#x003b3; family of proteins, these observations would argue that <italic>hmgcr</italic> is required for the release of the Hh ligand because it provides a precursor that is needed for the geranylgeranylation of G&#x003b3;1. This conclusion is supported by the finding that <italic>qm</italic>, which synthesizes the activated substrate, GGPP, that is used to geranylate G&#x003b3;1, is also required for the release of the Hh ligand from <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells. While these results implicate the biosynthetic pathway leading from mevalonate to the geranylation of G&#x003b3;1 in the proper release of the Hh ligand, we cannot exclude the possibility that there are important targets for geranylation in addition to G&#x003b3;1 or that other products of mevalonate might play some role in the <italic>hh</italic> signaling pathway. These possibilities remain open for a number of reasons.</p><p>First, the defects in the release of Hh observed in antibody staining experiments seem to be more severe in the <italic>qm</italic> mutant (and to a lesser extent in <italic>hmgcr</italic>: see 14) than in the <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> mutants we examined. One explanation for this difference is that the Qm enzymatic product, GGPP, is used for the geranylation of other proteins that are important for the release of the Hh ligand. However, this could also be due to, for example, differences in the perdurance of the maternal Qm and G&#x003b3;1 proteins.</p><p>Second, ectopic expression of Hmgcr in <italic>hh</italic> expressing cells causes a readily discernible change in Hh protein distribution across the parasegment and relatively high levels of Hh are found even near the middle of the interstripe region. By contrast, we could not detect an equivalent alteration in Hh distribution when G&#x003b3;1 was ectopically expressed in <italic>hh</italic> producing (or receiving) cells. This difference could mean that the mevalonate produced by Hmgcr has uses in <italic>hh</italic> signaling besides the synthesis of GGPP and the geranylation of G&#x003b3;1.</p><p>An alternative and perhaps more interesting possibility is that the differences in the effects of misexpression on the release/transmission of Hh protein reflect the fact that Hmgcr is limiting whereas G&#x003b3;1 is not. Consistent with this idea, the distribution of <italic>hmgcr</italic> mRNAs becomes progressively restricted as development proceeds and by mid-embryogenesis (stages 10&#x02013;15) <italic>hmgcr</italic> mRNAs are only detected in the SGPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-VanDoren1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, mRNAs encoding G&#x003b3;1, as well as several of the enzymes that are downstream of Hmgcr in the biosynthesis of GGPP, are much more widely expressed in the embryo at this stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Santos1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Izumi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. A possible consequence of this difference in mRNA distribution is that the levels of Hmgcr protein would increase dramatically when it is ectopically expressed in the ectoderm during mid-embryogenesis while this would not be true for G&#x003b3;1 or, for that matter, the other GGPP biosynthetic enzymes. The idea that Hmgcr is a limiting component of signaling pathways that depend upon geranylation G&#x003b3;1 (or other targets) is also supported by the defects in germ cell migration that are induced by ectopic expression of these proteins. For example, expression of <italic>hmgcr</italic> in the CNS cause much more severe abnormalities in germ cell migration than those observed when <italic>fpps</italic>, <italic>qm,</italic> or <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> are misexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Santos1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

For G&#x003b3;1, a role in releasing the Hh ligand from the sending cells would dovetail nicely with a recently discovered function of this G protein and its partners, G&#x003b2; and G&#x003b1; in the transport of cargo from the <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi network (TGN) to the basolateral plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Jamora1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Bard1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, since G&#x003b3;1 requires geranylation for membrane association and activity, the retention of Hh in <italic>qm</italic> and <italic>hmgcr</italic> mutants would also be explained by a disruption in G&#x003b3;1-dependent TGN-plasma membrane transport. In this context it is interesting to note that while the levels of Wg are reduced in <italic>hmgcr</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Deshpande2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> mutants, there is no obvious over accumulation of the Wg protein inside <italic>wg</italic> expressing cells like that observed for Hh. That the <italic>hmgcr&#x02192;qm&#x02192;g&#x003b3;1</italic> pathway would have no apparent effect on the release of Wg would make sense since this is thought to occur preferentially through the targeting of mRNAs to the apical surface of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Simmonds1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Though the precise mechanisms for TGN-plasma membrane transport have yet to be elucidated, it is thought that the heterotrimeric G protein complexes mediate the release of cargo from the TGN by promoting membrane fission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Burke1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In one scenario, interaction of the cargo with an unidentified receptor in the TGN leads to the activation of the trimeric G&#x003b3;1:G&#x003b2;: G&#x003b1; and the release of G&#x003b1; The G&#x003b3;1:Gb heterodimer in turn activates several targets including phosphokinase C and a phosphoinostide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) that generates diacylglycerol. PKC participates in cargo release from the TGN by activating Protein Kinase D (PKD) while locally high concentrations of diacylglycerol produced by PI-PLC are thought to change the properties of the TGN membranes and promote membrane fission. After membrane fission, the vesicle containing the cargo is then targeted to the basolateral plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Tabata1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Burke1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. A requirement in the formation of cargo containing vesicles would fit well with the effects of <italic>hmgcr</italic>, <italic>qm</italic> and <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> on the formation of the puncate Hh particles, or LPSs, that normally assemble along the basolateral membranes of Hh expressing cells. These LPSs are largely absent in <italic>hmgcr</italic>, <italic>qm</italic> and <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> mutant embryos and instead Hh accumulates in much larger aggregates or clumps. While the precise origin of the LPSs is not known, they are thought to be lipid containing vesicles (or micelles) and it would be reasonable to think that they could be generated by the budding of Hh containing vesicles from the TGN. In this case, the large aggregates or clumps of Hh protein seen in <italic>hmgcr</italic>, <italic>qm</italic> and <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> mutants would likely represent Hh trapped either in the TGN or in aberrant vesicles/structures that accumulate in the mutant cells when efficient cargo release from the TGN is disrupted.</p><p>While the idea that G&#x003b3;1 promotes the transport of Hh from the TGN to plasma membrane would seem to fit best with the known functions of G&#x003b3;1 and its collaborating G proteins, it is also possible that G&#x003b3;1 (plus G&#x003b2; and G&#x003b1;) functions at earlier steps in the secretion pathway, for example. in the transport of Hh from Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Golgi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-LeNiculesu1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, it is possible that some novel activity of G&#x003b3;1 at the plasma membrane rather than in the TGN is needed. For example, it could function to prevent the newly formed LPSs from clumping together into larger aggregates. Further studies will be required to distinguish between these and other possible mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title><italic>G&#x003b3;1</italic> Is Required for Germ Cell Migration</title><p>Studies by Santos and Lehmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000333-Santos1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> provided convincing evidence that <italic>hmgcr</italic> is required in the soma for germ cell migration because its biosynthetic product, mevalonate, is the precursor for the synthesis GGPP by Qm. They also found that GGPP is used in turn by geranylgeranyl transferse type 1 (<italic>&#x003b2;-GGT1</italic>) for the geranylation of some unknown target(s). The experiments presented here indicate that one (if not the only) somatic target in the germ cell migration pathway is G&#x003b3;1. Thus, the effects of both gain and loss of <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> function on germ cell migration closely resemble those reported for <italic>hmgcr, fpps, qm</italic>, and <italic>&#x003b2;-GGT1</italic>. Also supporting the idea that G&#x003b3;1 must be a relevant target for the <italic>hmgcr-</italic>isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, we find that G&#x003b3;1 proteins that cannot be geranylated behave as dominant negatives when ectopically expressed in the mesoderm and disrupt germ cell migration. In addition, there are other significant similarities between the two genes that have been studied in most detail, <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> and <italic>hmgcr</italic>. First, both genes show synergistic genetic interactions with components of the <italic>hh</italic> signaling pathway that perturb the process of germ cell migration. Second, germ cell migration can be disrupted when <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> or <italic>hmgcr</italic> are ectopically expressed in <italic>hh</italic> producing cells; however, there are no apparent effects when the genes are ectopically expressed in <italic>hh</italic> receiving cells.</p><p>Taken together with the fact that the SGPs are known to be a source of Hh these findings would argue that a critical function of the biosynthetic pathway leading from <italic>hmgcr</italic> to the geranylation of G&#x003b3;1 is to upregulate Hh signaling in the SGPs, and it is the Hh ligand produced by these cells that serves to attract the migrating germ cells. Importantly, this model accounts for a number of different observations. Since Hmgcr is expressed at high levels in the SGPs, but is not expressed elsewhere in the mesoderm, it would explain how Hh signaling could be specifically potentiated in a special sub-population of cells. It would also explain why the effects of <italic>hmgcr</italic> misexpression are much greater than misexpression of the other genes in the <italic>hmgcr&#x02192;g&#x003b3;1</italic> pathway that are more broadly transcribed in the embryo. Finally, it would explain why germ cells can be misdirected by ectopic expression of <italic>hh</italic>, <italic>hmgcr</italic>, the downstream genes in the geranylation biosynthetic pathway, and <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> in a variety of different tissues. By contrast, if the SGPs were to induce germ cell migration by expressing some unique and dedicated <italic>hmgcr&#x02192;g&#x003b3;1</italic> dependent attractant, it is hard to understand how misexpression of these different upstream genes would be able orchestrate the production of this special molecule in a variety of cells and tissues that have little resemblance to the SGPs. It should be noted, however, that our results would also be compatible with more complicated models. For example, it is possible that the potentiation of Hh signaling by the <italic>hmgcr&#x02192;g&#x003b3;1</italic> pathway induces the production of a specialized and as yet unknown germ cell attractant. Likewise, we also can not exclude the possibility that there is some other target for geranylation besides G&#x003b3;1 which is important for the production or activity of a second germ cell attractant and that this unknown molecule functions in concert with Hh to direct germ cell migration towards the SGPs. However, in either of these more complicated scenarios, the unknown germ cell attractant would have to be a molecule that can be induced in many different cell types in the embryo, but apparently only if these cells also express the Hh protein.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The embryo stainings were performed essentially as described in 51.

To test the cell autonomous function of <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> in germ cell migration, these authors rescued the gastrulation defects of progeny from <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> germline clone mothers using a <italic>nullo-GAL4</italic> to drive expression of a <italic>UAS-g&#x003b3;1</italic> transgene. They reported that the pole cells in these embryos failed to migrate properly out of the midgut and exhibited phenotypes similar to those found for mutations in the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) gene <italic>trapped in endoderm 1</italic> (<italic>tre1</italic>). We wondered whether the geranylated form of G&#x003b3;1 is also required in the germline. To explore this possibility we ectopically expressed the dominant negative <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> deletion mutant G&#x003b3;1-&#x00394;CAAX in the germline. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000333.s003">Figure S3E and S3F</xref>, ectopic expression of the G&#x003b3;1-&#x00394;CAAX protein in germ cells using a <italic>nos-GAL4</italic> driver disrupts germ cell migration. We found that nearly 60&#x00025; of the stage 13&#x02013;15 <italic>nos-GAL4/UAS</italic>-<italic>G&#x003b3;1-&#x00394;CAAX</italic> embryos had 3 or more lost germ cells, while 33&#x00025; had 5 or more lost germ cells (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;100 embryos). This is roughly equivalent to the germ cell migration defects evident when G&#x003b3;1-&#x00394;CAAX is expressed in the mesoderm using a <italic>twist-GAL4</italic> driver. The effects of the dominant negative protein in germ cells would support the findings of Kunwar et al., and argue that <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> (specifically geranylated G&#x003b3;1) has a cell autonomous function in these cells during their migration towards the SGPs. On the other hand, our results differ somewhat from those reported by Kunwar et al. in that we did not observe any obvious defects in the ability of the germ cells to exit the midgut when the G&#x003b3;1-&#x00394;CAAX protein was expressed using the <italic>nos-GAL4</italic> driver. While there are a number of plausible reasons why a <italic>tre1</italic>-like phenotype wasn't observed, the most likely explanation is that not enough of the dominant negative G&#x003b3;1-&#x00394;CAAX is generated to disrupt the <italic>tre-1</italic> dependent migration through the midgut epithelia. In particular, germ cells are known to be transcriptionally quiescent until just before they exit the midgut, and there might not be sufficient time to generate high enough levels of G&#x003b3;1-&#x00394;CAAX to effectively inhibit the maternally derived product. If this explanation is correct, it would suggest that <italic>g&#x003b3;1</italic> may also function at a later, <italic>tre-1</italic> independent step in the germ cell migration pathway since many of the germ cells in <italic>nos-GAL4/UAS</italic>-<italic>G&#x003b3;1-&#x00394;CAAX</italic> embryos fail to coalesce with the SGPs.</p><p>(4.2 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000333.s003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Steve Cohen, Paul Lasko, Fumio Matsuzaki, Eric Olson, Norbert Perrimon and Mark Vandoren kindly provided various reagents including fly strains and antibodies.
