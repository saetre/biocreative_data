Little is known of the specific role these genes play. We have explored the sequences encoding mouse RAG-1 by deleting large parts of the gene and by introducing local sequence changes. We find that a RAG-1 gene with 40% of the coding region deleted still retains its recombination function. In addition, a series of small deletions within the strongly conserved remaining 60% of the coding region was tested. Nine out of ten of these prove unable to provide RAG-1 activity, but one is quite active. Certain peptide sequences were also specifically targeted for mutagenesis. The RAG-1 protein generated from this expression system is transported to the nucleus and is degraded with a 15 minute half-life. The fate of the proteins made by the deletion mutants were also assessed. Transport of RAG-1 protein to the nucleus was found even with the most extensive deletions studied. The functionality of the deleted proteins is discussed with relation to an alignment of RAG-1 sequences from five animal species.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00073-0123-a" xlink:role="5647"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00073-0123-b" xlink:role="5647"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00073-0120.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5644"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00073-0121.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5645"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00073-0122.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5646"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00073-0123.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5647"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00073-0124.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5648"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00073-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5649"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00073-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5650"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
