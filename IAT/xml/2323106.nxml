Vif and Vpu counteract the antiviral effects of cellular restrictions to early and late steps in the viral replication cycle. We present evidence that the Vpx proteins of HIV-2/SIV<sub>SM</sub> promote virus infection by antagonizing an antiviral restriction in macrophages. Fusion of macrophages in which Vpx was essential for virus infection, with COS cells in which Vpx was dispensable for virus infection, generated heterokaryons that supported infection by wild-type SIV but not Vpx-deleted SIV. The restriction potently antagonized infection of macrophages by HIV-1, and expression of Vpx in macrophages <italic>in trans</italic> overcame the restriction to HIV-1 and SIV infection. Vpx was ubiquitylated and both ubiquitylation and the proteasome regulated the activity of Vpx. The ability of Vpx to counteract the restriction to HIV-1 and SIV infection was dependent upon the HIV-1 Vpr interacting protein, damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1), and DDB1 partially substituted for Vpx when fused to Vpr. Our results indicate that macrophage harbor a potent antiviral restriction and that primate lentiviruses have evolved Vpx to counteract this restriction.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Defense against infection by the primate lentiviruses HIV/SIV is mediated primarily by antibodies that can neutralize the virus and by cytotoxic cells that can recognize and kill other virus-infected cells. However, in the past several years, research has revealed the existence of an additional line of host defense against HIV/SIV. It is now apparent that cells contain factors (also known as cellular restrictions) that potently inhibit virus infection. This has forced primate lentiviruses to evolve a strategy to counteract these cellular restriction factors. For example, HIV/SIV encode an accessory protein called Vif, whose function is to neutralize a cellular restriction to HIV/SIV infection. Our study provides evidence for a novel restriction that is expressed by macrophages and which potently antagonizes HIV and SIV infection. We describe how the virus protects itself from this cellular restriction. The goal is to harness this cellular restriction as the basis for a novel therapeutic strategy against HIV infection.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genomes of primate and non-primate lentiviruses encode &#x0201c;accessory&#x0201d; proteins from short open reading frames which are absent from the genomes of simple retroviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Emerman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The function of two of the accessory proteins, the Vif and Vpu proteins, have been defined: Vif antagonizes the antiviral activity of cellular Apobec 3 cytidine deaminases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Sheehy1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and Vpu antagonizes the activity of tetherin to promote release of virions from the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Neil1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In all HIV and SIV lineages, the central viral region (overlapping Vif and Tat open reading frames) encodes at least one gene which is usually termed viral protein R (Vpr). Members of the HIV-2/SIV<sub>SM</sub>/SIV<sub>MAC</sub> lineage contain an additional gene in this region termed viral protein X (Vpx) which was originally derived from the African green monkey <italic>vpr</italic> gene by an ancestral recombination event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Fletcher1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Most of the information regarding the roles of Vpr and Vpx proteins in primate lentivirus replication has been derived from studies with HIV-1 Vpr. The Vpr protein of HIV-1 has been shown to promote the accumulation of cells in the G2 stage of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-He1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Rogel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and to associate with the DNA repair enzyme <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Uracil DNA glycosylase">Uracil DNA glycosylase</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Bouhamdan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Vpr has been shown to promote the infection of terminally differentiated macrophages and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Balliet1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Goujon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These HIV-1 Vpr-ascribed activities segregate between the Vpx and Vpr proteins of HIV-2/SIV<sub>SM</sub>: Vpr of HIV-2/SIV<sub>SM</sub> induces cell cycle arrest and associates with UDG but is dispensable for macrophage infection while Vpx neither induces cell cycle arrest nor associates with UDG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Fletcher1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Sleigh1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Vpx is essential for infection of simian macrophages by SIV in vitro and following infection of simian macrophages by Vpx minus SIV<sub>SM</sub>, late cDNA product are reduced while 2-LTR cDNAs, which are formed only after completion of reverse transcription, are absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Fletcher1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Sleigh1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether any of these activities relate to the functional role of Vpr/Vpx proteins in primate lentivirus replication, is unclear. In order to understand the functions of the Vpr/Vpx proteins in macrophage infection, we have focused on Vpx because of its profound impact on macrophage infection. In addition, its effect can be studied independently of other Vpr/Vpx-assigned activities including UDG association and cell cycle arrest.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Vpx is required for infection of heterokaryons between permissive and non-permissive cells</title><p>We previously demonstrated that Vpx of HIV-2/SIV<sub>SM</sub> was essential for early events in macrophage infection yet dispensable for infection of CD4 lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Fletcher1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

To increase particle infectivity and facilitate analysis of early events in the viral life cycle, viruses were pseudotyped with VSV-G envelope proteins. Although VSV pseudotyping has been shown to alleviate the defects exhibited by other accessory gene mutants such as Nef, pseudotyping did not alleviate the infectivity defect of Vpx-deleted viruses in macrophages. In order to gauge infection of primary macrophages under single cycle conditions, we quantitated viral cDNAs (mainly 2-LTR cDNA) by real time PCR. In this study, where we were dealing with a restriction and the viral target of the restriction was unknown, it seemed prudent to conduct experiments predominantly with viruses intact for all open reading frames as opposed to recombinant indicator viruses.</p><p>The profound requirement for Vpx in macrophage infection by HIV-2/SIV<sub>SM</sub> is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>. 2-LTR cDNA is formed only after completion of viral reverse transcription and translocation of viral cDNA to the nucleus where circularization occurs. Levels of 2-LTR cDNA in macrophages infected with a wild-type SIV and an SIV variant lacking Vpr were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). In contrast, viral 2-LTR cDNA was reduced at least 100 fold in macrophages infected with an SIV variant lacking Vpx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). In COS cells and in HeLa cells, viral cDNA synthesis with wild type and Vpr-deleted or Vpx-deleted viruses were similar. Although 2-LTR cDNA was not detected in macrophages infected with SIV&#x00394; Vpx, late viral cDNAs were evident but at a reduced level. Late cDNAs were reduced 15 fold and 2 fold at 24 and 48 h respectively in SIV&#x00394; Vpx as compared to wild type infection of macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000057.s001"><bold>Figure S1</bold></xref>). Our original study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Fletcher1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> on the requirement for Vpx in SIV infection of monkey macrophages reported a predominant defect in 2-LTR circle formation and an approximately 3 fold defect in late cDNA synthesis using non quantitative PCR. This is consistent with the defect observed in this study which involves infection of human macrophages with SIV. The greater than 100 fold defect in 2-LTR cDNA formation was recapitulated in macrophage infections with Vpx deleted SIV variants expressing GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). This analysis revealed that an SIV variant lacking Vpx was at least 100 fold less infectious than the wild type counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). Although Vpx was necessary for macrophage infection, it was dispensable for infection of COS/HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>)<bold>.</bold> This suggested the existence of cellular activities, differentially expressed between macrophages and COS or HeLa cells, which impact primate lentivirus infection. One possibility was that COS and HeLa cells contain a cellular activity which promotes virus infection but in macrophages, this activity must be activated by the Vpx protein. An alternative possibility was that macrophages contain a cellular restriction to infection which is counteracted by the Vpx protein and this cellular restriction is not expressed in COS or HeLa cells. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used a strategy previously adopted to characterize the mechanism by which Vif promotes viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Simon1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Madani1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Heterokaryons were generated between macrophages and COS cells and the susceptibility of the heterokaryons to infection by SIV<sub>WT</sub> and SIV&#x00394; Vpx was compared. When the fusogenic proteins of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) were expressed in COS cells, these cells readily underwent fusion with primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). Macrophage/COS heterokaryons (double staining cells) were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Double staining cells were not observed when normal COS cells (not expressing NDV proteins) were mixed with macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). As an additional control, macrophage homokaryons were produced using polyethylene glycol (PEG). Both macrophage/COS heterokaryons as well as COS and macrophage homokaryons were infectible by wild type SIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). In contrast, macrophage homokaryons and macrophage/COS heterokaryons were resistant to SIV&#x00394; Vpx infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). Since fusion with COS cells did not relieve the block to macrophage infection by SIV&#x00394; Vpx, this indicated that macrophages harbor an antiviral restriction which is counteracted by the Vpx protein and this restriction is absent from COS and HeLa cells.</p><fig id="ppat-1000057-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000057.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Vpx antagonizes an antiviral restriction in macrophages.</title><p>(A) Differential susceptibility of macrophages and cell lines to infection by wild type and Vpx-deleted (&#x00394;Vpx) or Vpr-deleted (&#x00394;Vpr) variants of SIV<sub>SM</sub>.

We also examined whether Vpx was ubiquinated by endogenous ubiquitin (as opposed to over expressed and tagged ubiquitin). HA-tagged Vpx was expressed in 293 T cells and cell lysates were directly Western blotted and probed with an HA antibody. This revealed the presence of higher molecular weight ubiquitylated forms of Vpx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref><bold>, right panel</bold>). The extent of Vpx ubiquitylation was reduced to various extents in Vpx mutants containing single or multiple lysine to arginine substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). Despite mutagenesis of all four lysines in Vpx, polyubiquitylated forms of the protein were still evident (compare GFP signal with Vpx<sub>M4</sub> signal).

The ability of the Vpx lysine mutants to support SIV infection of macrophages was next examined. The various mutants were packaged within SIV<sub>&#x00394;Vpx</sub> virions and single cycle infection of macrophages was evaluated from synthesis of late viral cDNAs and 2-LTR cDNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). The infectivity of the Vpx lysine mutants was impaired to various degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). The Vpx mutated lacking all four lysine (Vpx<sub>M4</sub>) exhibited the lowest infectivity for macrophage.

However, due to technical obstacles in transfection of primary macrophages, we were unable to evaluate the extent of Vpx ubiquitylation of the various lysine mutants in primary macrophages and for this reason, we were unable to directly assess whether the extent of Vpx ubiquitylation was proportional to Vpx biological activity.

Since proteasome disruption only impacted virus infection of cells in which Vpx was required for infection, this argued that proteasome inhibition specifically impaired Vpx function rather than impacting virus infection through off-target effects. The proteasome inhibitor lactacystin exerted a more modest but significant effect on SIV and HIV-2 infection of macrophages when compared to the other proteasome inhibitors. However, we were unable to test lactacystin in primary macrophages at higher concentrations because of toxicity.

While Vpx had no significant effect on the infectivity of wild type HIV-1, the infectivity of HIV-1&#x00394; Vpr for macrophages was profoundly enhanced by Vpx but not by HIV-1 Vpr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref><bold>, lower panel</bold>). The infectivity enhancement was also apparent in macrophages infected with an HIV-1 variant expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>). Thus, while HIV-1 was infectious for macrophages, its ability to infect these cells was markedly enhanced in the presence of Vpx. Vpx had no effect on the infectivity of wild type or &#x00394;Vpr HIV-1 for COS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref><bold>, upper panel</bold>). A possible explanation for the ability of Vpx to compliment HIV-1 &#x00394;Vpr but not wild-type HIV-1 is that Vpx and HIV-1 Vpr proteins compete for packaging within HIV-1 virions. An alternative possibility was that these proteins do not compete for packaging into virions but compete for interaction with the restriction after infection has occurred. Western blotting analysis revealed that both wild type and lysine mutant (Vpx<sub>M4</sub>) Vpx proteins were packaged into wild type and Vpr deleted HIV-1 virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>). This suggested that HIV-1 Vpr competed with Vpx in the target cell following infection and this competition precluded the ability of Vpx to activate the restriction. A prediction of this is that delivery of Vpx to this target cell prior to HIV-1 infection should be sufficient to inactivate the restriction and subsequently enhance macrophage infection by both wild type and Vpr deleted HIV-1. To evaluate this, we bypassed the requirement for Vpx packaging by directly introducing Vpx into the target cell by SIV<sub>WT</sub> infection. The susceptibility of those cells to infection by wild type or Vpr-deleted HIV-1 variants was then examined. In this case, the infectivity of both wild type and vpr deleted HIV-1 variants for macrophages was enhanced when Vpx was first introduced into the cell by SIV<sub>WT</sub> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>). In contrast, prior infection with a SIV&#x00394; Vpx variant did not enhance subsequent HIV-1 infection of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>). Therefore, in the absence of competition by packaged Vpr, Vpx greatly enhanced HIV-1 infectivity for macrophages. We next evaluated whether the ability of Vpx to enhance HIV-1 infectivity depended upon its ubiquitylation. As was the case for SIV, a Vpx mutant lacking ubiquitylation sites (Vpx<sub>M4</sub>) did not enhance HIV-1 infectivity when packaged within HIV-1&#x00394; Vpr virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>).

In this case, the ability of Vpx to enhance the infectivity of a Vpr deleted HIV-1 variant expressing GFP was compromised by the M4 mutation. In addition, the ability of Vpx to enhance HIV-1 infectivity required proteasome function in that Vpx failed to enhance permissiveness of macrophages to HIV-1 infection in macrophages in which proteasome function was disrupted by ALLN or proteasome inhibitor 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g006"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-1000057-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000057.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>HIV-1 is sensitive to the macrophage restriction and SIV Vpx but not HIV-1 Vpr antagonizes the restriction.</title><p>(A) HIV-1 Vpr and SIV Vpx proteins were packaged in HIV-1<sub>WT</sub> or HIV-1<sub>&#x00394;vpr</sub> viruses by cotransfection (for controls, viruses were transfected with an empty vector or a GFP-expressing vector).

If DDB1 is a functional Vpx interactor, we would predict that DDB1 silencing would only impact SIV infection of macrophages in which the restriction was expressed but not in COS cells which lack the restriction. In addition, HIV-1 Vpr did not antagonize a macrophage restriction. The activity of the restriction in HIV-1 was only revealed by the ability of Vpx to enhance HIV-1 infection of macrophages. Therefore, a prediction is that DDB1 silencing should not inhibit infection of macrophages by HIV-1. DDB1 specific siRNAs efficiently reduced DDB1 expression in COS cells and in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g007"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref><bold>, left panels</bold>).

Vpx exhibits similarities with the Vif protein of primate lentiviruses in that inactivation of the restriction required the proteasome/ubiquitin system. A role for the proteasome/ubiquitin system is provided by our demonstration that ubiquitylation mutants of Vpx are functionally attenuated and treatment of macrophages with proteasome disrupting agents specifically reduces their susceptibility to SIV infection but not HIV-1 infection. The inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitors on SIV infection of primary macrophages as reported in our study appears to be at odds with studies demonstrating that HIV-1 infection of cell lines is enhanced in the presence of proteasome inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Groschel1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Wu1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The majority of these studies have involved cell lines and one of these studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Groschel1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> has suggested that proteasome inhibitors enhance HIV-1 infection by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest thereby imparting a cellular environment that is more permissive to infection. Our study used primary macrophages and since these cells are terminally differentiated and nondividing, enhancing effects of proteasome inhibitors due to cell cycle arrest would not be manifest. A comparison of our study with the study Goujon et. al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Goujon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrates that Vpx is essential for infection of macrophage (our study) and of dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Goujon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there are some differences in the results obtained with Vpx mutant viruses in these two systems. In the study of Goujon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Goujon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 marginally (1&#x02013;2 fold) increased viral DNA accumulation in dendritic cells in the presence of Vpx whereas in our study, proteasome inhibitors markedly inhibited infection of macrophages by SIV but not HIV-1. Since Goujon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Goujon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> reported that primary human dendritic cells were highly sensitive to the toxic effects of MG132, it is possible that differences in treatment conditions that can be employed in macrophages versus dendritic cells could account for these differences. The study of Goujon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Goujon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> also showed an enhancement of SIV infection in the absence of Vpx. We did not examine the effects of proteasome inhibitors on a Vpx-deleted virus in macrophages because this variant was essentially dead in these cells.</p><p>Our study implicates DDB1 as a cellular cofactor of Vpx which is necessary for the ability of Vpx to counteract the macrophage restriction. This is supported by several independent experiments. DDB1 silencing in macrophages specifically impaired their susceptibility to infection by SIV and, in addition, impaired the ability of Vpx to enhance infectivity of macrophages by HIV-1. It is not possible to conclude at present whether DDB1 association accounts, in totality, for the biological activity of Vpx. DDB1 silencing led to a 5&#x02013;10 fold reduction in SIV infectivity of macrophages whereas there was a 100 fold infectivity defect imparted by deletion of Vpx. However, RNA silencing failed to completely deplete DDB1 from primary macrophages and it is possible that residual DDB1 allowed some retention of Vpx activity in these macrophages. We also present evidence that DDB1 binds to ubiquitylated Vpx and that lysine mutants of Vpx which are inefficiently ubiquitylated exhibit reduced DDB1 binding and are impaired in their ability to support SIV infection of macrophages. Using a Vpx mutant lacking lysine residues, we present evidence that Vpx ubiquitylation is important for association with DDB1 and to counteract the macrophage restriction. Although we attribute loss of Vpx function to lack of ubiquitylation and loss of DDB1 binding, we cannot rule out the possibility that loss of function of the mutant protein was due to indirect effects of the mutations on protein structure. However, at the very least, the Vpx lysine mutant is packaged within virions which suggests that it is competent for interaction with the p6 domain of the Gag polyprotein. As with DDB1 silencing, the reduction in Vpx function imparted by mutation of all four lysines in Vpx caused a no more than a 10 fold defect in Vpx function (for example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Therefore, ubiquitylation and DDB1 association may not fully account for the biological activity of Vpx in macrophages. However, polyubiquitylated forms of Vpx were still evident in cells transfected with a Vpx mutant lacking all lysine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000057-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). This suggests some degree of Vpx ubiquitination on nonlysine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Wang1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Cadwell1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Identification and mutagenesis of all ubiquitination residues on Vpx will be required before the degree to which Vpx activity depends upon ubiquitination can fully be assessed. Our study also suggests that DDB1 is not required for Vpx ubiquitylation but that Vpx ubiquitylation is necessary for association with DDB1. Therefore, the loss of function observed with the Vpx lysine mutant is likely to reflect a loss in DDB1 binding. Although SIV Vpr did not counteract the macrophage restriction, fusing it to DDB1 partially conferred this ability. This suggests that the function of Vpx may be to tether DDB1 to the reverse transcription complex upon which the restriction acts. Our study also indicates that DDB1 is required for the ability of Vpx to counter the macrophage restriction to HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 Vpr did not exhibit the ability to counter the macrophage restriction. For this reason, silencing of DDB1 did not impair susceptibility of macrophages to HIV-1 infection. However, the fact that the restriction was active against HIV-1 was revealed by the demonstration that Vpx greatly increased the permissivity of macrophages to HIV-1 infection. In this situation, silencing of DDB1 inhibited the ability of Vpx to enhance macrophage infection by HIV-1. Although Vpx is a virion protein, we do not know if DDB1 itself is packaged within virions. However, since silencing of DDB1 in the target cell inhibited SIV infection, this suggests that Vpx usurps DDB1 after infection of the target cell and likely, within the context of the reverse transcription complex.</p><p>Our study also reveals a paradox with regards to the functional consequences of HIV-1 Vpr and HIV-2/SIV Vpx interaction with DDB1. DDB1 mediates the cell cycle arrest property of HIV-1 Vpr. DDB1 was also necessary for the ability of SIV Vpx to counteract the macrophage restriction. However, SIV Vpx, although able to interact with DDB1, does not induce cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the ability of HIV-1 Vpr to interact with DDB1 does not appear sufficient to confer upon HIV-1 Vpr the ability to efficiently counteract the macrophage restriction. Therefore, there are likely to be different biological outcomes that are dictated by the nature of the interactions that HIV-1 Vpr and SIV Vpx forge with DDB1 and its associated E3 ubiquitin ligase complex components. Further insight into the mechanisms employed by HIV-1 Vpr and HIV-2/SIV<sub>SM</sub> Vpx to enhance macrophage infection may be revealed once the macrophage restriction itself is identified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Proviral DNAs, virus stocks and infections</title><p>The infectious molecular clone SIV<sub>SM</sub> PBj1.9 was used for the majority of experiments in this study.

The DNA ratio for pVSV-G, proviral clones and pIRES2-EGFP-Vpx was 1&#x02236;14&#x02236;1. For encapsidation of Vpr-DDB1 fusion proteins, 293T cells were co-transfected with an SIV deltaVpx/deltaVpr proviral clone, pIRES2-EGFP Vpr-fDDB1 and pVSV-G. The DNA ratio for pVSV-G, proviral clone and DDB1 expression plasmids was 1&#x02236;14&#x02236;1. HIV-1 and SIV stocks were normalized on the basis of reverse transcriptase activity. Viral infection efficiency was gauged from synthesis of viral cDNA products at early intervals (24 and 48 h) post-infection. PCR conditions for amplification of SIV<sub>SM</sub> and HIV-1 2-LTR cDNAs are as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Fletcher1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Sharkey1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. cDNA copy numbers were expressed on a per cell basis after quantitation of genomic DNA copy numbers using PCR and primers to the CCR5 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000057-Sharkey1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Macrophages were initially infected with VSV-pseudotyped SIV variants harboring intact or defective Vpx genes. Viruses used in the initial infection additionally lacked an intact envelope open reading frame. Macrophages were then super-infected with SIV variants which harbored intact envelope genes. As a consequence, cDNA products generated specifically by the super-infecting virus could be identified. SIV cDNA products were amplified in two rounds of PCR with JumpStart&#x02122; Red<sub>accu</sub>Tag&#x02122; DNA polymerase (Sigma). First round products were amplified using forward (taacaggaacaccagcaccaaca) and reverse (catctgctttccctgacaa) primers. Second-round products were amplified using forward (taacaggaacaccagcaccaaca) and reverse (aagcataacctggcggtgcaca) primers.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Gradient purification of virions</title><p>Supernatants from 293T cells transfected with infectious molecular clones were cleared of cellular debris by low-speed centrifugation (1500 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min) and then filtered (0.45 &#x000b5;m).
