Guides for the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA are 21-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are generated by Dicer-dependent cleavage from longer double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). To examine the relationship between the localization of dsRNA and the target cleavage of RNAi in human cells, we constructed five kinds of dsRNA expression vector that were controlled by tRNA<sup>Val</sup> or U6 promoter. Transcripts of tRNA-dsRNA were consistently localized in the cytoplasm and were efficiently processed by Dicer. In contrast, transcripts of tRNA-dsRNA were not processed in cells that expressed Dicer-directed ribozymes. In addition, transcripts of U6-dsRNA were basically localized in the nucleus and were not significantly processed, unless the transcripts of U6-dsRNAs possessed a microRNA-based loop motif: in the latter case, U6-dsRNAs with a microRNA-based loop were transported to the cytoplasm and were effectively processed. More over, tRNA-dsRNA directed against a mutant k-<italic>ras</italic> transcript cleaved its target mRNA efficiently in assays of RNAi not only <italic>in vitro</italic> with a cytoplasmic extract but also <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, it appears that RNAi in human cells occur in the cytoplasm. Importantly, the same tRNA-dsRNA did not affect the degradation of the normal k-<italic>ras</italic> mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our tRNA-dsRNA technology should be a powerful tool for studies of the mechanism of RNAi and the functions of various genes in mammalian cells with potential utility as a therapeutic agent.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA interferance (RNAi) is a process in which double-strand RNA (dsRNA) induces a sequence-dependent degradation of a cognate mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c2">2</xref>). The natural roles of RNAi might include defense against viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c7">7</xref>) and regulation of the expression of cellular genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c9">9</xref>). Genetic and biological studies have revealed that RNAi is a very complex process that involves many different proteins with mostly unidentified functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c11">11</xref>).</p><p>It has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> that dsRNA targets mRNA for cleavage in lysates of early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and in extracts of cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c14">14</xref>), and such reactions <italic>in vitro</italic> require ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c14">14</xref>). The molecular basis for the requirement for ATP is due, in part, to a requirement for ATP in the initial processing of long dsRNA into the 21&#x02013;25-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that serve as guides for targeted cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c18">18</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies with synthetic RNA duplexes demonstrated that the siRNA duplex must have 2- or 3-nt overhanging 3&#x02032;-ends for efficient cleavage of its target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c16">16</xref>). Such 3&#x02032; overhangs are characteristic of the products of cleavage reactions catalyzed by RNase III, and, in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, cleavage of dsRNA into siRNAs requires a multidomain RNase III, known as Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c17">17</xref>). Subsequently, siRNAs seem to associate with a multicomponent nuclease, identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and designated RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC), and then they guide this enzyme so that it catalyzes the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c19">19</xref>).</p><p>RNAi provides a method for inactivating genes of interest and, thus, provides a powerful tool for studies of gene function in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and plants. Specific inhibition of gene expression also can be achieved by the stable or inducible expression of dsRNA in animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c11">11</xref>). Inactivation of genes by dsRNA has been achieved in mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c21">21</xref>), but elicitation of RNAi using long dsRNAs has generally been less successful in cultured mammalian cells. Such failures can be explained most readily by the activation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and 2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthetase (2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-AS) which are activated by long dsRNA (&#x0003e;30 bp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c23">23</xref>).</p><p>It was reported recently that 21-nt synthetic siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c24">24</xref>) and siRNAs that were transcribed by U6 or H1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c32">32</xref>) specifically suppressed the expression of endogenous genes in several lines of mammalian cells. These 21-nt siRNA duplexes were able to evade non-specific reduction of mRNAs and these findings suggested that RNAi or an RNAi-related system might exist in mammals. Some mammalian homologs of RNAi-associated proteins, such as Dicer, eIF2C2 and WRN have, indeed, been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c36">36</xref>).

Therefore, we used two kinds of pol III promoter (the promoter of a gene for human tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, and mouse U6 or human U6 promoter) for expression of dsRNAs in mammalian cells. If designed appropriately, transcripts generated with the promoter of a human gene for tRNA<sup>Val</sup> are transported efficiently to the cytoplasm and we demonstrated previously that the cytoplasmic localization was important in improving ribozyme activities <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c47">47</xref>). In contrast, small RNAs transcribed under the control of the U6 promoter remained localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c37">37</xref>). Thus, we attached the gene for dsRNA (an extended stem&#x02013;loop RNA; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f1">1</xref>A) to the 3&#x02032; end of the promoter of a gene for tRNA<sup>Val</sup> (tRNA-dsRNA), to the 3&#x02032; end of the mouse U6 promoter (mU6-dsRNA) or to the 3&#x02032; end of the human U6 promoter (hU6-dsRNA).</p><p>We constructed dsRNA expression plasmids targeted to the mRNA for a mutant of K-Ras with a point mutation in codon 12 of the k-<italic>ras</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f1">1</xref>B). The length of the double-stranded region within the dsRNA was kept at 29 bp because long dsRNAs (&#x0003e;30mers) induce non-specific reduction of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c23">23</xref>). In the case of U6-based constructs, we used two kinds of loop motif for stem&#x02013;loop RNAs. One is a loop motif that consists of 5 nt (5&#x02032;-GAAAA-3&#x02032;), namely Loop 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f1">1</xref>A). The other is a microRNA (human <italic>mir-23</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c48">48</xref>) loop motif, namely Loop 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f1">1</xref>A). It is believed that precursor microRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm and the processed microRNAs act post-transcriptional gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c54">54</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>dsRNA transcribed under the control of the tRNA<sup>Val</sup> promoter was processed by a Dicer-complex in the cytoplasm</title><p>In RNAi, long dsRNAs are first processed to short RNA duplexes of predominantly 21 and 22 nt in length and with staggered 3&#x02032; ends in an RNase III-like reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c17">17</xref>). To examine whether tRNA-dsRNA and U6-dsRNA might be processed by an RNase III complex in mammalian cells, we performed northern blotting analysis with a k-<italic>ras</italic> mRNA-specific probe. SW480 cells were transfected with plasmids that encoded dsRNA under the control of the tRNA<sup>Val</sup> or U6 promoter. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Total RNA in each fraction was isolated and fractionated on a 15&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f2">2</xref>, in cells that expressed tRNA-dsRNA, processed siRNAs were detected in the cytoplasmic fraction and not in the nuclear fraction. Moreover, the sequences of processed siRNAs were confirmed by cloning and sequencing of the siRNAs (data not shown). In contrast, in cells that expressed either mU6- or hU6-dsRNA (Loop 1), predominantly unprocessed precursor dsRNAs were detected in the nucleus and the nuclear fraction contained very little siRNAs in cells that expressed either mU6- or hU6-dsRNA (Loop 1). However, mU6-dsRNAs (Loop 2) and hU6-dsRNAs (Loop 2) were transported to the cytoplasm and were processed efficiently (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f2">2</xref>). A mammalian Dicer has been detected mostly in the cytoplasm by immunostaining <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c20">20</xref>), so it seems likely that tRNA-dsRNA, mU6-dsRNAs (Loop 2) and hU6-dsRNAs (Loop 2) that had been transported to the cytoplasm were processed by the Dicer-like RNase III complex.</p><p>To confirm whether tRNA-dsRNAs are processed by Dicer, we constructed a poly(A)-connected Dicer-directed ribozyme (Dicer-RzA100) expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c44">44</xref>). Then this plasmid was introduced into HeLa cells stably. Stable cell lines were obtained by neomycin selection. Next, to examine suppression of expression of dicer gene by Dicer-RzA100, we performed the RT&#x02013;PCR analysis with specific primers for dicer mRNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f3">3</xref>A, the level of dicer mRNA in cells that expressed Dicer-RzA100 was reduced compared with that in WT-HeLa cells. The level of GADPH mRNA as a control did not alter in both cell lines. These results indicated that the Dicer-RzA100 cleaved dicer mRNAs specifically.</p><p>To examine whether reduction of Dicer affects the processing of the tRNA-dsRNA, we performed northern blot analysis using total RNAs from cells that expressed the tRNA-dsRNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f3">3</xref>B, in the case of a total RNA from cells that expressed the Dicer-RzA100, siRNAs that are generated from tRNA-dsRNAs were not observed in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Therefore, these results suggest that tRNA-dsRNAs are processed by Dicer in the cytoplasm. In contrast, reduction of Dicer did not affect processing of mU6-dsRNA (Loop 1). Thus, it is possible that the processing of mU6-dsRNA (Loop 1) is dealt with another RNase III-like enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Degradation of target mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> in a cell extract that contained tRNA-dsRNA, U6-dsRNA or synthetic siRNAs</title><p>To examine the cell compartment in which degradation of a target mRNA by dsRNA-mediated gene silencing occurs, we performed assays of RNAi <italic>in vitro</italic> using cell extracts that contained transcripts of tRNA-dsRNA.

These results support the earlier reports that the RISC is included in a ribosomal fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c19">19</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to these results, in the case of the normal k-<italic>ras</italic> mRNA substrate, significantly smaller amounts of 5&#x02032;-cleavage products were detected and these were found only in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell extracts that contained transcripts of tRNA-dsRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f4">4</xref>A, lane 2). These results are in accord with the report that synthesized siRNAs with one mismatched base pair in the middle of the siRNA was reduced in efficiency of cleavage of a target RNA in an assay of RNAi <italic>in vitro</italic> with lysates of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c55">55</xref>).

Thus, our results suggested that degradation of a target mRNA by dsRNA-mediated gene silencing occurs in the cytoplasm and that siRNAs are capable of recognizing one mismatched base pair in a middle position.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficiency and specificity of RNAi by tRNA-dsRNA in colon cancer cells</title><p>To examine the efficiency and specificity of RNAi by tRNA-dsRNA in human colon cancer SW480 cells, we introduced tRNA-dsRNAs and four kinds of U6-dsRNAs expression plasmids into SW480 and HeLa cells. The mutant k-<italic>ras</italic> gene was expressed in SW480 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c56">56</xref>). We used HeLa cells that expressed a normal k-<italic>ras</italic> gene as controls. We generated stable lines of cells that expressed tRNA-dsRNAs or each U6-dsRNA by selection in the presence of puromycin. We examined levels of K-Ras protein in cells that expressed tRNA-dsRNA or each U6-dsRNA by western blotting with K-Ras-specific antibodies. For quantitation, intensities of bands were analyzed by densitometry using the NIH Image Analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f5">5</xref>, the level of K-Ras protein in SW480 cells that expressed tRNA-dsRNA, mU6-dsRNA (Loop 2) or hU6-dsRNA (Loop 2) was significantly lower than that in wild-type SW480 cells, whereas the level of K-Ras protein in SW480 cells that expressed mU6-dsRNA (Loop 1) or hU6-dsRNA (Loop 1) was reduced only slightly compared with that in wild-type SW480 cells. The level of actin, chosen as an endogenous control, remained constant in these cell lines. Moreover, in HeLa cells that expressed tRNA-dsRNA, the level of K-Ras protein was similar to that in wild-type cells and in cells that expressed respective U6-dsRNA. These results demonstrated clearly both the efficiency and specificity of the tRNA-dsRNA in human cancer cells.</p><p>To examine the phenotype of cells that expressed tRNA-dsRNA, we analyzed the rates of proliferation of various lines of cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f6">6</xref>, SW480 cells that expressed tRNA-dsRNA proliferated significantly more slowly than wild-type SW480 cells. In contrast, the rate of proliferation in HeLa cells that expressed tRNA-dsRNA was the same as that of wild-type SW480 cells. These results indicated that the reduced rate of proliferation of SW480 cells that expressed tRNA-dsRNA was correlated with the reduction in the level of K-Ras protein in the cells. Thus, our tRNA-dsRNA targeted to the mutant k-<italic>ras</italic> gene appears to have potential utility as a therapeutic agent.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The discovery that dsRNA could induce gene silencing in animals and plants has raised the possibility that RNAi might be a nearly universal mechanism of gene silencing. An outline of the processes involoved in RNAi and several components have been identified in <italic>C.elegans</italic>, <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and plants, but details of the mechanism and many of the necessary participants in RNAi in mammalian cells remain unclear. In this study, to clarify the relationship between the localization and the target specificity of RNAi in mammalian cells, we constructed two kinds of dsRNA expression plasmid, namely, tRNA-dsRNA and U6-dsRNA expression plasmids. We demonstrated that tRNA-dsRNA which was localized in the cytoplasm was efficiently processed by the RNase III complex. An initial step in RNAi is the cleavage by Dicer, which is localized in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c20">20</xref>), of long dsRNAs. Although short dsRNAs are cleaved less effectively by Dicer <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c17">17</xref>), our tRNA-dsRNA was processed with significant efficiency in mammalian cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f2">2</xref>). In addition, U6-dsRNAs that had a microRNA-based loop motif were transported to the cytoplasm and were processed. Although transcripts from the U6 promoter are generally localized in the nucleus, the microRNA-loop motif promotes the transport of dsRNAs to the cytoplasm. Thus, cytoplasmic localization of dsRNAs is important for processing by Dicer.</p><p>The degradation step of mRNA is a very interesting aspect of RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Although two groups proposed that an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) chain reaction with siRNA amplifies the interference caused by a small amount of &#x02018;trigger&#x02019; dsRNA in <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c57">57</xref>), the mechanism is unclear in mammalian cells because an RdRP homolog does not exist in mammalian cells and siRNAs function as guides, not primers, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human RNAi pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c58">58</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that a cytoplasmic fraction from cells which expressed tRNA-dsRNA had mRNA degradation activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f4">4</xref>A). In addition, synthetic siRNAs mixed with the cytoplasmic fraction also had mRNA degradation activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f4">4</xref>B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c36">36</xref>). Moreover, it was recently reported that the level of HIV RRE-containing mRNA in the nucleus was not affected by siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c59">59</xref>). Thus, it is likely that a siRNA-associated silencing complex (SASC) including Dicer or -Slicer- is localized in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells.</p><p>RNAi has been shown to be a powerful tool for studies of gene function in <italic>C.elegans</italic>, <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and plants. However, in mammalian cells, a long dsRNA causes the non-specific reduction in expression of many genes. Thus, it was believed initially that RNAi could not be used for gene inactivation in mammalian cells. However, Tuschle&#x02019;s group demonstrated that siRNA could specifically suppress the expression of a target gene specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c24">24</xref>). Exploitation of RNAi in mammalian cells requires evasion of non-specific reduction of mRNAs. In addition, since the putative SASC is located in the cytoplasm, it is important that dsRNA transcripts be localized in the cytoplasm. If properly designed, tRNA-dsRNAs (with a short hairpin structure) can be transported to the cytoplasm and can escape the non-specific reduction of mRNAs. Indeed, we found that PKR was not activated in cells that expressed tRNA-dsRNA (data not shown).</p><p>Although our U6-dsRNA with a general loop motif that consisted of five nucleotides was not transported to the cytoplasm and we could detect only marginal RNAi by our U6-dsRNA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f5">5</xref>), transcripts of U6-dsRNAs (Loop 2) that had a microRNA-based loop motif were transported to the cytoplasm and were processed by Dicer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f2">2</xref>). In addition, they induced RNAi-mediated gene silencing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg158f5">5</xref>).</p><p>When alternative conditions were used, other U6-dsRNAs prepared by several independent groups (length of dsRNA and the size and the sequence of the hairpin-loop in these constructs were different from those of our U6-dsRNA) could support RNAi in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c30">30</xref>). In one case, a microRNA motif was used as the loop motif of dsRNA and the efficacy could have been enhanced by a microRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg158c32">32</xref>). Thus, the length and the nucleotide sequence of the loop in hairpin types of dsRNAs are important for construction of effective hairpin types of dsRNAs. Now we are examining effects of both different length and structure of the loop on the localization and RNAi-mediated gene silencing by hairpin types of dsRNAs in detail.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that RNAi in mammalian cells occurs in the cytoplasm and is very specific in mammalian cells. Our tRNA-dsRNAs should be powerful tools for studies of the mechanism of RNAi and the functions of specific genes in mammalian cells, and they might also be useful as therapeutic agents.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg158f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Construction of dsRNA expression plasmids.
