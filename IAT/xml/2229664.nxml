Here we show that the expression of RNF5 (aka RMA1), an ER-anchored RING finger E3 ligase implicated in muscle organization and in recognition and processing of malfolded proteins, is elevated and mislocalized to cytoplasmic aggregates in biopsies from patients suffering from sporadic-Inclusion Body Myositis (sIBM). Consistent with these findings, an animal model for hereditary IBM (hIBM), but not their control littermates, revealed deregulated expression of RNF5. Further studies for the role of <italic>RNF5</italic> in the pathogenesis of s-IBM and more generally in muscle physiology were performed using <italic>RNF5</italic> transgenic and KO animals. Transgenic mice carrying inducible expression of RNF5, under control of &#x003b2;-actin or muscle specific promoter, exhibit an early onset of muscle wasting, muscle degeneration and extensive fiber regeneration. Prolonged expression of RNF5 in the muscle also results in the formation of fibers containing congophilic material, blue-rimmed vacuoles and inclusion bodies. These phenotypes were associated with altered expression and activity of ER chaperones, characteristic of myodegenerative diseases such as s-IBM. Conversely, muscle regeneration and induction of ER stress markers were delayed in RNF5 KO mice subjected to cardiotoxin treatment. While supporting a role for RNF5 Tg mice as model for s-IBM, our study also establishes the importance of RNF5 in muscle physiology and its deregulation in ER stress associated muscular disorders.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscles are continually subjected to remodeling as a consequence of normal mechanical or metabolic stress, as an adjustment of muscle mass to muscle load during normal activity, or as a response to a muscle disease. While exercise leads to increased protein synthesis and build-up of muscle mass (hypertrophy), disuse is associated with degradation of muscle components (atrophy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Boonyarom1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Glass1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

During muscle remodeling, changes in protein turnover due to controlled degradation are balanced by new protein synthesis.</p><p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a key player in muscle dynamics both in normal and in pathological conditions. The UPS is able to selectively target for degradation structural and regulatory components following their ubiquitination by different E3 ligases. Increased general UPS components, and in particular specific E3 ligases, have been implicated in muscle remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Glass1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Jackman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Reid1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The important role of UPS in muscle atrophy is exemplified by MuRF1, a RING finger E3 ligase, and MAFbx, an F-Box protein component of the Skp1-Cullin F-Box protein (SCF) complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Bodine1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Increased expression of these ligases in mouse models of muscle disuse results in degradation of structural components of the muscle fibers such as the myofibrillar proteins (myosin, titin, troponin, nebulin, myotilin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Witt1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Clarke1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

The E3 ligase MuRF3 has also been shown to elicit a protective effect on myocardial function through its action on two types of filamins involved in muscle mechanosensing and signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Fielitz1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Other E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as ZNF216, have been implicated in general muscle physiology and muscle atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Hishiya1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Ozz-E3 was identified as an E3 ligase that targets sarcolemma-associated &#x003b2;-catenin for degradation and controls growth and maintenance of myofibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Nastasi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar role in myofibrillogenesis has been proposed for the MuRF2 E3 ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-McElhinny1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies support the notion that E3 ligases are an integral component of muscle dynamics during maintenance of normal muscle function.</p><p>In muscle disease, recent evidence supports a role of the UPS in the pathogenesis of select myopathies. Mutations in TRIM32 RING finger E3 ligase have been associated with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) type 2H <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Frosk1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and sarcotubular myopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Schoser1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the mechanism linking TRIM32 ligase activity to LGMD type 2H is unknown, TRIM32 has been shown to interact with myosin and to ubiquitinate actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Kudryashova1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a role in myofibrillar turnover during muscle adaptation. Accumulation of ubiquitin-containing cytoplasmic aggregates has been associated with both sporadic and hereditary forms of inclusion-body myositis (sIBM and hIBM). These findings suggest an important role of the UPS in accumulation, misfolding and aggregation of muscle proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Askanas1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This has been confirmed by genetic and histopathological analysis that links IBM-like muscle disorders with impairment of the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, a degradation pathway important in removal of misfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Vattemi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The sporadic form of IBM (sIBM) is the most common acquired myopathy that occurs in the older human population. sIBM is a slowly progressive myopathy that combines both a T-cell mediated autoimmune inflammatory response and myodegenerative features including vacuolar degeneration, protein aggregation and inclusion formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Askanas1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, sIBM patients are poorly responsive to anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive treatments, suggesting that inflammation per se may not be a primary cause of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Askanas1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Among current hypotheses, accumulation of malfolded proteins such as amyloid &#x003b2; Precursor Protein (a&#x003b2;PP) and its processed forms, and ER overload associated with proteasomal dysfunction are thought to be key players in sIBM pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Askanas1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This hypothesis has been further substantiated by the fact that different ER stress markers, such as GRP78 and GRP94 are overexpressed and present in amyloid containing aggregates in sIBM muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Askanas1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Vattemi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, most likely as a consequence of the activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Therefore, ER stress induction and impaired clearance of malfolded proteins are thought to be part of the pathogenic process occurring in s-IBM.</p><p>We have previously shown that the RING finger ubiquitin ligase RNF5 (also known as RMA-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Kyushiki1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Matsuda1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>) plays an important role in muscle physiology using the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Broday1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> RNF-5 localizes to the dense bodies and the M-line of the body wall muscles, where it regulates the levels of the LIM domain protein UNC-95.

In a mammalian cell culture system, RNF5 has been shown to ubiquitinate and regulate the localization of the protein paxillin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Didier1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, a critical component of focal adhesion, involved in cell adhesion and motility. More recently, RNF5 has been described as a new component of the ERAD machinery, where it contributes to the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of malfolded proteins as part of cell protein quality control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Younger1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we have established and characterized inducible transgenic mouse over-expressing RNF5 either ubiquitously or in a muscle specific manner. We show that general as well as tissue specific overexpression of RNF5 induces myofiber degeneration associated with an alteration of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function. Conversely, RNF5 KO mice exhibit delayed repair of muscle damage associated with attenuated ER stress response. Screening for RNF5 expression in muscle biopsies from patients suffering from muscular disorders including classical myopathies such as Duchenne and Becker myopathy as well as other myopathies with unknown etiology identified upregulation and mislocalization of RNF5 to aggregates in muscles from sIBM patients, as well as in a mouse model for hereditary IBM. Our findings establishes the importance of RNF5 in muscle physiology and in ER stress associated muscular disorders while pointing to the possible use of <italic>RNF5</italic> transgenic mouse as a unique model to study the role of ER function in the pathogenesis of degenerative muscle diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Aberrant RNF5 expression in human myopathies</title><p>To assess whether RNF5 expression or localization would be deregulated in certain human myopathies associated with ER impairment, muscle biopsies from patients affected by different forms of myopathies were screened for possible changes in pattern or level of RNF5 expression using RNF5 antibodies with confirmed specificity developed in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001609.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). An alteration of RNF5 expression in both vacuolated muscle fibers and in apparently normal fibers (2&#x02013;20&#x00025; of total fibers) was detected in biopsies from 10 patients with sIBM. Compared to control muscle, RNF5 in biopsies from sIBM patients was increased in amount and mislocalized, most frequently in apparently non vacuolated muscle fibers and diffusely within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001609-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Strikingly, in 3 out of 10 biopsies from sIBM patients, intensive staining for RNF5 was evident with formation of giant aggregates inside some muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001609-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Interestingly, RNF5 inclusions partly co-localized with beta-amyloid positive aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001609-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) but not with phospho-tau containing structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001609-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Given the limited expression of RNF5 in skeletal muscle, endogenous RNF5 was not detectable by straight western blots in extracts from human biopsies. Elevated RNF5 protein levels could be observed after RNF5 immunoprecipitation in biopsies from sIBM patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001609-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

In transverse sections of fresh frozen specimens from the triceps brachii, tibialis anterior and vastus lateralis muscles, there was a marked variability in myofiber size in the treated double transgenic animals, with numerous small caliber fibers having a round shape, and multifocal clusters of mononuclear cells. As there was no elevation of atrogin-1 in the muscle from the double transgenic animals, the decrease in fiber size was not likely a result of muscle atrophy (data not shown). Many muscle fibers of both small and larger caliber contained internal nuclei. Measurement of the cross-sectional area confirmed the presence of many small fibers, most markedly within the vastus lateralis muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001609-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The small size of the muscle fibers was reflected by a decrease in the weight of each muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001609-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).

Of interest, induction of calnexin was slightly delayed whereas expression of PDI was elevated in RNF5 KO.</p><p>Consistent with the changes observed in induction of ER stress markers, muscle regeneration in RNF5 KO mice was attenuated, compared to control animals, as evident from (i) delayed production of myosin heavy chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001609-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>) and (ii) a high number of centrally nucleated fibers observed 28 days after cardiotoxin treatment in the KO but not WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001609-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). These data substantiate the observations made with RNF5 Tg mice and suggest that <italic>RNF5</italic> is playing an important role in muscle regeneration process associated with ER stress response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study establishes a link between RNF5 and specific muscular disorders associated with ER stress. Prompted by our observation that RNF5 is overexpressed and mislocalized to aggregates in muscle biopsies from sIBM patients and deregulated in an animal model for hereditary IBM, we have investigated the role of RNF5 in muscle using 3 genetic mouse models: an inducible transgenic mouse in which the E3 ligase RNF5 is conditionally overexpressed (globally and selectively in skeletal muscle) and an RNF5 KO mouse. RNF5 overexpression led to myodegeneration and regeneration in skeletal muscle independent of the classical dystrophic mechanism of sarcomeric disruption. In addition, prolonged RNF5 overexpression leads to the formation of blue-rimmed vacuoles containing inclusions and congo red positive fibers, as seen in sIBM. Further, RNF5 KO mice subjected to muscle damage exhibited a milder muscle phenotype which is consistent with a slower regenerative process. Both RNF5 overexpression and KO models suggest that the muscle phenotypes are associated with altered ER stress response, as shown by the increase in the ER stress markers PDI, GRP78, GRP94 and calnexin in the muscle of the RNF5-overexpressing animals and the delay in GRP94 and calnexin induction in RNF5 KO. These observations establish a link between RNF5, ER stress and muscle physiology. The mouse lines established and characterized in this study offer new models to study ER-related myodegenerative process that occur in myopathies such as sporadic or hereditary IBM.</p><p>Impairment of the ERAD and UPR pathways has been linked with the onset of degenerative diseases such as sIBM, and is thought to have a contributing role by allowing improper accumulation of malfolded proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that RNF5, an E3 ligase involved in ERAD, exhibit an altered pattern of expression in biopsies from sIBM patients. Interestingly, RNF5 has also been shown to be upregulated in brain (Substantia Nigra) from Parkinson Disease patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Kim1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, therefore pointing to a possible broader role of this E3 ligase in degenerative disorders. The increase in RNF5 expression seen in these degenerative diseases could be a consequence of ER overload, ERAD dysfunction, or part of the mechanism engaged in the development of these disorders. Our data supports the latter possibility since RNF5 overexpression is sufficient to induce the myodegenerative process associated with both the formation of blue-rimmed vacuole over time and an elevation of ER stress markers, characteristic of sIBM. Our observation that RNF5 over-expression was not sufficient to promote the formation of vacuoles containing inclusions at an early time point when ER stress markers were already upregulated suggests that ER stress and RNF5 overexpression are among early events in the pathology of these muscle disorders.</p><p>That RNF5 is deregulated in the DMRV mouse model, where a sialation defect has previously been shown to promote the IBM-like phenotype, implies that RNF5 deregulation may not be the primary cause for the disease but rather be one of the early components contributing to the pathological process.</p><p>Among mechanisms that may account for the ability of RNF5 to cause myodegeneration is the effect of RNF5 on ER stress response and ERAD. RNF5 contributes to ubiquitination of misfolded proteins, with a concomitant effect on their clearance of the proteins by the proteasomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Younger1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. RNF5 also controls ERAD through its effect on JAMP, an ER anchored 7 transmembrane protein which is important for proteasome recruitment to the ER (our unpublished observation). Thus, RNF5 overexpression is expected to impair the ER stress response, consistent with the modification of ER stress associated chaperones observed in our mouse model. Of importance is that accumulating pathological evidence now links mutations or dysregulation of ER-related proteins with muscular disorders. For example, mutations in the ER-associated ATPase p97/VCP have been associated with a specific type of inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Watts1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the p97/VCP and ERAD pathways were recently implicated in the degradation of sarcomeric myosin and its chaperone Unc-45 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Janiesch1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Landsverk1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, thereby offering a link between physiologic ER function and the organization of essential structural muscle components. Further, activation of ER stress was implicated in an animal model of autoimmune myositis with increased expression of MHC class I in muscle fibers and in human myositis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Nagaraju1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. ER overload may be sufficient to trigger muscle regeneration prior to, and independently of, the onset of inflammation, supporting ER dysfunction as a primary cause of fiber damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Nagaraju1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Nagaraju2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, RNF5 overexpression may impair the ER function, ultimately leading to a defect in the process of muscle maintenance.</p><p>Independent evidence also supports the fact that ER-associated processes are physiologically relevant during muscle regeneration. The chaperone protein GRP94 and the ER-stress-responsive transcription factor ATF6 were upregulated and required for proper myoblast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Nakanishi1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Gorza1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. UPR has recently been proposed to be part of a quality control mechanism that determines proper muscle differentiation. In this model, the induction of certain UPR components, such as the transcription factor Xbp1, is used as a threshold to determine the progression of the myoblast into the differentiation program and the survival of the differentiated fiber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-AcostaAlvear1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Blais1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Nakanishi2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Deregulation of RNF5 in this context is expected to interfere with the balance of these components most probably as a downstream component of this system, therefore altering the differentiation and the muscle maintenance programs. Of interest, RNF5 E3 ligase activity does not appear to be required for the muscular phenotype, as Tg mice that expresses RING mutant form of RNF5 exhibits similar phenotypes (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, a close homolog of RNF5, RNF185, was shown to control paxillin turn-over during Xenopus development independently of its E3 ligase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Iioka1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Among possibilities to explain ubiquitin ligase independent effect of RNF5 is that RNF5 may impair muscle function by squelching or recruiting components of the ER machinery, by outcompeting its associated ligases (i.e. CHIP or gp78), or by acting as an E4 ligase on specific substrates after their ubiquitination by another E3 for which ligase activity may not always be required (i.e. p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001609-Grossman1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the characterization of the RNF5 transgenic and KO mouse models establishes an undisclosed link between impaired ER stress response and the early changes in degenerative myopathies, shown here for sIBM, while offering a novel model for studying the complex function of the ER in global muscle physiology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of <italic>RNF5</italic> transgenic mice</title><p>Mouse studies were performed under IACUC approvals from MSSM and BIMR.
