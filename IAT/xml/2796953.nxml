The 17 kb non-coding Xist RNA is crucial to this process and accumulates on the future inactive X chromosome. The most conserved Xist RNA region, the A region, contains eight or nine repeats separated by U-rich spacers. It is implicated in the recruitment of late inactivated X genes to the silencing compartment and likely in the recruitment of complex PRC2. Little is known about the structure of the A region and more generally about Xist RNA structure. Knowledge of its structure is restricted to an NMR study of a single A repeat element. Our study is the first experimental analysis of the structure of the entire A region in solution. By the use of chemical and enzymatic probes and FRET experiments, using oligonucleotides carrying fluorescent dyes, we resolved problems linked to sequence redundancies and established a 2-D structure for the A region that contains two long stem-loop structures each including four repeats. Interactions formed between repeats and between repeats and spacers stabilize these structures. Conservation of the spacer terminal sequences allows formation of such structures in all sequenced Xist RNAs. By combination of RNP affinity chromatography, immunoprecipitation assays, mass spectrometry, and Western blot analysis, we demonstrate that the A region can associate with components of the PRC2 complex in mouse ES cell nuclear extracts. Whilst a single four-repeat motif is able to associate with components of this complex, recruitment of Suz12 is clearly more efficient when the entire A region is present. Our data with their emphasis on the importance of inter-repeat pairing change fundamentally our conception of the 2-D structure of the A region of Xist RNA and support its possible implication in recruitment of the PRC2 complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In placental mammal females, Xist RNA is crucial for inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in order to maintain proper X chromosome dosage.

Based on nucleotide sequence of the A region and computer prediction, Wutz and colleagues have proposed that each repeat forms two short stem-loop structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000276-Wutz1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent NMR analysis confirmed that one of these stem-loop structures can be formed in vitro by an RNA molecule bearing a single copy of the mouse repeat A sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000276-Duszczyk1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In Xist RNA, the repeat sequences are, however, separated by long spacer regions (21 to 48 nt long for mouse). Since current models fail to take account of this sequence complexity, an experimental analysis of the entire A region was thought likely to provide valuable information on the structure of the A region. As conventional probing experiments are, however, hindered by the presence of the repeated sequences and long U tracks, we applied a combined approach exploiting both chemical and enzymatic probing of RNA structure in solution and FRET experiments using fluorescent oligonucleotide probes complementary to different parts of the A region.</p><p>Using this dual approach, we could show that repeats in the A region interact with each other to form long irregular stem-loop structures. Such inter-repeat interactions appear to be required for the binding of the various components of the PRC2 complex. We identified the minimal number of repeats necessary for such binding. The implications of our results within the wider context of X-inactivation and of the XCI mechanism(s) underlying silencing are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Probing of Mouse and Human A Region 2-D Structures</title><p>We analysed in parallel both the entire mouse and human A regions, as the sequence divergence of the inter-repeat linking sequence between mouse and human was expected to provide insight into how the spacer regions might influence the A repeat structure. The specific primers for the two A regions are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000276.s010">Table S1</xref>. To test if the A region interacts with neighbouring Xist RNA sequences, an RNA that contained only the mouse A region (positions 277 to 760 in mouse Xist RNA) and a larger RNA including the sequence extending from positions 1 to 1137 were studied in parallel by limited enzymatic digestion. Very similar digestion profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>) were obtained for the two RNAs when digestions were performed on the T7 RNA transcripts after folding under the conditions outlined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. We conclude that the A region probably folds on itself without major interaction with other upstream and downstream Xist sequences. Hence, our subsequent analyses of the 2-D structure of the Xist A region were carried out in the absence of flanking sequences (positions 227 to 760 and 330 to 796 for the mouse and human A regions, respectively).

We explored the possibility that each repeat folds into a unique longer stem-loop structure. Such folding was similarly unable to explain V1 RNase cleavages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000276.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We conclude that the 2-D structure may involve interactions between repeats and spacers and inter-repeat interactions. There is, however, a multitude of potential ways for duplex formation between repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g003">Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g005">5</xref>, models 1&#x02013;3). Our design of the putative structure was orientated by the detection of six successive strong V1 RNase cleavages in the central poly A sequence (positions 550 to 555), suggesting the involvement of this segment in a helical structure. The strong modification by DMS of a sequence immediately downstream (positions 555 to 561) was an indication for a single-stranded state. One possible explanation for these data was the formation of a central stem-loop structure called SLS2M with a U track on one strand and an A track on the other strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Formation of this central stem-loop structure was subsequently imposed as a constraint when exploring the possible folding of the mouse A region. This excluded structures in which two successive repeats would interact with each other (Model 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g003">Figure 3</xref>), since in this case, the entire poly A region would interact with the poly U track located upstream of repeat 3, which was not in agreement with the probing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Another possible structure involved formation of an interaction between the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; halves of the A region. This would generate a very long irregular stem-loop structure with an A rich terminal loop (Model 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g004">Figure 4</xref>). An alternative structure involved the folding on themselves of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; parts of the A region, with SLS2M in between (Model 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

It is the most thermodynamically stable structure proposed for this 5&#x02032; segment and was predicted irrespective of whether the experimental data were introduced as a constraint in the M-fold search. In SLS1M, each repeat interacts both with another repeat and with a spacer segment, increasing the stability of the overall structure. Similarly, M-fold analysis of the 3&#x02032; part of the mouse A region suggested that repeat 5 interacts with repeat 8 and a spacer region and repeat 6 with repeat 7 and a spacer region. The resulting SLS3M structure was predicted as the most favourable structure by M-fold when the experimental data were incorporated as a constraint. The overall predicted three stem-loop structure (Model 3) has a low calculated free energy (&#x02212;77.76 kcal/mol) and has a better fit to the experimental data than Models 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g004">4</xref>), suggesting that, in solution, Model 3 is the most likely structure among the numerous possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The Possibility to Form Structure 3 Is Phylogenetically Conserved</title><p>If a structure has biological relevance, it is generally conserved throughout evolution. Therefore, we tested whether the most favourable structures identified for the mouse A region were relevant to the human A region in solution. The sequence of the human A region differs from that of mouse by the presence of an additional repeat 5 and the absence of a long central polyA region. Experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000276.s003">Figure S3A</xref>&#x02013;E) suggested that the central repeat 5 forms a central stem-loop structure (SLS2H). Based on this, structures similar to mouse Models 2 and 3 could be proposed for the human A region which involve either a long irregular stem-loop structure including all the repeats (Model 2) or a three stem-loop structure (Model 3) with repeats 1 to 4 forming a first stem-loop structure (SLS1H), repeat 5 folded alone in a second stem-loop (SLS2H) and repeats 6 to 9 involved in a third stem-loop structure (SLS3H). As for the mouse A region: (i) A 2-D structure in which each repeat interacts with its immediate downstream repeat (repeats 1, 3, 6, and 8 with repeats 2, 4, 7, and 9, respectively, Model 1) was not supported by the probing data (segment 688 to 696) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000276.s004">Figure S4</xref>); (ii) M-fold analysis of the 5&#x02032; portion of the human A region (positions 370 to 530) either with or without the experimental data as a constraint identified SLS1H as the most stable structure (&#x00394;G&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;42.70 kcal/mol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g007">Figure 7</xref>); (iii) SLS3H was retained as the most stable structure for the 3&#x02032; part of the A region, when the experimental data were added as a constraint to an M-fold search; and (iv) the 3 stem-loop structure corresponding to Model 3 (&#x00394;G&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;86.6 kcal/mol) had the best fit with probing data compared to the other 2-D models.

This Model predicts that the P1&#x02013;P5 and P2&#x02013;P4 pairs of oligonucleotides interact with the single-stranded segments which border the helix formed by repeats 1 and 4, whilst the P6&#x02013;P7 pair of oligonucleotides should interact with the single-stranded segments bordering the helix formed by repeats 5 and 8. A marked FRET effect would therefore be expected for these three oligonucleotide pairs if the A region was folded as in Model 3. The distance between the fluorophores of these three pairs of oligonucleotides would, on the other hand, be expected to be much larger if region A was folded as in structures 1 or 2. Whilst tertiary structural interactions might decrease the distances, a lower level of FRET would still be expected to be observed for the three pairs of oligonucleotides if the A region was folded according to structures 1 or 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The P1 and P6 oligonucleotides bind to two single-stranded segments which flank the helix formed by repeats 1 and 8 in structure 2. A strong FRET effect for P1 and P6 would therefore be expected if the A region was folded according to structure 2. Upon binding to the A region, oligonucleotide P7 partially disrupts the base-pair interactions formed by the central poly A stretch. However, as similar levels of destabilization are expected for the three possible structures, binding of this oligonucleotide was not expected to favour one structure more than the two other ones. The same is true for oligonucleotide P5 that binds to the partner U stretch of the poly A sequence. To monitor the level of FRET obtained for oligonucleotides bordering a helix, we used the short R1&#x02013;2 transcript containing repeats 1 and 2 and their bordering sequences, which adopt a single unique 2-D structure and the P1&#x02013;P3&#x02032; oligonucleotide pair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000276.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Other controls exploited the P3&#x02013;P6 and P3&#x02013;P5 pairs, which were not expected to be in close proximity in any of the three proposed structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The oligonucleotide pairs used are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g008">Figure 8</xref>, along with examples of typical fluorescence intensity spectra recorded in FRET experiments for the P2&#x02013;P4 and P3&#x02013;P6 pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). High FRET signals in the range of 50&#x00025; were obtained for the P1/P5, P2/P4, and P7/P6 oligonucleotide pairs, whilst lower FRET signals were observed for the P1&#x02013;P6 (35&#x00025;) and especially the P3&#x02013;P6 and P3&#x02013;P5 oligonucleotide pairs (25&#x00025; and 22&#x00025;, respectively). This is compatible with a large part of the molecules being folded in solution into structure 3. Folding of a large number of molecules into structure 2 would have led to a strong FRET signal for the P1&#x02013;P6 pair and lower signals for the five other pairs, which was not observed. The strong FRET effects obtained for the P1/P5, P2/P4, and P7/P6 oligonucleotide pairs argues strongly against folding according to structure 1.

Here, we show that in vitro the repeated elements in the A region of both mouse and human Xist RNAs interact together and with the intervening spacer regions. This leads to the formation of peculiar long irregular stem-loop structures containing four repeats and long U rich terminal and internal loops. Our proteomic analysis suggests that these four-repeat structures may correspond to functional modules initiating the assembly of the PRC2 complex.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>A New Conception of the 2-D Structure of the A Region</title><p>Until now, both computer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000276-Wutz1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and experimental analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000276-Duszczyk1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> of the possible 2-D structure of the A region of Xist RNA have privileged the individual repeat as the unit of folding. However, the presence of long intervening spacer sequences between the repeats suggests that these spacer sequences may participate in 2-D structure formation, and points to the potential inadequacy of previous models. Our detailed chemical and enzymatic probing of the A region structure in solution involving the design of specific primers for reverse transcriptase extension analysis enabled us to identify for the first time the double-stranded and single-stranded segments making up the A region structure in solution. The data obtained clearly demonstrate that the repeats do not fold on themselves but rather fold one with the other.</p><p>Chemical and enzymatic probing of an RNA structure in solution often allows the building of a unique 2-D structure model in agreement with the experimental data. Studies on the A region were, however, complicated by the high degree of sequence redundancy.

To our knowledge, up to now, this approach has only been used to confirm the 2-D structure model of telomerase RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000276-Gavory1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This method, which involves the utilization of oligonucleotides carrying donor and acceptor fluorescent dyes complementary to single-stranded segments in the studied RNA, proved particularly well suited to the study of the A region, since our probing data identified several long single-stranded segments which were able to bind the oligonucleotide probes. Among the possible 2-D structures for the A region, only one, structure 3, showed perfect agreement with the FRET data. Structure 3, which contains two long irregular stem-loop structures, each involving four repeats (four-repeat structure), also shows the best agreement with the chemical and enzymatic data. The two long stem-loop structures are separated by a short stem-loop structure, corresponding to a divergent region between mouse and human Xist RNAs. One repeat in this segment is common to all the sequenced Xist RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000276.s005">Figure S5</xref>), except mouse RNA. In the latter, it is replaced by a poly A sequence forming a short stem loop with a poly U sequence. Interestingly, nucleotide sequence conservation in the A region extends to the spacer extremities, which contribute to the possibility of forming the four-repeat structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000276.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>Although the presence of large internal and terminal loops decreases the stability of stem-loop structures, the predicted free energies of the two four-repeat structures in both mouse and human RNAs have strongly negative values (between &#x02212;33 and &#x02212;45 kcal/mol), explaining why they are proposed by the M-fold software. In addition, these four-repeat structures may be stabilized <italic>in cellulo</italic> by RNA-protein interactions. Interestingly, protein PTB, which contains 4 RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are each able to interact with UCUU(C), UUCUCU, or CUCUCU sequences, showed high affinity for the A region in nuclear extract binding experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000276-g009">Figure 9</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000276-Perez1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. As UCUU motifs are present on each side of the large internal loops in the four-repeat structures and in the terminal loop, one might imagine that interactions of the RRMs of a single PTB molecule with these various segments may stabilize the four-repeat structure as suggested by previously proposed models for protein PTB-RNA interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000276-Auweter1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In spite that model 3 has the best fit with all the data compared to other models, this does not exclude the possibility of some local dynamic in small areas of the SLS1 and SLS3 structures.

Together with immunoselection assays performed on assembled RNP complexes, it revealed the capability of four components of the PRC2 complex to associate with an RNA corresponding to one of the four-repeat structures formed by the A region. However, our observation that the entire A region is needed for efficient association of the Suz12 protein suggests a putative additional functional role for the entire A region in either binding Suz12 or in stabilising the binding of Suz12 to the four-repeat structure. This is too early to give a convincing molecular explanation of this observation. Further experiments are needed to understand why Suz12 displays different association properties compared to other members of the PRC2 complex.</p><p>Whilst UV cross-linking of the RNP complexes formed with ES nuclear extract using the entire A region has confirmed the direct binding of PTB to this RNA region, direct binding of components of the PRC2 complex was not detected (unpublished data). Neither Ezh2 nor Eed, which were previously proposed to be recruited by Xist in an A region dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000276-Zhao1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, were cross-linked in significant amounts, suggesting that their association with the A region is mediated via association with other nuclear proteins. Therefore, the peculiar SLS1 and SLS3 structures in the A region may be needed to recruit nuclear proteins which have an affinity for components of the PRC2 complex or to reinforce the RNA affinity for these components. Mass spectrometry analysis of RNP complexes formed with the entire A region showed that, in addition to components of the PRC2 complex, a large number of other nuclear proteins can associate with this RNA region. In further studies, it will be important to identify which of these proteins are required for PRC2 association and which ones bind directly to the A region structure.</p><p>Our finding that Suz12 requires the entire A region, or more simply more than four repeats for efficient association with the RNA, is in good agreement with the observation of Wutz and colleagues (2002) that the presence of at least 5.5 repeats is needed to initiate inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000276-Wutz1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.
