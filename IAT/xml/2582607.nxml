We report that miR-155 expression is much higher in EBV-immortalized B cells than in EBV-negative B cells. LMP1, but not LMP2, up-regulated the expression of miR-155, when transfected in EBV-negative B cells. We analyzed two putative NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites in the miR-155 promoter; both sites recruited NF-&#x003ba;B complex, in nuclear extract from EBV-immortalized cells. The exogenous expression of LMP1, in EBV-negative background, is temporally correlated to induction of p65 with binding on both NF-&#x003ba;B sites and with miR-155 overexpression. The induction of p65 binding together with increased RNA polymerase II binding, confirms that LMP1-mediated activation of miR-155 occurs transcriptionally. In reporter assays, miR-155 promoter lacking NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites was no longer activated by LMP1 expression and an intact AP1 site is needed to attain maximum activation. Finally, we demonstrate that LMP1-mediated activation of miR-155 in an EBV-negative background correlates with reduction of protein PU.1, which is a possible miR target.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus (EBV), which infects over 90% of the adults, appears to have evolved to exploit the normal biology of B-cell development in order to persist as a life-long asymptomatic infection. However, EBV can contribute to oncogenesis. Indeed, it is frequently found in Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and lymphoproliferative diseases in immune-suppressed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). EBV-related oncogenesis is principally associated with latency during which only a limited subset of the full repertoire of viral genes are transcribed. In addition to protein-coding genes, the non-coding RNAs EBER1, EBER2 and a set of EBV-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed in all three forms of latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Of the genes expressed during viral latency in EBV-associated diseases, LMP1 is the one most implicated in tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). LMP1 is invariably expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma, it is required for EBV-mediated transformation of lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and it transforms rodent fibroblasts. Moreover, transgenic mice expressing LMP1 under the control of an immunoglobulin promoter develop B lymphocyte tumors more frequently than wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>LMP1 is a six-transmembrane constitutively active signaling molecule that functionally mimics members of the cellular tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. While the transmembrane domains are required for aggregation and constitutive activation of LMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>), two cytoplasmic domains, i.e. the C-terminal activator regions 1 and 2 (CTAR-1 and -2), are critical for the transforming properties of LMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12">9&#x02013;12</xref>). Together, these signaling domains act through cellular TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs) and other cell-signaling molecules to activate, three transcription factors, namely, nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), activator transcription factor-2 (ATF)-2 and AP-1, via c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">8&#x02013;12</xref>). By manipulating these cell-signaling pathways, LMP1 affects host cellular processes that regulate cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis, thereby contributing to cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis.</p><p>The miR-155 is processed from a primary transcript, known as &#x02018;BIC&#x02019; (B-cell integration cluster), whose upstream region was originally found to be a frequent site of integration of the avian leucosis virus in lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Transgenic mouse studies demonstrated that B-cell targeted expression of BIC leads to the development of B-cell malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Furthermore, a number of miRNA profiling studies have shown elevated levels of miR-155 in a wide array of cancers including lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19">14&#x02013;19</xref>). miR-155 is one of the miRNAs most frequently implicated in cancers. It plays a critical role in lymphocyte activation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and is induced by a variety of immune cell stimuli, i.e. toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, TNF-&#x003b1;, interferon-beta (IFN-&#x003b2;) and antigens [B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The mechanism by which miR-155 is regulated after TLR and IFN signaling in macrophages is still unknown. Here we show that LMP1 upregulates the expression of miR-155 mainly by activating the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, which suggests that miR-155 can cooperate in the EBV-mediated transformation of B cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>EBV-negative human B cells (DeFew) and EBV-immortalized human B cells MC3 (kindly provided by Prof. Giuseppe Scala, University &#x02018;Magna Grecia&#x02019; Catanzaro) Devozione, Cap (kindly provided by Dr Giuseppina Ruggiero, University &#x02018;Federico II&#x02019;, Naples), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2 mM glutamine.

We show that p65 but not p50 is engaged on the two NF-&#x003ba;B sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). However, we cannot rule out that p50 contributes to the active complex because it could simply be covered by DNA and p65, and thus inaccessible to the antibody.

However, LMP1 can activate two different pathways: the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and the Jun/Fos (AP-1) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>) and the miR-155 promoter has a <italic>cis</italic>-element responsive to AP-1 40 nt upstream from the start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Using truncated forms of BIC promoter cloned upstream the luciferase gene reporter, we observed that only the first 1380 nt drive the maximum activation of the promoter by PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) or LMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This could indicate that the NF-&#x003ba;B site 2 is irrelevant in the LMP1-mediated activation of miR-155. To verify the effectiveness of the two NF-&#x003ba;B <italic>cis</italic>-elements in LMP1-enhanced miR-155 promoter, we used both the promoters cloned upstream luciferase gene reporter [pLuc1783 wild-type (wt) and pLuc1380 wt]. Subsequently, we mutated NF-&#x003ba;B site 1 (pLuc1783&#x00394;NF-&#x003ba;B1 and pLuc1380&#x00394;NF-&#x003ba;B), the AP-1 site (pLuc1783&#x00394;AP-1 and pLuc1380&#x00394;AP-1) and the NF-&#x003ba;B site 2 (pLuc1783&#x00394;NF-&#x003ba;B2) using site-directed mutagenesis. All vectors were used for transfection and reporter assay in EBV-negative MEF. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, pLuc1380 wt was upregulated by about 5-fold when cotransfected with a vector expressing LMP1. In the presence of LMP1, pLuc1380&#x00394;NF-&#x003ba;B expression was about 80-fold less, and the expression of pLuc1380&#x00394;AP-1 about 6-fold less than pLuc1380 wt expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). These data would suggest that NF-&#x003ba;B site 1 plays a pivotal role in LMP1 activation and that substantial cooperation by the AP-1 site is required to attain maximum activation. Consistent with these results, NF-&#x003ba;B seems to be central also for basal levels of miR-155 expression. Indeed, without LMP1, pLuc1380&#x00394;NF-&#x003ba;B expression was about 17-fold lower than pLuc1380 wt expression, whereas pLuc1380&#x00394;AP1 was downregulated by about 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). When the reporter assays were repeated using the full-length vector pLuc1783 wt, induction was reduced (about 3-fold), in the presence of LMP1 compared to pLuc1380 wt (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B), which is in line with the results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. Surprisingly, all mutated forms of this vector (pLuc1783&#x00394;NF-&#x003ba;B2, pLuc1783&#x00394;NF-&#x003ba;B1 and pLuc1783&#x00394;AP-1) were no longer activated by LMP1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B is presented in logarithmic scale in order to show that the mutations in both NF-&#x003ba;B sites dramatically reduced the basal level of miR-155 promoter-driven luciferase expression, whereas the AP-1 mutation reduced basal levels to a much lesser extent. The latter observation is consistent with our data obtained with the truncated promoter.

Accordingly, inhibition of the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway by exogenous expression of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; led to reduced expression of miR-155 in MC3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn666/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). This could indicate that the non-canonical pathway is activated only at the beginning of EBV infection when the virus needs to maximize this signaling pathway.</p><p>Furthermore, both the NF-&#x003ba;B sites bound to p65 <italic>in vivo</italic> as did the RNA pol II on the TATA box of the BIC promoter, in MC3, which indicates ongoing miR-155 transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C) suggesting that the two NF-&#x003ba;B sites are active in an EBV-positive background. However, PMA- and LMP1-driven induction was higher with a truncated form of the BIC promoter lacking the distal site (NF-&#x003ba;B site 2) than with the full-length promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). To shield light on the effectiveness of the two NF-&#x003ba;B <italic>cis</italic>-elements, we performed reporter assays using the full length (pLuc1783) or a truncated form (pLuc1380) of miR-155 promoters either wild-type or mutated in the NF-&#x003ba;B site 1, NF-&#x003ba;B site 2 or AP-1. Our results indicate that both NF-&#x003ba;B sites are pivotal for basal and LMP1-induced expression of miR-155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Conversely, mutation of the AP-1 site in the pLuc1380 reduced the constitutive expression of the promoter, which in fact was still inducible by LMP1 albeit to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). However, mutation of the AP-1 site in the pLuc 1783 abolished the LMP1-induced expression. Yin <italic>et al.</italic> [unpublished data in (34)] suggested that miR-155 promoter contains one or more CpG islands. The presence of putative CpG as well as <italic>cis</italic>-elements bound by negative regulatory protein(s) or promoter secondary structures could explain why the truncated form of the promoter, lacking this putative NRE, is inducible at higher extent by both PMA and LMP1.</p><p>Subsequently, we performed time-course experiments in EBV-negative cells infected with an exogenous LMP1. Our data show that the expression of LMP1 is temporally correlated with the activation of p65 binding on both NF-&#x003ba;B sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), recruitment of RNA pol II and miR-155 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). All data reported give a clear indication that LMP1 enhances miR-155 expression, mainly, via activation of the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway.</p><p>Our results, together with the previous data reported by Yin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), illustrate the exquisite regulation of this miR by various stimuli, and highlight its importance in B-cell physiology.</p><p>PU.1 is a downstream effector of miR-155 thanks to the presence of a miR-155 complementary seed sequence in the 3&#x02032; UTR of PU.1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In the latter report, B cells lacking miR-155 generated reduced extrafollicular and germinal center responses and did not produce high-affinity IgG1 antibodies. PU.1 is highly expressed in miR-155-deficient B cells and its overexpression in wild-type B cells results in reduced numbers of IgG1-switched cells, which indicates that miR-155 plays a key role in antigen-driven B-cell maturation. PU.1 is a master gene of the Ets transcriptional factor family that promotes cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis thereby playing an important role in hematopoiesis [see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) for a review]. It is both an oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and a tumor suppressor gene that promotes apoptosis. Here we show that LMP1-mediated activation of miR-155 is correlated with diminished levels of the PU.1 protein. Many mRNAs were predicted to be direct targets of miR-155. A recent work reported that miR-155 plays an important role in EBV-regulated gene expression of the infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). It is thus possible that the phenotypic alterations and the oncogenic potentialities observed in miR-155-overexpressing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) are the result of deregulation of other targets in addition to PU.1. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis indicated that miR-155 may target SOCS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and WEE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) (G.G. and M.M., unpublished data), which would better account for its oncogenic role. Probably, a miRNA can have two or more targets or even different targets depending on the cellular context. Studies to elucidate the molecular targets of miR-155 after LMP1 induction, and to determine their reciprocal role during EBV infection and EBV-mediated transformation are underway in our laboratory.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn666/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR) PRIN 05; Funding for open access charge: Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnologies, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
