The dopamine D<sub>2 </sub>receptor agonist bromocriptine has been widely used clinically to treat human breast tumor and prolactinoma through inhibition of hyperprolactinemia and induction of tumor cell apoptosis, respectively, but the molecular mechanism of bromocriptine induction of pituitary tumor apoptosis remains unclear. Caveolin-1 is a membrane-anchored protein enriched on caveolae, inverted flask-shaped invaginations on plasma membranes where signal transduction molecules are concentrated. Currently, caveolin-1 is thought to be a negative regulator of cellular proliferation and an enhancer of apoptosis by blocking signal transduction between cell surface membrane receptors and intracellular signaling protein cascades. Rat pituitary adenoma GH3 cells, which express endogenous caveolin-1, exhibit increased apoptosis and shrinkage after exposure to bromocriptine. Hence, the GH3 cell line is an ideal model for studying the molecular action of bromocriptine on prolactinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The expression of endogenous caveolin-1 in GH3 cells was elevated after bromocriptine treatment. Transiently expressed mouse recombinant caveolin-1 induced apoptosis in GH3 cells by enhancing the activity of caspase 8. Significantly, caveolin-1 induction of GH3 cell apoptosis was sensitized by the administration of bromocriptine. Phosphorylation of caveolin-1 at tyrosine 14 was enhanced after bromocriptine treatment, suggesting that bromocriptine-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 may contribute to sensitization of apoptosis in GH3 cells exposed to bromocriptine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results reveal that caveolin-1 increases sensitivity for apoptosis induction in pituitary adenoma GH3 cells and may contribute to tumor shrinkage after clinical bromocriptine treatment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Prolactinomas, prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, are the most frequently found functional pituitary tumors in humans. The pathology of prolactinomas involves dysfunction of lactotrophic cells in the anterior pituitary gland which in turn leads to hyperprolactinemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. First line therapy for prolactinomas includes management with dopamine agonists. Bromocriptine is commonly chosen as a therapeutic agent for patients with prolactinomas or other pituitary adenomas; bromocriptine binds to the dopamine D<sub>2 </sub>receptor on pituitary epithelial cells to inhibit prolactin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Treatment with bromocriptine causes tumor shrinkage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A rat pituitary prolactinoma cell line, GH3 is commonly used as a cellular model for studying prolactinoma formation. Long-term incubation of GH3 with bromocriptine induces cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Caveolin-1 is a 21&#x02013;24 kDa major integral membrane protein on caveolae, an invaginated structure on cellular membranes enriched with high numbers of cholesterol, glycosphingolipid and signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Caveolin-1 has been suggested to negatively regulate many different signaling molecules located on caveolae via mutual interactions that compartmentalize the signaling molecules and suppress cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Caveolin-1 is functionally involved in endocytosis, transcytosis, cholesterol transport, homeostasis, negative regulation of Ras-, NO-, and G-protein-coupled-receptors, and growth-factor-mediated protein kinase signaling cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>There is growing evidence that loss of caveolin-1 expression is associated with tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Down-regulation or absence of caveolin-1 expression has been found in many human cancers, including primary breast, prostate, and colon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, caveolin-1 null mice are more susceptible to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting that caveolin-1 may be a tumor suppressor.</p><p>There is accumulating experimental evidence <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>that caveolin-1 expression sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimulation. Elevated expression of endogenous caveolin-1 is associated with induction of apoptosis in mouse peritoneal macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Ectopic expression of caveolin-1 in NIH3T3 cells and T24 human bladder carcinoma cells sensitizes cells to staurosporine-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These data demonstrate that an up-regulation of caveolin-1 may be involved in promoting cell apoptosis.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the effects of caveolin-1 on pituitary adenoma shrinkage in response to bromocriptine treatment at clinically-relevant concentrations in GH3 cells. Here we show that caveolin-1 in GH3 cells was up-regulated after bromocriptine treatment. Our data show that increased caveolin-1 expression sensitizes pituitary adenoma GH3 cells to apoptosis induced by bromocriptine treatment and clarifies the molecular mechanism of bromocriptine therapy of pituitary adenoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Ectopic expression of recombinant caveolin-1 in GH3 cells results in apoptotic phenotypes</title><p>Caveolin-1 is associated with apoptosis and has been detected in GH3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As bromocriptine stimulates GH3 cell shrinkage and apoptosis, we hypothesized that bromocriptine treatment would induce GH3 cell apoptosis via caveolin-1. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the amount of caveolin-1 mRNA in rat GH3 cells before and after bromocriptine administration at different dosages according previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Caveolin-1 mRNA was elevated after 24 hours of bromocriptine treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,a</xref>). To explore the function of caveolin-1 in GH3 cells, a pcDNA4-Caveolin-1 plasmid containing Myc-tagged mouse caveolin-1 under the control of the CMV promoter was constructed and successfully transfected into GH3 cells. A predicted 30 kDa recombinant protein was recognized by an anti-caveolin-1 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,b</xref>) and by an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,c</xref>). Twenty-four kDa endogenous caveolin-1 expressed in the A431 cell line, and recognized by an anti-caveolin-1 antibody, was used as the positive control in Western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,b</xref>). We next clarified whether the recombinant caveolin-1 was localized in cells in the same manner as endogenous caveolin-1. The distribution of endogenous caveolin-1 in A431 cells was determined by immunofluorescent staining with an anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody. Exogenous Myc-tagged caveolin-1 distribution in A431 cells was detected by double immunofluorescent staining with anti-caveolin-1 and anti-Myc polyclonal antibodies. Both endogenous and exogenous caveolin-1 had the same punctate distribution in the perinuclear region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,b</xref>). We then transiently expressed the Myc-tagged caveolin-1 in GH3 cells to examine the effect of caveolin-1 on GH3 cells. By 48 hours after caveolin-1 expression in GH3 cells, apoptosis-like nuclear condensation was visible upon staining with Hoechst 33342 (bisbenzimide, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). In the control experiment, transient expression of enhanced-green fluorescent protein (EGFP) did not alter nuclear morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). These data indicate that transient expression of Caveolin-1 induces apoptosis in GH3 cells. To test this, the TUNEL assay, which discriminates apoptosis from necrosis and from primary DNA strand breaks, was used to measure DNA fragmentation 48 hours after transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recombinant caveolin-1-expressing cells appeared shrunken with positive TUNEL labeling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,d</xref>). In the control experiments, all cells were positively TUNEL labeled after exposure to DNase I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,f</xref>), whereas no cell was TUNEL labeled after vehicle treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,h</xref>). We quantified the proportion of apoptotic cells in ectopic caveolin-1 or EGFP-expressing cells by counting the number of cells exhibiting nuclear condensations per 100 exogenous caveolin-1- or EGFP-expressing cells, stained with Hoechst 33342. Significant numbers of caveolin-1 expressing cells exhibited apoptosis after transfection (13% at 24 and 53% at 48 hours), whereas only 2% and 3% of EGFP-expressing cells and 1.6&#x02013;2% vehicle-treated cells exhibited apoptosis 24 and 48 hours after transfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This result revealed that even transient caveolin-1 expression increased GH3 cell apoptosis.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Bromocriptine enhances endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA expression in GH3 cells.</bold> (A) Panel a: Expression of caveolin-1 mRNA was enhanced after bromocriptine treatment.

To examine the role of caspases in apoptotic GH3 cells after transient caveolin-1 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), we separately treated the ectopic caveolin-1 and DsRed-N1 expressing GH3 cells with a general caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk), as well as specific caspase inhibitors, for caspase 3 (Z-DEVE-fmk), caspase 8 (Z-IETD-fmk) or caspase 9 (Z-LEHO-fmk) before determining the number of apoptotic cells by TUNEL assay. Over-expression of caveolin-1 resulted in 62% of the transiently-transfected cells becoming apoptotic. This effect was inhibited by treating GH3 cells with the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (24% apoptotic caveolin-1 expressing cells) and with the caspase 8 specific inhibitor, Z-IETD-fmk, (20% apoptosis).

Caveolin-1 has previously been reported to be associated with enhancement of apoptotic sensitivity. For example, NIH3T3 cells treated with anti-sense caveolin-1 were resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis, and T24 bladder carcinoma cells were sensitized to caspase 3 activation when stably expressing recombinant caveolin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Large increases in caveolin-1 expression have also been observed in apoptotic-agent-treated mouse peritoneal macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, retrovirus insertion-mediated random mutagenesis applied to L292 cells revealed caveolin-1 is necessary for apoptosis induced by TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These reports highlight a growing body of evidence indicating that up-regulated expression of caveolin-1 is associated with cell apoptosis. This study has now shown, for the first time, that caveolin-1 itself induces apoptosis of rat anterior pituitary epithelial cells of the GH3 cell line.</p><p>We have shown that caveolin-1 mRNA expression was further enhanced in GH3 cells after 24 hours of bromocriptine stimulation. It is known that with bromocriptine stimulation of GH3 cells leads to accumulation of wild type p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. There are two consensus half sites (-292 to -283 bp and -273 and -264 bp) in the caveolin-1 promoter that are predicted to be wild type p53 binding sites. Previous experiments have also shown that transfection of wild type p53 into human skin fibroblasts is accompanied by a six-fold increase in caveolin-1 promoter transcription activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore, and supported by evidence from this study, we speculate that bromocriptine enhances caveolin-1 expression via an increase in wild-type p53 expression in GH3 cells.</p><p>Caspases play critical roles in the initiation and execution of the apoptotic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We found that, at least in part, caspase 8 might be required for caveolin-1 induction of GH3 cell apoptosis. In contrast, up-regulation of caveolin-1 sensitizes NIH3T3 fibroblasts and T24 bladder carcinoma epithelial cells to apoptotic stimuli via increased activation of caspase 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Caveolin-1 up-regulation is also associated with simvastatin-induced apoptosis of thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages; this effect was independent of caspase activity, because the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-Fmk failed to block cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Together these results indicate caveolin-1 mediates cellular apoptosis through variant signaling pathways in different cell types.</p><p>Treatment of lymphocytes and NIH3T3 cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>or UV light induces phosphorylation of caveolin-1 Tyr<sup>14 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, caveolin-1 phosphorylated at Tyr<sup>14 </sup>specifically co-localizes with paxillin at focal adhesion complexes after epidermal growth factor, insulin or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment, suggesting phosphorylation of caveolin-1 is associated with cellular morphological changes and shrinkage when cells adapt to external cellular stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, etoposide, a therapeutic agent for leukemia, in inducing tumor cell apoptosis, increases phosphorylation of caveolin-1 Tyr<sup>14 </sup>in HL-60 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We demonstrated that phosphorylation of caveolin-1 Tyr<sup>14 </sup>was increased after bromocriptine treatment and this accelerated GH3 cells apoptosis, indicating phosphorylation of caveolin-1 Tyr<sup>14 </sup>may be important for bromocriptine mediation of cellular apoptosis or morphological changes in cells encountering apoptotic stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the present results demonstrate that caveolin-1 expression is induced after bromocriptine treatment in rat pituitary adenoma cells. Moreover, exogenous overexpression of caveolin-1 increases apoptosis of pituitary adenoma cells and enhances bromocriptine-induced cell apoptosis. Interestingly, caveolin-1 was phosphorylated at Tyr<sup>14 </sup>when GH3 cells responded to bromocriptine treatment. Phosphorylation of caveolin-1 Tyr<sup>14 </sup>is predicted to be associated with cellular apoptosis. These data suggest that bromocriptine-induced pituitary adenoma cell apoptosis may result from enhanced expression and activation of caveolin-1 via increased caveolin-1 phosphorylation. Our result explains the therapeutic effect of bromocriptine in curing pituitary adenoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, penicillin, streptomycin, L-glutamine, fetal bovine serum and horse serum were purchased from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD).

Caveolin-1 cDNA was amplified from total RNA by RT-PCR and was subcloned into pGEM T-easy vector by TA cloning (Promega, Madison, WI). The paired primer sequences used for RT-PCR were as follows: forward primer, 5'-CTCGAGATGTCTGGGGGCAAATACGTG-3'; reverse primer, 5'-TCTAGATATCTCTTTCTGCGTGCTGATGCG-3'. The DNA sequence of caveolin-1 was confirmed by auto-sequencing using an ABI 3730 autosequenser. Caveolin-1 in the pGEM T-easy vector was digested with <italic>Xho </italic>I and <italic>Xba </italic>I restriction enzymes and then subcloned into pcDNA4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) mammalian expression vector; this plasmid was termed pcDNA4-caveolin-1. pcDNA4-EGFP was cloned as follows: the clone pEGFP-N1 plasmid containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), was digested with <italic>Pst </italic>I and <italic>Not </italic>I restriction enzymes, then subcloned into pcDNA4 vector; this plasmid was designated pcDNA4-EGFP. pDsRed-N1 containing red fluorescent protein was purchased from Clontech Laboratories. For quantifying the level of caveolin-1 cDNA expressed in GH3 cells modulated after bromocriptine treatment, the cells were treated with either bromocriptine (Sigma) at different concentrations of 5, 10, 20 &#x003bc;M or with vehicle for 24 hours, when total RNA was extracted and the transcripts quantified by RT-PCR, as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The rat GH3 pituitary adenoma and human A431 epithelial cell lines were obtained from the American Type Cell Collection.

Cells were transfected with pcDNA4-caveolin-1 or pDsRed-N1 by Lipofectamine Plus&#x02122; reagent. Transfected cells were treated with caspase inhibitors at 50 mM final concentration for 48 hours, then immunocytochemical and TUNEL assays were used to quantify apoptotic cells. Anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody was used as the first antibody to recognize caveolin-1 expressing cells, followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Cells expressing DsRed-N1 were directly detected by fluorescent microscopy. The caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk, Z-DEVE-fmk, Z-IETD-fmk, and Z-LEHO-fmk, and the negative control Z-FA-fmk were purchased from Calbiochem Inc. One hundred Myc-tagged and DsRed-N1 expressing cells were examined in each experiment for positive TUNEL labeling. Each experiment was repeated three times.

Cell extracts were then centrifuged at 12000 rpm at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 min, and the supernatants collected. Protein samples were quantified by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (cat. no. #500-0006; Bio-Rad, Inc., Hercules, CA). Each 10 &#x003bc;g sample was denatured for 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C in Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mM DTT, 60 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromophenol blue). The proteins were then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Blots were washed with TBST buffer (120 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) then placed in TBST buffer supplemented with 5% skimmed milk powder for blocking non-specific interactions for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots were then incubated with rabbit anti-caveolin-1 antibody (1:1000 in TBST), mouse anti-Myc antibody (1:3000 in TBST) or anti-phosphorylated caveolin-1 (Tyr<sup>14</sup>) polyclonal antibody (1:1000 in TBST) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing the blots with TBST, membranes were incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000, Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) for 2 hours and washed again as described previously. Membrane-bound secondary antibodies were detected using the ECL procedure developed by Amersham Biosciences.
