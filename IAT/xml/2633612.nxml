This article presents evidence that a member of the Arabidopsis CBP60 gene family, <italic>CBP60g</italic>, contributes to MAMP-triggered SA accumulation. <italic>CBP60g</italic> is inducible by both pathogen and MAMP treatments. <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> growth is enhanced in <italic>cbp60g</italic> mutants. Expression profiles of a <italic>cbp60g</italic> mutant after MAMP treatment are similar to those of <italic>sid2</italic> and <italic>pad4</italic>, suggesting a defect in SA signaling. Accordingly, <italic>cbp60g</italic> mutants accumulate less SA when treated with the MAMP flg22 or a <italic>P. syringae hrcC</italic> strain that activates MAMP signaling. MAMP-induced production of reactive oxygen species and callose deposition are unaffected in <italic>cbp60g</italic> mutants. CBP60g is a calmodulin-binding protein with a calmodulin-binding domain located near the N-terminus. Calmodulin binding is dependent on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Mutations in CBP60g that abolish calmodulin binding prevent complementation of the SA production and bacterial growth defects of <italic>cbp60g</italic> mutants, indicating that calmodulin binding is essential for the function of CBP60g in defense signaling. These studies show that CBP60g constitutes a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> link between MAMP recognition and SA accumulation that is important for resistance to <italic>P. syringae</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Plants respond to attack by microbial pathogens through activation of a battery of defense responses. This activation is controlled by a complex signaling network. Disease resistance depends on rapid activation of plant defense responses. Improved understanding of the signaling network may lead to development of crops with improved disease resistance. Here, we used the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to study activation of defense responses after infection by a bacterial pathogen, <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>. We found that a gene not previously known to function in defense signaling, <italic>CBP60g</italic>, is needed for resistance. By studying plants with mutations in this gene, we found that <italic>CBP60g</italic> contributes to the increases in levels of the important signaling molecule, salicylic acid, that occur after pathogen recognition. We also found that the CBP60g protein binds calmodulin, a protein that mediates calcium regulation of protein function. Calmodulin binding was necessary for the function of CBP60g in disease resistance. We conclude that CBP60g is a protein that mediates calmodulin-dependent activation of salicylic acid signaling in response to pathogen recognition.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant innate immunity is multi-layered and tightly regulated by a complex signaling network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000301-Osbourn1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Defense against biotrophic or hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogens can be thought of as consisting of two branches: the broad and nonspecific defenses triggered by the perception of microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs or PAMPs), and the robust and relatively more specific resistance mediated by resistance (R) genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000301-He1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000301-Jones1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

To investigate whether CaM binding affects the function of CBP60g in defense responses, we engineered transgenic plants carrying mutated CBP60g proteins that no longer bind CaM in the <italic>cbp60g-1</italic> mutant background.

A wild-type version of the CBP60g c-Myc fusion construct (WT) was also made as a control. Primary transformants containing single copies of the transgenes were selected by qPCR, and their progeny were used for analyses. First, we tested expression of the modified proteins by immunoblotting using c-Myc antibody. None of the c-Myc fusion proteins were detected in untreated plants, but they were all present in plants inoculated with <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326. This was also true for the wild-type CBP60g c-Myc fusion construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000301.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). Thus, the <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326-induced increase in the CBP60g transcript level is reflected in the protein level.

Expression profiling studies suggested a defect in activation of SA signaling during the MAMP response. SA assays proved that CBP60g contributes to MAMP-induced SA accumulation. We found that CaM binding is important for the role of CBP60g in defense signaling. In contrast to other members of the CBP60 family, the CaM-binding domain of CBP60g lies close to the N-terminus of the protein. CaM binding is needed for activation of the protein, as mutants that fail to bind CaM also fail to complement the SA and bacterial growth defects of loss-of-function mutants. Our work demonstrates that CBP60g constitutes a CaM-dependent link from MAMP signaling to activation of SA synthesis.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>The Role of CBP60g in MAMP Signaling</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000301-g007">Figure 7</xref> shows a model of the position of CBP60g in the defense signaling network. Recognition of MAMPs such as bacterial flagellin by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) activates a MAP kinase cascade that in turn activates gene expression changes and ethylene production. MAMP recognition also triggers elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration and activates production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by AtrbohD. AtrbohD is required for deposition of callose.

One of these aspects is activation of CBP60g through CaM binding, as we have shown that CaM binding is required for the functions of CBP60g in MAMP-induced SA accumulation and limiting growth of <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326. CBP60g contributes to MAMP-induced SA accumulation, as SA levels are reduced in <italic>cbp60g</italic> mutants. Following <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326 inoculation, an SA-accumulation defect was observed at nine but not 24 hours. SA accumulation at nine hours likely reflects MAMP signaling, so this data is consistent with the idea that CBP60g is involved in transducing a signal from the MAMP response to SA accumulation. It is likely that there are multiple routes to activation of SA accumulation, with different routes more or less important for different stimuli and/or at different times. This may explain our finding that CBP60g is important for SA accumulation during the MAMP response, but has little effect during the response to <italic>Psm</italic> ES4326.</p><p>While our results show that CBP60g constitutes part of the link between MAMP recognition and activation of SA signaling, we cannot yet determine at what point in the MAMP signaling cascade a signal is transferred to CBP60g. Similarly, the relationship between MAMP recognition and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx is unclear. These uncertainties are indicated by the absence of arrows between PRRs and the MAPK cascade on the one hand, and Ca2&#x0002b; influx and CBP60g function on the other. Based on examination of the microarray data, we speculate that CBP60g and the MAPK cascade may act independently. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000301.s010">Figure S10</xref>, at 3 and 9 hours after inoculation with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 <italic>hrcC</italic>, there is no overlap between genes whose expression is affected by <italic>mpk3</italic> and those whose expression is affected by <italic>cbp60g</italic>.
