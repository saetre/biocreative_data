Recently, studies have focused on the identification of molecules involved in the function and/or development of T<sub>R</sub> cells. One such molecule, the G-protein coupled receptor Gpr83, has been identified through gene expression analysis as being overexpressed within thymic and peripheral naturally arising regulatory T (nT<sub>R</sub>) cell populations. The aim of this study was to further define the characteristics of Gpr83 expression and to investigate the role of Gpr83 in T<sub>R</sub>-cell development and function through the generation and analysis of Gpr83-deficient mice. Following activation, na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induce Gpr83 expression in a transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; dependent manner. Rather than being a general marker of activation, Gpr83 expression could only be detected in cells also expressing forkhead/winged helix transcription factor (Foxp3), further supporting the association of Gpr83 with the regulatory cell phenotype. Mice deficient in Gpr83 expression developed normally and did not display signs of inflammatory disease. Thymic nT<sub>R</sub>-cell development was unaffected by a lack of Gpr83 expression and peripheral nT<sub>R</sub>-cell homeostasis was normal when compared with that of wild-type mice. Gpr83 expression was dispensable for the regulatory activity of nT<sub>R</sub> cells as Gpr83-deficient nT<sub>R</sub> cells could suppress the development of disease in a T-cell transfer model of colitis. These results suggest a redundant role for Gpr83 in the function of T<sub>R</sub> cells in this model of disease. Further studies are required to determine the role of Gpr83 in T<sub>R</sub>-cell biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>inflammatory bowel disease</kwd><kwd>mucosal immunity</kwd><kwd>regulatory T cells</kwd><kwd>transgenics/knockouts</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulatory T (T<sub>R</sub>) cells are essential for the maintenance of immunological homeostasis and the effective regulation of immune responses within the body. Given the therapeutic potential of these cells, extensive studies over the last decade have been carried out with the aim of understanding the developmental and functional aspects of T<sub>R</sub>-cell biology. The most widely studied of these populations are the naturally arising regulatory T (nT<sub>R</sub>) cells which develop within the thymus and are characterized by their expression of the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor (Foxp3) and CD25.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> More recently, accumulating evidence suggests the potential for the extrathymic development of regulatory T-cell populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> The mechanisms by which T<sub>R</sub> cells mediate their suppressive activity have still to be clearly defined and it is likely that multiple pathways are utilized depending on tissue specificity and the type of immune response being regulated.</p><p>In the intestine, the balance between immunity and tolerance is crucial for maintaining the ability to distinguish and respond appropriately to the vast array of dietary antigens, commensal bacteria and harmful pathogens encountered within the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. The importance of T<sub>R</sub> cells in maintaining this balance is highlighted by studies of human patients with immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> In these patients, mutations in the transcription factor Foxp3 result in a lack of functional nT<sub>R</sub> cells and a primary target of the resulting multi-organ inflammation is the gut. Animal models of colitis have been used to investigate the mechanisms involved in mediating the prevention of intestinal inflammation. Molecules such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;, interleukin (IL)-10 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 have all been implicated as playing a role in the suppression of colitogenic T-cell activity mediated by nT<sub>R</sub> cells,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> although the exact cell types producing and responding to these immune modulators are still unclear. More recently, specialized subsets of mucosal dendritic cells have been shown to induce the conversion of antigen-specific T cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory cells in a retinoic acid and TGF-&#x003b2; dependent manner,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> providing evidence to suggest that induced as well as natural T<sub>R</sub> cells act in concert to regulate intestinal immunity.</p><p>Gene expression profiling of CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>R</sub> cells has provided valuable insights into the development and function of these cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> One molecule to emerge from these studies is the G-protein coupled receptor Gpr83, which displays highly restricted expression within the nT<sub>R</sub>-cell subset. Of particular interest is the potential use of Gpr83 as a marker of nT<sub>R</sub> cells as a consequence of its proposed cell surface expression. Gpr83 was originally identified as a glucocorticoid-responsive gene in a murine thymoma cell line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and subsequently shown to display high expression levels within the brain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></p><p>Whilst the association of Gpr83 with both thymic and peripheral T<sub>R</sub>-cell subsets has been established, the functional role of Gpr83 remains unclear. Gene expression studies reveal a clear link between Gpr83 expression and Foxp3.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> Furthermore, retroviral introduction of Foxp3 into na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is sufficient to induce high levels of Gpr83 expression as measured at the mRNA level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> More recently, Hansen <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated an enhanced ability to induce Foxp3 in cells retrovirally transduced with Gpr83.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> The physiological significance of this, however, remains to be determined.

Quantitative PCR analysis confirms this restricted expression in both thymic and peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> populations using T-cell subsets isolated from Foxp3<sup>GFP</sup> transgenic mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1a</xref>). These mice express a GFP-Foxp3 fusion protein which can be used to track expression of Foxp3 and thus the isolation of Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and Foxp3<sup>+</sup> (GFP<sup>+</sup>) populations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To determine whether Gpr83 is more widely expressed amongst other immune cell populations, leucocytes were isolated from the spleens of wild-type and BALB/c RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and sorted by FACS into various subsets based on the following markers: CD4, CD8, B220 and DX5. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that Gpr83 expression was only detectable amongst CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and, as has been shown previously, this was attributable to the enhanced expression of Gpr83 within the CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1b</xref>). A number of markers identified as being enriched within nT<sub>R</sub> cells have subsequently been shown to be more closely associated with an activatory rather than regulatory phenotype. To investigate whether Gpr83 expression could be detected following the activation of na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells we used the Foxp3<sup>GFP</sup> transgenic mice. This allowed us to isolate a predominantly na&#x000ef;ve population that was negative for expression of Foxp3. Splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> na&#x000ef;ve T cells were isolated by FACS (purity &#x0003e; 99%) and activated <italic>in vitro</italic> with &#x003b1;CD3/&#x003b1;CD28 coated beads. Expression of Gpr83 could be detected 24 hr after the activation of these cells, as assessed by quantitative PCR, and had returned to baseline by 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1c</xref>). At its peak the level of expression detected within the na&#x000ef;ve T cells was as high as that seen in <italic>ex vivo</italic> CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> nT<sub>R</sub> cells. Gpr83 appears to be a more acute activation marker as only low levels of GPR83 mRNA were found in the Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> antigen experienced pool (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>lo</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) analysed directly <italic>ex vivo</italic>. In view of the close association observed in T<sub>R</sub> cells between Foxp3 expression and Gpr83, we also analysed expression of Foxp3 in these cells. Foxp3 mRNA also showed activation-induced induction and was detectable within 24 hr following activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1c</xref>). The level of expression in the activated cells was substantially lower than that seen in CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> nT<sub>R</sub> cells but appeared to be maintained throughout the period of culture. Expression was higher than that observed in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells, suggesting that this transient induction of Foxp3 was not a general facet of antigen-activated T-cell populations. Taken together, these data show that both Foxp3 and Gpr83 can be induced following the activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> na&#x000ef;ve T cells.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Expression of the G-protein coupled receptor Gpr83 is restricted to the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment and is induced following T-cell activation.

Analysis of Gpr83 expression in these cells clearly showed that, like Foxp3, induction of Gpr83 expression was dependent on TGF-&#x003b2; signalling as no expression could be detected in dnTGF-&#x003b2;RII activated T cells. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from wild-type mice were able to induce expression of both Foxp3 and Gpr83 and no differences were observed in cell accumulation and viability between wild-type and dnTGF-&#x003b2;RII cultures (data not shown), indicating that the inability to detect expression of Gpr83 and Foxp3 was not a result of a failure to activate these cells, or increased cell death within the culture. Furthermore, as has previously been reported, Foxp3 expression was not reduced in nT<sub>R</sub> cells isolated from the periphery of dnTGF-&#x003b2;RII mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2b</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> However, there was a significant reduction in expression of Gpr83 in dnTGF-&#x003b2;RII nT<sub>R</sub> cells as compared with wild-type cells.

Amongst these, the orphan G-protein coupled receptor Gpr83 has been associated with the nT<sub>R</sub>-cell phenotype. Here we have analysed the expression of Gpr83 and produced Gpr83-deficient mice to critically examine its role in T<sub>R</sub>-cell development and function. Our results show that Gpr83 expression is tightly linked to Foxp3 expression and that, like Foxp3, its expression in antigen-activated cells is highly TGF-&#x003b2; dependent. Despite this association with Foxp3, Gpr83 appears to be dispensable for nT<sub>R</sub>-cell development and function. Thus Gpr83-deficient mice had normal frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells in the primary and secondary lymphoid organs and these cells retained their suppressive activity <italic>in vivo</italic> in a T-cell transfer model of colitis.</p><p>Previous studies suggest Gpr83 expression is restricted to Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells and is not induced upon activation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> By contrast to these results, we found a striking up-regulation of Gpr83, equivalent to levels found amongst nT<sub>R</sub> cells, following polyclonal activation of na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Importantly, this induced expression was not associated with a general activation phenotype but was strongly linked with Foxp3, as Gpr83 expression was only detected in activated cells also expressing Foxp3. Furthermore, Gpr83 expression is highly dependent on TGF-&#x003b2;, a cytokine known to induce functional regulatory (iT<sub>R</sub>) cells from na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> Whether TGF-&#x003b2; is acting directly to induce Gpr83 or whether this is a secondary event following induction of Foxp3 is unclear. A recent paper by Hansen <italic>et al.</italic> has described the preferential induction of Foxp3 in cells retrovirally transduced with Gpr83.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> This induction occurred under inflammatory conditions, and suggests that Gpr83 may be involved in &#x02018;conditioning&#x02019; cells to express Foxp3 and adopt a regulatory phenotype. However, there does not appear to be an absolute requirement for Gpr83 in the peripheral induction of Foxp3 <italic>in vitro</italic>, as addition of TGF-&#x003b2; to activated Gpr83-deficient T cells led to similar Foxp3 expression as was observed with wild-type T cells (C. Toms and F. Powrie, unpublished observations).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> Further experiments are required to clarify a role for Gpr83 in peripheral induction of Foxp3 expression.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; signalling also sustains Gpr83 expression in nT<sub>R</sub> cells, as there was a decrease in Gpr83 expression in nT<sub>R</sub> cells isolated from dnTGF-&#x003b2;RII mice. By contrast, the expression of Foxp3 was comparable between wild-type and dnTGF-&#x003b2;RII nT<sub>R</sub> cells, suggesting that the latter population does not contain significantly increased numbers of activated non-T<sub>R</sub> cells, which would reduce the overall expression of Foxp3 within this population. This observation also implies a differential sensitivity of Foxp3 and Gpr83 to TGF-&#x003b2; signalling in nT<sub>R</sub> cells, especially in the periphery of these mice. It is also notable that Gpr83 expression is highly dependent on IL-2, as nT<sub>R</sub> cells isolated from mice lacking IL-2 expression show significantly reduced levels of Gpr83.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> Further studies on the function of Gpr83 would be aided by the identification of the specific ligand for this protein. Preliminary studies have suggested that this may be provided by antigen-presenting cells,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> although further work is required to definitively demonstrate this.

This result demonstrates, in this <italic>in vivo</italic> disease model at least, that nT<sub>R</sub> cells can regulate inflammation in the absence of Gpr83 expression. As Gpr83 is up-regulated in TGF-&#x003b2;-induced Foxp3 iT<sub>R</sub> cells, it was possible that functional differences in the pathogenicity of Gpr83-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> T cells would be observed. However, no detectable differences were seen in either the onset or severity of disease induced by wild-type or Gpr83-deficient colitogenic T cells. Comparable levels of Foxp3 could be detected in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> transferred mice, suggesting that there was no defect in the ability to induce Foxp3 in these cells upon transfer (data not shown). Taken together, our data indicate that Gpr83 expression is dispensable for nT<sub>R</sub> cell function and control of intestinal homeostasis.
