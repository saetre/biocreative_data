Numerous studies have shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] that prenatal and early postnatal exposure to lead results in a long-term potentiation (LTP) decrease, cognitive deficits, and behavioral problems.</p><p>Interference with the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system has proved to be one of the key mechanisms that explains neurotoxicity of lead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain and it mediates activity-dependent processes critical to both the developing and mature brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Glutamate exerts its effects through various subtypes of ionotropic or metabotropic (mGluRs) receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Activation of the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) plays a central role in brain development and learning and memory, which have been considered as principal consequences of lead-induced neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, little is known about whether mGluRs are involved in lead neurotoxicity.</p><p>mGluRs have recently been extensively studied. mGluRs are composed of eight isoforms (mGluR1~8) which are classified into groups I, II, and III. Group II (<italic>mGluR2 and mGluR3</italic>) and group III (<italic>mGluR4, mGluR6, and mGluR7</italic>) receptors are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase by Go and possibly Gi protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that antagonists and agonists of mGluRs can modulate the induction, formation, and maintenance of LTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], a form of neuronal plasticity that is involved in memory and learning. The <italic>mGluR3 </italic>receptors are localized at high densities in brain areas associated with cognition and memory, such as the hippocampus, cortex and olfactory bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Expression of <italic>mGluR7 </italic>is relatively high on CA3 neurons in the CA1 region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The relationship between <italic>mGluR3/mGluR7 </italic>and synaptic plasticity had been verified by many recent studies. Pharmacological activation of <italic>mGluR3 </italic>revealed that <italic>mGluR3 </italic>may be of marked significance in the regulation of excitability in neuronal networks, as well as of synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the study by P&#x000f6;schel et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], activation of postsynaptic <italic>mGluR3 </italic>receptors were found necessary for long-term depression (LTD), presynaptic <italic>mGluR3 </italic>receptors functioned as modulators of both LTP and LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. On the other hand, the presynaptic axons of CA3 pyramidal neurons primarily express <italic>mGluR7</italic>, and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>modulate synaptic transmission at a variety of central synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For example, Bushell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] reported that the initial decremental phase of LTP, known as short-term potentiation, was greatly attenuated in the <italic>mGluR7 </italic>knockout mouse (<italic>mGluR7</italic>-/-), which suggested a role for <italic>mGluR7 </italic>in short-term potentiation in the CA1 region.</p><p>We therefore undertook this study to examine the possible role of <italic>mGluR3 </italic>and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>in lead neurotoxicity. We used a whole-animal model and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to analyze the expression of <italic>mGluR3 </italic>and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>in the hippocampus of developmental rats exposed to lead during the pre- and postnatal periods. We wish to ascertain the impact of lead exposure on <italic>mGluR3 </italic>and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>expression and their potential roles in lead neurotoxicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal protocol and Pb<sup>2+ </sup>exposure</title><p>Rats were exposed to Pb<sup>2+ </sup>during development as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Briefly, twenty-four adult Sprague-Dawley rats were individually housed in plastic cages with bedding at 22 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C under a 12-hour light: dark cycle (male-female ratio 2:1, weight 200~250 g). Eight female rats were randomly selected and placed on control or 0.2% lead acetate water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) from 10 days prior to mating and until postnatal day 21, namely gestational and lactational lead exposure. The lead-exposed group (4 litters) and control group (4 litters) both received the same treatment throughout the study and food and water were provided ad libitum. One day after parturition, litters were culled to 8 pups (male-female ratio 1:1) and the pups were weaned at 21 days of age. After weaning, all pups were fed deionized drinking water. All procedures complied with institutional guidelines regarding the ethical care and use of animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood lead and hippocampal lead analysis</title><p>In each litter, four weaning pups including 2 male and 2 female rats were randomly selected to analyze the blood lead and hippocampal lead levels to evaluate the actual lead content at the end of the exposure. Blood samples (0.3&#x02013;0.5 ml) were collected by cardiac puncture in tubes containing EDTA-disodium. Blood lead levels were determined via Thermo Elemental Solaar M6 Series (Thermo Elemental, Franklin, MA, USA) by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry and the quality control procedure for the assessment of lead exposure was performed. Hippocampus from both left and right sides were collected from each rat, rinsed softly with saline, sopped up water with filter paper, pooled together as one sample and weighed. After hippocampal tissues were digested by nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide, they were heated in the microwave digestion oven (CEM MARS5, USA). After that, hippocampal lead levels were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7500 CE, Agilent Technologies, USA). The operations are all performed in our ICP-MS lab, which meets the Chinese Standard (GBJ173-1984) and provides air to meet class 100 (class I) conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Ultrastructural details of hippocampus were studied with electron microscopy as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Briefly, after 32 weaning rats (8 litters, 4 pups/litter) were sampled by cardiac puncture as above, they were immediately decapitated and collected from both sides of hippocampi and immediately cut into tissue blocks (1 mm &#x000d7; 1 mm &#x000d7; 5 mm) and were processed for electron microscopy. Ultrathin sections (50 nm) were cut with an ultramicrotome (Ultracut, Reichert-Jung) and stained with 4% uranyl acetate for 20 minutes and with 1% Pb for 10 minutes prior to examination by electron microscopy (H-500, HITACHI, Japan). The slides were read by a designated and experienced pathologist who was blinded to the dose groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Morris water maze (MWM)</title><p>A test using the MWM was performed when young rats were 30 days old. In each litter, only one male and one female pups were randomly selected. The MWM was originally designed by English psychologist Morris in the 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which consisted of a dark circular pool 150 cm in diameter and 50 cm in height. The pool was filled to a height of 35 cm with water at 22&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C stained by black ink. A transparent Plexiglas<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>escape platform (12 cm in diameter) 5 cm below the water surface and invisible to the rats was located in the center of the southwest quadrant. The room had numerous extramaze cues that remained constant throughout the experiment and no intramaze cues to ensure that the rats had to rely on the location of extramaze cues to locate the platform. The procedure included a training portion and test portion. Each training day consisted of 4 trials per animal, with a quasi-randomly selected release location from each compass point (N, E, S, W). On trial 1 of day 1, the animal was released from the appropriate starting location and once the rat located the platform it was allowed to stay on it for 10 seconds. If the rat did not find the platform within 120 seconds, it was guided to reach it and allowed to remain on it for 10 seconds and then was returned to its heated cage following completion of the task. Twenty-four hours after last training trial (postnatal day (PND) 35), 7 days later (PND 42), and 1 month later (PND72), spatial memory was repeatedly examined. On each occasion experimental procedures and surroundings were kept constant. The time required to reach the platform (escape latency), distance swimming to the platform, and the swimming speed as well as the time and distance spent in each quadrant were recorded by a video tracking system. The measures were averaged per rat within each daily session.</p><p>The MWM originally was aimed to test short-term memory (STM), namely spatial reference memory. In previous studies, the retention tests including the inhibitory avoidance task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], hippocampal dependent discrimination task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and conditioned taste aversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], were performed to examine long-term memory (LTM) of rats which were conducted at 5 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], 7 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or 1 month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] after training. However, there have not any studies to assess the MWM test for evaluation of LTM. In this study, we tried to modify the classic MWM procedure and add our self-designed retention test, which might be a new and practical way to apply the MWM to evaluate LTM.</p></sec><sec><title>Total RNA isolation</title><p>At 21 days of age, both sides of hippocampus of pups (8 litters, one male and one female pups/litter) were harvested and stored frozen at -80&#x000b0;C prepared for PCR. RNA was isolated using a Trizol kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA concentrations and purity were evaluated by measuring the A260 nm-to-A280 nm absorbance ratio with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). Integrity of RNA was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR</title><p>Highly purified oligonucleotide primers were commercially generated (SBS Genetech, China). Primer design and optimization were performed with Oligo software (National Biosciences Inc., Plymouth, MN, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The primers used were the following: <italic>mGluR3 </italic>[GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M92076">M92076</ext-link>], sense 5'-GAC GTG GTC CTG GTG ATC CTA T-3', antisense 5'-CTA ACG GAG ATG CAC ATT G-3', 197 bp; <italic>mGluR7 </italic>[GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="D16817">D16817</ext-link>], sense 5'-CCA GAC AAC AAA CAC AAC CAACC-3', antisense 5'-GCG TTC CCT TCT GTG TCT TCT TC-3', 173 bp; <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic>, sense 5'-AGA CCT CTA TGC CAA CAC AGT GCT G-3', and antisense 5'-TCA TCG TAC TCC TGC TTG CTG A-3', 218 bp.</p><p>One-step, real-time quantitative RT-PCR was carried out with a LightCycler instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) by using the LightCycler SYBR Green I RNA Master Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). All reactions were conducted in duplicate. Negative control was performed with sterile purified deionized water. Each cycle of PCR included denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 seconds, primers annealing at 62&#x000b0;C for 5 seconds, and a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 12 seconds. The fluorescence of each sample was measured at 5&#x000b0;C below the melting temperatures (Tms) to eliminate background fluorescence due to primer-dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Results were analyzed with LightCycler Software version 3.5 by using the second derivative maximum method to set the CT. E was calculated using the equation E = 10<sup>(-1/slope) </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Agarose gel electrophoresis analyses were also performed to verify whether the amplified product corresponded to the size predicted for gene-specific product.</p><p>Relative quantification was carried out with the Relative Expression Software Tool (REST, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Because the expression level of the <italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>gene was constant regardless of lead exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], relative qualification was presented by means of normalization with the <italic>&#x003b2;-actin </italic>gene. Relative and normalized expression ratios (R) were calculated on the basis of the median of the performed duplicates and computed according to the following equation: R = E<sub>target</sub>exp(&#x00394;C<sub>Ttarget</sub>)/E<sub>ref</sub>exp(&#x00394;C<sub>Tref</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Wilcoxon test was used in the analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The variations in <italic>mGluR3 </italic>and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>expression were compared using coefficients of variability and the Wilcoxon two group test. Blood lead levels and hippocampal lead levels were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the MWM task, distance traveled (cm) and escape latency were the principal measures to evaluate the performance of the rats during acquisition training. The baselines of pretraining latency and swimming distance of two groups were analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Because the experimental design involves both a between-subjects factor (lead dose condition) and a within-subjects factor (days), repeated measures ANOVA was performed. Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD and the level of significance is <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 (two tailed).

Thus we considered that the dose of lead exposure which has been used in this study was appropriate and the hypothesis that the exposure level of 0.2% lead acetate might be too low to reveal any obvious change in expression of <italic>mGluR3 </italic>and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>mRNA should be ruled out.</p><p>On the other hand, the putative role of G-protein-coupled metabotropic receptors in LTP and LTD has been the subject of intense investigation recently. Although recent studies demonstrated that <italic>mGluR3 </italic>played an essential role in LTD and a modulatory role in LTP, and functioned to regulate activity-dependent synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>might mediate a reduction in synaptic transmission through a mechanism such as decreasing calcium influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], the results of our studies showed that no obvious variation of <italic>mGluR3/7 </italic>mRNA expression occurred after pre-natal and early post-natal lead exposure. Many studies have revealed that ionotropic glutamate receptors NMDARs acted as one of targets of lead induced neurotoxicity, mainly by means of the decreased expression of NMDARs subtypes <italic>NR2A </italic>mRNA and <italic>NR1 </italic>mRNA and therefore resulting in a decrease of calcium-dependent synaptic transmission. There is still lack of studies of other factors, such as the studies of effects of lead exposure on affinity of glutamate receptors. Several scientists had done some research about the impact of lead on binding abilities of glutamate receptors and found that developmental lead exposure altered expression levels of components of NMDAR with no change in binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The binding affinity was not considered as key elements of lead induced neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In conclusion, we speculate that rat <italic>mGluR3 </italic>and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>might not involve in the pathways mediating lead neurotoxicity. A potential limitation of the present study is that the results are only from rats and lack of data of other genus yet.</p><p>In neuronal ultrastructural detection and MWM task, we found that exposure to lead before and after birth can result in ultrastructural alterations and STM deficits, which is consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The hippocampus called "time window of memory" plays an especially important role in the storage of STM and the transition from STM to LTM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], hippocampal ultrastructural alterations maybe one of mechanisms of lead-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, a modified MWM procedure was applied and LTM was found also injured which was another proof that lead may cause irreversible neurological damage to neurodevelopment.</p><p>The present study suggests that lead exposure has no obvious effect on hippocampal <italic>mGluR3 </italic>and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>mRNA expression, and rat hippocampal <italic>mGluR3 </italic>and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>might not associate with lead induced neurotoxicity. Further studies are required to reveal the outcomes of another spliced variants of mGluRs after lead exposure. We believe this study is among the first to examine the role of <italic>mGluR3 </italic>and <italic>mGluR7 </italic>in lead neurotoxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XJ contributed to the acquisition and interpretation of the data and drafted the manuscript.
