The RNA hairpins are variants of the P4 region from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase P RNA: a U-to-A mutant changing the identity of the bulged nucleotide, and a U-to-C, C-to-U double mutant changing only the bulge position. Structures calculated from NMR constraints show that the RNA hairpins adopt different conformations. In the U-to-C, C-to-U double mutant, the conserved bulged uridine in the P4 wild-type stem is found to be shifted in the 3&#x02032;-direction by one nucleotide when compared with the wild-type structure. Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> is used as a spectroscopic probe for Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding sites because both complexes have octahedral symmetry and have similar radii.

The metal ion binds in the major groove near a bulge loop in both mutants, but is shifted 3&#x02032; by about one base pair in the double mutant.

This so-called P4 element with the flanking J3&#x0002f;4 and J2&#x0002f;4 single-stranded regions is part of a pseudoknot structure and is positioned at the center of the catalytic domain immediately adjacent to the site of the pre-tRNA cleavage in the tertiary structure models.

The unusually shifted imino resonance at 9.8 p.p.m. in both the P4 U69A and P4 U70b spectrum is characteristic of the UUCG tetraloop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh961c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh961c39">39</xref>), and confirms the formation of monomolecular stem&#x02013;loop structures for both molecules. Sequential connectivity indicating close proximity of imino protons in stacked base pairs is observed from G2 through G5 and G22 through G16 in the P4 U69A molecule. A weaker crosspeak between G5 and G22 indicates continuation of base stacking across the bulge loop.</p><p>In the P4 U70b spectra, sequential crosspeaks are observed from G2 through G22 and G21 through G16. The G22-G21 crosspeak between the closing base pairs of the bulge loop is very weak. Thus, stacking across the bulge loop appears to be significantly less pronounced in the P4 U70b molecule.</p></sec><sec><title>Assignments of nonexchangeable protons</title><p>As evident from the aromatic-H1&#x02032; proton NOE spectra shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh961f2">2</xref>a, the U69A molecule displays sequential connectivities as expected from the proposed secondary structure. The sequential connectivities extend from G1 to G5 and C7 to U13 on the bulged strand, with very weak A-form like sequential crosspeaks observed across the bulge loop between G5 and C7, suggestive of stacking interaction between these two bases. These data require the bulge nucleotide to be in a non-stacked, extrahelical conformation. A-form connectivity is observed on the opposite strand through the bulge loop from G17 to C27, lending further support for stacking between the two stems.</p><p>For the bulge position mutant P4 U70b molecule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh961f2">2</xref>b), A-form sequential connectivity is observed from G1 to C6 and C8 to U13 on the bulged strand. Again, A-form sequential cross peaks are observed between C6 and C8, somewhat stronger than the G5-C7 connectivities observed in P4 U69A. This indicates that the U7 introduced by mutation is bulged out instead of the U6 in the wild-type molecule. On the opposite strand, A-form connectivity is again present from G17 to C27, indicating a stacked conformation of the base pairs closing the bulge loop.</p><p>The UUCG tetraloop in both molecules displays the characteristic spectral properties described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh961c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh961c39">39</xref>).</p><p>The sequential connectivity patterns demonstrated for the aromatic-H1&#x02032; spectral regions could be confirmed in the H1&#x02032;-ribose, ribose-aromatic and aromatic-aromatic regions. Based on the sequential assignments of H1&#x02032; and aromatic protons, all H2&#x02032; protons and all but a few H3&#x02032; and H4&#x02032; protons could be unambiguously assigned from <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H COSY, NOESY and <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>1</sup>H HMQC experiments at natural abundance.</p></sec><sec><title>Intermolecular Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;RNA NOE crosspeaks</title><p>The slowly exchanging Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> ammine protons show a single resonance at 3.6 p.p.m. in H<sub>2</sub>O.

The crosspeak line width generally reflects the RNA proton line width. The intermolecular crosspeaks to RNA imino protons are unambiguously assigned with the exception of the overlapped G9 and G21 imino crosspeaks in the P4 U70b spectra. The presence of intermolecular NOEs to both the G21 H8 and the C20 H6 and amino protons was used to confirm the existence of NOEs to both G9 and G21 imino protons in the P4 U70b RNA.</p><p>NOE crosspeak intensities for imino and aromatic protons are summarized in the inset secondary structures of P4 U69A and P4 U70b in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh961f3">3</xref>.

NOESY experiments in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> did not show significant changes in crosspeak intensities or connectivities compared with experiments in the absence of divalent metal ions, suggesting little or no structural changes upon Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> binding. The same set of distance constraints was therefore used in structure calculations for both free RNA and the RNA&#x02013;Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> complex. Dihedral constraints for ribose and backbone conformation were derived from high resolution, phosphorus-decoupled <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H COSY experiments and <sup>31</sup>P-<sup>1</sup>H correlation experiments as described in Materials and Methods. Based on the magnitude of <sup>3</sup>J<sub>H1&#x02032;H2&#x02032;</sub>, sugar pucker was constrained to 3&#x02032;-endo for all nucleotides except G5 and A6, which were constrained to range between 2&#x02032;-endo and 3&#x02032;-endo, and U14 and C15, which were constrained to be 2&#x02032;-endo in P4 U69A. For P4 U70b, C6 was constrained to range between 2&#x02032;-endo and 3&#x02032;-endo and U7, U14 and C15 were constrained as 2&#x02032;-endo, all other nucleotides were constrained 3&#x02032;-endo. O4&#x02032;-exo conformation for G5 and C6 could be excluded based on the intraresidue H1&#x02032;-H4&#x02032; NOE intensity. Backbone dihedral angles that could not be directly measured were constrained to A-form ranges in the helical regions only.

Of the 50 initial structures, 35 structures converged during the global fold stage as judged from NOE violation energies. During subsequent refinement, 36 (P4 U69A) and 39 (P4 U70b) structures converged to low NOE and dihedral angle violation energies. The converged structures of both P4 U69A and P4 U70b were analyzed and most of the structures were found to fall in a single structure family. Structures that differed from the major structure family for each RNA revealed proton&#x02013;proton distances below 5 &#x0212b; for which no NOE crosspeaks were observed even at long mixing time; six structures for P4 U96A were discarded from further analysis based on this criterion.

The bulged nucleotide is found in the minor groove for P4 U69A, similar to the previously reported P4wt structure, whereas it is oriented towards the major groove in the P4 U70b structure, similar to the previously reported mutant structure. The location of the bulged nucleotide is determined by a number of unusual NOEs in both molecules. In P4 U69A, a stronger than usual NOE between A6 H2&#x02032; and C7 H5 combined with much weaker NOEs between A6 H2 and C7 H1&#x02032;as well as C23 H1&#x02032; define the minor groove conformation of A6. A major groove position of A6 could be ruled out based on the absence of any A6 H2 to imino proton crosspeaks.

The overall structural features of the RNA appear unchanged.</p><p>The coordinates for average structures of each molecule have been deposited in the PDB database under PDB ID 1XSG, 1XSH, 1XST and 1XSU.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Comparison of the structures of both P4 U69A and P4 U70b stems to the wild-type structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh961c18">18</xref>) reveals a significant difference between the two molecules. Change of the bulge nucleotide from uridine to adenosine does not change the secondary structure of the P4 element. The bulged nucleotide is found in the minor groove as observed in the wild-type structure, and the overall structure remains unchanged. The binding site of Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, not surprisingly, is preserved in the U69A mutant. Upon mutation of U69 to C and C70 to U, a GC base pair is introduced involving C69, thus extending the 5&#x02032; half of the P4 stem and shifting the bulge position by one nucleotide to U70. This difference in secondary structure is evident from the sequential NOESY crosspeaks shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh961f2">2</xref>. In addition to this change in bulge position, structure calculations based on NOE distance restraints and torsion angle restraints show that the bulged uridine changes its position from the minor groove to the major groove. Both the secondary structure and the change in bulged nucleotide position are similar to the situation in P4m. In contrast to P4m, however, no GU pair is introduced in P4 U70b. Comparing P4m and P4 U70b, the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding site is not preserved. Rather, a shift of the binding site to the 3&#x02032; direction is observed. From the comparison of metal ion binding positions, we can conclude that the introduction of a GU pair rather than the change in bulge position determines the site of binding in P4m. Without the GU pair, the metal ion is found to bind at the bottom of the upper stem adjacent to the bulge in both the wild-type structure and P4 U70b. Evidently, the expected widening of the major groove by the GU pair in P4m partly compensates the effect of the bulge shift, leading to a lesser change in positioning of the bound metal ion.</p><p>It is expected that the change in secondary structure and bulge nucleotide position found for the mutant P4 stems also occurs in the context of the full RNase P RNA. This is supported by changes in Tb<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> cleavage patterns consistent with the proposed secondary structure changes as reported by Kaye <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh961c19">19</xref>).</p><p>The findings by Kaye <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh961c19">19</xref>) reveal no large effect by local P4 structure changes on global structure as detected by hydroxyl radical experiments; any such global change would need to be rather subtle. Missing Tb<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> cleavage in the upper stem of P4 is probably due to a more stable helical structure in that region that prevents the necessary in-line backbone conformation required for cleavage, and should not be construed as evidence against the presence of a metal binding site in the upper stem. The proposed L8&#x02013;P4 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh961c6">6</xref>) provides a possible mechanism for structural distortion beyond P4. In particular, the change in position of the universally conserved bulged uridine could have a profound effect if functional groups on the bulged nucleotide participate in tertiary contacts. The findings of Kaye <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh961c19">19</xref>), however, indicate that bulge position, rather than identity, affects catalysis. The change in bulge position affects the riboyzme function by perturbation of a bulged-helix motif generally implicated in metal binding, according to these authors. The conserved uridine might be required for protein interaction rather than RNA tertiary contacts, since no profound change in RNA structure was found in the U69A mutant.</p><p>Binding of catalytic metal ions in the context of the complete RNase P sequence has been shown to involve the nucleotides A66 and A67, as well as single-stranded adenosines from the J3&#x0002f;4 junction 5&#x02032; to A66, and is mediated by inner sphere coordination. In the context of the isolated P4 stem, only A66 and A67 are present, and a different outer sphere binding site is observed instead. This difference both in context and metal binding properties limits functional interpretation of the metal binding site found in the major groove of P4. In particular, the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding site determined by this study may not correspond to a site of catalytic Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding. On the other hand, tertiary structure models of RNase P RNA show both A66 and A67 to be quite removed from the scissile bond in the pre-tRNA. Functional groups implicated in metal coordination are spread along the whole of P4, with the A352 phosphate in J2&#x0002f;4 coming closest to the scissile bond. Hence, perturbation of an outer sphere metal binding site at the bulged-helix motif in P4 may well have indirect effects on overall metal binding to P4, including essential, inner-sphere coordinated metals.</p><p>Support for outer sphere coordinated metal ions in P4 arises from the observation by Kurz and Fierke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh961c5">5</xref>) that Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> competes for metal ions critical for catalysis. Up to four Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions were found to bind cooperatively to the RNase P&#x02013;pre-tRNA complex and stabilize substrate binding; the affinity for these ions was enhanced by the protein subunit. Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub><sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> was found to inhibit catalytic activity by displacing a single essential outer sphere Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion, as well as to compete with inhibitory, larger divalent ions. Taken together, these findings support an outer sphere Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding site in P4. The role of this site remains unclear. It may serve to position an Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion close to the site of inner sphere binding during folding, or it may be responsible for inhibition by larger divalent ions due to a displacement of the catalytic Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion.</p><p>In addition to the perturbation of a bulged-helix motif, the precise location of the bulged nucleotide might also influence ribozyme function. In the wild-type and P4 U69A mutant, the minor groove placement of the bulged nucleotide positions it at the L8&#x02013;P4 interface in the tertiary structure model, somewhat removed from the cleavage site. In the P4 U70 and U70b mutants, the major groove position of the bulged nucleotide is closer to the cleavage site but the roughly 13 &#x0212b; distance to the scissile phosphate makes direct involvement in catalysis unlikely. Rather, the major groove placement of U70 might interfere with metal binding in the major groove of P4.</p><p>In summary, the position of helical structure distortion in P4 probably affects catalysis through a large change in ion binding position. This is an example of how a single base mutation can change the function of an RNA through metal interactions rather than effects on conformation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh961f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Secondary structure of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase P RNA (<bold>a</bold>) and hairpin P4 variants (<bold>b</bold>&#x02013;<bold>d</bold>) used in this study.
