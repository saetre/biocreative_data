In mitotic cells, HR functions to maintain the integrity of the genome through such processes as the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the maintenance of rDNA copy number, and the rescue of collapsed replication forks. HR is entirely conservative when it occurs following DNA replication where a sister chromatid is available as a template. However, utilization of sequences on a homologous chromosome can lead to crossovers and potential loss of heterozygosity (LOH), while recombination at ectopic or repeated sequences may lead to genomic rearrangements such as deletions, duplications, and translocations (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>In <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>, Rad52 is the defining member of an epistasis group that includes: RecA homologs Rad51, Rad55, Rad57, and Dmc1; putative SWI/SNF family ATPase Rad54; Rad52 homolog Rad59 and Mre11, Xrs2, and Rad50. The Rad52 epistasis group is essential for HR. Rad52 binds single-stranded DNA in vitro and has been shown to stimulate DNA annealing and to enhance Rad51-catalyzed strand invasion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In response to DNA damage, proteins involved in HR relocalize into discrete subnuclear foci. Fluorescently tagged repair and checkpoint proteins have been used to explore the composition and dynamics of these foci, which are giga-dalton-sized assemblies of proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Repair foci colocalize with fluorescently tagged inducible DSB sites, regions of single-stranded DNA, and sites of unscheduled DNA synthesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Multiple DSBs often colocalize at a single focus showing that foci reflect recombination centers capable of the simultaneous repair of more than one lesion. The assembly of proteins into repair foci is a coordinated process beginning with detection of damage by the Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 complex. Next, checkpoint proteins are bound and activated to arrest cell cycle progression until completion of repair. The lesion is repaired through HR performed by the Rad52 epistasis group proteins and finally the repair apparatus is disassembled &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. From a cell biology perspective, Rad52 focus formation is an excellent marker for HR, since it is required for the recruitment of all other HR proteins into repair foci.</p><p>While exogenous DNA damage greatly stimulates the formation of Rad52 foci, foci also form spontaneously in S phase cells, likely reflecting the repair of spontaneous DNA lesions such as DSBs, nicks, and single-stranded gaps &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Time-lapse microscopy indicates that foci form in approximately 50&#x00025; of cells during S phase and most spontaneous foci persist for less than 10 min &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Since spontaneous foci generally last for only a fraction of S phase, they are observed in 20&#x00025; of S phase cells in a population of logarithmically growing cells (5&#x00025; of the total population). Mutants defective in various aspects of DNA metabolism, including damage checkpoints (<italic>mec1 sml1</italic>), HR (<italic>rad51</italic>&#x00394;), and DNA replication (<italic>pol12&#x02013;100</italic>) exhibit elevated levels of spontaneous foci &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. This elevation may be the consequence of an increased incidence of focus formation reflecting the generation of more DNA lesions, or the consequence of foci that persist over time resulting from an alteration in the dynamics of focus assembly/disassembly.</p><p>Here we report the results of a genome-wide screen designed to identify gene deletions that significantly alter levels of spontaneous Rad52 foci. The set of gene deletions identified includes many known genes involved in DNA and chromatin processes such as replication, repair, silencing, and chromosome segregation, as well as a number of other processes with no reported link to HR. In addition, 22 previously uncharacterized ORFs designated <italic>IRC2&#x02013;11</italic>, <italic>13&#x02013;16</italic>, <italic>18&#x02013;25</italic> (<underline>I</underline>ncreased <underline>R</underline>ecombination <underline>C</underline>enters) were identified. Measurement of HR between sister chromatids and between homologous chromosomes in these focus mutants established four different classes demonstrating that several distinct mechanisms are involved in precipitating increased Rad52 foci. Furthermore, several <italic>IRC</italic> genes exhibit synthetic interactions with a <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; allele suggesting a direct role in the maintenance of genomic integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Genome-Wide Screen to Identify New Genes Affecting DNA Metabolism</title><p>Rad52, a central recombination protein, relocalizes to form sub-nuclear foci in response to spontaneous and induced DNA damage. Therefore, Rad52 focus levels can be used as a sensitive indicator for processes that impinge on the genome. An initial screen to identify gene deletions affecting the levels of spontaneous Rad52 foci was performed by transforming a plasmid containing a Rad52-YFP fusion gene directly into library haploid strains. However, this approach yielded an excessive number of false-positive results caused by additional recessive factors in the individual library strains. We therefore developed a method that permits the systematic creation of hybrid diploids that are homozygous for the gene deletion from each library strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030228-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), while simultaneously facilitating the introduction of plasmid or chromosomal constructs into the gene deletion strains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><fig id="pgen-0030228-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Rad52-YFP Focus Screen Using Systematic Hybrid LOH</title><p>(A) Method for preparation of hybrid LOH strains for screening, permitting simultaneous complementation of recessive factors in the library strains and introduction of the Rad52-YFP plasmid through mating &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>KanMX</italic>-marked gene deletion strains are mated with corresponding conditional centromere strains.

The distribution of focus levels is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030228-g002">Figure 2</xref>. To evaluate the reliability of the mutant screen, we partitioned the genes into four sub-sets shown (A, B, C, and D). Sub-set B consists of the strains that exhibit focus levels within the range of variation seen in a wild-type strain. These account for approximately 90&#x00025; of the deletions screened. For 233 gene deletions (sub-set A), no foci were observed. Upon retest, most of these strains formed foci; however, the distribution was shifted slightly to the left compared to the entire deletion library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030228-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030228-sg001">S1</xref>A). Furthermore, for the 96 strains that showed the lowest levels upon retest (less than 1&#x00025; foci), all gave rise to foci after ionizing radiation, indicating that no fundamental aspect of Rad52 focus formation was disrupted in these deletion strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030228-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B).

Following two independent retests, 80 mutants (75&#x00025; of the 108) consistently exhibited elevated focus levels including deletions of 16 previously uncharacterized ORFs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030228-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030228-st001">S1</xref>D).</p><table-wrap id="pgen-0030228-t001" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Genes Identified in the Screen for Increased Spontaneous Rad52-YFP Foci</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0030228.t001"/></table-wrap><p>Subsequently, we examined the 144 deletions from the genome-wide screen that exhibited foci in 15&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; of cells (sub-set C). We suspected that interesting candidate genes would be found in this sub-set since it includes deletions of several genes directly associated with genomic integrity, including replication (<italic>CTF18</italic>, <italic>RAD27</italic>), homologous repair (<italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>RAD50</italic>), chromatin remodeling (<italic>HPA1</italic>, <italic>SET2</italic>, <italic>SNT1</italic>, <italic>SWI6</italic>), and cell cycle control (<italic>CLB5</italic>, <italic>RAD17</italic>). To decide how much further to study this sub-set, we retested all 41 uncharacterized ORFs contained within it. We found that only nine (22&#x00025;) consistently exhibited elevated focus levels upon retesting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030228-st001">Table S1</xref>C). Since only 22&#x00025; of uncharacterized ORFs in this 15&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; focus range maintained an elevated focus phenotype compared to 75&#x00025; in the greater than 20&#x00025; range, we concluded that the likelihood of identifying additional new genes in this sub-set was dramatically decreased. Therefore, we did not delve deeper into our candidate pool, and the nine new genes along with the 80 deletions exhibiting the highest levels of foci were selected for further analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030228-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we recognize that the screen produces some false negatives since several gene deletions expected to exhibit elevated focus levels (e.g., <italic>mre11</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>xrs2</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rad50</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rad27</italic>&#x00394;) failed the cutoff for significance (16&#x00025;, 13&#x00025;, 9&#x00025;, and 16&#x00025;, respectively). In addition, the screen identified some gene deletions (e.g<italic>.</italic>, <italic>ddc1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rad57</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>slx8</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>mms1</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>rtt109</italic>&#x00394;), but failed to identify other members of the same complexes (e.g<italic>.</italic>, <italic>mec3</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rad55</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>slx5</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>asf1</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>mms22</italic>&#x00394;) that were expected to be phenotypically equivalent. We then retested the other members individually and they consistently demonstrated elevated levels of spontaneous foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030228-st001">Table S1</xref>E) indicating that the focus phenotype was shared among all members of each complex and that the mutants not identified in the initial screen were false negatives.

The levels of spontaneous relocalization of Rad52-YFP protein into subnuclear foci were analyzed in individual gene deletion strains. Our screen differs from previous genomic studies where changes in DNA metabolism phenotypes were identified using the output of DNA repair or recombination assays, such as survival following exposure to exogenous DNA damage or the gain or loss of genetic markers following recombination. Our cell biological screen permits the identification of alterations in the HR pathway in living cells regardless of the outcome of these events. In addition to mutations affecting recombination that ultimately block the appearance of recombinants (Class I) and mutations that increase the formation of spontaneous DNA damage (Class II), our screen uncovered mutations that alter the kinetics rather than the frequency of events (Class III) along with those that do not affect recombination globally (Class IV).</p><p>The majority of the genes identified in this study fall into functional groups associated with DNA metabolism and chromosome dynamics, including replication and repair, transcription, and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030228-t001">Table 1</xref>). In addition, we found genes involved in nuclear pore complexes and mitochondrial function as well as diverse cellular processes such as the spindle assembly checkpoint not previously associated with HR.

After retesting all uncharacterized ORFs with focus levels between 15&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; (41), nine consistently exhibited elevated foci and were added to the set of deletions. Three hypothetical ORFs were removed from the set after expression of the wild-type gene failed to complement the focus phenotype in the gene deletion strain. The remaining 86 gene deletions were prepared for the additional assays described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Microscopy.</title><p>Examination of Rad52-YFP focus levels by microscopy was performed as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030228-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;.

Twenty-four tetrads were dissected for each cross, and dissection plates were scanned using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). Colony size was measured for each cross using a macro (Y. Deng, unpublished data) written for ImageJ software (W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health), followed by genotyping for segregating alleles. Average colony size and standard deviation were derived in each cross for the wild type, gene deletion, <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394;, and the double mutants, and normalized to the mean value for the wild-type segregants in the cross. For this study, we defined two different classes of synthetic interactions for growth. Additive interactions are defined when the average colony size for the double mutant is significantly less than the colony size of either single mutant. Synergistic interactions are defined when the average colony size of the double mutant is significantly less than the product of the normalized colony size values of either single mutant. The synthetic interactions reported here were verified in a more closely related W303 genetic background by performing a second trial with congenic deletion strains (minimum four backcrosses) and W3777-17A (<italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394;).
