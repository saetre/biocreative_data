In this study, we investigated the role of hypothalamic Sirt1 in energy balance. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA mediated knock down of hypothalamic Sirt1 showed to decrease food intake and body weight gain. Central administration of a specific melanocortin antagonist, SHU9119, reversed the anorectic effect of hypothalamic Sirt1 inhibition, suggesting that Sirt1 regulates food intake through the central melanocortin signaling. We also showed that fasting increases hypothalamic Sirt1 expression and decreases FoxO1 (Forkhead transcription factor) acetylation suggesting that Sirt1 regulates the central melanocortin system in a FoxO1 dependent manner. In addition, hypothalamic Sirt1 showed to regulate S6K signaling such that inhibition of the fasting induced Sirt1 activity results in up-regulation of the S6K pathway. Thus, this is the first study providing a novel role for the hypothalamic Sirt1 in the regulation of food intake and body weight. Given the role of Sirt1 in several peripheral tissues and hypothalamus, potential therapies centered on Sirt1 regulation might provide promising therapies in the treatment of metabolic diseases including obesity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sirt1 is an evolutionarily conserved NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent deacetylase involved in a wide range of metabolic processes in the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Haigis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the adipose tissue, Sirt1 triggers fat mobilization by inhibiting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), and in the pancreas repression of the uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) by Sirt1 increases insulin secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Haigis1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Sirt1 expression as well as its activity is nutrient sensitive. For example, in the liver, the Sirt1 protein level increases upon fasting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Rodgers1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and decreases by high fat diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Deng1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Sirt1 action in the central nervous system has been studied as well. Sirt1 has neuroprotective effects. For example, increased nuclear NAD biosynthesis and Sirt1 activation are linked to axonal protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Araki1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, and hippocampus over expression of Sirt1 provides protection against neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Kim1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Sirt1 showed to be important in the regulation of stem cells to generate either astroglial lineage or the neuronal lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Prozorovski1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. At a global scale Sirt1 target genes in the mouse brain are deregulated by aging. This situation (at the gene expression level) can be reversed by specific over expression of central Sirt1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Oberdoerffer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Brain Sirt1 expression increases by caloric restriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Cohen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and fasting was shown to increase brain Sirt1 protein content specifically in the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Ramadori1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. A better understanding of hypothalamic Sirt1 action is of crucial importance since the hypothalamus is the primary brain center that interprets adiposity or nutrient related inputs to regulate energy homeostasis. Specifically, the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and the orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus are the major regulators of feeding and energy expenditure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Morton1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the Sirt1 expression in POMC neurons has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Ramadori1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, its functional role in the hypothalamus has not been determined. Hypothalamic control of food intake and body weight involves the action of metabolic sensors including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Cota1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and AMP activated kinase (AMPK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Minokoshi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of its dependence on NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Sirt1 also functions as a metabolic sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Fulco1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that hypothalamic Sirt1 represents another metabolic factor controlling food intake. Using the rat as a physiological <italic>in vivo</italic> model we found that ablation of Sirt1 activity or knocking-down Sirt1 gene expression at the hypothalamic level resulted in decreased food intake and body weight gain. Blocking the melanocortin receptors with the melanocortin antagonist SHU9119 attenuated the anorectic effect of Sirt1 inhibition. Fasting increased hypothalamic NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels and Sirt1 protein content. Inhibition of hypothalamic Sirt1 activity reversed the fasting induced decrease of FoxO1 acetylation, and resulted in increased POMC and decreased AgRP expressions. Regulation of POMC by Sirt1 depends on FoxO1 as shown utilizing in vivo and in vitro approaches. We also present data showing that hypothalamic Sirt1 regulates S6K signaling. Thus, targeting central Sirt1 signaling may show promise for the treatment of obesity and the associated disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Hypothalamic Sirt1 Regulates Food Intake and Body Weight</title><p>To study the potential role of hypothalamic Sirt1 in energy balance we first determined its expression in the rat hypothalamus. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining revealed a nuclear Sirt1 expression in certain hypothalamic centers involved in energy homeostasis, namely the ARC and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008322.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). By immunoblotting analysis, we also confirmed the presence of Sirt1 in the ARC, PVN, primary neurons, and in the mouse corticotropic AtT20 cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008322.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) (see below).

We next wanted to determine if modulating Sirt1 activity or its expression would effect food intake and body weight of adult rats. To block Sirt1 enzymatic activity we used a potent Sirt1 inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Napper1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This compound (EX-527) is a small, selective inhibitor of SIRT1 that does not inhibit histone deacetylases and is specific for Sirt1 over other sirtuin family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Solomon1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Milne1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Both the food intake and body weight changes induced by EX527 were Sirt1 specific because both parameters were reversed by co-administration of a Sirt1 activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Nayagam1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> (Sirt1 activator 3, or SA3) at a dose, which alone did not change either food intake or weight gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Induction of hypothalamic Sirt1 activity by ICV infusion of SA3 to re-fed rats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008322.s001">Figure S1D</xref>, right panel) resulted in increased short-term food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, right).

If the effect of Sirt1 on energy balance is mediated through central melanocortin signaling, blocking melanocortin receptors should reverse the anorexogenic outcome of Sirt1 inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we ICV infused rats with EX-527 and the melanocortin antagonist SHU9119. We used a dose of SHU9119 that did not change the overnight food intake or body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Administration of the melanocortin antagonist together with the Sirt1 inhibitor completely attenuated the decreased food intake or the weight gain induced by the Sirt1 inhibitor alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This result also shows that the effect of the Sirt1 inhibitor on food intake was specific and was not due to nonspecific effects such as food aversion. It has long been accepted that the thyroid hormone is an important determinant of overall energy consumption in humans and animals by affects uncoupling proteins (UCP-1, UCP-2, and UCP-3) in brown adipose tissue (BAT), muscle, and other tissues in combination with an activation of the sympathetic nervous system to accelerate ATP turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Kim2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The TRH peptide produced in neurons of the PVN is released from the median eminence to stimulate the biosynthesis and secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary, which in turn, stimulates the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone, thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>), and it modified product triidothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Nillni3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We had previously showed that the &#x003b1;-MSH peptide derived from POMC processing is one of the main regulators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Nillni2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Nillni1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> by up-regulating the TRH neuron in the PVN. Since the inhibition of hypothalamic Sirt1 induced an anorectic effect in a SHU9119 dependent manner, we measured the T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> plasma levels of EX527 infused animals. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, inhibition of hypothalamic Sirt1 resulted in a significant rise in plasma T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> levels, strongly suggesting that the melanocortin system was positively activated when Sirt1 activity was inhibited.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sirt1 Regulates Melanocortin System at the Level of ARC</title><p>It has been recently shown in mice that hypothalamic Sirt1 protein levels are increased by fasting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Ramadori1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We confirmed this finding in the rat hypothalamic nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The fasting induced increase in hypothalamic Sirt1 protein level was probably due to post-transcriptional regulations, because Sirt1 mRNA level was unaltered by fasting (data not shown). In addition, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g002">Figure 2B</xref> fasting increased ARC NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels and the NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/NADH ratio. Higher NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels, in addition to an elevated hypothalamic Sirt1 protein expression, suggest that Sirt1 deacetylase activity increases upon fasting. POMC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008322.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) and AgRP neurons together with the melanocortin receptors constitute the hypothalamic part of the central melanocortin system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Cone1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> important in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure.

Since hypothalamic Sirt1 regulates food intake through melanocortin receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), we investigated the effect of inhibition of hypothalamic Sirt1 in POMC and AgRP expression.

We next wanted to determine if the changes seen in POMC mRNA were also reflected at the POMC processing products level. With the antibodies we used (see experimental procedures), the &#x0223c;31 kDa POMC precursor normally present in the ARC was undetectable by the western blot analysis probably due to a fast processing and low protein content of this precursor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Perello1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008322.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), a phenomenon commonly seen for proneuropeptide precursors.

Under our experimental conditions, leptin (intraperitoneally) did not change the acetylation state of either protein, suggesting that the fasting induced decrease in FoxO1 acetylation was leptin-independent. Of note, leptin did not change the ARC Sirt1 protein level (data not shown). Blocking hypothalamic Sirt1 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008322.s004">Figure S4B</xref>) reversed the decrease in FoxO1 acetylation, suggesting that fasting induced deacetylation of FoxO1 required Sirt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Fasting induced decrease in p53 acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Ramadori1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> was also reversed by inhibition of Sirt1 function, and Stat3 acetylation was insensitive to Sirt1 inhibition (data not shown). We next tested whether Sirt1 alters FoxO1 activity. For this purpose we used an assay that indirectly measures the amount of FoxO1 bound to a forkhead box DNA element immobilized in a 96-well plate. Inhibition of hypothalamic Sirt1 resulted in decreased binding of FoxO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

Since FoxO1 suppresses POMC transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Kim3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Kitamura1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, we tested whether FoxO1 was necessary for the regulation of POMC by Sirt1. Therefore, we knocked-down either Sirt1 or FoxO1 in AtT20 cells followed by a treatment with SA3. As expected, ACTH secretion was decreased upon SA3 treatment of the negative control siRNA-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). In the absence of SA3, siSirt1, or siFoxO1 did not lead to significant changes in POMC expression in this cell line, probably because of the basal level of POMC expression is not inhibited by FoxO1 under the culture conditions used. As shown for resveratrol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, the SA3-induced decrease in ACTH was Sirt1 dependent, since knock-down of Sirt1 abolished this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, in the presence of intact Sirt1, knock-down of FoxO1 was able to reverse the inhibitory effect of SA3 on POMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).

This conclusion is consistent with the observation that Sirt1 protein levels and activity were increasing in fasted mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Ramadori1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and rat hypothalamus. Several lines of evidence in our study demonstrate that the hypothalamic action of Sirt1 is to regulate food intake and body weight. First, the EX527 treated rats had decreased food intake and body weight gain. These animals' weight gain was less than their pair-fed counterparts suggesting that the decreased in weight gain was not exclusively due to the reduced food intake. Second, Sirt1 showed to regulate the expression of AgRP and POMC. The POMC derived peptide &#x003b1;-MSH decreases food intake, and promotes energy expenditure through melanocortin receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Kim4">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and activation of HPT axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Nillni2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. AgRP, on the other hand, is a strong antagonist of the melanocortin receptors, and blocks &#x003b1;-MSH action. Blocking the melanocortin receptors consistently abolished the decreased food intake and body weight gain in hypothalamic Sirt1 inhibited animals, showing that melanocortin receptors mediate the effect of Sirt1 on energy balance. Third, inhibition of hypothalamic Sirt1 resulted in increased levels of serum thyroid hormones, which are strong stimulators of basic metabolic rate and thermogenesis.</p><p>In the present work, we studied the acetylation and/or activity of two of the transcriptional regulators of POMC: Stat3 and FoxO1, both of which are shown to be Sirt1 substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Nie1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Daitoku1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Stat3 acetylation triggers its dimerization, DNA binding and thus transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Yuan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Since Stat3 is a positive regulator of POMC transcription, a potential deacetylation of Stat3 by Sirt1 might render Stat3 inactive, leading to POMC downregulation.

Deacetylation of FoxO1 by Sirt1 was shown to stimulate its DNA binding, and transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Frescas1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Daitoku1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Liu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Under our experimental conditions we could not detect any significant change in the acetylation of ARC Stat3 by fasting, inhibition of Sirt1, or leptin administration, working against the hypothesis that Sirt1 targets Stat3 in the hypothalamus. However, upon fasting, ARC FoxO1 acetylation decreases in a Sirt1 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), and Sirt1 cofactor NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Sirt1 protein levels increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g002">Figure 2</xref>), accounting for the increased Sirt1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g004">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Also, the fasting induced decrease in POMC expression and increase in AgRP expression were sensitive to Sirt1 enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Therefore we propose that by regulating melanocortin signaling, Sirt1 links nutrient availability to energy homeostasis at the hypothalamic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This effect is mediated, at least in part, by the fasting induced and Sirt1 mediated deacetylation of FoxO1, such that Sirt1 shifts FoxO1's activity to resist the stress of fasting.</p><fig id="pone-0008322-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008322.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Model depicting Sirt1 action in the hypothalamus.</title><p>Insulin and leptin activate PI3K, which in turn negatively regulates FoxO1 by phosphorylation.

Hypothalamic Sirt1 action also involves S6K signaling. Whether Sirt1 acts upstream of down-stream of mTOR remains to be established.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0008322.g006"/></fig><p>It was recently reported that Sirt1 and AMPK could activate each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Hou1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Lan1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Canto1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. If such an interaction is true in hypothalamic neurons as well, then AMPK might be mediating some of the effects of hypothalamic Sirt1 on energy balance. Randy Seeley's group recently challenged this possibility where they showed that central administration of resveratrol stimulated food intake in rats (Li et al., Resveratrol Regulates Food Intake and Glucose Homeostasis in the CNS, Endocrine Society's 91<sup>st</sup> Annual Meeting, Washington D.C. &#x0005b;P1-379&#x0005d;). They proposed that resveratrol induced food intake by activating AMPK via Sirt1 activation in the hypothalamus. Therefore, it is very likely that Sirt1 mediated regulation of food intake involves multiple pathways, and includes other metabolic sensors such as AMPK, or mTOR. Our results on the regulation of S6K signaling by Sirt1 are of particular importance. Activation of hypothalamic mTOR or increased expression of S6K in the mediobasal hypothalamus results in decreased feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Cota1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Blouet1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>; therefore, Sirt1 down-regulating S6K signaling fits our model on the regulation of energy balance by hypothalamic Sirt1. Fasting induced down-regulation of hypothalamic S6K signaling is reversed by leptin as well as by inhibition of Sirt1. The exact molecular mechanism of either regulation is not known yet. Leptin and Sirt1 might be following independent pathways to ultimately regulate S6K signaling. Alternatively, Sirt1 and leptin action might regulate a common mediator of energy balance, such as AMPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Inoki1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, which might then activate or inhibit the mTOR signaling according to the specific input. Future research will help to identify the complex regulation of metabolic sensors by hormonal signals for the ultimate regulation of energy homeostasis.</p><p>Inactivation of hypothalamic Sirt1 resulting in an anorectic phenotype might seem contradictory to some previous findings on Sirt1. For example, mice whose food was supplemented with resveratrol did not eat more than their control counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Lagouge1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is not known whether resveratrol taken orally will effectively reach all arcuate neurons. Resveratrol is also an activator of AMPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Dasgupta1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, which at the central level positively regulates food intake and body weight gain. However, resveratrol fed mice did not show increased food intake or body weight gain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Lagouge1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore very likely that the peripheral effects of resveratrol might compensate for the responses induced at the central level. Recently Ramadori <italic>et. al.</italic> reported that chronic central infusion of resveratrol did not alter food intake or AMPK activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Ramadori2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. While the latter result conflicts with previous findings on resveratrol and AMPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Dasgupta1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, our results from central SA3 infusions agrees with Ramadori <italic>et. al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Ramadori2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> such that the SA3 induced food intake is a short term response. It is possible that the acute (as reported here) versus chronic actions of hypothalamic Sirt1 might be different. Sirt1 overexpressing mice have been generated and their physiology has been examined. Although one study showed that Sirt1 overexpressing mice ate less than wild type animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Banks1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, two other studies reported these mice being hyperphagic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Pfluger1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008322-Bordone1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether the observed effects of Sirt1 over expression on food intake involve the hypothalamic Sirt1 action remains to be determined. In summary, our study establishes a physiological role for hypothalamic Sirt1. We propose that Sirt1 at the central level senses the nutritional status of the body and regulates hypothalamic central melanocortin signaling and S6K pathway to govern food intake and body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008322-g006">Figure 6</xref>).
