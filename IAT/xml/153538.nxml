Analysis of yeast Ppt1p could provide important clues to the function of PP5 and its homologs, however it has not yet been characterized at the biochemical or cellular level.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The specific activity of recombinant Ppt1p toward the artificial substrates <sup>32</sup>P-myelin basic protein (MBP) and <sup>32</sup>P-casein was similar to that of PP5. Dephosphorylation of <sup>32</sup>P-MBP, but not <sup>32</sup>P-casein, was stimulated by unsaturated fatty acids and by arachidoyl coenzyme A. Limited proteolysis of Ppt1p removed the TPR domain and abrogated lipid stimulation. The remaining catalytic fragment exhibited a two-fold increase in activity toward <sup>32</sup>P-MBP, but not <sup>32</sup>P-casein. Removal of the C terminus increased Ppt1p activity toward both substrates two fold, but did not prevent further stimulation of activity toward <sup>32</sup>P-MBP by lipid treatment. Ppt1p was localized throughout the cell including the nucleus. Levels of <italic>PPT1 </italic>mRNA and protein peaked in early log phase growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Many characteristics of Ppt1p are similar to those of PP5, including stimulation of phosphatase activity with some substrates by lipids, and peak expression during periods of rapid cell growth. Unlike PP5, however, proteolytic removal of the TPR domain or C-terminal truncation only modestly increased its activity. In addition, C-terminal truncation did not prevent further activation by lipid. This suggests that these regions play only a minor role in controlling its activity compared to PP5. Ppt1p is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating that it may function in multiple compartments. The observation that Ppt1p is most highly expressed during early log phase growth suggests that this enzyme is involved in cell growth or its expression is controlled by metabolic or nutritional signals.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mammalian protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) and its homolog protein phosphatase T1 (Ppt1p) from the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>contain a catalytic domain structurally related to the catalytic subunits of PP1, PP2A and PP2B, and an N-terminal domain consisting of multiple tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) not found in other members of this family of phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

However little is known about the regulation of PP5 or its specific role in these pathways, and only one physiological substrate for PP5 has been identified to date, the apoptosis signaling kinase ASK 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. PP5 can be activated by lipid <italic>in vitro</italic>, and removal of the TPR domain or the C terminus generates an active, lipid insensitive form of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. PP5 phosphatase activity is also altered by hCRY2 and a fragment of hsp90 <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These findings suggest that PP5 may be autoinhibited and that the binding of protein partners or lipids to the TPR domain could potentially control PP5 activity in cells, however no reports have yet documented how PP5 is regulated <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Thus, if Ppt1p has an essential function in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, more than one other phosphatase can also carry out this role. In this report we have characterized the activity of recombinant Ppt1p, analyzed its expression at the level of protein and mRNA, and localized Ppt1p in yeast. Ppt1p can be activated by lipid, is most highly expressed in early log phase growth, and is present throughout the cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Comparison of Ppt1p and PP5 activity and response to lipid treatment</title><p>Recombinant Ppt1p expressed as a GST-fusion protein, then affinity purified and released from GST by thrombin cleavage yielded a single band of the expected molecular weight, 58 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

We therefore tested whether a saturated fatty acyl coenzyme A ester could also stimulate Ppt1p. Ppt1p activity toward <sup>32</sup>P-MBP was stimulated by arachidoyl coenzyme A in a concentration range similar to that observed for AA, with half-maximal stimulation occurring at approximately 50 &#x003bc;M for arachidoyl coenzyme A and 75 &#x003bc;M for AA. However, in contrast to AA stimulation, Ppt1p activity dropped off sharply at 80 &#x003bc;M arachidoyl coenzyme A and higher. Similar results were observed for PP5 (data not shown). This suggests that double bonds are not required to observe the effect of fatty acyl coenzyme A esters.</p><p>Unlike PP5, the activity of Ppt1p toward <sup>32</sup>P-casein was not stimulated by AA, arachidoyl coenzyme A, or linoleoyl coenzyme A over a range in concentration from 10&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and data not shown). Other unsaturated fatty acids also failed to stimulate Ppt1p activity with this substrate (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These data indicate that Ppt1p is stimulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as by a saturated fatty acyl coenzyme A derivative, toward some but not all substrates dephosphorylated by PP5.</p></sec><sec><title>Limited proteolysis of Ppt1p</title><p>Removal of the TPR domain of PP5 by limited proteolysis increases enzyme activity and the TPR domain binds lipid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Using conditions similar to those employed with PP5, digestion of Ppt1p with trypsin in the absence of lipid produced a 44 kDa catalytic fragment that was stable for at least 30 min and a 20 kDa fragment that was degraded within 30 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). N-terminal sequence analysis showed that these fragments are derived from the catalytic and the TPR domains, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,2B</xref>). The crystal structure of the PP5 TPR domain revealed three TPRs followed by an extended &#x003b1; helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], however Ppt1p was originally proposed to contain one additional TPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The pattern of proteolysis and sites of cleavage for Ppt1p are very similar to those seen with PP5 under these same conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This indicates that Ppt1p also contains an accessible region linking the TPR and catalytic domains and is most consistent with the presence of three TPRs in Ppt1p. Limited tryptic proteolysis in the presence of 250 &#x003bc;M AA generated a distinct pattern of fragmentation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). A 20 kDa fragment was observed at early times, but a series of four fragments ranging from 14&#x02013;16 kDa appeared between 10 and 30 min as the amount of the 20 kDa fragment decreased. These fragments, which are derived from the TPR domain, were not observed in the absence of AA, suggesting that lipid binding alters the conformation of this domain and its susceptibility to proteolysis. A similar change in susceptibility to proteolysis upon lipid binding was observed with PP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As with PP5, only lipids that stimulated <sup>32</sup>P-MBP dephosphorylation slowed degradation of the 20 kDa TPR fragment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Limited proteolysis of Ppt1p and its effect on Ppt1p activity</bold>. (A) Recombinant Ppt1p samples trypsinized in the absence or presence of 250 &#x003bc;M AA were resolved by electrophoresis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie staining.

(C) Recombinant Ppt1p was digested using either trypsin (T) or subtilisin (S) for 5 minutes in the absence of AA and assayed using either <sup>32</sup>P-casein or <sup>32</sup>P-MBP in the absence of AA. Data are presented as activity relative to control, which is the activity of full-length Ppt1p subjected to mock digest and assayed in the absence of AA. Results represent the mean &#x000b1; S.E. from three or more independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-4-3-2"/></fig><p>Removal of the TPR domain from Ppt1p by trypsin treatment had no effect on its activity toward <sup>32</sup>P-casein, but increased activity toward <sup>32</sup>P-MBP approximately two fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). AA did not stimulate <sup>32</sup>P-MBP dephosphorylation by Ppt1p after removal of the TPR domain (data not shown). Thus, lipids that activate Ppt1p alter the sensitivity of the TPR domain to proteolysis, and removal of the TPR domain causes a loss of the response of Ppt1p to lipid. However, removal of the TPR domain only modestly increases Ppt1p activity, in contrast to the 5&#x02013;25 fold elevation reported after TPR removal from PP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that proteolyzed Ppt1p is unresponsive to lipid because it is unstable, the observations that the catalytic fragment remains undegraded and control activity is not decreased argue against this possibility. Alternatively, an inhibitory element in the linker region may remain after TPR domain removal.</p></sec><sec><title>The effect of C-terminal truncation on Ppt1p activity</title><p>Removal of 10&#x02013;13 residues from the C terminus of PP5 results in a highly active enzyme that is only modestly stimulated by lipid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To examine the role of the C terminus in controlling Ppt1p phosphatase activity, a similar truncation mutant, Ppt1p (1&#x02013;504), was expressed and characterized (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Compared to full-length enzyme Ppt1p (1&#x02013;504) exhibited a two-fold increase in control specific activity with both <sup>32</sup>P-casein and <sup>32</sup>P-MBP. Lipid did not stimulate Ppt1p (1&#x02013;504) toward <sup>32</sup>P-casein, but still increased activity with <sup>32</sup>P-MBP 12-fold. In contrast, C-terminal truncation of PP5 activates the enzyme as extensively as lipid treatment, and little further activation is seen with lipid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the case of PP5, subtilisin digestion removed both the TPR domain and the C terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The observation that C-terminal truncation increased Ppt1p activity toward both <sup>32</sup>P-casein and <sup>32</sup>P-MBP, but subtilisin digestion increased activity only toward <sup>32</sup>P-MBP (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) suggests that the C terminus of Ppt1p remained intact during subtilisin digestion. However, mass analysis of the subtilisin-derived catalytic fragment would be required to confirm this.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of C-terminal truncation on Ppt1p activity</bold>.

Both signals revealed specific localization of Spc42p-EGFP to the spindle pole body (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><p>When HA-Ppt1p or EGFP-Ppt1p was overexpressed from the <italic>GAL1 </italic>promoter in a centromeric or episomal plasmid, respectively, indirect immunofluorescence of HA-Ppt1p or direct fluorescence from EGFP-Ppt1p showed that both proteins were also localized throughout the cell.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>PP5 and its homologs in other species represent a subfamily of PPP enzymes distinguished by the presence of an N-terminal domain containing multiple TPR repeats. Ppt1p from the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>was the first homolog of mammalian PP5 to be described. Thus far, genetic approaches have not revealed functions for budding yeast Ppt1p. In this report, we have characterized Ppt1p activity <italic>in vitro </italic>and examined its expression.</p><p>In the case of mammalian PP5, results from lipid stimulation and binding, limited proteolysis and truncation studies taken together suggest the TPR domain and the C terminus inhibit PP5 activity in a coordinated manner and that lipid binding to the TPR domain activates the enzyme <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study we used assay conditions for Ppt1p identical to those in which PP5 was shown to be activated by removal of the TPR or C-terminal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Under these conditions Ppt1p is also stimulated by lipids toward <sup>32</sup>P-MBP, and activating lipids slow TPR domain proteolysis. These results indicate that Ppt1p has a similar domain structure to PP5 and is activated in a similar manner by lipid binding to the TPR domain. Removal of the TPR domain prevents stimulation by lipid, but only modestly increases Ppt1p activity. Carboxyl-terminal truncation modestly increases Ppt1p activity toward both <sup>32</sup>P-MBP and <sup>32</sup>P-casein, and does not prevent further lipid stimulation of <sup>32</sup>P-MBP dephosphorylation. These results distinguish Ppt1p from mammalian PP5 and suggest that the C terminus is less important in controlling Ppt1p activity. Although more work will be required to determine its role in lipid stimulation, removal of the TPR domain had only a small effect on Ppt1p activation. Ppt1p contains two short stretches of amino acids, a 15-residue sequence between the linker helix and the catalytic domain (residues 174&#x02013;188), and a ten-residue sequence just preceding the extreme C terminus (residues 474&#x02013;484), that are not found in other PP5 homologs reported thus far ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and accession numbers CAB60937, CAA17690 and AAD21727). The presence of these additional sequences in Ppt1p may underlie the differences in the responses of Ppt1p and PP5 to N or C-terminal truncation. Additional studies will be required to determine if our observations reflect structural and regulatory properties unique to Ppt1p.</p><p>Ppt1p and PP5 exhibit similar specific activities toward <sup>32</sup>P-casein in the absence of lipid. However Ppt1p activity toward this substrate was not stimulated by lipids. These results highlight the fact that PPP enzymes often exhibit substrate specific effects <italic>in vitro </italic>and that the use of a single substrate to study this family of enzymes can be misleading. Like PP5, the control activity of Ppt1p is low toward the commonly used artificial substrates such as <sup>32</sup>P-casein and <sup>32</sup>P-MBP compared to other PPP enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, it is not clear whether the selective lipid stimulation of Ppt1p toward <sup>32</sup>P-MBP reflects a substrate-directed effect, or whether <sup>32</sup>P-casein is simply a poor substrate for Ppt1p. Egloff and colleagues identified seven acidic surface residues on the catalytic face of PP1c &#x003b3; that are replaced by neutral or basic residues in PP2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. They suggest the presence of these acidic residues in PP1c &#x003b3; may explain why casein is a good substrate for PP2A, but not for PP1. Based on a sequence alignment with PP1c &#x003b3;, these seven acidic residues are not conserved in Ppt1p. Using the program Modeller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], a homology model of the catalytic domain of Ppt1p was built based on three PP1 structures &#x02013; PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org"/>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] codes 1FJM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], 1IT6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and 1JK7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This model shows that the catalytic face of Ppt1p is generally less acidic than that of PP1c &#x003b3; and does not indicate the presence of other acidic residues that could act in the same fashion as those on PP1c &#x003b3;. Thus the reason for low Ppt1p activity toward this acidic substrate may be more complex than can be explained by electrostatic repulsion.</p><p>Others have proposed that fatty acyl coenzyme A esters are potential physiologic regulators of PP5, since these compounds stimulate pNPP hydrolysis by PP5 <italic>in vitro </italic>at physiologically relevant concentrations and are approximately 10-fold more potent than their free fatty acid counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although we confirmed this observation using PP5 and pNPP (data not shown), in our hands similar levels of AA and arachidoyl coenzyme A were required for half-maximal stimulation of <sup>32</sup>P-MBP dephosphorylation in the case of both Ppt1p and PP5. Although more work is required to examine this issue thoroughly, our results suggest that the large differences in potency between free fatty acids and fatty acyl coenzyme A esters seen using pNPP may not extend to all protein substrates. In addition, it will be important to determine if lipids in any form play a role in the regulation of PP5 or Ppt1p <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Ppt1p was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. No difference in compartmentalization or staining intensity in cells was observed as a function of cell or bud size. This suggests that the level or localization of Ppt1p is not controlled as a function of cell cycle progression. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization have been reported for other PP5 homologs. In some cases, including <italic>P. falciparum </italic>and HeLa cells, nuclear staining appeared more intense than cytoplasmic staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Based on studies with heterologously expressed human PP5-GFP fusion proteins, it has been proposed that nuclear localization requires a stretch of sequence in the C terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, other sequences or signals are also likely to contribute to nuclear localization of PP5 and its homologs, since rat and mouse PP5, which are identical to human PP5 in this region do not appear to be nuclear in all cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition <italic>P. falciparum </italic>PP5 is primarily nuclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], although it is not well conserved in the relevant C-terminal region but contains a potential bipartite nuclear localization signal not found in other PP5 sequences reported thus far. The functional significance of differential localization is not known at this time.</p><p>Ppt1p levels are highest during periods of rapid growth and drop off when growth slows (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), raising the possibility that this enzyme may have a role in controlling cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and its expression may be regulated by a metabolic or nutritional signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The observation that Ppt1p levels rose and fell in parallel with mRNA levels suggests that Ppt1p expression is primarily controlled at the level of gene transcription. Studies of PP5 and its homologs in cultured cells and various organisms also suggest it may play a role in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] or during rapid cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ppt1p shares several biochemical properties with PP5 and other homologs, including a similar domain structure and stimulation by lipid <italic>in vitro</italic>. Unlike PP5, Ppt1p is not fully activated by removal of the TPR domain or by removal of 9 C-terminal residues, suggesting that these regions may not play an autoinhibitory role in Ppt1p. Ppt1p is expressed in early log phase growth and decreases dramatically as cells approach the stationary phase, suggesting that Ppt1p could play a role in cell growth or may be controlled by metabolic or nutritional signals. Like PP5, the observation that Ppt1p is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm implies that it may function in several subcellular compartments.</p><p>Although our findings suggest some differences may exist in regulatory properties of Ppt1p and PP5, many biochemical and cellular properties are shared. In addition a recent report has shown that Ppt1p is co-purified with Hsp82p and Hsc82p, the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>homologs of hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], indicating that Ppt1p and PP5 have at least one common protein partner and suggesting that, like PP5, Ppt1p functions in chaperone complexes. Thus, <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Ppt1p is likely to be a valuable model for probing the cellular role of PP5.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Promega or Gibco BRL.
