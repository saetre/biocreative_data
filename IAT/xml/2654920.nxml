Here we identify for the first time a multifunctional surface lipoprotein of <italic>B. recurrentis</italic>, termed HcpA, and demonstrate that it binds <underline>h</underline>uman <underline>c</underline>omplement regulators, Factor H, CFHR-1, and simultaneously, the host protease <underline>p</underline>lasminogen. Cell surface bound factor H was found to retain its activity and to confer resistance to complement attack. Moreover, ectopic expression of HcpA in a <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> B313 strain, deficient in Factor H binding proteins, protected the transformed spirochetes from complement-mediated killing. Furthermore, HcpA-bound plasminogen/plasmin endows <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> with the potential to resist opsonization and to degrade extracellular matrix components. Together, the present study underscores the high virulence potential of <italic>B. recurrentis</italic>. The elucidation of the molecular basis underlying the versatile strategies of <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> to escape innate immunity and to persist in human tissues, including the brain, may help to understand the pathological processes underlying louse-borne relapsing fever.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>B. recurrentis</italic>, the causative agent of louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is transmitted to humans, its reservoir host, by contamination of abraded skin with either hemolymph or feces of an infected human body louse (<italic>Pediculus humanus humanus</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Scott1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Houhamdi1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The last century has seen multiple epidemics of LBRF in Europe, with high mortality rates up to 40&#x00025;. However, currently epidemic outbreaks of LBRF are only reported from Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Sundnes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Raoult1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. LBRF is a systemic inflammatory disease, characterized by one to five relapses of fever and a massive spirochetemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Cutler1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. If treated with antibiotics, the mortality is reduced to 2&#x02013;6&#x00025;, however, patients often suffer from Jarish-Herxheimer reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Southern1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to survive in human tissues, including the blood, <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> has to escape innate and adaptive immune defence processes. Complement acts as an important part of host innate immunity, which is essential for recognition and elimination of microbes. However, pathogenic organisms can evade complement attack that is either mediated by the acquisition of host regulators to the surface of the pathogen or by expression of endogenous complement regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Zipfel1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. An increasing number of pathogenic microbes utilize host complement regulators for immune evasion and for down-regulation of complement activation. In fact we and others have recently demonstrated that tick-borne pathogens, <italic>B. hermsii</italic> and <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, are able to bind complement regulatory proteins, i.e. factor H (CFH), CFH-like protein 1 (CFHL-1) and CFH-related protein 1 (CFHR-1), via their surface lipoproteins CRASP-1, thereby conferring resistance to complement attack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Rossmann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Rossmann2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Kraiczy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Kraiczy2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Brooks1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Surface bound CFH controls complement activation by accelerating the decay of the C3 convertase of the alternative pathway and by inactivating newly formed C3b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Pangburn1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Kuhn1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. CFH represents the main human fluid phase regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation and belongs to the factor H protein family, consisting of seven structurally related proteins in humans, including Factor H-related proteins (CFHRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Zipfel2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. All factor H protein family members are composed of short consensus repeats (SCRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Skerka1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Among those, CFHR-1 was recently shown to inhibit complement activation by interfering with C5 convertase and terminal complex formation (unpublished data).</p><p>Another common strategy of pathogens to circumvent the immune system and to persist is based on their capability to exploit host plasma derived proteases, in particular human plasminogen/plasmin (PLG) in order to breach tissue barriers. Recently, we have identified and characterized a number of PLG-binding outer surface lipoproteins in related spirochetes, including <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and <italic>B. hermsii</italic>. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> was shown to bind PLG via a multitude of lipoproteins, such as CRASP-3 (ErpP), CRASP-4 (ErpC), CRASP-5 (ErpA), OspA and as yet to be defined molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Fuchs1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Brissette1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>B. hermsii</italic>, on the other hand, was found to interact with PLG via a 21-kDa lipoprotein, which also binds CFH via distinct, non-overlapping domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Rossmann2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Surface bound PLG is subsequently processed via urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) to active plasmin, a broad-spectrum serine protease, capable of degrading constituents of the extracellular matrix and basement membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Coleman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Grab1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that surface-bound PLG retains its proteolytic activity, even in the presence of serum inhibitors, suggests this process as a suitable means of pathogens to readily disseminate and to persist in the host.</p><p>CFH- and C4b-binding proteins of <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Meri1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, but so far these proteins have not been isolated. Here we provide evidence that <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> express a novel multifunctional surface lipoprotein, which by exploiting host proteins confers resistance to both, complement attack and opsonization and simultaneously acquires an increased potential to invade host tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>Relapsing fever spirochetes <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> strain A1 and A17, <italic>B. hermsii</italic> (ATCC35209) strain HS1 and the Lyme disease spirochete <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> strain B313, which is a clonal mutant of B31 lacking all linear and circular plasmids with the exception of cp32-1, cp32-2, cp32-4, cp26 and lp17, were cultivated in BSK-H complete medium (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 5&#x00025; rabbit serum (Cell Concept, Freiburg, Germany) at 30&#x000b0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Zuckert1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

CFH and CFHR-1 only bound to full-length HcpA, but not to any of the deletion mutants. This indicates that long-range intramolecular interactions are involved in the formation of the CFH and CFHR-1 binding site rather than linear peptide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004858-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Furthermore, full-length and mutant HcpA proteins were analyzed for binding of human PLG using ELISA. Full-length HcpA (residues 18 to 175) as well as the truncated versions bound PLG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004858-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), thus indicating that the binding site for PLG is localized to the central domain of HcpA. Together, these data suggest that CFH and PLG bind to distinct, non-overlapping domains of the HcpA molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004858-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). To verify this assumption, competition assays were performed using immobilized HcpA and increasing amounts of PLG or CFH (up to 100 &#x000b5;g/ml) in combination with constant amounts of CFH (2 &#x000b5;g/ml) or PLG (10 &#x000b5;g/ml), respectively.

Vice versa, using up to 100 &#x000b5;g/ml of CFH no inhibition of PLG binding to HcpA could be observed.</p><p>To map the binding domain of CFH that interacts with HcpA, recombinant deletion constructs of CFH representing SCRs 8-10, SCRs 15-10, SCRs 19-20, and SCRs 1-7/FHL-1 were employed.

Construct CFHL-1 (CFH<sub>SCR1-7</sub>) did not bind to HcpA, indicating that the most C-terminal domains (SCR19-20) of CFH are involved in binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004858-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

Recombinant HcpA specifically binds CFH and/or CFHR-1 and in addition plasminogen, however via different binding domains. The CFH binding site of HcpA was determined by using mutants with either N-terminal (HcpA<sub>48-175</sub>, HcpA<sub>78-175</sub>) or C-terminal (HcpA<sub>18-145</sub>, HcpA<sub>18-115</sub>) truncations. All mutant of HcpA caused complete abrogation of CFH binding. These data suggest that the determinants required for CFH binding are defined by conformation rather than contiguous linear elements. This finding is reminiscent of the observed CFH binding capabilities for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> BbCRASP-1 and BbCRASP-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Kraiczy2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Kraiczy5">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Hovis1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Hovis2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, binding of PLG to HcpA was not affected by any of the indicated truncations of the HcpA protein, demonstrating that PLG and CFH interact with distinct HcpA domains and suggest that both host proteins can bind simultaneously to HcpA. This assumption is supported by our findings that PLG and CFH bind independently and coordinately to immobilized HcpA and do not compete with each other. Due to the efficient concurrent binding of CFH and PLG to immobilized HcpA it is to be expected that both host proteins similarly bind to HcpA expressed on the outer surface of <italic>B. recurrentis</italic>. Further studies are needed to elucidate the possibility that binding of CFH and PLG to the surface of <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> may be involved in certain pathologies of the central nervous system.</p><p>Plasma adsorption experiments and surface plasmon resonance analyses clearly demonstrate that binding of CFH to HcpA is exclusively associated with its C-terminal domain, SCR20. This finding is further substantiated by the fact that HcpA bound CFHR-1, another member of the factor H family that exhibits an almost identical (97&#x00025;) C-terminal short consensus repeat domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Zipfel1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the ability of the pathogen to coordinately bind CFH and/or CFHR-1 to HcpA most probably adds to the virulence of <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> by establishing its resistance to complement attack, even under conditions when the human complement regulators are differentially regulated.</p><p>Most recently, it was demonstrated that CFHR-1 is an inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway that binds to C3b, inhibits the C5 convertase activity and interferes with C5b surface deposition and membrane attack complex formation (Heinen et al., unpublished). In this context it is of interest that HcpA is also capable of binding another member of the factor H family, i.e. CFHR-2, whose function is yet to be disclosed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Zipfel1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The present data show that HcpA-bound CFH retains its regulatory capacity and controls both C3b deposition and C3-convertase activity, resulting in enhanced complement regulatory activity. This process is expected to increase resistance of louse-borne relapsing fever spirochetes to complement attack, an assumption supported by our previous findings with <italic>B. hermsii</italic>.</p><p>There is ample evidence suggesting that binding of PLG to bacterial surfaces, including spirochetes, is critical for their invasive potential and persistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Rossmann2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Fuchs1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Gebbia1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> binds PLG and upon processing to enzymatically active plasmin by human uPA the surface bound protease is shown to degrade the physiological substrate fibrinogen.

The finding that in accordance to the related Lyme disease spirochetes, <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> bind PLG and can disseminate from the blood to many distant organs, including the brain, supports the assumption that similar mechanisms could be involved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Hovis2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It was recently shown that <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> employs host plasmin to degrade both, surface-bound IgG as well as C3b, and thereby confers resistance to innate and adaptive immune defense processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004858-Rooijakkers1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Our corresponding finding that HcpA bound plasmin leads to a decrease of C3b molecules on the surface of <italic>B. recurrentis</italic> may represent a novel mechanism, by which spirochetes interfere with C3b deposition on their cell surface and moreover could escape phagocytosis. In line with this assumption, transformed <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> B313/pBR cells exhibit a significant reduction of C3b molecules deposited on their surface as compared to the parental <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> B313 strain.
