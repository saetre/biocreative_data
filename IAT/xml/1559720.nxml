For many bacterial infections, cytokine dysregulation is one of the contributing factors to the severe clinical outcomes in the susceptible hosts.

In this study, we compared the innate IFN-&#x003b3; response to <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>between the C57BL/6 and BALB/c splenocytes and characterized the hyperproduction of IFN-&#x003b3; in the relatively susceptible BALB/c mice <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Na&#x000ef;ve BALB/c splenocytes were found to produce more IFN-&#x003b3; in response to live bacterial infection compared to C57BL/6 splenocytes.

Although anti-Gr-1 depletion substantially reduced the IFN-&#x003b3; response, this was not due to the contribution of Gr-1<sup>high</sup>, Ly-6G expressing neutrophils. We found no differences in the cell types making IFN-&#x003b3; between BALB/c and C57BL/6 splenocytes. Although IL-12 is essential for the IFN-&#x003b3; response, BALB/c and C57BL/6 splenocytes made similar amounts of IL-12 after infection. However, BALB/c splenocytes produced higher proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-18 than C57BL/6 splenocytes after infection with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Higher percentages of Gr-1 expressing NK and T cells, poorer ability in controlling bacteria growth, and higher IL-18 could be the factors contributing to IFN-&#x003b3; hyperproduction in BALB/c mice.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei </italic>is the causative agent for melioidosis, an infectious disease endemic in South-east Asia and northern Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It has also been increasingly reported in other tropical and subtropical regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The bacillus is a facultative intracellular microbe and can invade and replicate in many different organs. Infection can result in a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from an asymptomatic state, benign pulmonitis, acute or chronic pneumonia, and to fulminant septicemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, even after the apparent resolution of acute symptoms, the infection can persist for decades as a chronic and latent condition where relapse is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, severe melioidosis with acute septicemia is associated with a high mortality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In severe melioidosis, patients exhibit elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and IFN-&#x003b3; induced chemokines IP-10 and MIG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Murine models of acute melioidosis mimic human pathology. mRNA for proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-6 were detected earlier and in more abundance in the organs of BALB/c mice with acute disease than the more resistant C57BL/6 mice when they were infected intravenously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We had previously established an intranasal murine model where BALB/c mice were susceptible while C57BL/6 mice were relatively more resistant to disease. We found high transient levels of IFN-&#x003b3; both locally and systemically in susceptible mice, which exhibit acute disease followed by death within a week after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The high levels of IFN-&#x003b3; correlated with high bacterial loads in the organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In another study, administering CpG DNA prior to bacterial challenge could attenuate hyperproduction of IFN-&#x003b3; in serum of BALB/c mice while lowering the bacterial load in the blood at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. So although IFN-&#x003b3; was shown to be critical in host survival in the first 24 h after infection as neutralizing antibodies against IFN-&#x003b3; lowered the LD<sub>50 </sub>by approximately 100, 000 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], hyperproduction could contribute to immune pathology and severe disease. We are interested in comparing the innate IFN-&#x003b3; response to <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, and in characterizing the hyperproduction of IFN-&#x003b3; in BALB/c through the <italic>in vitro </italic>stimulation of na&#x000ef;ve splenocytes with heat-killed or live bacteria. We found that na&#x000ef;ve BALB/c splenocytes consistently produce more IFN-&#x003b3; in response to live bacterial infection compared to C57BL/6 splenocytes. Through various comparisons between BALB/c and C57BL/6 splenocytes, factors which could contribute to the hyperproduction of IFN-&#x003b3; in BALB/c splenocytes are discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>BALB/c and C57BL/6 splenocytes produce IFN-&#x003b3; when stimulated with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic></title><p>It had been previously reported that splenocytes from na&#x000ef;ve animals could produce IFN-&#x003b3; in response to gamma irradiated <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In order to further characterize the IFN-&#x003b3; response of BALB/c and C57BL/6 to <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, we determine if na&#x000ef;ve splenocytes from these mice could produce IFN-&#x003b3; when infected with bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic>. Under optimal bacteria to cell ratio, we found that na&#x000ef;ve splenocytes produced high amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; with heat-killed and live <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, detectable by 12 h (data not shown) and at 24 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Although there were individual variances from mouse to mouse, na&#x000ef;ve BALB/c splenocytes consistently produced more IFN-&#x003b3; in response to live <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>compared to those from C57BL/6 mice whereas na&#x000ef;ve C57BL/6 splenocytes produced significantly higher IFN-&#x003b3; than BALB/c splenocytes when treated with heat-killed bacteria. Thus, the pattern of IFN-&#x003b3; production to live bacteria mimics the infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since higher IFN-&#x003b3; production in na&#x000ef;ve BALB/c splenocytes upon live bacterial infection <italic>in vitro </italic>could not have resulted from increased infiltration of cell-types from elsewhere, we tested the possibility that na&#x000ef;ve BALB/c splenocytes produce more IFN-&#x003b3; in response to live bacteria due to a poorer ability to control bacterial replication, leading to a higher bacterial load. We found no difference in the total bacteria counts between BALB/c and C57BL/6 splenocytes at 4 h after infection in three separate experiments. The mean intracellular bacterial loads of splenocytes from three animals were higher in BALB/c (1.06 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>CFU) than C57BL/6 (7.77 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>CFU) at 4 h after infection, reaching a statistical significant value with p &#x0003c; 0.05, although the difference did not reach statistical significance in one out of the three separate experiments. Each experiment on either total or intracellular bacterial counts involves splenocytes from six animals, three from each inbred strain. Intracellular bacterial loads at later time-points were inconsistent and unreliable probably due to increasing cell death. Cell viability at various time points after infection was also determined to confirm that the differential response was not contributed by difference in cell viability after infection. Infection of cells did not affect the viability at 5 and 10 h post infection, but showed a &#x0003e; 50% reduction at 24 h post-infection, as compared to the uninfected control splenocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). However, no differences in the percentages of cell viability between infected BALB/c and C57BL/6 splenocytes were detected even at 24 h post-infection.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Differential IFN-&#x003b3; response of BALB/c and C57BL/6 splenocytes to heat-killed and live <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>stimulation</bold>.

Since na&#x000ef;ve BALB/c splenocytes showed a higher IFN-&#x003b3; response compared to na&#x000ef;ve C57BL/6 splenocytes when infected <italic>in vitro </italic>with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, we determine if there are similar differences in other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Our results show that <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>induced significantly higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), IL-1&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and IL-6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) at 24 h in na&#x000ef;ve BALB/c than C57BL/6 splenocytes. There was no difference in IL-12 amounts in the infected splenocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). We were unable to detect an increase in IL-18 upon bacterial stimulation due to a constitutively high background although BALB/c still made more IL-18 than C57BL/6 splenocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was detected after infection of splenocytes from both strains of mice, with BALB/c producing a significantly higher amount of IL-10 as compared to C57BL/6, although dead bacteria did not induce much IL-10 from both (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). In response to heat-killed bacteria, BALB/c splenocytes produced more IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, but significantly less IL-12 when compared to C57BL/6 splenocytes. Thus, it appears that the higher IFN-&#x003b3; response seen in C57BL/6 to dead bacteria correlated with higher IL-12 levels.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cytokine responses of BALB/c and C57BL/6 splenocytes to <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>infection</bold>.

To confirm the role of IL-12 and IL-18 in <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>induced IFN-&#x003b3; response, neutralizing antibodies against IL-12 and IL-18 were used. Addition of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of neutralizing IL-12 antibodies could completely abrogate the production of IFN-&#x003b3; by BALB/c splenocytes to live bacteria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Neutralizing IL-18 antibodies partially lowered the amount of IFN-&#x003b3;. The isotype control antibodies had no effect on IFN-&#x003b3;. Furthermore, the dependence on IL-12 and IL-18 in the IFN-&#x003b3; response was specific for bacterial stimulation, and not for PMA and ionomycin (data not shown). As splenocytes from both mouse strains make IL-10, which can be antagonistic to IFN-&#x003b3;, we depleted IL-10 using neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibodies. Neutralizing anti-IL-10 increased the production of IFN-&#x003b3; to more than 1.5 fold compared to the control. Similar results were observed when these neutralizing antibodies were used for infected C57BL/6 splenocytes, although the amount of IFN-&#x003b3; induced by live <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>was much lower (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The effects of cytokine neutralizing antibodies on the production of IFN-&#x003b3;</bold>.

In agreement with what others had found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], our results show that T and NK cells were the major cells making IFN-&#x003b3; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The IFN-&#x003b3; capture assay also reveals Gr-1<sup>intermediate </sup>cells making IFN-&#x003b3;. We also performed depletion of various cell types from bulk splenocytes. Only data for BALB/c mice are shown as results from both mouse strains are similar (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Percentage of depletion for Gr-1<sup>high</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+ </sup>and DX5<sup>+ </sup>was at least &#x0003e; 85% as determined by flow cytometry. Depletion of B cells had no effect on IFN-&#x003b3; production (data not shown). However, depletion of Gr-1<sup>high </sup>cells, which depleted a significant proportion of Gr-1<sup>intermediate </sup>cells as well, reduced IFN-&#x003b3; production drastically both at 12 h (data not shown) and 24 h after stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). NK cells and CD4 T cells also contributed significantly to IFN-&#x003b3; production. As Gr-1<sup>high </sup>cells were generally associated with granulocytes such as neutrophils, although other cell types also expressed Gr-1 with varying intensity, we depleted the cultures with Ly-6G antibodies to specifically deplete the neutrophils. Depletion with Ly-6G does not have much effect on IFN-&#x003b3; production. Depletions had no effect on IFN-&#x003b3; production in response to PMA and ionomycin, demonstrating that the depletion procedures did not incapacitate the cells. Given that IL-12 is essential for the induction of IFN-&#x003b3;, the reduction of IFN-&#x003b3; could be due to a depletion of IL-12 producing populations. To exclude the possibility, we found that depletion of various cell types did not significantly abolish the IL-12 in the supernatant in response to stimulations with heat-killed and live bacteria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>IFN-&#x003b3; production by BALB/c and C57BL/6 splenocytes as measured by the IFN-&#x003b3; capture assay</bold>.

We found that the positively selected Ly-6G<sup>+ </sup>cells, representing the neutrophils, were only able to make very low amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; in the presence of IL-12 and bacteria (data not shown), which explains why their depletion did not make much difference to the total IFN-&#x003b3; produced. We next isolated human neutrophils from peripheral blood to test if they could make IFN-&#x003b3;. We found that neutrophil preparations varied in their ability to make IFN-&#x003b3; depending on the presence of contaminating cell-types such as T lymphocytes.

However, when stimulated with heat-killed bacteria, this trend is reversed. C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice have generally been classified as high and low IFN-&#x003b3; responders respectively to account for their innate resistance and susceptibility to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In response to heat-killed bacteria, C57BL/6 splenocytes indeed made more IFN-&#x003b3; than BALB/c, conforming to this model likely through the significantly higher IL-12 production.</p><p>We showed that BALB/c splenocytes were poorer in controlling bacterial infection. This would agree with <italic>in vivo </italic>data suggesting that high bacterial loads lead to hyperproduction of IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It had been reported that peritoneal cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice were more potent at microbicidal activity against <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>compared to those from BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, higher IFN-&#x003b3; observed in <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>infected BALB/c than C57BL/6 splenocytes was not due to difference in the cell viability from the two strains of mice, although there could be more subtle damages to cells which the XTT assay failed to detect.</p><p>Although IL-12 is absolutely essential for IFN-&#x003b3; production, we found that the higher IFN-&#x003b3; production did not result directly from higher IL-12 concentrations in BALB/c when stimulated with live bacteria. In fact, BALB/c cells made more IL-10, abrogation of which increased IFN-&#x003b3; production. This means that IL-12 concentration is not limiting and differences in IL-10 concentrations between the mouse strains are not big enough to tip the balance in IFN-&#x003b3; production. IL-10 and IFN-&#x003b3; are antagonistic to each another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. IL-10 can inhibit IFN-&#x003b3; production by NK cells in the presence of antigen presenting cells (APCs) through the inhibition of IL-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This could explain why we did not see higher IL-12 level in BALB/c mice, and it also implies that co-stimulatory factors other than IL-12 (such as IL-15 and IL-18) were involved in IFN-&#x003b3; response to <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Since only live but not dead bacteria induced IL-10, this suggests that <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>possess active mechanisms to trigger IL-10 production. It is possible that the high IL-10 seen in BALB/c in response to live bacteria could be a consequence of the immune system trying to counteract and suppress the increasing inflammation.</p><p>We did not find any obvious differences in the cell types making IFN-&#x003b3; between BALB/c and C57BL/6 splenocytes. However, BALB/c splenocytes contained more Gr-1<sup>high </sup>and Gr-1<sup>intermediate </sup>cells, as well as NK cells. As NK cells are major IFN-&#x003b3; producers in innate immunity, this translates to more IFN-&#x003b3;. Although depletion of CD8 T cells did not affect IFN-&#x003b3; production, CD8 T cells could produce IFN-&#x003b3; in response to <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>as examined by the IFN-&#x003b3; capture assay (data not shown) and as shown by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is possible that the CD8 depletion from the bulk population also relieves a suppressive effect on the other cells making IFN-&#x003b3;. The other explanation is they contribute only little in terms of quantity to the total amount so when they were depleted, the remaining population was enriched for the other cells making IFN-&#x003b3;. In addition, we found that Gr-1<sup>intermediate </sup>cells contributed to the IFN-&#x003b3; response. BALB/c splenocytes had higher numbers of Gr-1<sup>intermediate </sup>expressing CD8 T cells and NK cells compared to C57BL/6 and could explain why BALB/c cells made more IFN-&#x003b3;. This apparently requires a live bacterial infection because although the same cells made IFN-&#x003b3; in response to dead bacteria, they did not contribute to a higher response in BALB/c. A live infection allows for various pathogenic mechanisms of the bacteria, including the Type III secretion systems (TTSS), to operate. This may be necessary to allow for continual activation of cells or other factors such as IL-15 which could act as a co-stimulus for NK cells to make IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and IL-27 which could act as a co-stimulus for T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] to induce a high IFN-&#x003b3; response. Live bacteria could also induce caspase-1 activation in macrophages, leading to secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. As BALB/c splenocytes constitutively produced more IL-18 than C57BL/6, and IL-18 is at least partially required for IFN-&#x003b3;, this could be an additional factor that contributes to the hyperproduction of IFN-&#x003b3; in BALB/c splenocytes.</p><p>Several published studies employ Gr-1 antibodies to deplete neutrophils <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In our cell depletion studies, anti-Gr-1 depletion significantly reduced IFN-&#x003b3; production. However, since the anti-Gr-1 antibody recognizes both Ly-6G and Ly-6C markers and are not exclusive for neutrophils, we excluded the involvement of neutrophils through depletion of Ly-6G<sup>+ </sup>cells. Ly-6G is found almost exclusively on neutrophils and represents the Gr-1<sup>high </sup>cells. This means that the Gr-1 antibody is depleting other cell-types expressing Ly-6C or the Gr-1<sup>intermediate </sup>cells. Haque <italic>et al</italic>. had recently shown F4/80 macrophages to be producing IFN-&#x003b3; during <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>infection <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We did not further characterize the Gr-1<sup>intermediate </sup>population making IFN-&#x003b3;, but we did find the expression of Gr-1<sup>intermediate </sup>on T cells and NK cells, which likely express Ly-6C as Ly-6G is not found on these cells. Others had shown that Ly-6C expressing NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and CD8<sup>+ </sup>CD44<sup>hi </sup>Gr-1<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] make IFN-&#x003b3;. As BALB/c splenocytes contained more NK cells and Gr-1 expressing NK and T cells, this could be a factor contributing to higher IFN-&#x003b3; production upon live bacterial encounter. Furthermore, we found that highly purified neutrophils make very little IFN-&#x003b3; even in the presence of IL-12 and IL-18 and minute numbers of contaminating lymphocytes in neutrophil preparations could contribute to the IFN-&#x003b3; effect. Thus, it is imperative for studies examining the production of IFN-&#x003b3; by neutrophils to use highly purified neutrophils and to exclude the contribution of contaminating cell-types. In fact, Schleicher <italic>et al </italic>recently found that minute numbers of contaminating CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells or CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>NK cells are the source of IFN-&#x003b3; in IL-12/IL-18-stimulated mouse macrophage populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This highlights the need for caution in interpreting data due to the possible presence of minute numbers of contaminating but high IFN-&#x003b3; producing cells.</p><p>It has been reported that IL-18 could induce neutrophilia in mice by acting on macrophages to produce IL-6, which in turn causes neutrophilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, the constitutively high IL-18 in BALB/c mice likely contributes to more neutrophils present in BALB/c splenocytes. Furthermore, addition of IL-18 to splenocytes in culture induced the production of GM-CSF, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. As susceptible BALB/c mice show hyper-inflammation upon infection and succumb to acute disease, this seems to parallel patients with acute melioidosis who exhibit hyper-inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. As the most prominent risk factor for melioidosis is diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], our studies in the susceptible mouse strain may have implication on the immune condition of diabetic individuals such as constitutive inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] which predisposes them to acute disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>An active infection is required to induce a hyperproduction of IFN-&#x003b3; in BALB/c compared to C57BL/6 splenocytes. The higher production of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and IL-18, and the presence of more neutrophils contribute to a more intense inflammation seen in BALB/c splenocytes. The higher intracellular bacterial loads in BALB/c splenocytes likely contribute to more inflammation. Furthermore, the higher numbers of NK cells and Gr-1<sup>intermediate </sup>expressing cells in BALB/c splenocytes also contribute to more IFN-&#x003b3;. Future investigations into how each cell population interacts with live bacteria could shed more light on the control of inflammation in the different mouse strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>Virulent <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei </italic>strain KHW used in this study is a local clinical isolate from a fatal case of melioidosis in Singapore.
