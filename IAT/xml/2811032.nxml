Irrespective of their physical organization, each precursor tRNA contains extra sequences at both the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends that are removed to generate a mature, functional tRNA. Either RNase E or RNase P are required for the separation of tRNAs that are transcribed as part of polycistronic transcripts to generate pre-tRNAs that become substrates for RNase P, which cleaves them endonucleolytically to generate the mature 5&#x02032; termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>While 5&#x02032;-end processing of all tRNAs has been shown to be catalyzed by only endonucleases, 3&#x02032;-end maturation is believed to be a multistep process involving both endo- and exoribonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). For example, for tRNA transcripts terminating with a Rho-independent transcription terminator, an initial endonucleolytic cleavage can remove the stem-loop followed by exonucleolytic trimming to generate the mature 3&#x02032; terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). In contrast, 3&#x02032;-end processing can be all exonucleolytic for tRNA transcripts that are terminated in a Rho-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Of the eight known 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exoribonucleases in <italic>E. coli</italic>, RNase T and RNase PH are the most important for final 3&#x02032;-end maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), a major 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exoribonuclease encoded by <italic>pnp</italic> gene, has only been shown to be involved in shortening of long 3&#x02032; trailer sequences (&#x0003e;15 nt) generated after intergenic endonucleolytic cleavages of polycistronic tRNA operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) or Rho-dependent transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Thus, although PNPase plays a significant role in the processing and degradation of a variety of RNA species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), its role in tRNA processing and maturation has been thought to be minimal.</p><p>Of the eight leucine tRNA genes encoded in <italic>E. coli</italic>, seven are part of five different polycistronic operons that depend on either RNase E or RNase P or both for initial processing and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>). Here we describe a unique processing pathway for the eighth leucine tRNA, <italic>leuX</italic> that encodes tRNA<sup>Leu5</sup>. Specifically, PNPase initiates processing by removing the the Rho-independent transcription terminator and stops 1&#x02013;3 nt downstream of the CCA determinant. This is the first <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstration of processing of an RNA substrate containing a stem-loop structure by PNPase, even though the enzyme has been shown to be inhibited by such structures <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Endonucleases such as RNase E, RNase G, RNase LS or RNase Z are not involved. Our data further show that RNase P, the endonuclease responsible for generating mature 5&#x02032; termini, also removes the terminator from &#x0223c;10% of primary transcripts by cleaving 4&#x02013;7 nt downstream of the CCA determinant, generating substrates for RNase II, which removes an additional 3&#x02013;4 nt. Subsequently, RNase T completes the 3&#x02032; maturation process by removing the last 1&#x02013;3 nt downstream of the CCA determinant left by either PNPase or RNase II.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this study were all derived from MG1693 (<italic>thyA715</italic>) (<italic>E. coli</italic> Genetic Stock Center, Yale University).

PNPase degrades the 3&#x02032; <italic>leuX</italic> trailer sequences that include the Rho-independent transcription terminator but stops 1&#x02013;3 nt downstream of the CCA terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Alternatively, terminators from &#x0223c;10% of the primary transcripts are removed by RNase P cleavage at 4&#x02013;7 nt downstream of the CCA terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). RNase II cleaves the extra nucleotides at the 3&#x02032;-end of the RNase P processed transcripts to within 1&#x02013;3 nt of the CCA terminus. Finally, RNase T removes the last 1&#x02013;3 nt to generate the mature 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). All the pre-tRNAs, whether they are generated by PNPase or RNase P, have their 5&#x02032; termini matured by RNase P. Furthermore, terminator removal precedes 5&#x02032; processing. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Processing pathways for tRNA<sup>Leu5</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic>. PNPase initiates the processing by removing the 3&#x02032; trailer sequences that include the Rho-independent transcription terminator up to 1&#x02013;3 nt downstream of the CCA terminus. Alternatively, RNase P removes the terminator of &#x0223c;10% of the transcripts by cleaving at 4&#x02013;7 nt downstream of the CCA terminus. The RNase P cleavage intermediates are substrates for RNase II, which removes 3&#x02013;4 additional nucleotides. Subsequently, the 5&#x02032;-end is matured by RNase P and the 3&#x02032;-end is matured, primarily by the activity of RNase T. However, RNase PH, RNase D, RNase BN and RNase II may substitute in the absence of RNase T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp997f7"/></fig></p><p>There are a number of features that make this tRNA processing pathway very unusual. In the first place, since the Rho-independent terminators associated with tRNA transcripts are usually removed endonucleolytically, by either RNase E or RNase G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>), it was unexpected that the <italic>leuX</italic> terminator was degraded primarily by a 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease, PNPase. However, the &#x0223c;10-fold increase in the steady-state level and an almost 10-fold increase in the half-life of the full-length transcript in the <italic>&#x00394;pnp</italic> strain clearly demonstrated the requirement of PNPase for terminator removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, the cloning and sequencing of <italic>leuX</italic> species from a <italic>&#x00394;pnp</italic> strain confirmed the presence of significantly more transcripts with intact terminators compared to the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), while the data derived from the <italic>rnpA49</italic> strains showed that the majority of the PNPase processed species contained an extra 3 nt downstream of the CCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, while the <italic>leuX</italic> terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C) has a relatively low predicted free energy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), the sequencing of over 250 <italic>leuX</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) demonstrated that this structure functions very efficiently <italic>in vivo.</italic></p><p>Thus, our data represent the first documented example of PNPase degrading through a region of double-stranded RNA <italic>in vivo.</italic> Although PNPase has been shown to be involved in the removal of Rho-dependent transcription terminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), its ability to degrade the <italic>leuX</italic> terminator without significant assistance from multiple rounds of polyadenylation of the substrate or through the unwinding activity of the RhlB RNA helicase was surprising because the enzyme is generally inhibited by secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, since the thermodynamic stability of the 7 bp <italic>leuX</italic> stem-loop, which only contains four G/C base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), is relatively low, there may not be a requirement for the unwinding activity of RhlB RNA helicase. In fact, our <italic>in vivo</italic> observations are consistent with previous <italic>in vitro</italic> data showing that stem-loops containing five G/C base pairs are not effective barriers against PNPase degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Furthermore, Blum <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) demonstrated that PNPase could not efficiently degrade the <italic>lpp</italic> Rho-independent transcription terminator (containing a 13 bp stem that includes six G/C base pairs) <italic>in vitro</italic> unless a poly(A) tail longer than five nt was added. Thus, the need for 3&#x02032; polyadenylation may be minimized by the presence of 6&#x02013;8 nt single-stranded region following the <italic>leuX</italic> stem-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C).</p><p>Another interesting feature of this pathway relates to the requirement of RNase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lane 2). Many transcripts ended 4&#x02013;7 nt downstream of the encoded CCA in the RNase II deficient strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) even though PNPase levels are increased 2&#x02013;3-fold in this genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Since PNPase had no difficulty in degrading through the stem-loop structure of the terminator, there was no reason to believe that it stopped at 4&#x02013;7 nt downstream of the encoded CCA in the absence of RNase II, particularly since most of the immature 3&#x02032; termini in the RNase P deficient strains were mapped at 1&#x02013;3 nt downstream of the CCA terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, a large drop in the RQ and PF of the mature tRNA and the dramatic increase in the half-life of the primary transcript in the <italic>&#x00394;pnp rnpA49</italic> strain compared to the <italic>&#x00394;pnp</italic> single mutant and wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>D,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; data not shown) suggested that the RNase P cleavages at 3&#x02032; the ends, left a single-stranded region (&#x0223c;10-11 nt), sufficient for RNase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) to bind and remove the next 3&#x02013;4 nt, but were not substrates for PNPase.</p><p>It should also be noted that a previous <italic>in vitro</italic> study mapped a 3&#x02032; RNase P cleavage site at 7 nt downstream of CCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Thus, it is apparent that the longer processing intermediates in the RNase II deficient strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) were in fact processed by RNase P, although not as precisely as <italic>in vitro</italic>. While the exact mechanism of how RNase P recognizes cleavage sites in the 3&#x02032; trailer sequences is not known, one possible explanation is that a structure different from that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C forms in a limited number of <italic>leuX</italic> transcripts providing access to RNase P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). It is not clear if the same RNase P molecule cleaves both the 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-ends of a single transcript. Furthermore, while no other exoribonuclease could replace RNase II in these experiments, it has been shown that all MG1655 derivatives are deficient in RNase PH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The final 3&#x02032; maturation of tRNA<sup>Leu5</sup> still requires RNase T, since more than 70% of the precursor tRNA were 1&#x02013;3 nt longer than the mature tRNA in the <italic>&#x00394;rnt</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The detection of some <italic>leuX</italic> primary transcripts in a wild-type strain [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>)] suggests less efficient processing by PNPase compared to terminator removal by either RNase E or RNase G, since primary transcripts processed endonucleolytically are not readily detectable in wild-type strains. In fact, this may be the rate-limiting step during tRNA<sup>Leu5</sup> processing because 3&#x02032;-end processing appears to be necessary before RNase P cleavage at the 5&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, in the absence of PNPase the major unprocessed species is the full-length <italic>leuX</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lane 2) with only a minor fraction (&#x0003c;1%) of the processing intermediates having a mature 5&#x02032; terminus containing the 3&#x02032; terminator sequences. While this result is in contrast to the <italic>in vitro</italic> study of <italic>leuX</italic> processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), it is consistent with inhibition of processing of both the <italic>secG leuU</italic> and <italic>metT</italic> operons by RNase P prior to endonucleolytic removal of their respective Rho-independent transcription terminators <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In contrast, RNase P processing of tRNA transcripts is not inhibited by Rho-dependent transcription terminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Finally, it should also be noted that previous experiments have shown that RNase E can inefficiently cleave at a limited number of locations within the 5&#x02032; upstream region of tRNA transcripts dependent on RNase P for processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Thus, it was not entirely surprising that RNase E inefficiently cleaved the 5&#x02032; upstream region of <italic>leuX</italic> transcripts when RNase P was inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, what was different in the case of <italic>leuX</italic> was the large number of cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) such that it initially appeared as if the enzyme possessed a 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleolytic activity similar to what has been observed with RNase J from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, a careful combination of the sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of RNase E activity on the full-length <italic>leuX</italic> transcript, demonstrated that this activity is indeed endonucleolytic. In addition, the absence of a role for RppH in tRNA<sup>Leu5</sup> maturation (data not shown), even though the transcript was a substrate for the enzyme <italic>in vivo</italic>, was consistent with no involvement of the 5&#x02032;-end-dependent endoribonucleases (RNase E, RNase G) during processing.</p><p>Taken together, we have identified a novel tRNA processing pathway that involves primary removal of a Rho-independent transcription terminator by the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease PNPase. Furthermore, this is the first <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstration that RNase P acts at both the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends of transcripts during tRNA maturation. Surprisingly, when we examined the sequences downstream of the CCA determinant of the Rho-independent transcription terminators presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, there was no obvious reason as to why the <italic>leuX</italic> terminator was not a substrate for RNase E. Even though most of the terminators known to be cleaved by RNase E (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, bold type) primarily contain As and Us downstream of the CCA determinant, there are three Gs in the <italic>leuZ</italic> sequence. It thus seems possible that the recognition of individual terminators involves more than primary sequences. If this hypothesis is correct, there could be additional Rho-independent transcription terminator sequences that are not substrates for endonucleolytic cleavage. Taken together, the tRNA processing pathways in <italic>E. coli</italic> are far more diverse than previously envisioned.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Institutes of General Medical Sciences (GM75220 and GM81554 to S.R.K.).
