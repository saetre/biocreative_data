Since CSF-1 plays important role in embryonic development and implantation, we investigated its role in gram-negative bacterial LPS-induced implantation failure. The effect of LPS on normal (nonsuperovulated) and superovulated in vivo-produced embryos was assessed by signs of morphological degeneration. A significantly similar number of morphologically degenerated embryos recovered from both nonsuperovulated and superovulated LPS treated animals on day 2.5 of pregnancy onwards were morphologically and developmentally abnormal as compared to their respective controls (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001. Normal CSF-1 expression level and pattern were also altered through the preimplantation period in the mouse embryos and uterine horns after LPS treatment. This deviation from the normal pattern and level of CSF-1 expression in the preimplantation embryos and uterine tissues suggest a role for CSF-1 in LPS-induced implantation failure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A variety of cell types at the blastocyst implantation site produce growth factors that could play important role(s) in the implantation process. Decidual cells and/or embryos produce transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and colony stimulating factor (CSF-1) (Haimovici et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Furthermore, receptors for EGF, PDGF, and CSF-1 have been detected on embryonic and trophoblast cells. The receptor for CSF-1 (<italic>c-fms</italic>) has been detected from the early 2-cell stage embryo onwards albeit at low levels. CSF-1 mRNA transcripts have been detected in the oviducts and uterus suggesting a paracrine action of these growth factors during the preimplantation period of embryonic development (Arceci et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]).</p><p>During pregnancy, a paradoxical relationship exists between the fetal allograft and the maternal immune system. Several studies have demonstrated the adverse and beneficial effects of cytokines and growth factors secreted by activated lymphocytes and monocytes on the development of early embryos, during pathogenic conditions. These evidences have now formed the basis of the &#x0201c;immunotrophism&#x0201d; hypothesis, which suggests that local cytokines and growth factors produced by activated immune cells promote pregnancy. Colony stimulating factor-1 (or CSF-1, also known as macrophage colony stimulating factor, M-CSF) is found in humans as a 90 kd secreted homodimer and a 86 kd membrane-bound form, which is cleaved to release a 46 kd homodimer (Rettenmeir et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). It has been shown that CSF-1 mRNA and its corresponding protein increase 1000 folds in the uterine horns during pregnancy in mouse (Pollard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). CSF-1 protein and CSF-1 mRNA expression also increase in the placenta in human with advancing gestation (Kauma et al 1999).</p><p>Adequate knowledge on preimplantation embryogenesis is necessary for the successful accomplishment of medically assisted reproductive technology and for embryo biotechnology (Iritani [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). For carrying out the various embryonic manipulations <italic>in vitro</italic>, usually, a large number of viable and synchronously developing embryos are required and that can be obtained by superovulation. Silent subclinical gram-negative bacterial infections of the genital tract of pregnant animals may lead to poor quality of collected embryos. We designed the present study to evaluate the developmental status of preimplantation embryos developing <italic>in vivo</italic> in LPS-treated pregnant animals under nonsuperovulated/normal and superovulated conditions.</p><p>Gram-negative bacterial infections of the genitourinary tract of pregnant women are known to cause abortion, fetal loss, or poor pregnancy outcome (for a review see Deb et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). Gram-negative bacterial endotoxins, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) is the main antigenic component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, and is known for its potency to activate the myeloid and nonmyeloid cells to produce cytokines. These cytokines and growth factors exert autocrine and paracrine effects on the surrounding cells and modulate the expression and synthesis of other cytokines. Silent subclinical infections of these bacteria can lead to early pregnancy losses where the mother remains unaware of it (see Deb et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). In a previous study we have established the &#x0201c;minimum dose&#x0201d; of LPS which can compromise blastocyst implantation in mouse (Deb et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). The objectives of this study were to find out if LPS could alter the pattern and level of mRNA expression of CSF-1 in the 2-cell to blastocyst stage embryos and uterine horns at narrow intervals over the preimplantation period of pregnancy in mouse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Superovulation and embryo recovery</title><p>Park strain mice were maintained, superovulated, and mated as described earlier (Deb et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]).

The embryos were recovered on each day of pregnancy by flushing the excised oviducts and uterine horns with sterile PBS in sterile endotoxin free petri-dishes (Deb et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]).

Therefore, mouse may be used as a reliable and reproducible animal model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of failure of pregnancy (Dudley et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). To elucidate the mechanism of LPS-induced failure of implantation we investigated its effect on the <italic>in vivo</italic> development of preimplantation stage embryos collected from nonsuperovulated/normal and superovulated pregnant animals. We observed that the LPS had more or less similar effects on the quality and quantity of embryos collected from the nonsuperovulated and superovulated animals. The abrupt decline in the quality and quantity of the embryos in response to LPS on day 4.375 of pregnancy may be one of the causes of reduced reproductive efficiencies during gram-negative bacterial infections (Rupasri et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]).</p><p>The observed asynchronous cleavage and degeneration of preimplantation embryos recovered from LPS-treated animals may be due to activation of LPS-triggered apoptotic pathways in the cells of developing preimplantation embryos. Zou et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] suggested that LPS triggers F as mediated apoptotic pathway in mouse preimplantation (2-cell stage) embryos. It has also been reported that the expression of genes involved in cell death (eg, MA-3, p53, Bad, and Bcl-xS etc) gets elevated and that of the genes involved in cell survival (eg, Bcl-2) gets downregulated in embryos undergoing fragmentation (Jurisicova et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and Levy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). The present study clearly demonstrates that LPS is associated with severe degeneration and fragmentation of mouse embryos <italic>in vivo</italic>. This may be due to an early expression of several proinflammatory cytokines in response to LPS in the developing mouse embryos.</p><p>The early preimplantation stage embryos are maintained in a nonadhesive state by a nonadhesive proteinaceous coat of ZP (Foulk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). The ZP prevents the attachment of the prematured embryo to the endometrium and also helps in the transfer of the developing embryos from the oviducts to the uterus (Carson et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). The zona is shed from the surface of the matured blastocyst just before implantation (ie, on day 4.5 of pregnancy) under normal pregnancy and makes it attachment-competent. However, we saw an early loss of zona pellucida (on day 4.37 of pregnancy) from the developing embryos in response to LPS. The early loss of ZP may expose the premature blastocyst to high levels of cytotoxic factors, which may lead to the fragmentation and degeneration of developing embryos in mouse.</p><p>This study clearly implies that the low dose of LPS used in the present experiment may mimic the pathophysiology of subclinical genital tract infection of gram-negative bacteria, which may not affect the uterine preparation for embryonic receptivity at the gross anatomical or physiological levels. Our study also indicates that the preimplantation embryonic development is susceptible to low level of LPS <italic>in vivo</italic>. The present observations clearly demonstrate that LPS significantly affects the morphology and development of the superovulated embryos, which suggests the mouse embryos produced <italic>in vivo</italic> may be a good model to study such complications. It is possible that the growth factors and cytokines of embryonic and/or maternal origin, which are produced in response to LPS may alter the molecular dialogue at the feto-maternal interface, which may lead to poor pregnancy outcome and infertility in mouse.</p><p>CSF-1 performs several functions during implantation and placentation in physiological pregnancy. Bhatnagar et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study, have shown that CSF-1 stimulates the development of trophectoderm of the blastocyst. CSF-1 regulates growth, differentiation, and functions of macrophages, is readily detectable in the peripheral blood in the steady state, and is further induced <italic>in vivo</italic> after infection (Cheers and Stanley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]) or challenge with LPS (Roth et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). Furthermore, CSF-1 treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> increased levels of LPS-induced TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL-6 (Chapoval et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]).</p><p>We observed an early expression of CSF-1 gene in the embryos collected from the control animals. Our observation suggests its importance in the normal development of embryos during the early preimplantation stages. Zolti et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] reported the expression of CSF-1 in unfertilized human oocytes and during early embryogenesis. However, Arceci et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] could not detect its expression in preimplantation embryos in mouse. The pattern of CSF-1 expression in the embryos recovered from LPS-treated animals was similar to that of the control during days 1.5 to 3.5 of pregnancy. However, its abrupt expression in blastocysts (day 4.33) in response to LPS may lead to formation of developmentally compromised blastocysts which are incompetent for implantation.</p><p>The increase in CSF-1 production after ovulation and during pregnancy by uterine tissues as observed by us and previous researchers (Pollard et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]) may be due to increasing levels of progesterone, which is known to stimulate <italic>in vitro</italic> production of M-CSF in endometrium (Azuma et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]). The decreased level of CSF-1 mRNA in the uterus of animals treated with LPS as compared to that of the control animals on days 3.5, 4.0, and 4.125 of pregnancy indicates that LPS may have a slight antiprogestrogenic activity. The observed decrease in the expression of CSF-1, in the present study, in response to the treatment of animals with LPS may decrease uterine receptivity to the implanting blastocyst and may lead to unsuccessful implantation.</p><p>The ability of LPS to induce a differential regulation of the expression of CSF-1 in uterine horns and the preimplantation embryos suggests the possibility that the expressions of other cytokines like TNF and IL-6 were altered by CSF-1. Though the data is semiquantitative in nature, to our knowledge this is the first report which shows a differential expression of CSF-1 in the uterine horns and preimplantation embryos in response to LPS, and it highlights the importance of a regulated expression of CSF-1 for sustenance of normal pregnancy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We are thankful to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi, India; and to the Rockefeller Foundation, USA, for grants to the first author.
