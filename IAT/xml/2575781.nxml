In this study, we show that in the mammalian eye, the function of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) extends beyond regulation of the innate immune response; it restricts RPC proliferation. In TLR4-deficient mice, enhanced proliferation of cells reminiscent of RPCs is evident during the early postnatal period. In vitro experiments demonstrate that TLR4 acts as an intrinsic regulator of RPC fate decision. Increased TLR4 expression in the eye correlates with the postnatal cessation of cell proliferation. However, deficient TLR4 expression is not sufficient to extend the proliferative period but rather contributes to resumption of proliferation in combination with growth factors. Proliferation in vivo is inhibited by both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways, similar to the mechanisms activated by TLR4 in immune cells. Thus, our study attributes a novel role to TLR4 as a negative regulator of RPC proliferation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>R. Shechter, A. Ronen, and A.

In mammals, retinal neurogenesis ends by the early postnatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Reh and Fischer, 2006</xref>). Although a small number of quiescent retinal stem/progenitor cells persist at the margin of the mature retina near the junction of the ciliary epithelium (CE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tropepe et al., 2000</xref>), progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation are no longer evident. As retinal stem cell therapy has promising therapeutic potential for eye pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Young, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">MacLaren et al., 2006</xref>), it is necessary to identify the factors that regulate retinal progenitor cell (RPC) proliferative capacity.</p><p>The expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been recently documented in the ciliary body of the mammalian eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brito et al., 2004</xref>). TLR4 is primarily identified as an innate immune receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Takeda and Akira, 2005</xref>); therefore, its function in the eye has been commonly attributed to the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kumar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2006</xref>). However, because TLRs recognize patterns rather than specific molecules, along with their ability to recognize physiological compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ohashi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Okamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>), they are endowed with the innate ability to mediate a rapid response to a wide range of signals in the microenvironment and not merely to pathogens.</p><p>Nonimmune functions of the TLR family have been reported in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in establishing the dorsal&#x02013;ventral axis polarity, in synaptogenesis, and in axon pathfinding during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Halfon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rose et al., 1997</xref>). Such nonimmune functions of this receptor family have only recently emerged in mammals. We have recently shown that in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS), TLRs, including TLR4, regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rolls et al., 2007</xref>). In mammalian brain development, other members of the TLR family, TLR3 and TLR8, were identified as negative regulators of axonal/neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cameron et al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, TLR4 was found to be absent in neurons during the developmental stages of CNS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lehnardt et al., 2003</xref>); however, with age, its expression levels increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wadachi and Hargreaves, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, the functions that have been recently attributed to TLRs in the mammalian CNS, the changes in TLR expression pattern with development, and the evidence of TLR4 expression in the retinal ciliary body, a location known to harbor RPCs, raised the possibility that TLR4 may play a role in the mammalian retina in RPC fate determination.</p><p>In this study, we identified TLR4 as a negative regulator of RPC proliferation. During the early postnatal period, TLR4-deficient (TLR4D) mice exhibited enhanced proliferation of cells expressing molecular markers commonly attributed to RPCs. In vitro experiments demonstrated that TLR4 directly modulates RPC fate decision. The increase in TLR4 levels, which coincided with the cessation of proliferation in the ciliary body, was found to be one of the factors that contributed to the decrease in proliferation. Thus, we suggest that although TLR4 is not the primary factor that regulates RPC proliferative capacity throughout life, it does determine the sensitivity of these cells to the microenvironment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>TLR4 deficiency results in increased proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the postnatal mammalian retina</title><p>To assess the effect of TLR4 on RPC proliferation, we analyzed retinas from postnatal day 6 (PN6) mice, which is the latest time point at which intense proliferation in the mammalian retina has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanks and Bok, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Young, 1985</xref>). We found by PCR that TLR4 is the dominant TLR family member expressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brito et al., (2004)</xref>, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TLR4 is expressed in the retina and the CE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), a location that has been shown to harbor a retinal progenitor population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tropepe et al., 2000</xref>). We next identified the specific population of cells that expresses TLR4 in the ciliary body. TLR4-positive cells hardly expressed markers characteristic of endothelial (CD34; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) or epithelial (cytokeratin 18 and AE1/AE3; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>) cells but expressed molecular markers characteristic of RPCs such as nestin, a neural progenitor marker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), and Chx10, a retinal progenitor marker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). To further strengthen our hypothesis that the TLR4-positive cells are proliferating RPCs, we injected the 6-d-old mice with the cell proliferation marker BrdU. BrdU-positive cells that coexpressed TLR4 were detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Deficiency in TLR4 results in increased proliferation of cells reminiscent of RPCs in the early postnatal retina.</bold> (A) Semiquantitative PCR of PN6 whole eyes for TLR1&#x02013;9.

To that end, we compared proliferation between wild-type (WT) and TLR4D PN6 mice assessed by BrdU incorporation and staining for the proliferation marker Ki67, a nuclear protein expressed in all phases of the cell cycle except the resting phase. The number of proliferating cells was higher in the TLR4D mice relative to the matched WT controls both in the CE and the peripheral retina (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, H&#x02013;J</xref>). Next, double immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that the observed increase in proliferation occurred in cells expressing the neural progenitor marker nestin and the retinal progenitor markers Pax6 and Chx10 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, K&#x02013;N</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative analysis 7 d after injection revealed an increased number of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressing the neuronal marker &#x003b2;III-tubulin (&#x003b2;IIIT) in the TLR4D mice (16,590 &#x000b1; 1,872 vs. 8,480 &#x000b1; 2,687, TLR4D vs. WT, respectively; Student's <italic>t</italic> test, &#x0002a;, P &#x0003d; 0.05). This increase was not solely a result of enhanced proliferation but also an outcome of increased differentiation into neuronal cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Because rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells are the major retinal neuronal cells formed during late histogenesis, we also quantified the percentage (out of total BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells) of the bipolar-specific marker PKC-&#x003b1; and the photoreceptor-specific marker recoverin. Increased differentiation into the tested retinal neuronal cell types was evident in TLR4D mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Notably, these differences did not result from differential survival, as no effect on apoptosis (measured by cleaved caspase 3) was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

To address this issue, we first tested whether TLRs are expressed by RPCs in vitro. Undifferentiated RPCs express mRNA that encodes for members of the TLR family (TLR1&#x02013;9), with pronounced expression of TLR4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Using TLR4-specific antibodies, we verified that RPCs indeed express this receptor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B&#x02013;D</xref>). To examine whether the TLR4 expressed on the RPCs affects their proliferation, we used an activator of TLR4, ultrapurified lipopolysaccharide (upLPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>). Reduction of sphere diameter and proliferation were observed in the presence of upLPS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E&#x02013;G</xref>). Treatment with upLPS did not affect RPC viability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref>). Furthermore, suppression of TLR4 expression using TLR4-targeted siRNA increased the sphere diameter by 19.5 &#x000b1; 3.9% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 46&#x02013;56; Student's <italic>t</italic> test, &#x0002a;, P &#x0003d; 0.0004; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 I</xref>). Next, we examined the ability of TLR4 expressed on RPCs to direct their differentiation into neurons. Activation of TLR4 on RPCs using upLPS inhibited neuronal differentiation assessed by &#x003b2;IIIT and doublecortin (DCX; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, J and K</xref>) and had no effect on differentiation to the other lineages. Collectively, these results suggest that TLR4 is an intrinsic regulator, restricting both the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of RPCs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Activation of TLR4 on RPCs directly restricts their proliferation and neuronal differentiation in vitro.</bold> (A) Semiquantitative PCR analysis of RPCs for TLR expression.

TLR signaling, which relies on cytoplasmic adaptor molecules that can associate with the intracellular region of the TLR molecule, exerts its effect via two main signaling pathways, MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88)-dependent and -independent cascades. The former involves the activation of the intracellular adaptor MyD88, and the latter entails the participation of another adaptor, TICAM1 (TIR domain&#x02013;containing adaptor protein inducing INF-&#x003b2;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies indicated that in developing neurons, TLR activation does not activate NF&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cameron et al., 2007</xref>), demonstrating that a different signaling pathway is induced in these cells. In contrast, TLR4 activation in adult neural progenitor cells results in the activation of both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rolls et al., 2007</xref>), similar to the pathways activated in the immune system. As the proliferation of RPCs can be considered a recapitulation of both neurogenesis and developmental processes, we wished to identify the signaling pathways used in this process. Therefore, we tested whether MyD88 and TICAM1 participate in the regulation of cell proliferation in the eye. We found increased numbers of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the peripheral retina and the CE of both MyD88- and TICAM1-deficient mice relative to WT PN6 mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A&#x02013;C</xref>). We further confirmed that the proliferating cells expressed markers characteristic of RPCs, including nestin, Pax6, and Chx10 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>).

As long as proliferation was detectable in the peripheral retina, deficiency in TLR4 resulted in increased proliferation relative to WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>). Because the absence of TLR4 had no effect on proliferation at later time points (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>), we suggest that TLR4 signaling represents a secondary mechanism restricting proliferation in the adult eye.</p><p>The absence of proliferating RPCs in the adult eye can be either attributed to the lack of proliferation-promoting factors or to the presence of inhibitory molecules. The former was recently demonstrated, as GF administration results in in vivo proliferation of cells expressing markers characteristic of RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer and Reh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether TLR4 participates in restricting proliferation when GFs are provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer and Reh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>). We intravitreally injected FGF-2 and insulin as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>) to WT and TLR4D mice at PN15 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Incorporation of BrdU, which was injected together with the GF, revealed, as expected, an extension of the proliferation period. As in the early postnatal stage, providing the eye with GF resulted in significantly higher proliferation in the TLR4D mice compared with the WT animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, G&#x02013;I</xref>), indicating that TLR4 had a negative impact on proliferation when conditions permissive for RPC proliferation were restored. To confirm these results and to demonstrate the effect of GFs on cell proliferation, we analyzed retinas for the expression of Ki67. A higher number of proliferating cells was seen in the GF-treated retinas relative to controls in both strains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 J</xref>); however, the effect was far more pronounced in the TLR4D mice (fourfold increase) than in their matched controls (2.5-fold increase; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 J</xref>). We further confirmed that the observed increased proliferation involved cells expressing markers distinguishing RPCs, such as Pax6 and Chx10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, K and L</xref>). These results suggest that under permissive conditions, TLR4 down-regulates proliferation. Importantly, deficiency in TLR4 had a more pronounced effect on proliferation in the PN15 eyes supplied with GF relative to PN6 eyes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 M</xref>). This pronounced effect is supported by the enhanced expression of TLR4 at PN15 relative to PN6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Thus, our findings suggest that even though it cannot be considered the primary limiting factor of RPC proliferation in adulthood, enhanced TLR4 expression in the eye contributes to the restriction of RPC proliferation.</p><p>In this study, we identified TLR4 as a novel player in the regulation of RPC proliferation in the mammalian eye. We found that TLR4 inhibits proliferation of retinal cells expressing progenitor markers in the early postnatal period and contributes to their lack of proliferation in the subsequent time period. In vitro experiments confirmed that TLR4 is expressed on the RPCs and directly affects their cell fate decision. Notably, TLR4 does not belong to any of the previously known classes of cell&#x02013;cell signaling pathways used to determine the fate of RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yang, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, the major classes of known cell&#x02013;cell signaling pathways share a common property with the TLR orthologue, as they all participate in dorsal&#x02013;ventral patterning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biemar et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, because similar effects of TLR4 on neural progenitor cell proliferation are also evident in the adult hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rolls et al., 2007</xref>), our results further emphasize the importance of this receptor family in neurogenic processes in general.</p><p>TLR4 is a member of a larger receptor family. Thus, our results suggest that additional members of this family may participate in retinogenesis and RPC fate regulation. Revealing the specific function of these family members necessitates further investigation. The unique features of the TLR family, including pattern recognition rather than identification of a single ligand and their ability to recognize stress-related compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>) or pathogens, provide RPCs with the capacity to respond to various deviations from homeostasis, such as injury. Our finding that TLR4 restricts RPC proliferation might provide, at least in part, an explanation for the limited neurogenesis in response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nickerson et al., 2007</xref>), a condition that releases a variety of ligands that can ultimately be recognized by the TLR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vabulas et al., 2002</xref>). Revealing the mechanisms that constrain RPC proliferation has promising therapeutic potential for inducing neurogenesis in the adult eye under pathological conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>TLR4D mice (C57BL/10ScNJ; The Jackson Laboratory) and their WT C57BL/10 counterparts (a gift of I.
