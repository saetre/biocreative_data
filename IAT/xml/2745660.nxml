The presence of selected microRNAs in stem cells and their disappearance during differentiation suggest roles in suppressing pluripotency and/or restricting cell differentiation. Indeed, knockout mice lacking Argonaute2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RNA-induced silencing (RISC) complex, exhibit severe defects in neural development, including the failure to close neural tube <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Liu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Genomic silencing of DGCR8, an RNA-binding protein essential for processing microRNAs, completely prevents mouse ES cells from differentiating into embryoid bodies, suggesting that microRNAs are required to inhibit ES self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Wang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In one example, mir-302 is induced by Oct4 (POU5F1) and Sox2 in hESC, in turn suppressing cyclin D1 and thereby (along with other target mRNAs), increasing the fraction of cells in S phase and stimulating cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Card1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, mir-145, induced upon differentiation, represses pluripotency by inhibiting production of Oct4, Sox2, and KLF4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Xu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. From these studies we conclude that microRNAs are important early in stem cell differentiation and are likely to be required for differentiation mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Gangaraju1">&#x0005b;reviewed by: 9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While about 700 human microRNAs have been identified, the total number of microRNA genes has been predicted to be from 1,000 per genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Lewis1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Xie1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Bentwich1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> to as many as 10,000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Miranda1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps some microRNAs are exclusively expressed in specific tissues or differentiation stages, functioning transiently during development. We propose that most previously identified microRNAs are expressed universally or in stable, adult tissues. Therefore, early stages of development are more likely to express microRNAs that are present only transiently or in specific cell stages. One study proved that this can be an effective strategy by using deep sequencing to screen small RNA sequences in hESC, finding 13 new microRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Bar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps existing discovery methods, including earlier deep sequencing approaches, were not sufficiently sensitive to detect low concentrations of these microRNAs. Since we wish to study the function of microRNAs during early neural precursor development, we chose to apply the highly sensitive and accurate method of Sequencing by Oligo Ligation and Detection (SOLiD) to cultures of hESC and their neural precursor derivatives. We found not only that quantifying microRNAs by counting sequences is a sensitive method for evaluating microRNA expression, but that new transcripts could be identified that mapped to genomic loci predicted to encode previously unknown microRNAs. However, sequencing alone cannot distinguish microRNAs from other families of small, non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Since microRNAs must be associated with a RISC complex to have function, we identified candidate microRNAs by identifying them in immunoprecipitated Ago2-containing complexes.</p><p>Known populations of microRNAs are strongly conserved across species, but should we expect newly-identified microRNAs to be similarly conserved? Most studies that have searched for microRNAs have attempted to extend this conservation when identifying putative genes among populations of small ncRNA. One of the accepted criteria for microRNA identification is phylogenetic conservation across species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Ambros1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This criterion would automatically exclude any potentially species-specific microRNAs and skew evolutionary studies to identify a high percentage of conserved microRNAs by definition. However, many microRNAs are not conserved and are lineage- or species-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Bentwich1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Berezikov1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Berezikov2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Piriyapongsa1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Zhang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Cao1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The expansion and evolution of microRNAs have been linked to both body plan innovation and vertebrate morphological complexity throughout evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Hertel1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Prochnik1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Heimberg1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that some newly-described microRNAs may lack conservation with distant species. Furthermore, there is evidence that microRNA innovation is an ongoing process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Hertel1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Liang1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. MicroRNAs have been identified as key developmental regulators, modulating cell specificity and tissue identity. Based on this fundamental developmental function, we speculate that species-specific microRNAs function in a manner that would contribute to the uniqueness of a species. For example, Cao <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Cao1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> describe a hES cell-specific population of microRNAs that evolved in primates only some 5 million years ago. These microRNAs are differentially expressed during cell differentiation and probably exert a posttranscriptional regulatory role specific to primate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Therefore, we predict that new microRNAs expressed early in human development would not likely be conserved across most species.</p><p>By incorporating SOLiD deep sequencing of large numbers (&#x0003e;100 million) of small RNAs from hESC and by adapting these results to an algorithm designed to match small RNA reads with genome sites consistent with the established mechanism of microRNA processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Friedlander1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, we identified over 800 predicted microRNAs. To validate these predictions we assayed Ago2-containing complexes and found 146 predicted microRNAs as enriched by immunoprecipitation. Finally, we compared small RNA SOLiD sequencing results from multiple, independently-derived hESC lines to ensure expression across biologically variable samples. While a similar approach has been tried previously with lower numbers of small RNA sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Bar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, ours is the first study to combine ultra-deep sequencing, model-based precursor prediction, and validation in Ago2-containing complexes. Initial analysis of new microRNAs suggests that they are expressed in a more biologically-specific manner and are less conserved than previously-identified microRNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>hESC Cultures</title><p>HSF1 and HSF6 cultures were prepared and differentiated at UCLA as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Wu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

A total of four SOLiD assays were run on multiple hESC cell lines and stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s002">Table S1</xref>). A second slide made use of the multiplexing capability of the SOLiD system to sequence multiple samples at about 7.5 million sequences each by using primers having different barcodes.

Is counting of SOLiD-detected sequences an accurate method for measuring microRNA concentrations? We assayed two developmental stages (ESC and NSC) of one cell line (RG7) using both SOLiD and TaqMan microRNA qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s010">File S1</xref>), which is generally accepted as an accurate method for measuring relative RNA concentrations. We found good correlation between methods when comparing fold-change from ESC to NSC (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.730, Pearson). We conclude that counting SOLiD sequences exhibits similar accuracy as qPCR over a broad range of concentrations. Therefore, this method is acceptable for judging relative quantities of sequences as potential mature or star strands within a precursor structure.</p><p>We performed hierarchical clustering to characterize cell lines and culture stages using counts of all detected known microRNAs.

Within each culture condition group, the RG7 NRP sample was most dissimilar compared with NSC and NPC cultures, but the H1 embryoid body (EB) culture was more like H1 ESC than other ESC cultures, consistent with a predominant cell line difference. The H1 cell line has been found to contain several genomic deletions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>) and therefore may represent a true biological outlier compared with the other lines.

This algorithm was designed to screen deep sequencing reads that have been aligned to genome for model properties consistent with Drosha/Dicer substrate processing.

The color-coded reads are interpreted as specifying the &#x0201c;interval&#x0201d; between two adjacent bases. In alignments with genomic sequences, two successive colors must be interpreted consistently since they share a common nucleotide that is interrogated twice. Inconsistent color patterns cannot be aligned to reference genome and thus are discarded, improving the quality of the aligned colorspace sequences. We aligned reads to human genome in colorspace using SHRiMP, which rapidly identifies potential homologies and extends them with a Smith Waterman algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Smith1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

This was done in two separate datasets&#x02014;one derived from H1 ESC and the other from H1 NSC samples, reasoning that expression and alignment patterns of one condition might obscure those from the other condition. We do not believe that the sequences selected were due to PCR over-amplification because most sequences aligning in overlapping positions varied in their terminal nucleotide position (not shown). A large number of reads were excluded by selecting 10 or more reads per genomic location&#x02014;31,773,857 reads were excluded for ESC and 37,779,985 for NSC. Selected alignments, condensed by location, were used to extract surrounding putative precursor sequences from genome.

Among the miRDeep-derived candidates there are 179 and 238 known microRNAs or snoRNAs from ESC and NSC, respectively. These were removed from predictions using the Tables function of the UCSC genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>). Similarly, prediction sites matching the RNA Genes track of the browser were removed, eliminating fragments of rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA, or other classes of small RNA. Finally, prediction sites matching the RepeatMasker track of the genome browser were removed so that we could focus on non-repeated genomic loci. After filtering, a total of 818 predicted microRNA genes were identified from the two conditions, ESC and NSC. Of these, 75 predictions appeared in both conditions, leaving 287 predictions specific for ESC and 456 specific for NSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Comparing miRDeep log-odds score distributions for recovered known microRNAs and predicted microRNAs, there is a large degree of overlap but the predicted microRNA population includes a lower range of scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s005">Figure S3</xref>). Perhaps some of these 818 predicted microRNAs could be other classes of small ncRNA.</p><p>As expected, a larger proportion of these 818 predicted microRNA genes were identified from data unique to a single developmental stage than was true for known microRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">Files S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s013">S4</xref>). This agrees with the hypothesis that previously identified microRNAs are more commonly expressed in multiple tissues or stages of development. Newly-identified microRNAs are likely to be more specific to tissue or developmental stage.</p><p>If these 818 predicted microRNA genes are expressed and/or regulated during early stem cell differentiation, their genomic positions should be phased with respect to chromatin marks, particularly those characteristic of developmental regulation. Using publicly-available ChIP-Seq data from the ESC stage of the H9 cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Ku1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, we overlapped the start site and direction of all predicted precursors from each class (ESC or NSC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g002">Figure 2D&#x02013;E</xref>). For this summary analysis we did not examine potential clusters of microRNAs, presence of microRNA-encoding loci in introns, or the possibility of distant transcription start sites, all of which could confound a more detailed interpretation. However, the precursors predicted from ESC had a phased peak of H3K4me3 with local maximum near &#x0223c;100 bp upstream of the 5&#x02032; end of the precursor and local minima &#x0223c;500 bp upstream and &#x0223c;800 bp downstream. No peaks were observed for H3K27me3 or H3K36me3. This pattern is similar to a plot summarizing ChIP-Seq marks for 93 known microRNAs exclusively expressed in hESC (not shown). The ChIP alignment pattern was quite distinct for NSC-derived predictions in ESC cultures. The H3K4me3 track had local maxima at &#x0223c;500 bp upstream and &#x0223c;400 bp downstream of the precursor 5&#x02032; end with a dip in the track near the 5&#x02032; end. To a lesser degree, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 tracks appear to peak upstream of the precursor. Since H3K4me3 is normally considered to be indicative of active expression, the presence of marks overlapping predicted transcriptional precursors for the ESC predictions in ESC cells is consistent with gene expression. However, there is no clear indication of transcription by the H3K36me3 marks for this class of predictions. On the other hand, increased numbers of marks for H3K27me3 for the NSC predictions in ESC might indicate repression of at least a subset of the predicted precursors. Since H3K36me3 is also found surrounding predicted precursor sites, another subset may be transcribed or it may represent stalled transcription. Overall, a clear presence of epigenetic marks aligning with predicted precursor locations on genome is consistent with regulated expression during early differentiation.</p><p>As a validation strategy for potential biological function of these predicted microRNAs, we searched for small RNAs that could be associated with RISC by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Ago2. Ago2 is one member of the Argonaute family found in RISC complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Su1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Available evidence suggests that binding among Ago family members is not sequence-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Meister1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Landthaler1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> and so Ago2 binding was expected to serve as a proxy for binding with all Ago proteins. We prepared small RNAs from immunoprecipitated cytoplasmic extracts of hESC or NSC cultures from the RG7 line. Preliminary experiments used qPCR and primers specific for a subset of the predicted microRNAs to test Ago2 IP samples. Out of 87 predicted microRNAs tested, 46 were found to be enriched by Ago2 IP over IgG IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s012">File S3</xref>). Based on this pilot experiment we expanded our search using deep sequencing of the IP samples. Small RNAs were sequenced and those predicted microRNAs that were enriched at least 4-fold over IgG controls were selected, yielding 146 new microRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">Files S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s014">S5</xref>). A similar analysis of known microRNAs found 609 that were at least 4-fold enriched by Ago2 IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">File S2</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s001">Methods S1</xref>). Interestingly, while the majority of Ago2 IP-selected microRNAs were expressed linearly with their concentration within the Ago2 IP sample, several outliers were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s006">Figure S4</xref>). From this observation we conclude that Ago2 IP does not always merely reflect cellular concentration and therefore it may be more indicative of microRNA function than measurements of microRNA concentrations in the cell.</p><p>If Ago2 IP reliably selected microRNAs among other varieties of small RNA sequences, we expect that these sequences would be reproducibly expressed across biological replicates&#x02014;in the case of human stem cells, in several independently-isolated cell lines. We quantified sequencing results from small RNA libraries (not immunoprecipitated) from samples of either ESC or NSC staged cultures of H1, HSF1, HSF6, or RG7. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> were adjusted for sequencing depth by converting to counts per million sequences detected (cpm). All 755 Ago2 IP-selected RNAs (146 predicted and 609 known) were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">File S2</xref>). Additionally, the computationally-predicted microRNAs would be expected to be expressed in the stage from which it was originally identified (i.e., ESC or NSC). For the 44 microRNAs predicted based on expression in ESC, 41 were present in at least 3 of the 4 ESC cell lines and only 1 was detected in only a single line. Similarly, from the 116 microRNAs predicted based on NSC expression, 115 were detected in at least 3 of the 4 NSC lines and one was found in only two lines. The measured expression levels clearly distinguish cultures by stage. This was independently observed for all 755 RNAs, only the 609 Ago2 IP-enriched known microRNAs and the 146 Ago2 IP-enriched predicted RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Examining the distribution of expression levels for known vs. predicted microRNAs in each culture stage, we find that in ESC the predicted microRNAs include lower concentrations than the known populations but the distributions mostly overlap in NSC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s007">Figure S5</xref>). This matches our prediction that newly-described microRNAs would be found at lower concentrations in conditions searched previously such as ESC, but that transient developmental stages such as NSC would be a rich source of new microRNAs at any concentration. We conclude that the 146 computationally-predicted microRNAs that are Ago2 IP-enriched are consistently expressed in a biologically-diverse group of samples.</p><fig id="pone-0007192-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007192.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Ago2 IP-selected microRNAs.</title><p>A.

RNA was prepared from RG7 hESC cultures at three stages (ESC, NSC, and NRP), induced pluripotent cells obtained from WiCell cultured at two stages (ESC, NSC), and three adult human tissues (brain, heart and kidney). Sequencing libraries were constructed and sequenced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s002">Table S1</xref>). Counted observations were normalized by calculating the counts per million beads detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">File S2</xref>). In general, microRNA expression levels correlated samples according to their developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). That is, ESC samples from RG7 hESC were similar to an iPS culture obtained from WiCell. RG7 NSC samples were more like NRP and iPS NSC cultures than other tissues. Similar results were obtained by comparing iPS cultures with other hESC lines (not shown).Three adult tissues were least correlated. This pattern was similar for the Ago2 IP-enriched known microRNAs and for the Ago2 IP-enriched predicted microRNAs, except that the predicted microRNAs grouped brain and iPS NSC samples together. We observed that these iPS cells were more likely to spontaneously differentiate based on culture morphology and that these cells were more likely to produce neural markers upon differentiation (not shown), consistent with the increased correlation of iPS NSC cultures with adult brain with predicted (correlation coefficient of 0.830) but not known microRNAs (0.385, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

Therefore, the 146 predicted microRNAs selected by Ago2 IP are found to be regulated over differentiation as predicted, but in patterns similar to those of known microRNAs.</p><p>Since microRNAs were originally identified by strong evolutionary homology, we surmised that newly-described microRNAs observed in hESC could be less conserved, consistent with a more recent evolutionary appearance, as has been predicted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Liang1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. We employed a novel metric, SiPhy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Garber1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, to assess the substitution rate of each new microRNA across a genomic alignment of 29 mammalian species (<italic>manuscript in preparation</italic>). The substitution rates (&#x003c9;) were determined relative to the substitution rates of ancestral repeats, a model for neutral evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). As expected, miRDeep predicted microRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, red) as a class demonstrate higher substitution rates than previously classified &#x02018;known&#x02019; microRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, black), suggesting that there is less evolutionary constraint on these sequences. A similar distribution of &#x003c9; is observed for the subset of new microRNA sequences that were confirmed through direct association with Ago2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, blue). The new microRNA sequences described here demonstrate a reduced substitution rate from a neutral model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, grey), but are significantly less conserved than the population of known microRNAs. Since previous microRNA annotation efforts have required a high degree of conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Ambros1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, it is clear that the majority of these new sequences would not have met this stringent criterion, despite their physical association with the RISC complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>By applying ultra-deep sequencing techniques to samples obtained from hESC cultures, we predict up to 818 new microRNA-encoding genes. Chromatin marks associated with these genomic loci are consistent with regulated gene expression. Validation was accomplished by immunoprecipitation of Ago2-containing RISC complexes. These RNAs are drastically regulated over differentiation. Evolutionary conservation among these predicted microRNAs is weaker than for previously identified microRNAs, but we propose that this is appropriate for recently-evolved microRNAs that may be involved in species-specific processes. The fact that 32.9&#x00025; of the Ago2-selected, newly-described microRNAs shared identical seed sequences with known microRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">File S2</xref>) supports this conjecture. We believe we have identified a large number of new microRNAs that are expressed in a regulated fashion over development, are associated with RISC complex, and therefore likely function during early stem cell differentiation.</p><p>The large number of candidates was likely due to several factors. The use of colorspace coding of nucleic acid sequences allowed us to discard reads that were likely due to technical error during deep sequencing, enhancing the confidence in the remaining sequences. Aligning these sequences to genome with SHRiMP using colorspace retained the advantages of this scheme, ideally enforcing the overlapped interrogation of each nucleotide by two adjacent color codes. We used miRDeep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Friedlander1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> to model microRNA gene structure by comparing both positions and counts of accumulated genome alignments with features characteristic of precursors capable of cleavage by the Microprocessor system. Using the probabilistic scoring provided by miRDeep, we found that a large proportion of our predictions overlapped with scores for known microRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s005">Figure S3</xref>). Comparing individual predicted microRNA genes with wiggle tracks of SHRiMP alignments, the general pattern of mature and star strand RNAs coincides with miRDeep-selected results (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Certainly our conservative selection of only the alignments overlapping at least 10 individual sequence reads limited the production of additional predicted genes. However, we believe that the computational interpretation of deep sequencing reads within a probabilistic model of a Drosha/Dicer substrate generally provided reasonable candidates for further investigation.</p><p>Deep sequencing of small RNAs has drawn criticism as some claim that the observed small RNAs are merely degradation fragments of longer RNAs. We uniquely address this critique by selecting for small RNAs that contain the characteristic 5&#x02032;-phosphate and 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl groups of RNase III (Dicer) processing through the library construction process. In separate studies, we built SOLiD libraries from RNA samples digested with alkaline phosphatase to destroy 5&#x02032;-monophosphates and then with Tobacco Acid Phosphatase to convert capped termini to monophosphates. Assessing sample microRNAs using qPCR (not shown) we found that these libraries were enriched for U4 snRNP and depleted for microRNAs, supporting our interpretation that the small RNA libraries used here are not capped. Additionally, in a preliminary alignment to genome, overlapping reads were aggregated together into contiguous intervals. The mean size of these intervals was 21 nt in length for both the H1 ESC and NSC datasets (consistent with the mean size of small RNAs known to be associated with the RNAi machinery) with a mean coverage of &#x0223c;150- and &#x0223c;200-fold respectively. Furthermore, the largest interval we were able to construct from the overlapping alignments was &#x0003c;170 bases. Approximately 40&#x00025; of these small RNAs were found to be intragenic to a known transcript (RefSeq and Ensembl), however the majority of these align to intronic regions, with little evidence of exonic, protein-coding sequences aligning to oursmall RNAs. These results, taken together and in conjunction with our other data, suggest a functional role for these sequenced small RNAs within the cell.</p><p>A previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Bar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> used high-throughput pyrosequencing of concatamers built from small RNAs to detect more than 4&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> sequences&#x02014;about 240-fold less than the number of sequences we observed. From this starting point, alignments representing mature and &#x0201c;star&#x0201d; sequences were computed into hairpins, similar to steps within the miRDeep algorithm. By these methods, Bar and colleagues identified 14 novel and 53 candidate microRNAs, using expression detection by a second method as validation. Five novel microRNAs were selected for validation. Only one of those, mir-1912, matches a predicted microRNA gene found in our list (chrX:113792287-113792343:&#x0002b;) and this RNA was found to be enriched by Ago2 IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">File S2</xref>). We did not test the other, non-overlapping predictions from Bar for Ago2 IP. We conclude that our deeper sequencing allowed the detection of many more predicted microRNA genes. Alternatively, the more sophisticated model used by miRDeep may have increased the likely candidates from existing data.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">File S2</xref> lists the locations and sequences for the 146 predicted microRNAs that were found to be enriched by Ago2 IP. A supplemental file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s014">File S5</xref>) also provides a standard BED file for visualizing these predicted microRNAs in the genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>). Among this group of RNAs, 50 (34&#x00025;) are found within RefSeq mRNA loci on genome (the enclosing RefSeq names are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">File S2</xref>). While many previously-known microRNAs are found clustered in genome, we find that the closest distance between adjacent microRNAs within this new list of 146 is 21 kb, but four of the new microRNAs appear to cluster with previously-known microRNAs (neighbors listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">File S2</xref>). While the precise sequence of the mature microRNA that is listed was produced based on probabilistic methods, we note that the calculated seed sequences (positions 2&#x02013;8) have a 32.9&#x00025; identity with known microRNAs (p&#x0003c;0.0001, chi-square, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s011">File S2</xref> for identities of shared seeds). For example, predicted microRNA chr16:62121639-62121678:- was based on RNA sequences found in ESC and its expression clusters with mir-302a, with which it shares a seed sequence (cluster 2, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s009">Figure S7</xref>). This may represent the evolution of a new family member with slightly different regulatory control based on having different transcriptional regulatory sequences, with different precursor processing based on variation in hairpin sequences, or with target discrimination based on sequence differences outside the seed area. The significantly high proportion of new microRNAs matching seed sequences from previously known microRNAs suggests the presence of new family members, perhaps by a seed-conservative evolutionary mechanism. Certainly for this subset, we predict that cellular mRNA targets must exist since they would be predicted to overlap those of existing microRNAs.</p><p>Expression analysis of counted sequencing results reveals a broad range of patterns, as assessed by K-means clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s009">Figure S7</xref>). Some clusters are reminiscent of a CNS differentiation pathway, such as clusters 3 and 10. Cluster 3 includes the archetypical nervous system microRNAs mir-9 and mir-124, as well as 12 new microRNAs. We expect that many of these new microRNAs will function in neural differentiation. Two clusters, numbers 2 and 6, contained predominantly pluripotent conditions (hESC and iPS). Interestingly, several individual members of these clusters distinguished embryonic from this example of induced pluripotent cultures. For example, three new microRNAs (chr11:15312537&#x02212;15312579:&#x0002b;:ESC, chr6:75211867&#x02212;75211929:&#x0002b;:ESC, and chr8:27799484&#x02212;27799541:&#x02212;:ESC, all members of cluster 2) were primarily found in iPS cultures, suggesting that these microRNAs may be induced during reprogramming or perhaps represent a &#x02018;microRNA memory&#x02019; of the original cellular phenotype. None of the known microRNA members of this cluster was so specific for iPS cells. In contrast, chr9:123671954&#x02212;123672027:&#x02212;:ESC was primarily expressed in hESC instead of iPS, as were mir-371-5p, mir-372, and mir-520a. These differences are consistent with recent studies that suggest cellular reprogramming may be incomplete, and that differences between hESC and iPS cells can be identified at the transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Chin1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Clearly, the combination of expression patterns could be used to distinguish iPS from hESC cultures, but the differences in microRNA expression levels may also contribute to the subtle phenotypic differences observed between iPS and hESC.</p><p>Surprisingly, we find that microRNA expression levels are not always predictive of association with Ago2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s006">Figure S4</xref>). This disagrees with a study performed with FLAG-tagged Ago2 in HEK293T cells where no sequence selection was found in loading RISC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Hendrickson1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. We found, for example, that the ES-specific microRNA mir-302 family is over-represented in Ago2 IP samples compared with other microRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s006">Figure S4C</xref>). Similarly, the differentiation-specific microRNA mir-145 is over-represented in Ago2 IP samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007192.s006">Figure S4D</xref>). Most new microRNAs are under-represented in both conditions. Perhaps there is a bias in binding Ago2 over other Ago family proteins and this explains the discrepancy? Investigation of the preference of Ago proteins for specific microRNAs found no evidence for such selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Meister1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Landthaler1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The possibility remains that some preference does exist and if we immunoprecipitated all Ago proteins (Ago1-Ago4) we should find an aggregate enrichment proportional to microRNA concentrations in the cell. Alternatively, an unknown cellular mechanism might regulate the association of microRNAs with RISC components so that identifying only those microRNAs found bound with Ago predicts their function. A third possibility is that since our detection methods are so &#x0201c;deep,&#x0201d; we are measuring the Ago-selection of microRNAs at lower concentrations and these rare microRNAs are regulated differently from the constitutive microRNAs that were assayed earlier. A fourth possibility is that the stabilities of microRNAs in RISC are based on finding mRNA targets, so that the most actively targeting microRNAs would be over-represented and those that are present without a currently-expressed target may be under-represented. No matter what the explanation, we conclude that Ago2 binding is a reasonable predictor of function but that lack of binding does not exclude RISC loading by microRNA binding with other Ago family members.</p><p>These predicted microRNA genes match most of the generally-accepted definitions for microRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Ambros1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. They were identified within a size-fractionated library of cDNAs (here made by PCR instead of cloning) and they are predicted to match a model of fold-back precursor structure and microRNAs biogenesis, as judged within the mirDeep algorithm using RNAfold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Friedlander1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Gruber1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. At this stage the predicted microRNAs have not been demonstrated to exhibit increased precursor accumulation following Dicer knockdown&#x02014;this would be technically difficult for a large number of precursors in hESC cultures. While it is possible to obtain transient Dicer knockdown using siRNAs (not shown), selection of stably transfected hESC lines often leads to differentiation, altering microRNA expression patterns. Finally, the requirement for phylogenetic conservation cannot be demonstrated for the majority of these microRNAs since we hypothesize that they are recently evolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007192-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). However, within the established criteria, one mode of acceptance is strong evidence of expression and the establishment of a hairpin structure on the precursor. These two criteria were tested here. Sequencing detected both mature and star strands of a computed hairpin. Furthermore, we conservatively filtered the predictions for expression in multiple cell lines in multiple differentiation stages. We also tested predictions for co-immunoprecipitation with Ago2, an indication of the presence in a RISC ribonucleoprotein complex. The inclusion of this final validation step, we believe, provides valuable proof that at least these predicted microRNAs found associated with Ago2 should be acceptable as microRNAs.</p><p>Association with Ago2 alone is not sufficient to define a microRNA. For example, recent studies found Ago2 bound with dsRNAs associated with promoter elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Li1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, Dicer cleavage products of snoRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Ender1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, or mitochondrial tRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Maniataki1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our screening strategy specifically identified Drosha-like substrate structures in genomic DNA and subtracted other classes of known small RNAs including tRNAs and snoRNAs, supporting our conclusion that we have identified new microRNAs. One way to substantiate this claim is to demonstrate cleavage of predicted precursors by Microprocessor complex by inhibiting the RNA binding protein DGCR8, as has been done in mouse ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Wang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We attempted this by transient transfection of DGCR8-specific siRNAs into hESC cultures. While this technique was successful at reducing DGCR8 mRNA, by 3 days after transfection it did not alter levels of DGCR8 protein, as judged by Westerns or of known microRNAs, as judged by qPCR (not shown). Creating stably transfected lines from hESC is difficult since the cells tend to differentiate upon long-term selection. We will continue to search for appropriate methods to demonstrate that the predicted precursors are processed by microRNA pathways.</p><p>The discovery of new microRNAs in hESC and their differentiating cellular products provides the basis for a complex regulatory network. Regulated expression of microRNAs upon differentiation satisfies the hypothesized role of microRNAs in canalization, or stabilization of nascent cell types in the face of stochastic regulatory drift. An elegant hypothesis was recently published considering the evolutionary pressures on microRNAs and how they may function to stabilize species identities or even cell types from one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Wu2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. These authors conjecture that microRNAs have dual functions: gene expression tuning and expression buffering, and that both of these contribute to stabilizing homeostasis. Furthermore, the action of microRNAs on translation may be modest&#x02014;few examples show more than 50&#x00025; change in target protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Baek1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Wu and colleagues consider that microRNAs, as agents of stabilization, may only be phenotypically functional when homeostasis is perturbed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007192-Wu2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In the context of stem cell differentiation, this may be just the case&#x02014;that the perturbation of homeostasis from pluripotency to differentiation programs is exactly the situation when the function of microRNAs is most important. The expanded number of microRNAs found in this study and associated with RISC provides a broad collection of molecules poised to reinforce the dynamic stability of cell type-specific phenotypes during early hESC development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007192.s001"><label>Methods S1</label><caption><p>(0.26 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007192.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007192.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Summary of SOLiD experiments.

Predicted microRNAs were assayed in small RNA SREK libraries by SYBR green qPCR (SYBR Green Master Mix, Applied Biosystems) using one microRNA-specific primer and one primer specific for the library (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTC CTG TAC GGC CAA GGC G-3&#x02032;</named-content>). Custom microRNA probes were designed by synthesizing DNA oligos identical to the probed RNAs. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> show the C<sub>t</sub> value (mean of two technical replicates) for each RNA. The &#x0201c;delC<sub>t</sub>&#x0201d; was calculated by subtracting the detected C<sub>t</sub> for the spiked-in NCode control small RNA (see text). If qPCR product was not observed for a probe (blank entry in C<sub>t</sub> column), 40 cycles was substituted to calculate the minimum observable quantity of target. The &#x0201c;deldelC<sub>t</sub>&#x0201d; subtracts the delC<sub>t</sub> for IgG background from the Ago2 delC<sub>t</sub>, and the resulting value is used to calculate relative quantity (RQ) by raising 2 to the power of the deldelC<sub>t</sub>. In this case, RQ refers to the relative enrichment of the target RNA by Ago2 IP over background IgG IP.</p><p>(0.05 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007192.s012.xls"
