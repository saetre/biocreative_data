However, our previous work suggested that at least 50% of thymic DCs originate independently of these progenitors. We now formally demonstrate by parabiotic, adoptive transfer, and developmental studies that two of the three major subsets of thymic DCs originate extrathymically and continually migrate to the thymus, where they occupy a finite number of microenvironmental niches. The thymus-homing DCs consisted of immature plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and the signal regulatory protein &#x003b1;&#x02013;positive (Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup>) CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subset of conventional DCs (cDCs), both of which could take up and transport circulating antigen to the thymus. The cDCs of intrathymic origin were mostly Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>hi</sup> cells. Upon arrival in the thymus, the migrant pDCs enlarged and up-regulated CD11c, major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II), and CD8&#x003b1;, but maintained their plasmacytoid morphology. In contrast, the migrant cDCs proliferated extensively, up-regulated CD11c, MHC II, and CD86, and expressed dendritic processes. The possible functional implications of these findings are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Three major subsets of DCs have been identified in the mouse and human thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). The most intensively studied subset in the mouse has a signal regulatory protein &#x003b1;&#x02013;negative (Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>hi</sup> phenotype and is thought to arise intrathymically from a common T cell/DC precursor. These conventional DCs (cDCs) are generally presumed to be involved in the negative selection of developing thymocytes. In contrast, the origins and in vivo functions of the two other subsets of thymic DCs are unknown. One subset is composed of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and the other is composed of Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cDCs.</p><p>In previous parabiotic and adoptive transfer experiments, we provided evidence that at least 50% of the DCs in the steady-state thymus developed independently of thymocyte progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). These included pDCs and possibly the subset of CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cDCs. In contrast, most of the DCs whose generation was linked to the importation of thymocyte progenitors were CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>hi</sup> cDCs, as also suggested by the experiments of Porritt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). These results raised the possibility that two of the three subsets of thymic DCs might be formed extrathymically.</p><p>In studies involving the induction of immune deviation (Th1 to Th2 polarization) in mice injected intraocularly with antigen, we detected a population of F4/80<sup>+</sup> antigen-presenting cells that migrated to the thymus and activated NKT reg cells (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). We also observed that self&#x02013;MHC II&#x02013;specific CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T reg cells appeared in the thymus of post&#x02013;cyclosporin A (CSA)&#x02013;treated mice at the time when an influx of tolerogenic DCs from the periphery occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). In addition, abundant evidence from other laboratories has demonstrated that thymus-homing inflammatory DCs can induce both dominant and deletional tolerance to peripheral self- and nonself-antigens (see Discussion). These observations led us to hypothesize that, in addition to the promiscuous intrathymic expression of tissue-restricted antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), the migration of DCs from the blood to thymus constituted a major pathway by which the induction of dominant and deletional thymic tolerance to peripheral self- and nonself-antigens may also occur under steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>Although the present study does not formally test this hypothesis, it does provide supporting data by demonstrating that (a) most, if not all, of the pDCs and approximately one third of the cDCs (those expressing Sirp&#x003b1; and CD11b) in the steady-state thymus are recent emigrants from the blood; (b) immature, noninflammatory, thymus-homing pDCs and cDCs can take up both soluble and particulate circulating antigen and transport it to the thymus; (c) once in the thymus, the pDCs enlarge and assume a semimature phenotype by up-regulating CD11c, MHC II, and CD8&#x003b1; (but not CD86) while maintaining a plasmacytoid morphology; and (d) the thymus-homing Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs proliferate extensively in the thymus, up-regulate CD86 as well as CD11c and MHC II, and assume a mature DC morphology. Some of the functional implications of these findings have recently been reported by Proietto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), who observed that the Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> subset of thymic cDCs could induce CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells from CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes in vitro, and that thymus-homing DCs could induce antigen-specific (OVA) deletion and T reg cell formation in transplanted thymus lobes in vivo. Given the propensity of semimature pDCs to induce T reg cells in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), it is possible that they too may contribute to the induction of central tolerance.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Migration of DCs to the thymus in parabiotic mice</title><p>Our previous experiments suggested that 50% of the total DCs present in the thymi of adult mice arise independently of thymocyte progenitors and may have emigrated in a preformed state from the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In this study, we set up pairs of parabiotic mice between CD45.1 and CD45.2 partners to confirm this hypothesis and to determine the phenotypes and origins of the partner-derived thymic DCs. In these experiments, partner-derived pDCs and cDCs in the blood and thymus were examined 3 wk after parabiotic union, when thymocyte chimerism was still very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Because T cells are exchanged randomly in the blood of parabiotic partners but few migrate to the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), we used them as a standard against which to judge the efficiency of cross-transfer and thymic migration of hematogenous DCs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Partner-derived DCs in the blood and thymus of parabiotic mice.</bold> CD45.1 and CD45.2 congenic mice or eGFP tg and WT mice were joined by cutaneous vascular anastomosis.

Five-color FACS analysis for CD45.1, CD45.2, or GFP plus CD11c, B220, Sirp&#x003b1;, and one of the other surface antigens listed in D was performed on each sample.

This suggested that most pDCs recirculate in the blood but that most cDCs do not. Similarly, &#x0223c;50% of the pDCs and 15% of the cDCs in each thymus were partner derived. Given that &#x0223c;30% of the total DCs in the thymus were pDCs and 70% were cDCs, it can be calculated that partner-derived DCs comprised &#x0223c;25% of the total DCs in each thymus (0.5 &#x000d7; 30% pDCs + 0.15 &#x000d7; 70% cDCs). By doubling these figures to allow for an equivalent contribution by thymus-homing host-origin DCs, we estimate that &#x0223c;50% of the total DCs in each thymus (i.e., most if not all of the pDCs and about one third of the cDCs) had been formed extrathymically and/or had originated from committed thymus-homing precursors. As shown by immunohistology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), most of the partner-derived DCs (GFP<sup>+</sup> in this case) were comingled with the host-origin DCs in the thymus medulla and corticomedullary regions.</p><p>These results clearly indicated that the partner-derived pDCs had migrated randomly from the blood to thymus and reached equilibrium within 3 wk. However, as the partner-derived cDCs constituted &#x0003c;15% of the total cDCs in the blood and thymus, it was not possible to deduce whether they too had reached equilibrium. To do this, it first was necessary to distinguish the thymus-homing cDC subset from other cDCs in the blood and thymus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, almost all of the partner-derived cDCs in the blood and thymus were Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> MHC II<sup>+</sup>, and &#x0223c;20% of those in the thymus were CD8&#x003b1;<sup>lo/int</sup>. In contrast, the major subset of host-derived cDCs in the blood and thymus were Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MHC II<sup>+</sup>, and almost all of those in the thymus were CD8&#x003b1;<sup>hi</sup> (unpublished data). As with the pDCs, &#x0223c;50% of the total Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs in both the blood and thymus were partner derived. Therefore, it can be deduced that the partner-derived cDCs also equilibrated between the blood and thymus within 3 wk of parabiotic union. However, as the partner-derived cDCs in the thymus expressed higher mean levels of Sirp&#x003b1; and MHC II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), they appeared to be more mature than those in the blood. Similarly, the partner-derived pDCs in the thymus expressed higher levels of MHC II, and almost all displayed CD8&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the intrathymic origin of the Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>hi</sup> subset of thymic cDCs, mice were parabiosed for 3 wk, and then separated and rested for 4 wk. Our prediction, based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), was that partner-derived thymocyte progenitors would enter the thymus at some point during the first 3 wk of parabiosis and would generate a wave of thymocytes and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cDCs thereafter. However, because of the absence of significant bone marrow chimerism at this time, the partner-derived pDCs and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs in the blood would not be replenished during the month of separation. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref> are compatible with this scenario.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration of DCs to the thymus after adoptive transfer</title><p>Collectively, the results in the parabiotic mice suggested that small numbers of pDCs and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs continuously enter the steady-state thymus from the blood. To test this prediction, nonirradiated WT mice were injected i.v. with 20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> nucleated blood cells from enhanced GFP (eGFP) transgenic (tg) mice, a cell dose that contained approximately the same number and variety of DCs as are normally present in the blood (&#x0223c;2.5 ml) of an adult mouse. At timed intervals, the numbers and identities of the donor-origin DCs in the thymus were determined by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Migration of DCs to the thymus of normal adoptive recipients.</bold> (A) 20 million nucleated blood cells from adult eGFP tg mice were injected i.v. into 5&#x02013;7-wk-old nonirradiated WT recipients.

Thymic cDCs and pDCs from GFP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> control mice were used to determine background fluorescence. More than 90% of the B220<sup>+</sup> donor-origin cells were PDCA<sup>+</sup> Gr-1<sup>+</sup> NK1.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and &#x0003e;90% of the B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup> donor-origin cells were PDCA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Gr-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK1.1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).

(B) Time&#x02013;response. WT mice were injected i.v. with 20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> bone marrow cells from eGFP tg mice, the thymocytes were harvested at the indicated times thereafter, and the percentage of the total cDCs and pDCs that were of donor origin (GFP<sup>+</sup>) were determined. A representative analysis from one out of three experiments is shown. (C) Dose&#x02013;response. The total numbers of donor-origin (GFP<sup>+</sup>) pDCs and cDCs in the recipient thymus were determined 2 d after i.v. injection of graded numbers of bone marrow cells from eGFP tg mice, as indicated. Each point represents the mean &#x000b1; SD of five recipients from one out of two experiments. (D) The sensitivity of the PCR assay was determined by serial dilution of thymic DNA from eGFP tg mice (lanes 10 to 12), and the numbers of cell equivalents were determined by dividing the pg of DNA by 6.24. Further resolution between 62.4 and 6.24 pg DNA revealed a sensitivity of two cell equivalents (not depicted). The sensitivity of the PCR assay was also determined by analyzing purposeful mixtures of GFP<sup>+</sup> thymic DCs and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes (lanes 3&#x02013;9) or a mixture of 62.4 pg GFP<sup>+</sup> DNA with 1.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> pg GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DNA (lanes 2 and 3). Lane 1 represents a 100-bp DNA ladder. A representative analysis from one out of eight experiments is shown. (E) Multiple injections.

Both the donor-origin pDCs and cDCs persisted in the thymus for at least 10 d but were absent by 30 d. Results of multiple experiments showed that a mean of 4.5 &#x000b1; 0.6% of the total pDCs and 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.4% of the total cDCs were of donor origin at 2 d. As 30% of the total DCs in the thymus were pDCs and 70% were cDCs, it can be calculated that the ratio of donor-origin pDCs to cDCs in the thymus at this time was 2:1 (0.045 &#x000d7; 30% pDCs/0.009 &#x000d7; 70% cDCs). Similar results were obtained after i.v. injection of 20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> lymph node, spleen, bone marrow, or thymus cells, even though the thymus cell suspensions contained &#x0223c;10% of the number of DCs as the others did (unpublished data).</p><p>Dose&#x02013;response experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) demonstrated roughly parallel saturation kinetics for the donor-origin pDCs and cDCs 2 d after the injection of between 5 and 100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> bone marrow cells. This suggested that the thymus has a finite number of niches for migrating DCs. Given the small number of donor-origin DCs present in the thymus 2 d after i.v. injection (&#x0223c;8,000), we verified the results obtained by FACS analysis by nested PCR for GFP genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). We also excluded the possibility that most of the donor-origin DCs were located in the blood passing through the thymus. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) and observed in this study, &#x0003c;1% of the injected DCs were present in heart blood after 2 d. Therefore, assuming a blood volume of 10% of organ weight, a maximum of only 18 GFP<sup>+</sup> cells could have been present in the &#x0223c;7 &#x000b5;l of thymus blood. The additional possibility that the donor-origin DCs were sequestered in the thymic blood vessels was excluded by examining immunohistological sections (unpublished data). Instead, as in the parabiotic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), almost all of the donor-origin DCs were located extravascularly in the medullary regions.</p><p>To gain some insight into relative turnover rates of thymus-homing pDCs and cDCs, mice were injected i.v. on alternate days with saturating doses of bone marrow cells for a total of five injections. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>, the number of donor-origin pDCs in the thymus 2 d after the fifth injection was four times greater than after the first injection. However, the number of donor-origin cDCs was only twofold greater. Hence, the turnover rate of the donor-origin DCs in the thymus appeared to approximate 12 d for the pDCs but only 3&#x02013;4 d for the cDCs. These results are consistent with the equilibration rate for pDCs in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), and with the reported life spans of pDCs and cDCs in the normal mouse spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). However, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and in experiments in the following two sections are more compatible with a 10-d turnover rate for the donor-origin cDCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Antigenic phenotypes of donor-origin DCs in the blood and thymus</title><p>As in the parabiotic mice, almost all of the donor-origin cDCs in the thymus 2 d after i.v. transfer of blood cells were Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Of note, between 10 and 15% of the donor-origin pDCs and cDCs in the thymus at day 2 were MHC II<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, reflecting their frequency in the blood (unpublished data). This was also true at 6 h. As demonstrated in the section on monocytes (see below), the MHC II<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cDC precursors did not appear to be monocytes. Hence, although most of the pDCs and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs enter the thymus in a preformed state, committed DC precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) also enter.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Surface phenotypes of donor-origin DCs in the blood and thymus of adoptive recipients.</bold> 20 million blood cells from eGFP<sup>+</sup> tg mice (input) were injected i.v. into normal WT recipients.

In addition, the proportion of donor-origin cDCs in the thymus that were MHC II<sup>int/hi</sup> increased progressively between 6 and 48 h, and greatly exceeded that in the original inoculum. These results suggest that thymus-homing cDCs, but not pDCs, mature shortly after entering the thymus. However, as shown in the following section, pDCs attain a semimature state and express CD8&#x003b1; between days 2 and 10.</p></sec><sec><title>Proliferation and maturation of thymus-homing DCs</title><p>In the course of these studies, we noted that two populations of DCs in the secondary lymphoid tissues of normal eGFP tg mice could be distinguished by their relative levels of GFP expression, the majority being GFP<sup>hi</sup> and the minority being GFP<sup>lo</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). This was also true for the steady-state thymus, in which the GFP<sup>lo</sup> and GFP<sup>hi</sup> DCs exhibited relatively immature and mature antigenic phenotypes, respectively (unpublished data). Although GFP under the control of the actin promoter is not a specific marker for DC maturation, the GFP<sup>lo</sup> thymic DCs appeared to be small round cells by light scatter analysis, and the GFP<sup>hi</sup> DCs appeared to be either large round or large irregular cells. This was confirmed by the morphologies of FACS-sorted GFP<sup>lo</sup> and GFP<sup>hi</sup> thymic DCs, especially when subdivided into CD11c<sup>lo</sup> and CD11c<sup>hi</sup> subsets. Thus, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, the GFP<sup>lo</sup> CD11c<sup>lo</sup> DC fraction contained a mixture of small round and plasmacytoid cells, the GFP<sup>lo</sup> CD11c<sup>hi</sup> fraction contained mostly medium-sized plasmacytoid cells, the GFP<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>hi</sup> fraction contained large DCs, and the GFP<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>lo</sup> fraction (not depicted) contained a mixture of large DCs and large plasmacytoid cells. Additionally, many of the DCs were undergoing mitosis, especially in the GFP<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>hi</sup> fraction. Strikingly, at day 2 after adoptive transfer, most of the donor-origin DCs in the thymus were GFP<sup>lo</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), whereas by day 10 &#x0223c;75% of the donor-origin DCs were GFP<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). It is unlikely that the GFP<sup>hi</sup> DCs represented a separate migratory wave, as donor-origin GFP<sup>hi</sup> DCs were rare in the blood at 48 h. Therefore, we presume that the GFP<sup>hi</sup> donor-origin thymic pDCs and cDCs on day 10 were derived from the GFP<sup>lo</sup> DCs.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Activation, maturation, and proliferation of the DCs that enter the thymus.</bold> (A) Distribution of DCs in the blood, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow from normal eGFP tg mice according to relative fluorescence intensity (high/low) for GFP and CD11c.

This appeared to be true for the cDCs, as &#x0003c;1% of the 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD)&#x02013;labeled CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs in the blood were cycling, whereas &#x0223c;25% of the GFP<sup>lo</sup> and 50% of the GFP<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs in the steady-state thymus were in S/G<sub>2</sub>/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). In contrast, the proportions of cycling pDCs in the blood and thymus were low (10&#x02013;15%) and relatively constant. Thus, the CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs appeared to undergo a burst of proliferation shortly after entering the thymus but, as in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), the pDCs did not. This was verified by adoptive transfer experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>), in which &#x0223c;45% of the donor-origin cDCs but only 15% of the donor-origin pDCs in the thymus were in cycle at 48 h. Overall, the immature thymus-homing CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs proliferated and differentiated into mature interdigitating DCs in the thymus, and the immature thymus-homing pDCs became semimature, possibly without the need for proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Monocytes fail to migrate to the thymus in the steady state</title><p>Monocytes have been shown to generate cDCs under inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), and it is possible that they may also do so in the steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).

The present study indicates that two of these thymic DC subsets, namely pDCs and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs, arise extrathymically and continually migrate from the blood to thymus. Vandenabeele et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>) have proposed a similar scenario regarding the CD11b<sup>+</sup> subset of cDCs in the human thymus. Strictly speaking, many of the mature Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs in the thymus probably are formed intrathymically by proliferating Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> MHC II<sup>lo</sup> cDCs and/or their Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> MHC II<sup>&#x02212;</sup> precursors that have emigrated from the blood. However, for convenience we refer to this cDC subset as being of extrathymic origin.</p><p>In contrast, the Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CDllb<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>hi</sup> subset of thymic cDCs appears to arise entirely within the thymus, presumably from a common T cell/DC precursor. This was shown by age&#x02013;response experiments in which the Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>hi</sup> subset of donor-origin cDCs appeared in the thymus only when the &#x0201c;gates&#x0201d; for thymocyte progenitor entry were open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), and by developmental studies in which the vast majority of WT DCs that formed after transfer of WT bone marrow cells into nonirradiated IL-7R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice or of Rag<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells into irradiated WT recipients were Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>hi</sup>. These results are consistent with earlier precursor-product studies of &#x0201c;low CD4&#x0201d; thymocyte precursors and CD8<sup>&#x02212;/lo</sup> and CD8<sup>hi</sup> thymic cDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), as well as with adoptive transfer experiments involving Rag<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, Notch-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, Tef-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and IL-7R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). They are also consistent with the observation that the earliest intrathymic thymocyte progenitors (CD4<sup>lo</sup>) did not generate significant numbers of thymic pDCs upon in vivo transfer, although they could readily generate cDCs (unpublished data). However, they differ from the observation of Weijer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>) that CD34<sup>+</sup> cells generated pDCs when injected i.v. or directly into human fetal thymus fragments in RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x003b3;c <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. It is possible, of course, that the latter results may not be applicable to the intact adult mouse thymus and, in the case of i.v. injection, may be explained by the migration of extrathymically generated pDCs to the thymus. Similarly, Ito et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>) have reported that IL-18 or a combination of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-3, and TNF-&#x003b1; induced the in vitro generation of CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cDCs from fetal or adult DN1 and DN2 thymocytes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). However, their experiments did not address the question of the origins of CD11b<sup>+</sup> thymic cDCs in vivo.</p><p>In dose&#x02013;response experiments, the migration of both pDCs and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs to the thymus obeyed strict saturation kinetics, suggesting that the adult thymus has a finite number of niches for immigrating DCs. In addition, the seeding efficiencies to the thymus of pDCs and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs from the blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow approximated 10% when the proportions of the input numbers of DCs that entered the thymus within 2 d were calculated. However, in the case of GFP<sup>lo</sup> (immature) thymic DCs (the GFP<sup>hi</sup> [mature] DCs did not return to thymus), the seeding efficiency approximated 50%. This striking result is consistent with that of Duncan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) but differs from that of Bonasio et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), who reported that splenic DCs were recruited to the thymus with efficiencies equal to or better than that of thymic DCs and that all subsets of splenic DCs had thymus migratory activity. Although the reasons for these differences are unclear, it should be noted that Flt-3L&#x02013;stimulated DCs were used in the latter experiments and that the numbers of DCs transferred (5&#x02013;20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) greatly exceeded those routinely used in this study (&#x0223c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a very small proportion of the cDCs that reached the thymus in our experiments had a Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>hi</sup> phenotype.</p><p>In agreement with the present results, Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>) have recently reported that most DCs are not exchanged randomly between parabiotic partners, presumably because they have a short half-life in the blood. In the present study, we identified the DCs that were randomly exchanged between parabiotic partners as immature pDCs and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/lo</sup> cDCs. In addition, Liu et al. found that the DCs in the blood were in equilibrium with those in the spleen and lymph nodes, suggesting that most DCs in these organs were derived from circulating precursors. We previously observed a similar phenomenon regarding the equilibration of thymocyte progenitor activity between the blood and thymus of parabiotic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that the circulating pDCs and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs reached equilibrium with their counterparts in the thymus within 3 wk after parabiotic union.</p><p>The reasons for the selective migration of pDCs and SIRP&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>cDCs to the steady-state thymus are not known but presumably are related to the expression of a novel combination of adhesion molecules and chemotactic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). It is also possible that Sirp&#x003b1; itself is involved in this migratory behavior, as Sirp&#x003b1; signaling modulates transendothelial and transepithelial migration and enables Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DCs (both pDCs and cDCs) to traverse the high endothelial venules in the lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Significantly, the increased migration of immature DCs through high endothelial venules has been reported to enhance the induction of antigen-specific T reg cells in lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), possibly because the Sirp&#x003b1; protein, when engaged by its ligand (CD47), causes a shift in cytokine profiles and the formation of semimature DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). A similar function in the thymus could theoretically lead to the development of antigen-specific T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the situation in the peripheral lymphoid tissues, the Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs that enter the thymus up-regulate CD80 and CD86 as well as CD11c and MHC II. In addition, they proliferate extensively and differentiate into mature interdigitating cDCs over a 10-d period. Intriguingly, Watanabe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) have reported that thymic stromal lymphopoietin&#x02013;producing medullary epithelial cells stimulated some thymic DCs to up-regulate MHC II, CD80, and CD86, and induce the formation of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> thymic T reg cells. The present experiments raise the possibility that the subset of Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs may participate in this phenomenon, as it was the only DC subset that underwent large-scale activation in the steady-state thymus. Indeed, Proietto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) have recently reported that Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs from the thymus but not the spleen induced CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells from CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes but not splenocytes in vitro, suggesting that this phenomenon was thymus specific. They also demonstrated that, unlike splenic cDCs, both the Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subsets of thymic cDCs could acquire and cross-present cell-associated OVA to CD8 OT-1 T cells, and that both thymic DC subsets were superior to their splenic counterparts in presenting OVA on MHC II to CD4 OT-II T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Furthermore, given that pDCs achieve a semimature status after migration to the thymus, the possibility also exists that they too may be able to induce T reg cells and/or NKT reg cells in the thymus, much as they do in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>).</p><p>In this respect, many investigators have shown that inflammatory DCs can migrate to the thymus and induce CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T reg cells and/or activate NKT reg cells. For example, Khoury et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>) demonstrated that thymic DCs pulsed in situ with myelin basic protein induced protective antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T reg cells when infused into naive euthymic, but not thymectomized, mice. Other investigators have reported that the migration of donor-origin DCs to the thymus after heart, lung, and renal allografting was associated with the formation of MHC II&#x02013;allospecific CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). A similar mechanism may play a role in establishing tolerance by pretransplant infusion of donor lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Indeed, migration of semiallogeneic DCs to the thymus after treatment with CSA or LF15-0195 has been found to expand CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>); we have also observed the formation of self&#x02013;MHC II&#x02013;specific CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> thymic T reg cells that prevent autologous graft-versus-host disease in CSA-treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). We have also observed that circulating F4/80<sup>+</sup> antigen-presenting cells activate NKT reg cells in the thymus after the intraocular injection of foreign antigen (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Some of these and related observations have already been applied therapeutically in the management of autoimmune disorders and the prevention of allograft rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>).</p><p>This then leaves the question of the functions of thymus-homing DCs in the steady state. We have previously postulated that noninflammatory DCs, like inflammatory DCs, are involved in inducing dominant and deletional thymic tolerance by transporting and presenting peripheral self- and nonself-antigens to the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). The present study identifies a mechanism by which this might occur by demonstrating (a) the existence of a physiological blood-to-thymus migration pathway for noninflammatory pDCs and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs, (b) the ability of these DCs to acquire and transport circulating antigen to the thymus, and (c) the ability of these DCs to differentiate into semimature pDCs and mature cDCs once in the thymus. That these thymic-homing DCs constitute fully one half of the DCs normally found in the adult thymus further attests to their probable importance in thymic function. Furthermore, as circulating immature DCs routinely capture bloodborne antigens, and some tissue-resident DCs enter the blood after acquiring antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>), it seems likely that DCs routinely transport antigen to the thymus, much as they do to the secondary lymphoid tissues. Support for this notion has recently been provided by Bonasio et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>), who detected antigen-specific deletional tolerance in the thymus of recipients of immature OVA-pulsed DCs. These investigators also observed central deletional tolerance to membrane-bound OVA on cardiac myocytes in OT-II bone marrow radiation chimeras, presumably because of thymus-homing DCs. Additionally, Proietto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) have recently attributed the occurrence of both negative selection and the induction of antigen-specific T reg cells in the thymus of Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>OTII/CD11c OVA double-tg bone marrow chimeras to the migration of peripheral DCs to the thymus.</p><p>An especially rich source of tissue-specific self-antigens for thymus-homing DCs could be apoptotic cells, which express CD47, the ligand for Sirp&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>). In addition, the establishment by thymus-homing DCs of central tolerance to innocuous foreign antigens might be of special importance, as most of these antigens would not be ectopically expressed in and might not otherwise reach the thymus. Nonetheless, given the apparently broad diversity of the TCR repertoires of intrathymically generated T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>), T reg cells that down-regulate immune responses to toxic or pathogenic antigens might also be formed. Under these circumstances, the induction of peripheral immunity and dominant central tolerance would have to be tightly coordinated so as to permit effective protection while preventing excessive tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>). We have previously observed such a phenomenon in the formation and release of waves of purified protein derivative&#x02013; and OVA-specific &#x0201c;suppressor&#x0201d; T cells from the thymus on days 4 and 9&#x02013;12, respectively, after the induction of an immune response to the footpad injection of OVA in CFA (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>). Hence, it can be envisioned that dominant and/or deletional thymic tolerance to a broad spectrum of extrathymically expressed antigens is induced continuously by thymus-homing DCs in the steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), as well as being induced intermittently in the inflammatory state. In the latter instance, it is possible that monocyte-derived DCs may be involved (unpublished data). However, until definitive functional studies are conducted, the precise roles of the thymus-homing DCs in the steady state remain speculative.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Functional implications of the blood-to-thymus migration pathway for DCs in the steady state.</bold> In this scheme, &#x0223c;50% of the total DCs in the steady-state thymus represent and/or arise from thymus-homing immature DCs or their immediate MHC II<sup>&#x02212;</sup> precursors in the blood. Virtually all of the pDCs and approximately one third of the cDCs in the thymus originate in this manner. The thymus-homing cDCs can be distinguished from the major population of intrathymic cDCs by the expression of Sirp&#x003b1; and CD11b, and the lack of expression of CD8&#x003b1;. Immature thymus-homing pDCs and cDCs acquire and process self- and nonself-antigens in the periphery under noninflammatory conditions and transport them to the thymus. Once in the thymus, (a) the pDCs and Sirp&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cDCs occupy recently vacated niches in the medullary and corticomedullary regions, (b) the pDCs develop a semimature phenotype, and (c) the cDCs undergo activation, proliferation, and maturation into fully differentiated DCs. We propose as a working hypothesis that one or both of these thymus-homing DC populations assist, directly or indirectly, in the induction of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells and/or in antigen-specific negative selection. As a consequence, the diversity of the TCR repertoire of T reg and effector T cells in the thymus is continually altered to reflect the changing antigenic milieu in the periphery, especially to myriad foreign and some tissue-specific antigens that are not ectopically expressed by the thymic epithelium.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20082232_RGB_Fig7"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Animals.</title><p>Congenic Ly5.1 C57BL/6N and B6-Ly5.2/Cr mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.

Conjugated antibodies to CD8&#x003b1;, CD80, CD86, MHC II, PDCA, and CD24 were purchased from eBioscience. Biotinylated anti-SIRP&#x003b1; was a gift from W. Li (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia). The expression of these antigens (and GFP) was determined by simultaneous three- to five-color fluorescence analysis on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, modified FACScan, or LSR II; BD). Three-color analyses were done using FITC-, PE-, APC-, or biotin (plus avidin PerCP-Cy5.5)-conjugated antibodies; four-color analyses used all of these conjugates, whereas five-color analyses used these conjugates plus APC-Cy7&#x02013; or Pacific blue&#x02013;conjugated antibodies. Compensation was done for each fluorochrome to calculate spectral overlap. In parabiotic and adoptive transfer experiments, eGFP or the CD45.1 and CD45.2 alleles were used to identify donor and host-origin cells, and normal mice that were either eGFP<sup>+</sup> or eGFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, or CD45.1<sup>+</sup> or CD45.2<sup>+</sup> were included as positive and negative fluorescence controls. For multicolor analysis, mixtures of all of the conjugated antibodies minus the relevant antibody were used to determine background fluorescence, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Five million nucleated cells per sample were routinely analyzed to ensure that sufficient DCs were represented (&#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> cells in the blood and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> cells in the thymus). Results were confirmed by the periodic analysis of DCs enriched on Nycodenz gradients (see the following section).

Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing the marrow plugs from the femur and tibia, and dispersing the cells by gentle pipetting. Tissue fragments from the thymus (stripped of attached lymph nodes), lymph nodes, and spleen were digested for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C in RPMI 1640 medium with 2% fetal calf serum containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.02 mg/ml DNAase (Boehringer Mannheim) and were mixed in EDTA (5-mM final concentration) for 5 min. No differences in the migratory behavior of the DCs were observed between the enzyme-treated or untreated cell suspensions, but almost twice the number of DCs were recovered after the enzyme treatment. In some experiments, DCs from the cell suspensions were enriched (40&#x02013;50% purity) by centrifugation in Nycodenz medium (Optiprep 9.5%; Sigma-Aldrich). In other experiments, subsets of DCs were purified (&#x0003e;98%) by sorting on a flow cytometer (Vantage SE; BD).</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of monocytes.</title><p>Monocytes (90&#x02013;95% purity) were obtained from blood by negative selection on an immunomagnetic column (Miltenyi Biotec). Nucleated cells were labeled with antibodies for MHC II, CD45R, CD43, and CD24 according to the method of Leon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), treated with MACS anti&#x02013;rat &#x003ba; microbeads (20 &#x000b5;l/10<sup>7</sup>cells), loaded onto an LS column (500 &#x000b5;l of buffer/10<sup>8</sup> cells), and placed in a magnetic field. The unlabeled fraction (monocyte enriched) was collected in the pass-through fraction, and the labeled fraction (monocyte depleted) was flushed out of the column. The monocyte-enriched fraction was further purified by passage through an MS column. The purity of the monocyte-enriched fraction was then assessed by FACS analysis of light scatter, positive staining for CD11b and F4/80, variable staining (neg/lo or int/hi) for Gr-1, and negative staining for CD11c, CD45R, and MHC II.

At timed intervals after cell transfer, donor-origin cells (GFP<sup>+</sup>) in tissue-cell suspensions were identified, quantified, and phenotyped for surface markers by four- or five-color flow cytometry. In other experiments, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> blood cells or proportionate numbers of DCs or monocytes therein were injected intrathymically into the anterior superior portion of each lobe (10 &#x000b5;l per site) using a 1-ml syringe (with attached 28-gauge needle) mounted on a Tridek Stepper (Indicon), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>).

The amplified PCR products were separated on agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide. The sensitivity of the PCR assay was determined by serial dilution of DNA from GFP tg mice and by the use of purposeful mixtures of GFP<sup>+</sup> DCs and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymus cells.
