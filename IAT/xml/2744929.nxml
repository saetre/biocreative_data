One such example is provided by studies on the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 helicase using single molecule mechanical experiments. HCV currently infects nearly 3&#x00025; of the world population and NS3 is a protein essential for viral genome replication. The objective of this study is to model the RNA unwinding mechanism based on previously published data and study its characteristics and their dependence on force, ATP and NS3 protein concentration. In this work, RNA unwinding by NS3 helicase is hypothesized to occur in a series of discrete steps and the steps themselves occurring in accordance with an underlying point process. A point process driven change point model is employed to model the RNA unwinding mechanism. The results are in large agreement with findings in previous studies. A gamma distribution based renewal process was found to model well the point process that drives the unwinding mechanism. The analysis suggests that the periods of constant extension observed during NS3 activity can indeed be classified into pauses and subpauses and that each depend on the ATP concentration. The step size is independent of external factors and seems to have a median value of 11.37 base pairs. The steps themselves are composed of a number of substeps with an average of about 4 substeps per step and an average substep size of about 3.7 base pairs. An interesting finding pertains to the stepping velocity. Our analysis indicates that stepping velocity may be of two kinds- a low and a high velocity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The study of RNA unwinding by helicases is a problem of basic scientific interest. Recent advances in single molecule techniques have allowed the study of these proteins and their action at an unprecedented detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Dumont1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Myong1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The HCV RNA helicase NS3 is one such example. The Hepatitis C virus infects nearly 3&#x00025; of the world population. NS3, as one of the viral-encoded proteins that are essential for viral genome replication, has been a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Ali1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Serebrov1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> have focused on the RNA unwinding mechanism using bulk measurement techniques. More recently, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Dumont1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> the RNA unwinding mechanism was studied by observing individual mechanistic cycles using optical tweezers. They employed Fourier analysis on the distribution of pairwise distances of the unwinding to study the unwinding characteristics. This work is motivated by these single molecule experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Dumont1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. We aim to perform a statistical analysis on the RNA unwinding data and compare with the conclusions reached before. The results presented here were obtained using the data analysis methods proposed in Arunajadai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Arunajadai1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In this method, RNA unwinding by NS3 is hypothesized to occur in a series of discrete steps. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Dumont1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, Dumont et al. proposed the concept of pauses and subpauses, which are periods of constant extension between the discrete steps observed directly from single molecule experiments. Such behavior has also been observed in single molecular studies involving the separation of double-stranded DNA into two separated single strands at constant force <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Danilowicz1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Weeks1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> which may provide information pertinent to the mechanism of DNA replication. Here the pauses are believed to caused by a series of energy minima where the strand separation halts and will not commence until the energy barrier is overcome. Even in identical molecules the number of base pairs that separate as function of time varies as separation requires random thermal activations that differ in different identical molecules. In this work, a classification algorithm is employed on the periods of constant extensions estimated by the statistical model. This analysis helps one to understand if such distinctions exist and if so, whether the differences are statistically significant. We see that there is reasonable agreement among most of the characteristics of the unwinding mechanism but there are also some new inferences which might be worth further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experiment</title><p>Here we describe the experimental setup followed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Dumont1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> that was used to obtain unwinding trajectories of NS3 helicase in real time. The enzyme used is the full-length protein of the hepatitis C virus helicase (NS3) from HCV genotype 1a. The single molecule assay can directly follow the movement of NS3 on its RNA substrate. The RNA secondary structure used in this experiment is called the hairpin. Optical tweezers are used to apply a constant tension between the two beads attached to the ends of a 60 base-pair (bp) RNA hairpin. The end to end distance change of the RNA is recorded as it is unwound by NS3. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Dumont1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, it is shown that any unwinding of the RNA at external forces below 19 pN (pico Newton, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0006937.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) must be helicase catalyzed. Thus the double stranded RNA is held by the optical tweezers at a constant force ranging between 5 and 17 pN. NS3 and ATP were flown together in a buffer. As NS3 unwinds the hairpin, the distance between the beads increase so as to maintain a constant force on the molecule. For each pair of base-pair unwound a pair of nucleotides (nt) is released. A schematic of the experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g001">figure 1</xref>.

The steps were then detected by scanning for the maximum slope within a running-window. Pause durations were defined as the intervals between two steps and the velocity as the slope from a linear fit. Substeps were then detected using a running-window within a step. Subpauses i.e. periods between substeps were required to be longer than 80 ms. Thus we see that the analysis depends on setting certain conditions like requiring the user to choose an appropriate running window size.

The output from PAM produces what is known as the silhouette width ranging from 0 to 1 for a given cluster size. The greater the value of the silhouette width, the better the classification. A silhouette width ranging between 0.7 and 1 indicates a very strong structure in the classification and between 0.5 and 0.7 indicates a reasonable structure in the classification. We first run PAM individually on the durations across different experiments. Cluster sizes of 2, 3, 4 and 5 were employed. The silhouette plot from one such analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g008">figure 8</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0006937-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006937.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>PAM Silhouette plot.</title><p>Shows classification of periods of constant extension obtained for traces with 1 mM NS3, 1 nM ATP and a force of 13 pN.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006937.g008"/></fig><p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g008">figure 8</xref> that the average silhouette width is highest for the cluster of size 2 with an average of 0.77. This cluster shows that the subpause group (red) has a well pronounced structure while the pause group (blue) has a weaker structure. This could be due to the small number of pauses compared to subpauses. As the number of clusters is increased, the strength of some of the individual groups seems to increase, but the average silhouette width decreases. Thus a cluster of size two seems to do the best classification. This procedure was repeated for durations from other sets of experiments. Each of them consistently chose a cluster of size two with an average silhouette width ranging between 0.74 and 0.77. Thus a cluster of size two seems to be the ideal classification and we will refer to them as pauses and subpauses.</p><p>To avoid misclassification by sheer chance of the observed data we incorporate the PAM classification procedure into a leave-one-out algorithm. We leave one trial out and run PAM on the durations from other trials. Using the results from PAM, the durations from the left out trial are classified as a pause or a subpause. This procedure is repeated for every trial and a given duration is given the majority classification. This reduces the probability of misclassifying a given duration as pause or subpause. It also gives a measure of the sensitivity of a given duration to misclassification, i.e. in what proportion of the leave one out trials was a given duration classified differently from its final classification. A proportion of zero would suggest that a given duration is clearly a pause or a subpause. Higher proportions might indicate borderline values that could have been classified as a pause or a subpause depending on the draw of the data.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g009">Figure 9</xref> shows the empirical distribution of the pauses (a,b) and the subpauses (c,d) respectively. The histograms suggest the distribution is right skewed. The notches in the boxplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g009">figures 9 (b) and 9(d)</xref> seem to overlap suggesting that their median values might be similar at the 5&#x00025; significance level except in the case of the ATP comparison boxplots. The difference is more pronounced in the case of pauses then the subpauses. The outliers in the subpauses are the borderline values suggested by PAM. It was observed from the leave one out PAM classifications that these subpauses were classified as pauses in about a third of the trials. The outliers in the pauses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g009">figure 9(b)</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g010">figure 10</xref> as the horizontal red lines. The black lines show the fitted values superimposed on the raw data represented by the gray lines. Diagnostic checks like the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g005">figure 5</xref> reveal no abnormalities. The consistency of their pattern of occurrence suggests that it might not be appropriate to dismiss them as outliers. They seem to occur consistently either between 2 and 6 seconds or between 4 and 8 seconds. Pauses are the time duration that it takes to break the hydrogen bonds before proceeding with the unwinding process. Thus in the time it takes to break a bond the apparatus records constant extension. A relevant question that merits further investigation with regard to these outlier pauses is, are there particular sequences of RNA that are more difficult to unwind than others? To address this question, the numbers of base pairs of RNA unwound just before the pause and just after the pause were calculated. This segment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g011">figure 11</xref> by the sequence in the gray shaded area. It is seen that except for outlier C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g010">figure 10</xref> the others are overlapping areas in the same region of the sequence. These outliers also account for those that were observed in the QQ-plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g005">figure 5</xref>.

The histogram shows the distribution to be right skewed in all the experiments. The outliers in the boxplot reveal the extent to which the distribution is right skewed. In fact 10&#x00025; of the observation in each category is an outlier. The maximum velocity that the measuring device could follow was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0006937.e073.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> nm/s, the upper limit of which translates to about 230, 222 and 216 bp/s at 13, 15 and 17 pN force respectively. All but five of the estimated velocities were within this limit with the maximum being 273 bp/s.</p><fig id="pone-0006937-g012" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006937.g012</object-id><label>Figure 12</label><caption><title>Histogram and Boxplots of estimated Stepping velocities.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006937.g012"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g013">Figure 13</xref> shows the histograms and the boxplots of the log transformed stepping velocities. One can see from the boxplots that the variance in the velocity has been stabilized and there are no longer any outliers. Though it may not be evident from the boxplots, the histograms (especially the plots on the right and bottom) suggest a bimodal distribution for the log transformed velocities. This leads to the question: do there exist two kinds of stepping velocities like the two kinds of pauses seen before. To see if the velocities can be classified into two distinct groups we run the clustering algorithm partitioning around medoids (PAM) on the velocities from each of the experiments. The algorithm was run for cluster sizes 2, 3, 4 and 5. A cluster of size two was consistently chosen across all the experiments with average silhouette widths ranging between 0.7 and 0.8 indicating a strong structure for the two groups. The leave one out algorithm incorporating PAM was run to classify the velocities into two groups. We refer to them as the low and high velocity groups. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g014">Figure 14</xref> shows the results from the classification of the log transformed velocities into two groups from one set of experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g014">Figure 14 (a)</xref> shows the silhouette plot indicating the cluster structure obtained from PAM. The silhouette widths of 0.78 and 0.8 suggest the existence of two clusters with very strong structures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g014">Figure 14 (b)</xref> is the plot of the histogram of the two groups with the normal density curve overlaid. It shows the existence of two distinct distributions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g014">Figures 14 (c) and (d)</xref> are the quantile-quantile plots of the sample quantiles of the log transformed velocities against the theoretical quantiles of the normal distribution. It can be seen that both the low and high velocities can be well approximated by a normal distribution. Such inferences were drawn from all the experiments. Thus one might infer that the stepping velocities can be classified into low and high and that each of them follow a log-normal distribution. This explains the extreme right skew seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006937-g012">figure 12</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0006937-g013" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006937.g013</object-id><label>Figure 13</label><caption><title>Histograms of Log transformed Stepping velocities.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006937.g013"/></fig><fig id="pone-0006937-g014" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006937.g014</object-id><label>Figure 14</label><caption><title>Classification of Log transformed velocities.</title><p>(a) shows the Silhouette plot from the classification, (b) shows the histograms of the two velocities with the normal density overlaid, (c) and (d) show the QQ-plots of the velocities against the theoretical quantiles of the Normal distribution.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006937.g014"/></fig><p>Hypothesis tests to study the effect of force, NS3 and ATP concentration on velocity seems to suggest that the velocities both low and high are independent of force, NS3 and ATP concentration.

It is worth noting that this work makes only two assumptions-the intervals between the jumps being gamma distributed and the noise being normally distributed. These are assumptions that one can validate after the model is fit. This work avoids assumptions or conditions that either have no basis nor can be verified after model fit. Two characteristics that are worth exploring are</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1. Step size: Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Dumont1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and this work conclude that the step size is independent of the force, NS3 and ATP concentrations but differ in the average step size reported i.e. 11 bp in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Dumont1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and 16 bp in our work. The biologists hypothesize that a 11 bp step size might make more biological sense from the viewpoint of the chemical structure of both RNA and NS3. Due to the right skewed distribution of the step size the median might be a more appropriate statistic to consider. In this work the median step size does appear to be in agreement with the results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Dumont1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. To address this disparity, a future work would be to explore the outlier cases described in this work. What leads to the higher number of substeps between two pauses? Are such behaviors just anomalies? If so, does their exclusion lead to an agreement between step size between the two studies with respect to the mean step size?</p></list-item><list-item><p>2. Stepping Velocity: There are some basic differences in which the velocities are computed in the two studies and as such are incomparable. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006937-Dumont1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> our work suggests that the velocity might be independent of ATP concentration, but one should note that our work classified the velocities into low and high. Further experimental studies might be required to understand the phenomenon. Another area of interest is to study the relation between pauses and their occurrence in relation to the RNA sequence as discussed in this work.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><ack><p>I would like to thank Prof. David Brillinger, Professor of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, for his feedback and suggestions during the course of this work.
