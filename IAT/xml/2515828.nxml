For example, PGE<sub>2 </sub>and PGI<sub>2 </sub>are produced during inflammation and contribute to the direct sensitization of nociceptive neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Downstream of binding to its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), PGE<sub>2 </sub>sensitizes nociceptive neurons to thermal stimuli via PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the heat- and capsaicin-gated <underline>T</underline>ransient <underline>R</underline>eceptor <underline>P</underline>otential (TRP) ion channel TRPV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. TRPV1 is the founding mammalian member of a subfamily of TRP channels gated by temperature (dubbed thermoTRPs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>TRPA1, first characterized as a thermoTRP channel gated by noxious cold (although this finding is controversial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] is activated by compounds that induce "burning" sensations and therefore could be best classified as a "chemoTRP." Irritant chemicals ligands of TRPA1 include allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), cinnamaldehyde (CA), allicin, acrolein and formalin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. TRPA1 is also tightly coupled to bradykinin signaling and is activated by agents generated by oxidative stress[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Two groups have recently shown that covalent modification of cytoplasmic N-terminal cysteine residues via the Michael addition reaction is a common mode of action of several TRPA1 agonists[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In order to identify novel and endogenous TRPA1 activators, we performed a bioactive lipid library screen and describe here our findings that 15-deoxy-&#x00394;12,14-prostaglandin J<sub>2 </sub>(15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>) a cyclopentane prostaglandin metabolite of PGD<sub>2</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], specifically activates this channel and not other thermoTRPs enriched in DRG. Similar to AITC and CA, 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>is characterized by an electrophilic &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated carbonyl group capable of undergoing a Michael addition with nucleophilic groups on cysteine residues. A role of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>in peripheral nociception has not been described previously; rather this molecule is best characterized as an anti-inflammatory agent[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, we have identified a population of DRG nociceptive neurons that respond to 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>and the TRPA1-specific agonist AITC. We therefore further hypothesized that 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>plays an <italic>in vivo </italic>role in acute peripheral nociceptive signaling via TRPA1 activation. Accordingly, we found that 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>induced acute nociceptive responses when administered cutaneously in mice. This effect is specific to TRPA1 as these nociceptive behaviors are significantly attenuated in TRPA1 knockout mice. Taken together our results demonstrate a novel TRPA1-dependent role of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>in acute pro-nociception.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Bioactive Lipid Library Screen</title><p>Intracellular calcium measurements were performed using a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR).

Cells were induced for mTRPA1 expression as described and loaded with Fluo-3 according to protocol (Molecular Probes). The plates were placed into a FLIPR (Molecular Devices, UK) to monitor cell fluorescence (EX _ 488 nM; EM _ 540 nM) before and after the 201 lipids contained in the Biomol Bioactive Lipid Library were added[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per 35 mm dish 24 hr prior to transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing mTRPA1, mTRPV1 or mTRPM8 and GFP (green fluorescent protein) in pcDNA3.1 using LipofectAMINE and OPTI-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Life Technologies). Green fluorescence from cells expressing GFP was detected with the aid of a Nikon microscope equipped with a mercury lamp light source and a GFP filter (emission wavelength, 510 nm).

This search identified that 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>activated mTRPA1 in a dose dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;B</xref>). In these preliminary screen experiments, ATP was used as a control for cell viability as CHO cells show endogenous and robust responses to this compound. To determine whether 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>directly activates TRPA1, whole-cell current was recorded from HeLa cells expressing mTRPA1 at a holding membrane potential of -40 mV. Application of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>to the bath solution rapidly increased the inward current that slowly decreased with time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In the cell-attached patches used in this study, the number of TRPA1 channels expressed ranged from 3 to 14. In cell-attached patches with pipette potential held at -60 mV to record outward current, application of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>to the external solution also activated single channel currents in all patches tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Control solution containing 0.1% DMSO did not activate any channels (n = 8). Single channels activated by 15d-PGJ2 are shown at expanded time scale in the inset of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. The single channel conductance of the inward current (+40 mV pipette potential) was 87 &#x000b1; 3 pS (n = 3), based on measurements at two membrane potentials 0 and +40 mV. This is similar to the single channel conductance values reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The single channel properties of TRPA1 expressed in HeLa cells have recently been characterized in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and therefore not described here. Because TRPA1 switches to a conformation that is insensitive to thiol-reactive compounds when inside-out patch is formed, all experiments were done using cell-attached patches. In cell-attached patches with pipette potential at +40 mV to record inward current, 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>also activated TRPA1. Further addition of 50 &#x003bc;M AITC produced a much greater activation of TRPA1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In HeLa cells transfected with plasmid containing only GFP DNA, 15d-PGJ2 did not activate any channels (n = 5). As 50 &#x003bc;M AITC maximally activates TRPA1, these results show that the current activated by 20 &#x003bc;M 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>is ~26% of the peak current (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, inset) under these experimental conditions. As 15d-PGJ2 and AITC were added to the bath solution outside of the pipette, the result also shows that the compounds must cross the membrane and activate TRPA1 from the intracellular side of the membrane. The true concentration of PGJ2 in the cell that interacts with TRPA1 is difficult to know. Because the activation of TRPA1 by AITC was not easily reversible even after several minutes of washout, whether PGJ2 sensitized the action of AITC could not be determined in the same cell. In three cell-attached patches with 10 &#x003bc;M ruthenium red in the pipette, addition of 15d-PGJ2 failed to activate TRPA1 (data not shown), further showing that TRPA1 is the target of this prostaglandin. In cells expressing TRPV1, application of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>failed to activate TRPV1, but subsequent addition of capsaicin strongly activated the channels, as predicted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Similarly, in cells expressing TRPM8, application of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>failed to activate any channels, but subsequent addition of menthol elicited strong activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Although other TRP ion channels were not tested, these results suggest that 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>is specific for TRPA1 among three TRP channels tested.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>FLIPR-based library screen of 15d-PGJ2 activation of TRPA1</bold>.

We show that 15d-PGJ2, similar to all known TRPA1 ligands, induces pain. We further demonstrate a causal link between 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>-induced nociception and TRPA1 activation at the cellular and behavioral levels.</p><p>Intriguingly, 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>is best characterized as a potent anti-inflammatory agent and not as a molecule that induces acute or long-term inflammatory pain. Instead, the resolution of the inflammatory state appears to correlate with increasing levels of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>within tissue fluids[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Like other cyclopentane prostaglandins, 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>does not function via a specific GPCR. Rather, the anti-inflammatory effects of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>are mediated by activation of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x003b3;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For example, 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>represses the transcription of a number of pro-inflammatory factors including inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>also acts independent of PPAR&#x003b3; to alter the activity of inflammatory molecules. It is thought to directly alkylate nucleophilic cysteine residues of NF-&#x003ba;B, thereby inhibiting DNA binding by NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Similarly, TRPA1 is activated by the covalent binding of electrophiles to cysteines, providing a likely mechanism whereby 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>activates this channel[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The results of our initial compound library screen were borne out by follow-up electrophysiological recordings showing that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>directly activates TRPA1. In contrast to 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, the J series PGD<sub>2 </sub>metabolites PGJ<sub>2 </sub>and 12d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, which also contain reactive electrophilic carbons, failed to activate TRPA1 in our studies. A recent study by Taylor-Clark et al., which examined the activation of human TRPA1 using heterologous expression in HEK cells, found that 12d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>was able to activate this channel[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Discrepancies between this study and our study could be due to concentrations tested (5 times greater concentrations were utilized by Taylor-Clark et al.), expression systems used or to subtle species differences in channel structure. The in vivo behavioral studies described here extend those of Taylor-Clark et al. by demonstrating that 15d-PGJ2 activation of TRPA1 is physiologically relevant. Lastly, during the preparation of this manuscript Andersson et al. published an article on the activation of TRPA1 by mediators of oxidative stress (including 15d-PGJ2) which confirm our findings presented here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with a physiological role of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>in the activation of TRPA1, we identified a population of DRG neurons sensitive to 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, AITC and capsaicin. TRPA1-expressing neurons occur as a subset of TRPV1-expressing neurons in the DRG; whereas TRPM8 is expressed in a separate population. These results support our electrophysiological studies showing that 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>does not activate TRPV1 or TRPM8. In further support of specific activation of TRPA1, a negligible number of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>/AITC responsive neurons were detected in cultures derived from TRPA1 knockout mice compared to wildtype (~2% vs. 90% respectively).</p><p>Specific agonists of TRPA1 cause acute nociceptive behaviors <italic>in vivo </italic>when administered cutaneously. Therefore, we investigated responses to intraplantar injection of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>. Both C57BL/6J and TRPA1 wildtype mice responded robustly by licking of the injected paw as well as lifting of the paw from the surface of the testing apparatus. These behaviors were dramatically abolished in TRPA1 knockout mice, suggesting that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>-induced acute peripheral nociception is mediated by TRPA1.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated a definitive role of TRPA1 in transmitting acute and inflammatory pain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Here we show that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, a molecule with no known membrane receptor that is implicated in anti-inflammatory pathways, specifically activates TRPA1, an ion channel expressed in the cell membrane of nociceptive neurons. We also show that similar to other TRPA1 agonists, 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>induces robust, acute nociceptive behaviors <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data also support that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>-induced peripheral nociception <italic>in vivo </italic>occurs through TRPA1 signaling. Collectively, our findings elaborate on a novel function of 15d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>in peripheral nociception and identify TRPA1 as its principal receptor in pain-sensing DRG neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare they that have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
