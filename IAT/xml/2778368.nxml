Mutations in AIRE cause APECED syndrome, which is characterized by a breakdown of self-tolerance. The molecular mechanism by which AIRE increases the expression of a variety of different genes remains unknown. Here, we studied AIRE-regulated genes using whole genome expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We show that AIRE preferentially activates genes that are tissue-specific and characterized by low levels of initial expression in stably transfected HEK293 cell model and mouse thymic medullary epithelial cells. In addition, the AIRE-regulated genes lack active chromatin marks, such as histone H3 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and acetylation (AcH3), on their promoters. We also show that during activation by AIRE, the target genes acquire histone H3 modifications associated with transcription and RNA polymerase II. In conclusion, our data show that AIRE is able to promote ectopic gene expression from chromatin associated with histone modifications characteristic to inactive genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ability to maintain self-tolerance is one of the fundamental properties of the normal immune system. During T-cell development in the thymus, the random genomic rearrangement of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene segments create a large number of different TCRs, many of which can recognize self-proteins. In order to maintain tolerance to self-antigens, autoreactive T-cells undergo negative selection in the thymus medulla, where self-peptides bound to the MHC complex on the surface of antigen-presenting cells are presented to thymocytes. Thymocytes with high TCR affinity to the MHC-peptide complex are eliminated by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C1">1</xref>). Efficient negative selection is therefore dependent on the availability of self-proteins in the thymus.</p><p>Thymic medullary epithelial cells (mTECs) have an important role in maintaining self-tolerance, as they are capable of expressing large numbers of genes that are usually expressed only in specific tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C2">2</xref>). This so-called ectopic or promiscuous gene expression significantly broadens the repertoire of self-antigens that can be presented to developing T-cells. In mice, the expression of many tissue-specific antigens has been shown to be dependent on the Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE) protein expressed in mature mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C3">3</xref>). The absence of AIRE leads to the escape of auto-reactive T-cells to the periphery and subsequent autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C5">5</xref>). In humans, mutated AIRE causes an autosomal recessive disease, Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis Ectodermal Dystrophy (APECED), which is characterized by a breakdown of self-tolerance, leading to destructive autoimmune reactions in several, mainly endocrine, organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C6">6</xref>).</p><p>Lack of thymic expression of a single antigen can be sufficient to elicit an autoimmune attack against the corresponding tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C7">7</xref>). Therefore, to ensure immune tolerance, the expression of tissue-specific antigens in the thymus must be carefully regulated. Although the ability of AIRE to promote gene expression in cell models and in the thymus has been described by several groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C9">9</xref>), the exact molecular mechanisms by which AIRE enhances the expression of tissue-specific genes in mTECs are still not clear.</p><p>One important factor that influences the transcriptional status of a gene is chromatin structure. Post-translational modifications of the N-terminal ends of histones have an important role in this process, as they determine whether proteins with specific domains can interact with chromatin and can predict whether genes are active. For example, the promoters of transcriptionally active genes are usually enriched for histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), whereas silenced gene promoters often have histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C10">10</xref>). We and others have recently shown that the PHD finger of AIRE interacts with the unmodified N-terminal ends of histone H3, and this interaction is required for AIRE-dependent transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C13">13</xref>). Since AIRE is able to sense histone H3 N-terminal modifications, it is likely that chromatin structure plays an important role in AIRE-mediated gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C14">14</xref>). Accordingly, post-translational histone H3 modifications may direct AIRE to specific locations on chromatin to activate target genes. Likewise, it has been proposed that AIRE may be involved in structural changes of larger chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C15">15</xref>).</p><p>To address the role of chromatin structure and histone binding in AIRE-promoted ectopic expression, we used genome-wide expression analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by array analysis (ChIP-on-chip) and a bioinformatics approach. Due to the scarcity of AIRE-positive cells in the thymus, we took advantage of a model system of a stably transfected human embryonic epithelial HEK293 cell line. Earlier studies suggested that the basic mechanism by which AIRE activates its broad range of target genes is independent of the mTECs' cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C17">17</xref>). Indeed, similar to results of studies with mTECs, we have shown that AIRE efficiently activates several genes, including <italic>insulin</italic>, in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C13">13</xref>). Thus, these cells have all the necessary factors for AIRE-mediated gene activation and provide a feasible model for studying the molecular mechanisms of ectopic expression.</p><p>In this study, using the epithelial cell model, we show that AIRE is able to activate ectopic expression of genes, which are tissue-specific, characterized by low levels of initial expression and lack transcriptionally active chromatin marks, such as H3K4me3 and AcH3, on their promoters. During their activation, AIRE-regulated genes acquire active histone modifications and RNA polymerase II. Importantly, we also confirm the lack of active chromatin marks on AIRE target genes <italic>in vivo</italic> in mouse mTECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>AIRE acts as a transcriptional activator in HEK293 cells</title><p>We recently showed that AIRE increases the expression of its target genes, <italic>S100A8</italic>, <italic>involucrin</italic> and <italic>insulin</italic>, in stably transfected HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C13">13</xref>). To further identify AIRE-regulated genes in this cell model, we used Illumina HumanWG-6_V2_0_R2 BeadChip expression arrays that cover more than 48 000 transcripts. The experiments were performed in triplicate with cell lines expressing AIRE (two independent AIRE lines: AIRE1 and AIRE2), AIRE with a D312A mutation (AIRE-D312A) and yellow fluorescence protein as a negative control (NC). The D312A mutation resides in the first PHD zinc finger (PHD1) of AIRE, and structural studies have shown that it prevents zinc finger binding to histone H3 N-terminal tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C13">13</xref>).</p><p>The array analysis results demonstrated the ability of AIRE to induce ectopic gene expression in HEK293 cells. The comparison of the combined data sets of AIRE1 and AIRE2 with NC yielded 140 and 154 genes that were significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) up- and downregulated, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP433F1">1</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A, B</ext-link>). The gene expression scatter plots and heat map of 140 upregulated genes showed that cells with AIRE1 and AIRE2 had almost identical expression profiles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP433F1">1</xref>B), whereas expression in AIRE-D312A cells was more similar to that of the NC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP433F1">1</xref>C and D; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A</ext-link>). The latter result shows that the intact structure of PHD1 involved in histone binding is crucial for the efficient activation of a majority of AIRE-regulated genes. However, histone H3 binding does not seem to be essential for regulation of a portion of the AIRE targets (62 genes), as these were still upregulated in cells expressing AIRE-D312A. Nevertheless, when compared with AIRE wild-type lines, the AIRE-D312A line was clearly less potent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP433F1">1</xref>C and D; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A</ext-link>) and resulted in lower activation levels. Indeed, the induction levels of 41 out of 140 genes, upregulated in the AIRE1/AIRE2 cell lines, were significantly lower in AIRE-D312A when compared with AIRE1/AIRE2. In contrast, analysis of 154 genes indicated that their downregulation was not dependent on intact PHD1 structure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP433F1">1</xref>C and D; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1B</ext-link>), suggesting that histone binding is not essential for AIRE-mediated gene repression.</p><fig id="DDP433F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>AIRE changes the expression of many genes in HEK293 cell line.

While the expression profiles of AIRE1 and AIRE2 cell lines are very similar, AIRE-D312A cell line shows decreased activation of several genes when compared with wild-type AIRE cell lines.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddp43301"/></fig><p>We noticed that several previously identified AIRE targets (<italic>S100A8</italic>, <italic>involucrin</italic>, <italic>insulin</italic>) were not differentially expressed in our array analysis. For example, although <italic>S100A8</italic> expression increased almost 5-fold and ranked 311th among activated genes, its differential <italic>P</italic>-value was 0.42. Therefore, the number of AIRE-regulated genes identified by expression array was most likely underestimated. The smaller number of genes in our microarray approach was probably due to rigorous statistical analysis. Analysis of our data with the commonly used arbitrary 2-fold change threshold yielded 540 up- and 529 downregulated genes, which are in the same range as those of previously published microarray results of transgenic expression of AIRE in pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C17">17</xref>). Interestingly, although we specifically analyzed the expression of well-characterized APECED autoantigen genes (<italic>CYP17A</italic>, <italic>CYP21A2</italic>, <italic>CYP11A</italic>, <italic>TG</italic>, <italic>TPO</italic>), these were not activated by AIRE. Thus, these results are in agreement with previous data showing that AIRE promotes ectopic expression by a generic mechanism not specific to mTECs, whereas the cellular environment defines which genes are regulated by AIRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>AIRE target genes have tissue-specific expression patterns and tend to cluster in the genome</title><p>In mouse mTECs and in a rare subset of stromal cells in the lymph nodes, AIRE preferentially activates tissue-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C18">18</xref>). To determine whether AIRE-upregulated genes in HEK293 cells can be considered tissue-specific, we searched the <italic>ti</italic>ssue-specific <italic>g</italic>ene <italic>e</italic>xpression and <italic>r</italic>egulation (TiGER) database (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/tiger/">http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/tiger/</uri>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C19">19</xref>). Of the 140 AIRE-upregulated genes, the TiGER database contained 121, and 59 of these were classified as having tissue-specific expression patterns. We next used the database to identify the total number of tissue-specific genes present on Illumina arrays (6005) and compared the observed versus expected frequencies of tissue-specific genes among the AIRE target genes. Strikingly, the proportion of tissue-specific genes was indeed significantly higher among AIRE-upregulated genes than would have been expected by chance (chi-square test <italic>P</italic>-value 2.7&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>). Furthermore, as previous studies with mTECs have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C18">18</xref>), the range of tissues expressing the genes activated by AIRE was extremely wide, covering essentially the whole body (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>). This association, however, was not found when the analysis was performed on genes downregulated by AIRE.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that AIRE-regulated genes tend to cluster in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C20">20</xref>). We also observed that compared with random set, AIRE regulated genes in HEK293 cells were found to be more clustered than would be expected (chi-square test <italic>P</italic>-value 3.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>AIRE targets have low initial expression levels</title><p>We next analyzed the distribution of AIRE-regulated genes by expression level. Strikingly, we found that AIRE preferentially activates genes with low initial expression levels, whereas in contrast, the repressed genes had high initial expression levels (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4A</ext-link>). This finding was further supported by comparison of the average signal intensity of all genes on the Illumina arrays (average signal intensity 290) with AIRE-upregulated (57) or downregulated (1357) average gene signal intensities. Moreover, the average increase of AIRE-upregulated genes was far higher (12.4-fold) than the average decrease (2.6-fold) of repressed genes. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between initial expression levels in NC cells and the fold of induction (Pearson correlation, two-tailed <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0009), so that genes with low initial expression levels had higher induction rates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S5A</ext-link>). No such correlation between expression level and fold of repression was present in genes downregulated by AIRE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S5B</ext-link>). We also analyzed the distribution of AIRE-regulated genes by size and exon number, but overall, we found no difference compared with genes of the whole genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4B and C</ext-link>).</p><p>To verify the microarray results, we performed qPCR-based expression analysis on samples from AIRE1/AIRE2, AIRE-D312A and NC cells using primers specific to several identified AIRE target genes. In general, the qPCR results confirmed the expression differences found using the Illumina BeadChips (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP433F2">2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S6</ext-link>). However, the qPCR approach was by far more sensitive than the microarray and also confirmed strong upregulation of previously identified target genes with low expression levels (such as <italic>insulin</italic> and <italic>S100A8</italic>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP433F2">2</xref>) and several other genes, such as <italic>S100A5</italic>, <italic>S100A6</italic>, <italic>S100A7</italic>, <italic>S100A9</italic>, <italic>LOR</italic>, <italic>SPRR2F</italic> in epidermal differentiation cluster on chromosome 1 (data not shown). It should be noted that the fold of induction varied widely between individual genes. For example, the induction of <italic>S100A8, HBG2</italic> and <italic>IFI16</italic> genes was more than 200-fold, whereas <italic>LPL, PHF11, THBS2</italic> and <italic>LY6G6D</italic> were upregulated less than 20-fold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S6</ext-link>). Again, larger fold changes were seen with genes with low initial expression levels (data not shown). The qPCR results with AIRE-D312A also confirmed the array results, demonstrating that the expression of a subset of genes was partially (<italic>OAS3, HCP5, CLDN1</italic>) or completely (<italic>GHR, TOX3, PAK3, SUSD4, CDH12</italic>) independent of the PHD1 finger (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP433F2">2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S6</ext-link>).

We included AIRE target and control gene regions to the tiling array, which covered 36 Mb of the genomic DNA sequence. To detect histone modifications, we used specific antibodies against H3K4me3 and AcH3 modifications, which mark a transcriptionally active state, and against H3K27me3, which is characteristic to silenced chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C10">10</xref>), as well as an antibody against unmodified histone H3 as a control.</p><p>We first verified the overall performance of the arrays.

These features are characteristic for tissue-specific genes outside of their host tissue and, indeed, the expression of many AIRE target genes activated in our epithelial cell model was restricted to a limited number of tissues. We also show that on target gene promoters, AIRE is able to increase H3K4me3 and AcH3 levels, the histone modifications associated with active chromatin and to engage RNA polymerase II. Our results support the idea that AIRE induces the expression of target genes through transcriptional activation.</p><p>AIRE is needed for proper negative selection of self-reactive thymocytes in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C4">4</xref>). Although there is evidence that AIRE might also influence other processes, such as processing and/or presentation of self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C24">24</xref>) or differentiation of mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C25">25</xref>), the main mechanism by which AIRE propagates negative selection involves promotion of tissue-specific antigen expression in mTECs. In addition, it has been reported that over-expression of AIRE induces apoptosis in 1C6 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C26">26</xref>); however, we did not observe this in HEK293 cells. This discrepancy is probably due to the different cell-lines used; the 1C6 cells were derived from primary mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C27">27</xref>) and therefore might be more susceptible to apoptosis than the transformed HEK293 cells used in this study. Our data show that even in an embryonic epithelial cell model, AIRE is able to induce ectopic expression of multiple genes, resembling the situation in mature mTECs. Importantly, although the repertoire of genes that was activated in this cell model was different from that in mTECs, many of these genes were classified as tissue-specific.</p><p>Considering that AIRE activates multiple genes, it was reasonable to hypothesize that in order to regulate gene expression, AIRE should be recruited to chromatin. We and others recently have shown that the AIRE PHD1 finger is able to interact with histone H3 N-terminal tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C13">13</xref>). Several posttranslational modifications on histone H3 affect this interaction, and, in particular, H3K4me3, which is enriched on the promoters of actively transcribed genes, hinders AIRE binding. According to this scenario, AIRE is able to bind chromatin regions with low levels of H3K4me3. While tissue-specific genes are highly expressed only in a limited number of tissues, they have low expression levels and low levels of H3K4me3 on their promoters in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C28">28</xref>). This is consistent with our results, which show that AIRE target gene promoters have low initial expression levels and low levels of H3K4me3 and AcH3. Importantly, we confirmed our cell model results by showing the presence of low levels of H3K4me3 in mouse CD80<sup>low</sup> mTECs on the AIRE target genes <italic>Ins2</italic> and <italic>S100a8</italic>, whereas the AIRE-independent genes <italic>Gad2</italic> and <italic>Gapdh</italic> had high levels of H3K4me3.</p><p>Our findings provide several clues of AIRE's function in mTECs. It provides a mechanistic explanation of how, based on epigenetic histone marks, AIRE is guided to its target genes in the thymus. This implies that AIRE is not recruited to tissue-specific antigen genes <italic>per se</italic>, but instead, AIRE identifies its target genes by a specific histone code, which can often be found on tissue-specific gene promoters outside of the tissues in which they are expressed. Besides the AIRE&#x02013;PHD1 interaction with histone H3, however, other factors may be involved in AIRE recruitment to chromatin, as the expression levels of some genes were not influenced by the D312A mutation. For example, AIRE harbors a putative DNA binding domain called SAND, which in the case of the Sp100 protein has been shown to preferentially bind unmethylated CpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C29">29</xref>). Indeed, earlier studies have proposed a direct AIRE interaction with specific DNA sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C32">32</xref>). In contrast, we (our unpublished data) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C15">15</xref>) have found that AIRE interaction with DNA, when studied <italic>in vitro</italic>, occurs in a non-specific manner. In addition, although our initial ChIP results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C13">13</xref>) showed that very high H3K4me3 levels might prevent AIRE binding to chromatin, our AIRE ChIP-on-chip data indicate that the AIRE protein has a fairly random pattern of chromatin binding. It is possible that although H3K4me3 modification blocks AIRE PHD1 binding, the other AIRE domains might still interact with DNA. AIRE's relatively stochastic binding to chromatin is also in agreement with other studies reporting that the AIRE target genes vary in different genetic backgrounds and cell types, and that even different single cells from the same tissue may have variable patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C34">34</xref>).</p><p>After recruitment to chromatin, AIRE activates gene expression. Oven <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C21">21</xref>) have proposed that AIRE promotes transcriptional elongation by recruiting elongation factor P-TEFb to target gene promoters. This AIRE-mediated elongation mechanism assumes the presence of stalled RNA polymerase on the target gene promoters. However, in NC cells, we did not detect RNA polymerase II on the AIRE target promoters. Even though this lack of RNA polymerase in our experiments could be explained by low detection efficiency, we still observed an increase in RNA polymerase II levels on several target genes after activation by AIRE. This was also confirmed by ChIP experiments using initiating RNA polymerase II (data not shown). AIRE's role in processing primary transcripts has been proposed as another possible mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C15">15</xref>). Our data, which show activation of AIRE target genes through changes in their histone modifications and RNA polymerase II recruitment, argue that the increase seen in mRNA levels is, at least to some extent, due to enhanced transcription. In this context, the variations in target gene selection between different cellular environments can be explained by the local milieu, such as accessibility of chromatin and the availability of transcriptional proteins.</p><p>In conclusion, our data show that AIRE is able to promote ectopic expression of tissue-specific genes from chromatin lacking transcriptionally active histone H3 modifications. Our data indicate that activation by AIRE occurs via transcriptional regulation and is accompanied by an increase in H3K4me3 and AcH3 levels on target gene promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibodies used in the study were: &#x003b1;H3 (ab1791), &#x003b1;H3K4me3 (ab8580) (Abcam); &#x003b1;H3K27me3 (Upstate Biotechnology); &#x003b1;-rabbit polyclonal IgG (sc-2027) and &#x003b1;AIRE (sc-17985) (Santa Cruz).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Cell lines</title><p>The generation of HEK293 cell lines expressing AIRE1, AIRE2, AIRE D312A mutant and YFP expressing negative control (NC) has been described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C13">13</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Gene expression arrays</title><p>The RNA from AIRE1, AIRE2, AIRE-D312A and NC was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), treated 2 &#x000d7; 30 min with Turbo DNAse (Ambion) and purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).

The chosen genes had to be significantly upregulated by AIRE (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05) and have fold change greater than 5. The arrays covered the whole gene and 200 kb up- and downstream of each gene. In addition, a 5.2 Mb region was chosen from chromosome 1, which contained the epidermal differentiation cluster. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with &#x003b1;H3K4me3, &#x003b1;AcH3, &#x003b1;H3K27me3, &#x003b1;H3 and &#x003b1;AIRE from AIRE1 and NC cell lines as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP433C13">13</xref>). The immunoprecipitated and input material were amplified using WGA2 and WGA1 GenomePlex Whole Genome Amplification Kits (Sigma). Sample labeling and hybridization to custom made tiling arrays were performed by Nimblegen (Roche). For each probe, a scaled log<sub>2</sub>-ratio was calculated. Scaling was performed by subtracting the bi-weight mean for the log<sub>2</sub>-ratio values for all probes on the array from each log<sub>2</sub>-ratio value. Peaks were detected using NimbleScan by searching for four or more probes whose signals are above specified cutoff values, ranging from 15 to 90%, using a 500 bp sliding window. The cutoff values are percentage of hypothetical maximum, which is mean+6 standard deviation. Each peak is assigned a false discovery rate (FDR) based on 20 times randomization of ratio data. For histone modifications, FDR cutoff at 0.01 level was used.</p><p>For <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp433/DC1">Supplementary Material, Figure S7</ext-link>, genes were first sorted according to the signal intensities on Illumina Beadchip expression arrays. A sliding window with the size of 50 probes and step of 1 probe was then used to calculate the percent of promoters having corresponding posttranslational histone modification.

The number of cells in each cell fraction was counted and cells were pooled (200 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells) starting from the last fraction. A negative depletion was performed to enrich for CD45- cells using CD45 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and the AutoMACS system (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The negative fraction was stained with anti-G8.8-FITC (anti-EpCAM, generated from a G8.8 hybridoma cell line), anti-Ly51-PE (BD Biosciences), anti-CD45-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD Biosciences) and anti-CD80 biotin (BD Biosciences) followed by second-stage staining with Streptavidin-PE-Cy7 (Serotec Ltd). Cell sorting and analysis was performed on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) instrument to get the fractions of mTECs (CD45, G8.8<sup>high</sup>, Ly51<sup>low</sup>).
