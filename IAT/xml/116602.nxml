This ability depends on the regulated synthesis of a membrane bound DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) and/or TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide) reductase enzyme. Use of these compounds in <italic>E. coli</italic> occurs by a broad substrate enzyme encoded by the <italic>dmsABC</italic> operon located at 20 minutes on the chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The 100-fold activation of <italic>dmsABC</italic> gene expression in response to anaerobiosis is controlled by the Fnr regulatory protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Following a re-examination, the <italic>dmsABC</italic> P1 transcription start site was located 223 nucleotides upstream of the translational start of <italic>dmsA</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This centers the Fnr binding site (TTGATnnnnAACAA) at -41.5 bp from the <italic>dmsABC</italic> P1 promoter as also established by DNase I footprinting analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The presence of nitrate, a preferred alternative electron acceptor, elicits a 10-fold repression of <italic>dmsABC</italic> expression via the NarXLQP two-component regulatory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Nitrate is detected by either of the two sensor-transmitter proteins, NarX or NarQ, which then activate the DNA binding response-regulatory protein NarL, by phosphorylating an aspartate residue located at position 59. NarL-phosphate then negatively regulates <italic>dmsABC</italic> operon expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Additional regulators of <italic>dmsABC</italic> expression have also been described that involve molybdenum dependent gene expression via the ModE transcription factor, and integration host factor (IHF) that interacts with DNA at a downstream site called P2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Neither the presence of TMAO nor DMSO, substrates for the DMSO reductase, further modulate <italic>dmsABC</italic> gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the control of <italic>dmsABC</italic> gene expression by Fnr and NarL was investigated. Mutagenesis of the Fnr recognition sequence at the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter region confirmed the contribution of Fnr in the 100-fold activation of <italic>dmsABC</italic> expression and explored the DNA sequence and spacing requirements for the Fnr recognition site at the P1 promoter. The region of <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter DNA protected by the NarL regulatory protein was identified by DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments. These studies define the molecular interactions of Fnr and NarL at the <italic>dmsABC</italic> P1 promoter that together provide for the oxygen and nitrate regulated expression of this respiratory pathway operon.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Effect of <italic>cis</italic>-acting mutations in the Fnr binding site on anaerobic induction of <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression</title><p>To investigate the effects of sequence changes in the <italic>dmsA</italic> Fnr-recognition site on the anaerobic activation of <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression, site-directed mutagenesis and &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays were performed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Since the native Fnr binding site at the <italic>dmsA</italic> P1 promoter differs from the Fnr consensus recognition sequence (TTGATnnnnATCAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]) by one base pair (bp) in the right half-site (e.g., A<bold>A</bold>CAA vs. ATCAA), the Fnr-site was converted to the consensus sequence and analyzed for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A 3-fold increase in anaerobic activation of <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression was observed for the consensus Fnr site (300-fold) relative to the 114-fold anaerobic activation by Fnr seen for the native <italic>dmsA</italic> sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, &#x003bb;JA303 and &#x003bb;JA250, respectively). The &#x003bb;JA303 consensus mutant <italic>fnr</italic><sup>+</sup> strain exhibited a 1000-fold anaerobic increase in &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression relative to the corresponding <italic>fnr</italic><sup>-</sup> strain (i.e., 22,200 vs. 19 units). To our knowledge, this "consensus" Fnr-dependent <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter exhibits the highest anaerobic induction of any Fnr-regulated <italic>E. coli</italic> promoter examined. The enhanced ability of Fnr to activate <italic>dmsABC</italic> gene expression is possibly, by analogy to Crp, due to increased affinity of Fnr at the consensus versus the native non-consensus Fnr recognition sequence at <italic>dmsA</italic>. Likewise, the poor match of the Fnr site at the promoter for the fumarate reductase gene, <italic>frdA</italic> to the consensus Fnr sequence may account for the relatively weak anaerobic induction for this respiratory operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Nucleotide sequence at the <italic>dmsA</italic> P1 promoter region and the effects of sequence alterations in the Fnr binding site on <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression. The DNA sequence is shown in the middle portion of the figure and is numbered relative to the 5' terminus of the <italic>dmsA</italic> mRNA (not to scale). The transcriptional start site is located at the guanine residue positioned at 223 bp upstream of the <italic>dmsA</italic> translational start site and is indicated by the arrow at position +1. The consensus sequence of the RNA polymerase recognition sequences in the -35 and -10 regions are shown below the DNA sequence. The boxed sequences from position -35 to -48 indicate a 14 bp region of dyad symmetry similar to the Fnr consensus recognition sequence (TTGATnnnnATCAA). The location of Fnr-box mutations within the <italic>dmsA</italic> regulatory region and the corresponding phages carrying the <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> fusions are indicated in the lower portion of the figure. The effect of cis mutations on Fnr-dependent activation of <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression is shown in the lower right portion of the figure. &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was measured from the cells containing the indicated fusion inserted in single copy at the <italic>att</italic> site. The strains were grown in a buffered LB medium either aerobically or anaerobically. The asterisk represents the fold difference between the <italic>fnr</italic><sup>-</sup> and <italic>fnr</italic><sup>+</sup> strains.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2180-2-13-1"/></fig><p>Several additional DNA sequence changes were introduced into the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter region to alter the Fnr recognition sequence as well as to alter the spacing between the Fnr site and the RNA polymerase recognition sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A single base substitution in the left half-site when combined with the Fnr consensus sequence at the right half-site exhibited a 138-fold activation of <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, &#x003bb;JA450), an induction equivalent to the wild-type <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter that has the symmetrical deviation in the right half-site (ca. 114-fold). Thus, the left and right half-sites are equivalent in their ability to confer Fnr-dependent activation of <italic>dmsA</italic> gene expression by RNA polymerase. This is in contrast to the requirement for the left half-site of the Fnr1 regulatory site needed for Fnr-dependent repression at the <italic>cydA</italic> P1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. When a two base-pair change was introduced into the left Fnr half-site (e.g., TTGAT to TT<bold>AG</bold>T) of the native <italic>dmsA</italic> sequence, it nearly abolished the anaerobic induction of <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, &#x003bb;JA257). The deletion of the entire left half-site Fnr sequence, while preserving the right half-site as consensus, exhibited similar results (&#x003bb;JA304). Hence, a single Fnr half-site is not sufficient to allow Fnr-dependent activation of the <italic>E. coli</italic> DMSO reductase genes.</p><p>To evaluate how the spacing between the Fnr binding site and the start of <italic>dmsA</italic> transcription alters the anaerobic activation of <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression, single basepair insertions were introduced at position -35 (&#x003bb;JA448 and &#x003bb;JA449). The 114-fold anaerobic activation seen for the wild-type <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter was reduced to about 35-fold in each of the two mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), indicating that the position of the Fnr site at the wild-type <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter is important for controlling optimal <italic>dmsA</italic> gene expression. Thus, the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter exhibits a preference for -41.5 target sites like other Fnr-regulated class II promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. By analogy to the CAP transcription regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the proposed mechanism for Fnr activation of gene expression involves its ability to promote open complex formation by RNA polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As suggested by the appearance of DNase I hypersensitive cleavage sites, a change in the DNA conformation occurs upon Fnr binding at the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The presence of hypersensitive DNase I cleavage sites at other FNR-regulated promoters as well as DNA bending experiments support this conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, recent studies propose the protein-protein interaction of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and Fnr at the <italic>narG</italic> and <italic>dmsA</italic> promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Finally, for each of the site-directed mutations of the Fnr binding site in this study, the level of <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression was not significantly altered in an <italic>fnr</italic> deletion strain either aerobically or anaerobically, indicating that the Fnr-independent expression from the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter was not affected by the sequence alterations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Location of NarL binding sites at the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter</title><p>Under anaerobic conditions, <italic>dmsA</italic> expression is repressed approximately 10-fold by NarL when nitrate is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although three putative NarL sites have been proposed based on their similarity to a NarL consensus recognition sequence, TACYYMT (Y = C or T, M = A or C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], no <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> information is available regarding the location of the NarL site(s) within the <italic>dmsA</italic> regulatory region. To evaluate where NarL binds, DNase I footprinting experiments were performed using a <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter fragment corresponding to -127 to + 62 relative to the start of transcription at P1. When NarL-phosphate was incubated with the coding strand of DNA, a 76 bp region was protected that extends from position -48 to +28 relative to the start of <italic>dmsA</italic> transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, open rectangle). DNase I hypersensitive cutting sites were seen at positions +32, +31, +30, +18, +4, -18, -19, -41, and -53 relative to the start of transcription.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprint analyses of the <italic>dmsA</italic> coding strand by NarL and NarL-phosphate.

The NarL protein used in Lanes 2 and 6&#x02013;9 was phosphorylated with acetyl phosphate prior to incubation with the <italic>dmsA</italic> fragment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2180-2-13-2"/></fig><p>The DNase I footprint of the non-coding strand of <italic>dmsA</italic> with phosphorylated NarL revealed an 83 bp protected region that extends from -51 to +32 relative to the start of transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). DNase I hypersensitive cutting was observed at positions +27, +4, +3, -10, -20, -21, -22 and -32. For the non-coding DNA strand, the size of the DNase I footprint pattern appears to increase when higher levels of NarL-phosphate are present. DNase I protection first occurs within the +10 to -15 region followed by an extension to the -25 to -50 region and then finally the +20 region. The size of the protected region did not change further when up to five-fold higher amounts of NarL-phosphate were used (10 &#x003bc;M, data not shown). Thus, the sizes of the protected regions on each strand concur. Furthermore, non-phosphorylated NarL gave no DNase I protections in the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter region under the same conditions for either strand (up to 10 &#x003bc;M), suggesting that NarL-phosphate, but not NarL, can act as a transcriptional repressor for <italic>dmsA</italic> expression. The protections for both strands are consistent with the binding of multiple molecules of NarL to the DNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprint analyses of the <italic>dmsA</italic> non-coding strand by NarL and NarL-phosphate.

In hydroxyl radical footprinting, the small, highly reactive hydroxyl radical (&#x02022;OH) attacks the deoxyribose sugars along the DNA backbone with no sequence or base specificity, thereby providing a high resolution of structural information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A total of eight to nine distinct hydroxyl radical protected regions were observed of three to five basepairs in size for each DNA strand that extended over a 97 bp region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These NarL-phosphate protections extended from position -59 to +38, consistent with the results of the DNase I footprinting experiments described above. The hydroxyl radical protected regions for the <italic>dmsA</italic> strands of DNA were offset by 3 bp in the 3' direction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This offset suggests that the NarL protein either occludes the minor groove of DNA, or that the DNA conformation is distorted upon NarL binding. In the former case, the DNA backbone sites located closest to one another are across the minor groove and separated in sequence by 3 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The second proposal is supported by a recent 2.2 angstrom NarL-DNA structure for NarL-C-terminal domain complexed to a synthetic 7-2-7 NarL consensus binding site where the protein causes a conformational change of B-DNA to A-DNA (Ann Maris, personal communication). Furthermore, the hydroxyl radical protected regions occur at ten bp intervals, a regular phasing of the helix repeat. This signifies that NarL-phosphate binds to only one side of the DNA molecule <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The hydroxyl radical data are also consistent with the binding of multiple molecules of NarL-phosphate to the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter region as suggested by the DNase I data. Therefore, a simple model that accounts for the footprint data is the assembly of multiple NarL-phosphate molecules onto one face of the DNA that somehow protect the minor groove from hydroxyl radical attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In an alternative model, NarL binds only at the three proposed NarL heptamer consensus sites spaced at 20 bp intervals within the <italic>dmsA</italic> regulatory region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, this model is difficult to envision since the DNase I and hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns extend over seven to nine turns of DNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Location of the Fnr and NarL binding sites in the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter region.

No hydroxyl radical or DNase I protected regions of DNA were observed when non-phosphorylated NarL protein was used at a concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M (data not shown). In addition, &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays revealed that the 10-fold nitrate dependent repression of <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression was unaffected by the deletion of upstream DNA sequence to -71 relative to the start of <italic>dmsA</italic> transcription, further pinpointing the location of the 5' end of the NarL recognition site for <italic>dmsA</italic> (data not shown). Furthermore, the NarL footprint pattern does not extend into the <italic>dmsA</italic> P2 promoter region. Therefore, NarL does not appear to directly affect regulation at the P2 site, unless a large DNA/protein complex that involves multiple transcriptional regulators is involved (i.e. Fnr, NarL, ModE, and IHF in addition to RNAP). Future investigation of this complex regulatory region will be needed to ascertain such a matter. Finally, a similar hydroxyl radical footprint pattern of 8&#x02013;9 protected regions of 3&#x02013;4 bp spaced 10 nucleotides apart was also observed for NarL-phosphate at the promoter region of the <italic>frdA</italic> gene, another anaerobically induced gene that is repressed by NarL in the presence of nitrate (data not shown).</p><p>To establish if the entire NarL protected region is required for NarL-phosphate to bind DNA, a DNA fragment (designated Fragment B, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) containing a truncated region of the <italic>dmsA</italic> regulatory sequence was constructed. The fragment extends from position -127 to -13 relative to the start of <italic>dmsA</italic> transcription at P1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In Fragment B, two of the three consensus heptamer sites have been replaced by the multi-cloning region of pGEM-11Zf (Methods). When examined by DNase I footprinting analysis, the altered <italic>dmsA</italic> Fragment B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lanes 6 to 9) revealed a 38 bp NarL-phosphate protected region extending from position -51 to -13. This protected region spans only the wild-type <italic>dmsA</italic> DNA sequences but not the adjacent foreign DNA sequences. In contrast, the full-length <italic>dmsA</italic> fragment (Fragment A, -127 to +62) showed a larger protected region from -51 to +32 (lanes 2&#x02013;5). These findings demonstrate that the smaller <italic>dmsA</italic> region containing only one of the three consensus heptamer sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) is sufficient for NarL binding. However, a somewhat weaker binding of NarL-phosphate to the DNA fragment containing the truncated <italic>dmsA</italic> region relative to the full-length region may suggest that NarL binds at the promoter in a weakly cooperative fashion. The protections are consistent with the proposal that NarL-phosphate recognizes and binds at multiple heptamer recognition sites within the <italic>dmsA</italic> P1 promoter region.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of the NarL-phosphate protection patterns for the entire <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter region versus a truncated <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter fragment.

These sites, previously assigned at positions +8, -14 and -34, are now centered at positions + 15, -7, and -27 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) due to the reassignment of the <italic>dmsA</italic> P1 start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Since the size of the DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprints in this study show DNA protections between and beyond these three consensus sites, other NarL binding sites may be present in this region. As the three consensus NarL boxes flank the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter and are spaced 20 bp apart (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), the spacing and orientation of the NarL protected regions make it tempting to speculate that NarL-phosphate binds at each site. Additional NarL-phosphate monomers then assemble on the DNA to form a stable DNA protein complex. Alternatively, molecules of NarL-phosphate may bind at both the consensus and at related NarL-box sequences that contain one or two mismatches from consensus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Inspection of the DNA reveals an additional NarL box within the protected region that has one mismatch from consensus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, dashed arrows) and nineteen NarL-like boxes with two mismatches (dotted arrows, not all shown). We note that none of the three consensus heptamers (solid arrows, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) are arranged in a 7-2-7 sequence, nor are any of the consensus heptamers paired with any of the mismatch heptamers in such an arrangement. This is noteworthy since a 7-2-7 sequence has been speculated for nucleating NarL interactions at other promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Stoichiometry experiments are planned to ascertain the number of NarL molecules that bind the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter region, as are studies to mutagenize one or more of the NarL binding sites to determine the importance of the NarL consensus binding sites at the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study investigated the effects of sequence changes in the Fnr-recognition site on the anaerobic activation of <italic>dmsA-lacZ</italic> expression as well as examined the NarL recognition sites within the <italic>dmsABC</italic> regulatory region. The data illustrates that Fnr is responsible for the 100-fold anaerobic activation of <italic>dmsA</italic> expression. Also, both half-sites of the Fnr recognition sequence at <italic>dmsA</italic> are required for Fnr-dependent expression and are similar in their ability to activate <italic>dmsA</italic> transcription. Furthermore, the spacing between the Fnr and RNA polymerase recognition sequences is critical at <italic>dmsA</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> interactions of the nitrate-responsive regulatory protein NarL with the promoter region of <italic>dmsABC</italic> were examined using DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting techniques. The location of the NarL-phosphate protected regions within a 97 bp segment of the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter is consistent with the model for <italic>dmsABC</italic> expression whereby multiple molecules of NarL-phosphate recognize and bind to the DNA in a weak and cooperative fashion. The NarL interactions with the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter region occurred at ten bp intervals and were offset by 3 bp in the 3' direction, suggesting the assembly of multiple NarL-phosphate molecules onto one face of the DNA that protect the minor groove. Furthermore, nonphosphorylated NarL was unable to protect the NarL binding sequences at the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter region, suggesting that phosphorylation of NarL is required for repression of <italic>dmsABC</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, bacteriophages, and plasmids</title><p>The genotypes of the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strains, plasmids, and the bacteriophage used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

The fragment, corresponding to -127 to +62 relative to the start of transcription, was amplified by PCR using primers 5'GAACGGTCTAGAATATATTGGC'3 (oSB15) and 5'GGGAATTCGCTATATAGGCTTGTATACATCGAA'3 (oSB14) with plasmid pPC25 as template. The PCR product was digested with either the <italic>Eco</italic>RI or <italic>Xba</italic>I restriction enzyme, end-labeled with [&#x003b1;P<sup>32</sup>]-dATP (ICN, Inc.) using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and purified using a PCR clean-up kit (Qiagen). A smaller DNA fragment representing the 5' end of the dmsA promoter region from position -127 to -13 relative to the start of transcription was also constructed by PCR amplification using pPC25 as template and oligonucleotides oSB15 and oSB21 (5'GTAGTATTACTAGTAAGTGAGG'3).

Only the <italic>Xba</italic>I site designed near the -127 region remained intact. Using the resulting plasmid pSB10 as template, the cloned product was PCR amplified with the vector forward and reverse primers, digested with <italic>Xba</italic>I and labeled as described above, resulting in Fragment B (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>DNase I footprinting assays were carried out in 30 &#x003bc;l of binding buffer (1 mM Tris, pH7.5, 5 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.7 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 ng poly-(dI-dC), 12% glycerol) with a final DNA concentration of 2 nM. NarL was purified and phosphorylated using acetyl phosphate as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Following phosphorylation, NarL was immediately diluted to the indicated concentrations and DNA binding was allowed to proceed at 22&#x000b0;C for 10 min. DNase I (Sigma) was added (2 &#x003bc;l of a 1:250 dilution of 10 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> stock in water) and incubation continued for six min at 22&#x000b0;C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 7 &#x003bc;l of stop buffer (0.1 M ETDA, pH 8, 1.7 M sodium acetate, pH 5, 0.1 &#x003bc;g poly-(dI-dC)). Following precipitation, the samples were resuspended in loading dye, subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 M urea, and detected by autoradiography. Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions were performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Hydroxyl radical footprinting at the <italic>dmsA</italic> promoter was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. NarL binding to the indicated DNA fragment was performed as described above, omitting glycerol from the binding buffer. Following the 10 min binding reaction, a freshly prepared DNA cleavage mixture was added (3 &#x003bc;l each of 20 mM L-ascorbic acid, 1.5% hydrogen peroxide, 20 mM iron (Fe<sup>+2</sup>) EDTA). After 1 min at 22&#x000b0;C, cleavage was terminated by the addition of 3 &#x003bc;l of 0.5 M thiourea and 7 &#x003bc;l stop buffer.
