Several herpesvirus proteins are required for replication and dissemination within the nervous system, indicating that exploiting the nervous system as a niche for productive infection requires a specialized set of functions encoded by the virus. Whether initial entry into the nervous system from peripheral tissues also requires specialized viral functions is not known. Here we show that a conserved deubiquitinase domain embedded within a pseudorabies virus structural protein, pUL36, is essential for initial neural invasion, but is subsequently dispensable for transmission within and between neurons of the mammalian nervous system. These findings indicate that the deubiquitinase contributes to neurovirulence by participating in a previously unrecognized initial step in neuroinvasion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Subsets of herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus and pseudorabies virus, are neuroinvasive pathogens. Upon infection, these viruses efficiently target peripheral nervous system tissue and establish a life-long infection for which there is no cure. Very few pathogens are known that invade the nervous system proficiently, and the mechanism by which herpesviruses achieve neuroinvasion is largely unknown.

Four viruses of this group infect humans: herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and simian herpes B virus (SHBV). The latter is associated with rare life-threatening zoonotic infections. Diseases associated with these viruses range from minor recurrent lesions to shingles, keratitis and encephalitis. All of these pathologies can occur as a consequence of viral dissemination into the nervous system. There are additional neuroinvasive herpesviruses that infect mammals other than humans. Among these, pseudorabies virus (PRV) has a broad host range and is commonly associated with severe encephalitic infections, making it a useful model for studies of neuroinvasion and pathogenesis &#x0005b;reviewed in 1&#x0005d;. In addition, the propensity of PRV to transmit neuron-to-neuron during encephalitic spread has led to its use as a self-amplifying tracer for mapping of the vertebrate neural circuitry &#x0005b;reviewed in 2&#x0005d;. PRV is closely related to VZV (both are members of the varicellovirus subgroup of the alpha-herpesvirus family), and shares a common structure, similar genetic composition and a related infectious cycle with all neuroinvasive herpesviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Enquist2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-McGeoch1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To date, mutant viruses displaying defects in neurotropism fall into two categories: neuron-specific replication mutants and axon transport mutants.

In this report, we demonstrate that an isolate of PRV mutated in a critical catalytic residue of the pUL36 DUB domain replicates and spreads within the nervous system, but is severely attenuated in its ability to initially invade the nervous system from peripheral tissues. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, the DUB mutant virus was found to transport in axons both following entry (retrograde transport) and replication (anterograde transport) in cultured neurons. Furthermore, the DUB mutant replicated and spread in the nervous system following direct inoculation: either by injecting mutant virus into the brain or vitreous chamber of the eye. Unlike previously described neuroinvasive mutant viruses, the DUB mutant was competent to spread to synaptically-linked second- and third-order CNS neurons in a manner similar to wild-type infections in both anterograde and retrograde circuitry. Together, these findings demonstrate that the pUL36 deubiquitinase represents a novel neuroinvasion determinant that functions at a previously unrecognized initial step in penetration of the nervous system from peripheral tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation and initial characterization of the pUL36 mutant virus</title><p>A conserved cysteine residue in the pUL36 tegument protein that is critical for the proteolytic activity responsible for deubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Schlieker1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Schlieker2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> is also required for efficient invasion of the central nervous system by PRV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Bttcher1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Intravitreal injection into the eye can expose the iris and ciliary body to viral inoculum, which receive autonomic innervation. The time course of infection and retrograde spread of PRV in these circuits is somewhat variable due to the gelatinous matrix of the vitreous body (compared to the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber, see below). Nevertheless, in these experiments wild-type virus was reproducibly observed to have infected the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW) of the midbrain, preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that project to neurons in the ciliary ganglion via the oculomotor nerve, which in turn innervates the smooth muscles in the iris and ciliary body in the eye to mediate pupillary constriction and lens accommodation, respectively. In contrast, capsid fluorescence was never detected in the EW following C26A virus infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000387-t001">Table 1</xref>). Wild-type virus also spread to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) via a retrograde circuit of sympathetic origin (from iris, to superior cervical ganglion to spinal cord to paraventricular nucleus). Consistent with an inability to spread in retrograde circuitry, no labeled cells were observed in the PVN of C26A virus infected animals (data not shown). However, one animal that received an intravitreal injection of C26A virus showed clear signs of retrograde spread to the oculomotor nucleus, which innervates 4 of the 6 extraocular muscles of the eye (data not shown). While this result was only observed once, it cannot be ignored as it indicates that the C26A virus was capable of spreading from the eye to the brain via a retrograde circuit under some circumstances. We hypothesized that damage to the sclera (outer layer of the eye) and attached extraocular muscles resulting from intravitreal injection may sometimes allow for spread from the extraocular muscle to the oculomotor nucleus in the brain. Therefore, further examination of retrograde spread was necessary to determine the specific defect resulting from the C26A mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The C26A virus is competent to spread in anterograde and retrograde circuits</title><p>To determine if the C26A virus was capable of intracellular transport in both the retrograde and anterograde directions, we examined axonal transport in cultured dorsal root sensory neurons by tracking red-fluorescence emissions from capsid particles by time-lapse microscopy. In these assays, the C26A virus behaved similarly to the wild-type virus, having only small decreases in axon transport during both stages of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000387-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These findings demonstrate that intracellular transport of the C26A virus was intact, and suggests the defect observed after intravitreal injection was likely due to a change in intercellular viral spread in animals. While these results did not immediately explain the defect observed in spread through retrograde sympathetic and parasympathetic circuits following intravitreal inoculation (i.e. to the EW and PVN), they were consistent with the one instance of C26A virus spread to the oculomotor region of the midbrain.</p><fig id="ppat-1000387-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000387.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Viral transport dynamics in axons of cultured primary neurons.</title><p>(A) Representative example of retrograde transport of an individual capsid in a dorsal root sensory axon after infection with the C26A virus, shown as a time-lapse montage.

Preliminary studies indicated that the decrease in titer correlated to an increase in the particle&#x02236;PFU ratio of the C26A virus, as the C26A virus produced approximately equal numbers of fluorescent viral particles as the wild-type virus (data not shown). Therefore, by concentrating the C26A stocks to attain titers comparable to the wild-type virus, which were necessary to initiate reproducible infections of the nervous system, defective particles in the concentrated C26A viral stock may have interfered with infection of the retrograde circuits. As an initial test for interference, a stock of wild-type virus (PRV-GS847) was prepared as a concentrated stock and inoculated into the anterior chamber of the eye. Although 10-fold more viral particles were inoculated in this experiment than normal, retrograde transmission to the EW occurred unabated (data not shown). As a second test for interference, the C26A virus was mixed with an equal titer of PRV-152 virus and co-injected into the anterior chamber of the eye. PRV-152 is a derivative of the PRV-Bartha strain, which is an attenuated PRV isolate that is incapable of spread in anterograde circuits but retains spread in all retrograde circuitry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Pickard1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. PRV-152 encodes a GFP reporter cassette driven by a cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, and therefore provides a fluorescent marker that is distinct both spectrally and spatially from the RFP-capsid emissions of the C26A virus (mRFP1-capsid fluorescence is most profound in the nucleus of an infected cell, whereas the GFP signal is diffuse throughout the cell body and neurites of an infected neuron). If the concentrated stock of C26A virus inhibited infection of the sympathetic and parasympathetic circuits innervating the eye, PRV-152 infection of the same circuits should also be blocked in a co-infection paradigm. However, interference was never observed and GFP fluorescence indicating presence of PRV-152 was readily detected in the EW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000387-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, RFP-capsid fluorescence emissions indicative of the C26A virus were now also detected in the EW of these co-injected animals.</p><p>Spread of C26A virus to the EW in the co-injection experiment indicated that PRV-152 had complemented the C26A defect. For complementation to occur, both viruses would have had to replicate in a common cell prior to entering the nervous system. This provided an incentive to examine the iris and ciliary body of the co-injected animals for co-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000387-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). Infection of the ciliary body and iris by both PRV-152 and the C26A virus was frequently observed and areas infected by either virus often displayed some degree of overlap, indicating that initial replication in these tissues prior to neuroinvasion provided an opportunity for the C26A virus to benefit from the unaltered pUL36 protein expressed by PRV-152 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000387-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, and data not shown). In a subsequent experiment, the C26A virus was found to infect cells of the iris efficiently when injected alone into the anterior chamber of the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000387-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

We expect that a similar event likely occurred in the one intravitreal injected animal in which C26A virus spread specifically to the oculomotor nucleus (see above). To determine if injection can, in some instances, allow for direct exposure of the inoculum to axons embedded within the peripheral tissue, the beta subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 was injected into the eyelid. CTB is a retrograde tracer, but unlike neuroinvasive herpesviruses which spread trans-synaptically, CTB labeling is restricted to the neuron cell body from which an axon projects. Furthermore, CTB must come into direct contact with the axon to label the distal neuronal cell body. Of 6 animals tested, only one showed CTB retrograde label into the brain. The absence of CNS labeling in the remaining five animals indicated that injection into the eyelid infrequently allowed for direct exposure to nerve endings. This finding was consistent with the conclusion that the C26A virus is specifically incapable of invading the mammalian nervous system from tissues innervated by the PNS, except in infrequent cases when nerve endings become directly exposed to the inoculum.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since its discovery four years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Schlieker1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, the herpesvirus pUL36 deubiquitinase has been the focus of several reports due to its potential as a target for the development of novel antiviral compounds. The DUB is conserved in all herpesviruses so far examined, and enzymatic assays are available to aid in screens for small molecule inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Kattenhorn1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Sompallae1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. However, little is known regarding the role of the DUB in the herpesvirus infectious cycle and its significance to productive infection, and substrates of the DUB during infection have yet to be identified. Surprisingly, the DUB is one of the few domains of the large pUL36 tegument protein (an essential herpesvirus structural component) that is dispensable for herpesvirus propagation in cultured cells. Although mutation of the DUB in several herpesviruses reduces viral propagation kinetics, the underlying defect associated with these mutants in cultured cells is unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Wang2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Lee1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Jarosinski1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Initial studies of DUB-mutant herpesviruses in animal models have revealed more substantial defects. MDV, a herpesvirus noted for its oncogenic activity, requires the DUB to produce tumors in chickens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Jarosinski1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Because the underlying deficiencies that produce these fundamental losses in pathogenesis are not understood, we sought to explore the PRV neuroinvasive defect in greater detail. Although the DUB activity in PRV has yet to be studied enzymatically, the conservation of the DUB activity throughout all three branches of the herpesviridae indicates that the DUB is important for the pathogenesis of these viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Schlieker1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Gredmark1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Jarosinski1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our initial experiments produced results consistent with a selective loss of retrograde trafficking in the nervous system; however, retrograde transport of the C26A virus was unmasked by either infecting neurons directly in the retina or brain, or presumably by mechanical damage at the site of injection. An important insight was fortuitously made when the C26A mutant was co-infected with a virus encoding a wild-type pUL36 protein (PRV-Bartha), resulting in the rescue of the C26A defect and retrograde spread to the brain. This trans-complementation could only occur if the C26A virus remained competent to infect cells prior to neuroinvasion, which was subsequently confirmed by examining the eye for infection. Therefore, the C26A mutation resulted in a virus that replicated in non-neuronal cells both in culture and in the iris, and also replicated and spread in cultured neurons and neural circuits <italic>in vivo</italic>, but largely failed to spread between the innervated non-neuronal tissue and the innervating neurons. Such a defect has never been observed for a neuroinvasive herpesvirus before, and reveals that a previously unrecognized barrier to viral dissemination into the nervous system is overcome by the amino-terminal deubiquitinase domain embedded in the pUL36 protein. The neuroinvasion defect was rescued by either co-infection with a virus encoding a wild-type pUL36 protein or by repairing the C26A mutation directly, confirming that the neuroinvasive defect mapped to the pUL36-encoded DUB.</p><p>In contrast to the results presented here, a previous study that examined the role of the PRV DUB following intranasal infection reported only a general delay in neuroinvasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Bttcher1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by findings made with a replication-defective mutant of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), a neuroinvasive herpesvirus related to PRV. Although a replication-defective virus cannot propagate and spread infection cell to cell, the HSV-2 replication-defective mutant nevertheless infected the nervous system following intranasal inoculation in mice, although not as efficiently as wild-type HSV-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-DaCosta1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Because the same HSV-2 mutant was not detected in the nervous system following intradermal or intramuscular inoculation, these findings indicate that neurons are directly exposed to viral inoculum in the nasal cavity. Therefore, neuroinvasive defects can be partially obscured by a low level of direct neuron exposure in intranasal infection models, which likely explains the previous PRV findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Bttcher1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Direct exposure of neurons was also occasionally a complication in our eye and eyelid injection paradigms but in these instances was presumably a result of tissue damage from the injection procedure, which is consistent with cholera toxin sporadically labeling neurons following injection of some animals.</p><p>Identification of the molecular determinants that promote the neuroinvasive behavior of this class of herpesviruses not only provides insight into the underlying mechanisms of viral dissemination within host tissues, but also into the relationship between tissue tropism and pathogenesis. Yet, the majority of herpesviruses are not neuroinvasive pathogens, which argues that the pUL36 DUB may perform a more fundamental role during infection. Infection of cultured cells with DUB-mutant herpesviruses has revealed delays in viral assembly, propagation kinetics and cell-cell spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Bttcher1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Wang2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Jarosinski1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>; however, how these generalized defects relate to the specific phenotype seen in animals reported here is unclear. One possible role for the DUB is cell-to-cell transmission of infection. All herpesviruses are noted for their ability to establish latent infections in cell types other than those first exposed to the virus during natural infections. For example, Epstein-Barr virus first infects epithelial cells in lymphoepithelial structures such as the tonsils, and then spreads to B-lymphocytes where latency is established. The general propensity of herpesviruses to transfer from one cell type to another across presumably specialized regions of cell-cell contact may have an underlying requirement for the deubiquitinase activity of pUL36. Because pUL36 is a cytosolic protein, a possible mode of action would be to promote newly assembled intracellular virions to exit cells at sites of cell-cell contact that would otherwise be obscured from the virus. We expect that 2-chamber models will allow further examination of the DUB mutant in epithelia-neuron transmission in culture; however, this will require developing a system where neurites can be effectively excluded from exposure to the initial viral inoculum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Chng1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Kristensson1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000387-Liu1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The pUL36 tegument protein is greater than 300 kDa in neuroinvasive herpesviruses such as HSV and PRV, with the amino-terminal DUB amounting to less than 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the protein's mass.

The micropipette was lowered 7.7&#x02013;7.8 mm from the dura mater, thus avoiding involvement of the retinal axons in the optic chiasm, and approximately 200 nl (the Nanoject II was set to the 207 nl volume preset) of a 1&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml stock of PRV-GS1652 were ejected into the hypothalamic neuropil. The micropipette was left in place for about 1 minute before slowing retracting, and the craniotomy was packed with gelfoam and the incision was sutured.</p></sec><sec id="s4f3"><title>Eyelid injections</title><p>Under isoflurane inhalation anesthetic (2.5&#x02013;5&#x00025;), the skin of the upper eyelid of one eye was injected with 2 &#x000b5;l of PRV-GS1652 (1&#x02013;4.25&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml) and the upper eyelid of the other eye was injected with 2 &#x000b5;l of PRV152 (1&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml). In a separate set of experiments, animals received a unilateral upper eyelid injection of 2 &#x000b5;l of cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) using a Nanoject II nanoinjector fitted with a glass micropipette (Drummond Scientific Co, Broomall, PA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>After post-injection intervals ranging from 2&#x02013;11 days, animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg, i.p.), and perfused transcardially with 0.9&#x00025; saline followed by freshly prepared fixative consisting of 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.1 M), pH 7.3. Brains were removed, stored in the same fixative containing 30&#x00025; sucrose at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, and sectioned at 40 &#x000b5;m in the coronal plane on a sliding microtome equipped with a freezing stage (Physitemp Instruments Inc., Clifton, NJ). Sections were collected in phosphate buffer, mounted on subbed slides, blotted to remove excess buffer, and coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Coverslips were sealed with fingernail polish to prevent dehydration, and slides were stored in the dark at 4&#x000b0;C. EGFP and mRFP1 fluorescence is stable under these conditions for several months with minimal quenching. Slides were examined using a Leica (Nussloch, Germany) DMRA light microscope equipped with epifluorescence and fitted with a microstepping servomotor in the z&#x02013;axis. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu (Hamamatsu City, Japan) C4742-95 CCD digital camera under epifluorescence using either EGFP optics (412020 High Q narrow band EGFP filter; Chroma, Brattleboro, VT) or mRFP optics (#41004 HQ Texas Red filter, Chroma) and deconvolved using Openlab fluorescence deconvolution software (Improvision, Boston, MA) running on an Apple Macintosh G4 platform. Digital images were pseudo-colored, and images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop version 6.0.1. Images were enhanced for brightness and contrast.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the expert technical assistance of Anne Simpson, Connie King, and Allison Evans.
