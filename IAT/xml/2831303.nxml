Unique to the <italic>norVW</italic> promoter in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is the presence of three enhancer sites associated with a binding site for &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase. Here we show that all three sites are required for NorR-dependent catalysis of open complex formation by &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-RNAP holoenzyme (E&#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>). We demonstrate that this is essentially due to the need for all three enhancers for maximal ATPase activity of NorR, energy from which is used to remodel the closed E&#x003c3;<sup>54</sup> complex and allow melting of the promoter DNA. We also find that site-specific DNA binding <italic>per se</italic> promotes oligomerisation but the DNA flanking the three sites is needed to further stabilise the functional higher order oligomer of NorR at the enhancers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive radical species that is toxic to micro-organisms. It can be encountered exogenously, as a consequence of pathogen invasion, or endogenously through the process of respiratory denitrification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is known to possess at least three enzymes capable of directly detoxifying NO, by utilising either NO reductase or NO dioxygenase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). One of these systems comprises the enzyme flavorubredoxin (encoded by <italic>norV</italic>) and its associated NADH oxidoreductase (encoded by <italic>norW</italic>), which reduces the NO radical to nitrous oxide under anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Immediately upstream of the <italic>norVW</italic> genes is the divergently transcribed <italic>norR</italic> gene, which encodes an NO sensing &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-dependent transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This protein is essential for activating transcription of the <italic>norVW</italic> operon and shares &#x0223c;40% sequence homology with <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic> NorR, which is responsible for the transcriptional regulation of heme <italic>b</italic><sub>3</sub>-iron NO reductase in response to NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). NorR has a modular domain architecture typical of bacterial &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-dependent enhancer binding proteins (bEBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and consists of three key domains: an N-terminal regulatory GAF (for cGMP-specific and cGMP-regulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, <italic>Anabaena</italic> Adenylyl cyclase and <italic>E. coli</italic> transcription factor FhlA) domain containing a mononuclear ferrous iron centre that detects NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), a central AAA+ (for ATPase associated with various cellular activities) domain that interacts with &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup> and couples ATP hydrolysis to promoter DNA melting by RNA polymerase, and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain.</p><p>Previously we reported that <italic>E. coli</italic> NorR binds to three sites upstream of the <italic>norV</italic> promoter that contain inverted repeats with core consensus GT-(N7)-AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). These NorR-binding sites are conserved amongst the proteobacteria and are found upstream of genes encoding NorV (e.g. <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>), Hmp (e.g. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) and NorA (<italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, integration host factor (IHF) binds to the region upstream of <italic>norVW</italic> between the <italic>norV</italic> transcription start site and the NorR enhancer sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In common with other &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-dependent systems, the bending of DNA induced by IHF at this location may encourage interactions between NorR and &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase by DNA looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>bEBPs function by coupling the energy yielded from ATP hydrolysis to the isomerisation of &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase from the closed promoter complex to the open promoter complex that is competent for transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). Oligomerisation of the AAA+ domain of bEBPs to form hexameric rings is required for the formation of a functional ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>) but not for ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In some cases the ATPase activity of bEBPs is not only regulated in response to environmental signals but is also responsive to interaction with specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>).</p><p>We previously demonstrated that the ATPase activity of NorR is enhancer DNA-dependent <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Here we report that each of the three NorR enhancer sites upstream of the <italic>norV</italic> promoter is essential for transcriptional activation. We demonstrate that this is a consequence of the stringent requirement for the three enhancers for maximal ATPase activity of NorR through promoting and stabilising a functional higher order oligomer of the activator. We use a GAF domain deleted form of NorR (NorR&#x00394;GAF), which can activate transcription in the absence of NO, to correlate ATP hydrolysis with higher order oligomer formation. We also suggest that the NorR oligomer formed at the three enhancers is stabilised by the wrapping of flanking DNA around the higher order oligomer identified in negative-stain electron microscopy images.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> NorR&#x00394;GAF was over-expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).

For these experiments and all subsequent biochemical assays described here, we used a truncated derivative of NorR (NorR&#x00394;GAF) that retains the AAA+ and the DNA-binding domains, but lacks the NO responsive GAF domain. We have demonstrated previously that NorR&#x00394;GAF activates <italic>norVW</italic> transcription in the absence of NO both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The DNA-binding characteristics of NorR&#x00394;GAF are similar to that of wild-type NorR (data not shown). As observed previously, the interaction of NorR with the three enhancer sites in the wild-type promoter was manifested by protection and enhancement of G residues between position &#x02212;137 and &#x02212;84 relative to the <italic>norV</italic> transcript initiation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In the case of the site 1 mutant, protection was observed at sites 2 and 3 but was absent at site 1 as anticipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Similarly, with either the site 2 or 3 mutant, protection by NorR&#x00394;GAF was lost at the mutant site but was maintained at the two remaining wild type enhancer sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and D). However, some methylation enhancement was detectable in most cases at the mutant sites. If NorR binding to the three sites is strongly co-operative it would be expected that disruption of a single site would influence binding to the wild-type sites. As this was not evident from the methylation protection experiments, the mutations apparently prevent binding of NorR to each of the mutant sites, without discernable loss of binding to the remaining wild-type sites. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Methylation protection footprinting of wild type and mutant <italic>norR-norV</italic> intergenic region constructs with NorR&#x00394;GAF.

This suggests that in the absence of NO, the GAF domain represses the ATPase activity of the AAA+ domain and that binding to specific DNA targets is also required for ATPase activation. In the case of the truncated NorR&#x00394;GAF protein, the requirement for NO-dependent signal activation is relieved, but the presence of DNA containing the <italic>norR-norV</italic> intergenic region is still required for significant ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). This further suggests that binding to the enhancer sites is necessary to activate the ATPase activity of NorR.</p><p>In order to investigate the role of individual enhancer sites in activation of the ATPase activity, we assayed ADP release in the presence and absence of DNA fragments carrying mutations in each of the NorR-binding sites. In the absence of promoter DNA, NorR&#x00394;GAF exhibited a low level of ATP hydrolysis (&#x0003c;50 mM ATP min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> mol <sup>&#x02212;1</sup> NorR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, solid bars).

These results imply that under these conditions, at relatively low protein concentrations (300 nM), NorR&#x00394;GAF must be bound to all three enhancer binding sites to catalyse ATP hydrolysis. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>ATPase and open complex stimulating activities of NorR&#x00394;GAF associated with wild type and mutant promoter DNA constructs.

We assayed open promoter complex formation by NorR&#x00394;GAF on wild type and mutant promoter templates in the presence of &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase, IHF, CTP and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and quantified the heparin resistant species resolved on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Although the binding of NorR to enhancer binding sites is itself heparin resistant, the mobility of nucleoprotein complexes formed upon open complex formation is considerably slower and such complexes can be detected as a super-shifted species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). At low concentrations of NorR&#x00394;GAF (115 and 230 nM), open complex formation was only observed on the DNA fragment with the three wild type NorR enhancer sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4).

This analysis confirmed that the level of open complexes formed at the mutant promoter constructs was minimal compared to the wild type at relatively low protein concentrations (&#x0003c;200 nM) but increased to 50% or less of the wild type at 460 nM NorR&#x00394;GAF. At this relatively high concentration it is possible that activation of promoter bound &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-RNAP by NorR&#x00394;GAF occurs from solution as observed with other &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-dependent activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>Three shifted bands (other than the super-shifted species) were visible in reactions containing the wild type DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 2&#x02013;5).

The presence of more than one band is indicative of partial occupancy of the enhancer sites at relatively low protein concentrations under these buffer conditions. We assume that the three bands result from the binding of NorR to one, two or all three sites (labelled as NorR&#x02013;DNA complexes A, B or C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). It is notable that bands B and C were evident in reactions carried out with the site 2 mutant DNA fragment whereas band C was the main species visible with fragments containing the site 1 or site 3 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;10, 12&#x02013;15 and 17&#x02013;20, respectively).

Interestingly, the isolated AAA+ domain of NorR had negligible ATPase activity compared to that of NorR&#x00394;GAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, left panel). This result may suggest that DNA binding actively promotes ATPase activity (probably through promoting oligomerisation of AAA+ domain) rather than simply relieving an inhibition imposed by the DNA-binding domain. Indeed the AAA+ domain fails to form higher order oligomers at high concentration and in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, right panel).</p></sec><sec><title>Binding to a 66 bp fragment containing three enhancer sites (NorR123) marginally increases the ATPase activity relative to binding to a single NorR1 site</title><p>Our data show that DNA binding <italic>per se</italic> promotes self-association and ATPase activity. We next tested whether availability of the three consecutive sites further enhances the ATPase activity of NorR&#x00394;GAF. We used a 66 bp DNA fragment (NorR123), which is the minimum DNA length containing the three NorR-binding sites based on previous DNA footprinting results. ATPase activity assays were performed with increasing NorR&#x00394;GAF concentrations while maintaining a 3 : 1 activator monomer: DNA molar stoichiometry in the complex. This optimal DNA to protein molar stoichiometry was determined as described above by fixing protein and ATP concentrations and varying DNA:protein ratios for optimal ATP turnover (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1065/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1A</ext-link>, right panel).

Size exclusion chromatography indicated that the complexes elute as multiple peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), implying a highly heterogeneous population of oligomers. Our results so far indicate that the increased ATPase activity of NorR&#x00394;GAF upon binding to enhancer DNA is largely due to DNA binding <italic>per se</italic> rather than increased local protein concentration at the three enhancer sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding to a 266 bp DNA fragment, containing the three enhancer sites, strongly stimulates the ATPase activity of NorR</title><p>As stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by the 66 bp oligonucleotide was less than anticipated for a DNA fragment containing all three NorR enhancer sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), we measured the ATPase activity of NorR&#x00394;GAF in complex with a longer (266 bp) DNA fragment. We performed ATPase assays with this fragment using a protein:DNA stoichoiometry of 6 : 1, which was again chosen based on the optimal ATPase activity at fixed protein and ATP concentrations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1065/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1B</ext-link>).

Furthermore, the sigmoidal nature of the curve indicates clear evidence for cooperativity. Size exclusion chromatography of NorR&#x00394;GAF in complex with the 266 bp DNA fragment revealed a significant shift towards a higher molecular mass species (elution peak at 9.3 ml; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), suggesting that this DNA fragment stabilises a higher order oligomeric form of NorR&#x00394;GAF (possibly a hexamer), in contrast to the complexes observed on the 21 and 66 bp oligonucleotides (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>B with 6B). The presence of DNA in the peak fraction was confirmed by measuring the absorption at 280 and 260 nm wavelengths. We infer from these observations that stabilisation of a higher order oligomer on the 266 bp fragment may be responsible for the increased stimulation of the ATPase activity of NorR&#x00394;GAF. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The ATPase activity and oligomerisation state of NorR&#x00394;GAF in the presence of the 266 bp dsDNA that contains all three enhancer sites.

Whereas only a single shifted species was observed on the 266 bp DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), partial occupancy of the enhancer sites was evident at low protein concentrations with the 66 bp DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Quantitation of the fully shifted species showed that NorR&#x00394;GAF has a 2-fold higher affinity for the 266 bp DNA fragment (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>, 81 nM) compared to the 66 bp DNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>, 174 nM). Moreover, the NorR&#x00394;GAF-DNA-binding curve for the 266 bp DNA fragment exhibited increased positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 3.4 compared with 1.3 for the 66 bp oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). This increase in affinity and cooperativity is consistent with a more stable hexameric ring formation, in agreement with the increased ATP turnover observed with the longer DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the increase in affinity is due to thermodynamic requirements for DNA recognition, it is highly likely that the affinity increase is due to additional interactions between protein and DNA, such as those encountered through the DNA wrapping around NorR. Nevertheless, under the conditions at which the ATPase activity and gel filtration were measured (micromolar concentrations), the DNA should be fully saturated with protein, thus the differences in gel filtration profile and ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) are likely due to the different nature of the nucleoprotein complexes formed rather than the different affinities for the protein&#x02013;DNA interaction. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>NorR&#x00394;GAF has a higher affinity for the 266 bp DNA fragment than for the 66 bp DNA fragment NorR123.

Similar conclusions have been derived from deletion analysis of this promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and also the <italic>Ralstonia eutropha norB</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Our data extend these observations and characterise the requirement for the three enhancers <italic>in vitro.</italic> The presumed physiological role of bacterial enhancers is to tether activators at high local concentration close to the promoter and to facilitate the formation of higher oligomeric forms that are active for transcriptional activation. While multiple enhancers are common in &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoters, an absolute dependency on more than one target site is unusual. For example, two enhancers are sufficient to assemble higher order oligomers of NtrC, in which some protomers are bound by protein&#x02013;protein interactions and apparently do not contact DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In contrast, our data for NorR indicate that all three enhancer sites are necessary for the formation of an active oligomeric species. When present at high concentration, bEBPs can activate transcription from solution in the absence of enhancer DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> and some &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-dependent activators naturally lack a DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Moreover, in many cases the DNA-binding domain does not appear to be essential for transcriptional activation. For example, PspF lacking the enhancer-binding domain (PspF<sub>1&#x02013;275</sub>) can form high-order oligomers and activate transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>The increased ATPase activity of NorR&#x00394;GAF observed upon binding to the three enhancer sites could be due to one or all of the following three reasons: (i) DNA binding induces conformational changes that promote self-association and therefore increases ATPase activity, (ii) DNA binding stimulates ATPase activity <italic>per se</italic>, (iii) since there are three NorR-binding sites, binding to DNA increases the local protein concentration and thus promotes self-association, which increases the ATPase activity. Our data suggest that the significant increase in ATPase activity upon binding to enhancer sites is not likely to be a consequence of self-association resulting from an increase in local protein concentration. It is more likely due to the conformational changes induced by DNA binding that promote hexameric ring formation and ATP hydrolysis <italic>per se</italic>, therefore increasing the ATPase activity. Hence in the case of NorR, in addition to GAF domain activation, the enhancer DNA sites provide an important ligand to promote assembly of the active oligomeric form of the activator. This is in stark contrast to the activation mechanism of other bEBPs such as NtrC, where activation of the receiver domain is key to hexamer formation and ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Our results are consistent with the observation that all three NorR-binding sites are required for catalytic activity. Mutating any one of the sites abolishes binding of one NorR dimer to the DNA, therefore preventing proper hexameric ring formation. However, in the absence of DNA, ATPase activity increases with protein concentration, in agreement with the observation that open complex formation can be achieved in the absence of enhancer DNA at relatively high concentrations of NorR. This demonstrates that although the native conformation in the absence of DNA is not optimal for formation of higher order oligomers (as shown in gel filtration experiments), at higher protein concentrations and in the presence of ATP, oligomerisation can occur to enable catalytic activity. However, the higher order complexes formed under these conditions are likely to be far less stable than the nucleoprotein complexes formed in the presence of the three enhancer sites. In the absence of the DNA-binding domain, the isolated AAA+ domain of NorR fails to form higher order oligomers and the ATPase activity is further reduced compared to NorR&#x00394;GAF, consistent with the hypothesis that the DNA-binding domain can promote oligomerisation, and hence ATPase activity. DNA binding appears to shift the conformation of NorR&#x00394;GAF to a form that favours hexameric ring formation at physiological protein concentrations, thus providing the necessary ATPase activity required for open complex formation.</p><p>The requirement for three consecutive enhancer sites is reminiscent of the EBP-related protein TyrR, which is proposed to bind as a dimer to three TyrR boxes, forming a hexameric species that is active in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Another unusual feature of the NorR&#x02013;DNA interaction is the heparin resistance of the protein&#x02013;DNA complexes, which implies that NorR makes extensive DNA contacts, possibly forming a topologically distinct nucleoprotein complex. Our EM data show that in the presence of the 266 bp DNA fragment carrying the three enhancer sites, NorR&#x00394;GAF forms oligomeric rings, similar to other bEBPs in their active functional states. The precise mechanism whereby the enhancer DNA stabilises ring formation is currently unclear. One possible model is that the DNA wraps around the hexameric ring, making extensive contacts that help to stabilise it. Assuming that the diameter of the hexameric ring assembly of the AAA+ domain is &#x0223c;120 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), a minimum of 450 &#x000c5; (the total diameter to the centre of duplex DNA is 120 + 25 &#x000c5;) or &#x0223c;130 bp DNA is required to wrap around the ring. The 66 bp NorR123 oligonucleotide would therefore be insufficient, consistent with our finding that the stimulatory effect of this DNA fragment, which contains all three UAS sites, is similar that of the 21 bp oligonucleotide, which carries only a single UAS site.</p><p>The assembly of bEBPs into at least a hexamer is necessary for activation of the ATPase activity required to drive the transition of the &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>-RNA polymerase promoter complex from the closed to the open DNA-melted state. Although the experiments described here have been performed with a constitutive form of NorR lacking the regulatory GAF domain, the ATPase activity of wild-type NorR is also enhancer dependent, and in addition requires the binding of NO to the ferrous iron centre to activate the catalytic activity of the AAA+ domain. Given that the NorR apoprotein is fully competent for DNA binding, the three enhancers clearly provide a scaffold for the assembly of a stable heparin-resistant NorR nucleoprotein complex that is poised at the promoter, ready to perceive the NO signal. In contrast to other EBPs such as NtrC and DctD which are dimeric in their inactive forms and are regulated through control of the oligomerisation state, the activity of wild-type NorR is apparently regulated when bound to DNA as a higher order oligomer.</p><p>In summary, our data support a unique activation mechanism for NorR. Three NorR dimers readily bind to the three consecutive UAS sites. DNA binding by NorR induces conformational changes that stimulate hexameric ring formation. NorR then forms a hexameric ring with extensive DNA interactions (possibly through DNA wrapping) for increased stability. In the presence of the NO signal, intramolecular repression of the AAA+ domain by the GAF domain is released, activating ATPase activity and allowing the NorR hexamer to interact with RNAP-&#x003c3;<sup>54</sup> and activate transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1065/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (to R.D.)
