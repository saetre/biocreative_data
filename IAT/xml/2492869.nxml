The urease was purified 51-fold with a recovery of 12% of the enzyme activity and 0.24% of the total protein. The enzyme had an isoelectric point of 5, and showed optimal activity at pH 7.0 and 28&#x02013;35&#x000b0;C. The purified enzyme exhibited a Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics with a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m </italic></sub>of 5.60 &#x000b1; 0.69 mM. Hydroxyurea and thiourea are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme with K<sub>i </sub>of 1.04 &#x000b1; 0.31 mM and 26.12 &#x000b1; 2.30 mM, respectively. Acetohydroxamic acid also inhibits the enzyme in a competitive way. The molecular weight estimated for the native enzyme was between 130&#x02013;135 kDa by gel filtration chromatography and 157 &#x000b1; 7 kDa using 5&#x02013;10% polyacrylamide gradient non-denaturing gel. Only three subunits in SDS-PAGE were identified: two small subunits of 14,000 Da and 15,500 Da, and a major subunit of 66,000 Da.

This infectious disease affects different animal species and is transmitted to humans in several ways, the most common through ingestion of raw milk or other unpasteurized dairy products. The preferred ecological niche for the brucellae is within phagosomal compartments of host macrophages; the capacity of this bacterial pathogen to establish and maintain chronic infections is dependent upon its ability to replicate within these phagocytic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>Brucella </italic>belongs to the alpha-2 subdivision of the <italic>Proteobacteria </italic>and they are therefore phylogenetically related to the plant cell-associated species of the genera <italic>Rhizobium </italic>and <italic>Agrobacterium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>A wide variety of environmentally and medically important bacteria produce the enzyme urease (urea amidohydrolase; EC 3.5.1.5), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, leading to the production of carbon dioxide and ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This enzyme allows many soil bacteria to use urea as a nitrogen source. Urease is also an important virulence factor that improves survival of pathogenic bacteria under acidic conditions within the host and can also cause direct damage to the host tissue due to ammonia, CO<sub>2 </sub>or alkali production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Interestingly, some species of <italic>Rhizobiales</italic>, such as <italic>Brucellae </italic>and <italic>Bradyrhizobium </italic>BTAi1 show multiple urease clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This reiteration so far is found in other bacterial species, namely <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>, <italic>S. avermitilis, Pseudomonas syringae </italic>and <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Several bacterial ureases have already been purified and characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. One of the most studied ureases is from <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, a bacterium that is able to persist in the stomach where the pH is very acidic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Urease activity is an important colonization factor by generating ammonia in the immediate bacterial microenvironment, thus protecting <italic>H. pylori </italic>from the deleterious effects of gastric acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, urease activity appears to be responsible for the acid resistance of the invasive enteric pathogen <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, some humans have a genetic predisposition to develop reactive arthritis following a <italic>Y. enterocolitica </italic>infection, which correlates to their serum reactivity with the UreB subunit of <italic>Yersinia </italic>urease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The present work describes the purification as well as the enzymatic and phylogenomic characterization of urease from <italic>Brucella suis </italic>strain 1330; in addition, the urease reactivity of sera from patients diagnosed with brucellosis was examined. To our knowledge, no <italic>Brucella </italic>urease has been previously purified and characterized. Since <italic>Brucella </italic>is a human pathogen, it is important to obtain as much information as possible to complement databases, such as BRENDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These results can then be used by experimentalists and modelers to understand, from a systems biology point of view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the mode of action of enzymes in the pathogen and how that can be modified in order to develop new disease treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Urease was purified from the soluble extract of <italic>B. suis </italic>1330 using two consecutive chromatography steps that resulted in the final isolation of a homogeneous enzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

During the chromatographic purification, all fractions were measured for urease activity and consistently produced one activity at the same salt concentrations. The purified protein showed a specific activity of 540 U/mg. This is in the range of urease specific activities described for other organisms: from very low &#x02013; 8 U/mg for <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] &#x02013; to as high as 3500 U/mg in <italic>Brevibacterium ammoniagenes </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>An SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme revealed the presence of three protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 66,000, 15,500 and 14,000 Da; the low molecular weight bands were poorly stained in contrast to the large subunit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The stoichiometry of the subunits in bacterial ureases has been the subject of considerable investigation. Separation of individual subunits by SDS-PAGE and integration of the staining intensities for the multiple bands reveal near-integer values for the subunits stoichiometries, but these ratios vary for the enzymes from different sources. It is likely that all ureases possess equal numbers of each or their distinct subunits polypeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The molecular weight of the native enzyme obtained by gel filtration on Superose was 130&#x02013;135 kDa, while molecular weight obtained by nondenaturing zymograms gels, appeared as one prominent band with a molecular weight of 157 &#x000b1; 7 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Bacterial native ureases show a range of molecular weights from 140 kDa in <italic>S. salivarius </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] to 300 &#x02013; 600 kDa in <italic>H. pylori </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The isoelectric point was 5.0, very similar to the 5.1 value of urease from <italic>Proteus penneri </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The predicted molecular weight for the three subunits of <italic>B. suis </italic>urease operon 1: URE-A1 (11,129 Da), URE-B1 (11,377 Da) and URE-C1 (61,054 Da), the total molecular weight expected is 83,520 Da, this result is very closed with the molecular weight obtained in the polyacrylamide gradient non-denaturing gel if <italic>B. suis </italic>urease could be in a dimer form (2). Molecular weights higher than expected for the three subunits in the denaturing polyacrylmide gel could be a product of aberrant running. Differences between results in gel filtration chromatography compared with polyacrylamide gradient non-denaturing gel could be a product of different conformation of the standard proteins and the possible multimeric conformation of the <italic>B. suis </italic>urease.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15%) of <italic>Brucella suis </italic>urease after two steps of purification</bold>.

We assayed urease activity in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0, as suggested by Dunn and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although Tris has been described as an inhibitor of urease, a simple control experiment comparing the activity in Tris-HCl and the synthetic buffer HEPES, showed no significant difference (results not shown).</p><p>In terms of temperature stability, ureases from different species of <italic>Lactobacillus </italic>have a very high optimal temperature between 55 to 65&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>is stable between 22 to 60&#x000b0;C but is inactivated above 60&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>B. suis </italic>urease was active between 10&#x02013;45&#x000b0;C, and it was almost completely inactivated above 45&#x000b0;C. The optimal activity was observed between 28&#x02013;35&#x000b0;C, temperatures that are close to the corporal temperature of humans and other animals who are hosts for this pathogen.</p><p>The kinetic study of <italic>B. suis </italic>urease showed a simple Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic behavior (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), in accordance with what has been described for ureases from other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The K<sub>m </sub>obtained by hyperbolic regression was 5.60 &#x000b1; 0.69 mM, and a very similar value (5.24 mM) was obtained with the still widely used Lineweaver-Burk or double reciprocal plot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Hence, <italic>B. suis </italic>urease shows a higher affinity for its substrate than the enzymes from <italic>B. abortus </italic>(13 mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], <italic>P. mirabilis </italic>(39 mM) or <italic>Providencia stuartii </italic>(12 mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], but less affinity than <italic>H. pylori </italic>whose urease has one of the lowest <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m </italic></sub>values (0.3 mM) reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A limited correlation may exist between the value of this kinetic constant and the ecological niche of the host organism. For example, <italic>H. pylori </italic>inhibits the gastric mucosal lining, where low concentrations of urea are present (1.7 to 3.4 mM); such a low kinetic constant would allow this urease to function under close to saturation conditions despite the low substrate concentration. In contrast, microorganisms that are exposed to large amounts of urea such as are found in the urinary tract or in the soil typically possess ureases with higher K<sub>m </sub>values, such as 13, 60, and 40 to 130 mM observed for the enzymes from <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, <italic>Sporosarcina ureae</italic>, and <italic>Bacillus pasteurii</italic>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Kinetics of the <italic>B. suis </italic>urease</bold>.

These are potentially important to control urease related pathogenesis of bacterial infections and in enhancing the efficiency of urea fertilizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We tested the inhibitory effect of three of these compounds, hydroxyurea and thiourea, substrate analogues, and AHA. Both hydroxyurea and thiourea show a competitive type of inhibition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), with K<sub>i </sub>of 1.04 &#x000b1; 0.31 mM for hydroxyurea and 26.12 &#x000b1; 2.30 mM for thiourea. These results agree well with what is described for ureases from other bacteria: the enzyme from <italic>K. aerogenes </italic>is inhibited by thiourea with a K<sub>i </sub>&#x0003e; 25 mM, and hydroxyurea is a competitive inhibitor of the <italic>Brevibacterium ammoniagenes </italic>urease with a K<sub>i </sub>of 0.23 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For AHA, we used a similar approach and obtained a competitive inhibition with K<sub>i </sub>of 0.77 &#x000b1; 0.06 mM.

Results are from a representative experiment using a single enzyme preparation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2180-8-121-5"/></fig><p>Due to the low protein concentration of the low molecular weight bands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), it was not possible to sequence them. Since the active urease apoenzyme consists of UreA, UreB and UreC, it is likely that the smaller bands correspond to UreA and UreB. In the case of 66 kDa protein, we obtained the amino acid sequence MPARISRATYAQM; this sequence matched with <italic>B. suis </italic>UreC1 subunit (BR0270).</p><p>During the last years, several immunoreactive <italic>Brucella </italic>proteins have been identified and evaluated against animal and human serum samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It is well known that urease is the most abundant protein of <italic>H. pylori </italic>and as a result it serves as a significant immunogen and is useful in diagnostic tests. Patients with active gastritis due to <italic>H. pylori </italic>show significantly elevated immunoglobulin G and A sera titers to the urease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the current study, <italic>B. suis </italic>urease was tested for reactivity with human sera from patients with acute and chronic brucellosis by western blot analysis. The IgG antibodies in sera from patients with acute and chronic brucellosis reacted against the large subunit while the lower molecular weight subunits were not recognized. It is possible that the smaller subunits (UreA and UreB) did not react because their concentration was too low or that they are not immunogenic. As expected, healthy individuals were seronegative for reactivity to the UreC1 (data not shown). This is somewhat analogous to the serum reactivity of patients recovering from <italic>Y. entercolitica </italic>infections in which the UreB subunit is recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Although the sequenced genomes of the <italic>Brucella </italic>spp. have two urease operons (<italic>ure</italic>-1 and <italic>ure</italic>-2), it appears that only one is responsible for encoding an active urease. In the case of <italic>B. abortus</italic>, Tn mutagenesis produced mutations of <italic>ure-</italic>1, but not <italic>ure-2</italic>, resulting in decreased urease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Similarly, in the case of <italic>B. suis</italic>, the disruption of the <italic>ure</italic>C2 or <italic>ure</italic>B2, genes does not affect measurable urease activity in <italic>B. suis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, it is perhaps not unexpected that the urease purified in this study was identified as that encoded by <italic>ure</italic>C1 based on N terminal amino acid sequencing. Moreover, the serum from humans diagnosed with brucellosis also reacted with UreC1 and supports the mutational studies that only the <italic>ure</italic>-1 operon is used to produce urease during a <italic>Brucella </italic>infection. It is also noteworthy that the serum from patients infected with <italic>Y. enterocolitica </italic>also shows reactivity to the UreB subunit and is a candidate antigen involved in the induction of reactive arthritis in the same patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This ReA syndrome is also a typical side effect of a significant proportion of patients who have been infected with <italic>Brucella </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or with a number of other pathogens acquired through the gastro-intestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The question remains: why are the bacterial ureases so immunodominant and are they responsible, at least in part, for the induction of ReA as suggested by the arthritogenic peptide theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>PSI-BLAST comparisons showed that UreC1 from <italic>B. suis </italic>has 99% of similarity with either the putative UreC1 from <italic>B. melitensis </italic>or UreC1 from <italic>B. abortus </italic>(encoded by BMEI0647 and BruAb1_0296 genes, respectively). Also, high similarity values were obtained by comparison with the alpha subunits from <italic>M. loti </italic>(81%), <italic>R. leguminosarum </italic>(78%), <italic>S. meliloti </italic>(79%) and <italic>A. tumefaciens </italic>(78%). In contrast, the comparison with UreC2 from <italic>B. suis, B. melitensis </italic>and <italic>B. abortus </italic>(BR1358, BMEI1652, and Bru Ab1_1355 genes, respectively), yielded lower values (around 55%, in each case). To find the relationships of the multiple urease clusters of <italic>B. suis</italic>, we carried out a phylogenetic and structure analysis with ureases from bacterial species with unique or multiple clusters.</p><p>The phylogenetic tree deduced for <italic>B. suis </italic>UreC1 (BR0270, denoted as <italic>B. suis </italic>270) grouped it within the <italic>Rhizobiales </italic>order (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, left). The closely related clades included the typical UreC from other alpha (not shown), beta (<italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>), and gamma (<italic>P. syringae and P. syringae </italic>tomato) proteobacterial species. However, in the other main clade, the UreC2 (BR1358, denoted as <italic>B. suis </italic>1358) was grouped with <italic>Yersinia </italic>and <italic>Photorhabdus </italic>species, both from the gamma proteobacteria subdivision [bootstrap value = 100]. The unexpected phylogenetic relationship of cluster 2 possibly reflects a horizontal gene transfer event, because both <italic>Brucella </italic>and <italic>Yersinia </italic>share the niche (the mammalian cell), are classified as facultative intracellular pathogens and can replicate inside macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In a closely related clade appeared two UreC from <italic>Bradyrhizobium </italic>BTAi1 (denoted as 1962 and 4442) and one from <italic>Pseudomonas syringae </italic>strain B728a (PSYR2197). A similar explanation of horizontal gene transfer could be applied, because these species are common inhabitants of the soil and the plant rhizosphere. Also in this group were the UreC subunits of the distant Actinobacteria species <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor </italic>and <italic>S. avermitilis</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic and cluster structure analysis</bold>.
