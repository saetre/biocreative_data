Herein, levels of the miR-17-5p/miR-20a miRNA cluster were inversely correlated to cyclin D1 abundance in human breast tumors and cell lines. MiR-17/20 suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor colony formation by negatively regulating cyclin D1 translation via a conserved 3&#x02032; untranslated region miRNA-binding site, thereby inhibiting serum-induced S phase entry. The cell cycle effect of miR-17/20 was abrogated by cyclin D1 siRNA and in cyclin D1&#x02013;deficient breast cancer cells. Mammary epithelial cell&#x02013;targeted cyclin D1 expression induced miR-17-5p and miR-20a expression in vivo, and cyclin D1 bound the miR-17/20 cluster promoter regulatory region. In summary, these studies identify a novel cyclin D1/miR-17/20 regulatory feedback loop through which cyclin D1 induces miR-17-5p/miR-20a. In turn, miR-17/20 limits the proliferative function of cyclin D1, thus linking expression of a specific miRNA cluster to the regulation of oncogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; miRNA, microRNA; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; MSCV, mouse stem cell virus; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium; UTR, untranslated region.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21&#x02013;22 nucleotide molecules that regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted mRNAs. Derived from nuclear precursor RNAs, initial processing occurs by the internuclease Drosha to release pre-miRNAs of 60&#x02013;70 nucleotides in length from pri-miRNA. Subsequent transport to the cytoplasm by exportin-5 results in processing by the internuclease Dicer to generate the &#x0223c;22-nucleotide mature miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lund et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). The base pairing interactions between miRNAs and their target mRNAs, often within the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of target genes, results in the degradation of target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambros, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cullen, 2004</xref>) or inhibition of their translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lai, 2002</xref>). To date, 533 miRNAs have been identified in humans (miRBase Sequence Database version 10.0, released in August 2007; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/">http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/</ext-link>). It has been proposed that, as each vertebrate miRNA may bind to as many as 200 gene targets, miRNAs potentially control the expression of about one-third of human mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krek et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Several independent lines of evidence support a role for miRNAs in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Croce and Calin, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2007</xref>). miRNA-encoding genes are frequently located at fragile sites, as well as in minimal regions of loss of heterozygosity, minimal regions of amplification, and in common breakpoint regions involved in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calin et al., 2004</xref>). Aberrant expression of miRNAs or mutations of miRNA genes have been described in many types of tumors. Let-7 abundance is reduced in several cancers, including lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Takamizawa et al., 2004</xref>), and let-7 was reported to regulate tumor growth by targeting the <italic>ras</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>). miR-15a and miR16-1 were deleted and/or down-regulated in &#x0223c;70% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calin et al., 2002</xref>). miR-15a/16-1 induced apoptosis by inhibiting BCL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cimmino et al., 2005</xref>). The miR-34 family is an important component of the p53 tumor suppressor network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2007</xref>). The human miR-17/20 cluster's genomic location, chromosome 13q31, correlates with loss of heterozygosity in several different cancers, including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eiriksdottir et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 1999</xref>). The expression and function of miRNA varies by cell type. The miR-17/20 cluster functions as a tumor suppressor in the human B cell line P493-6 by decreasing <italic>E2F1</italic> expression, thereby inhibiting <italic>myc</italic>-induced cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Donnell et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, in both lung cancer and lymphomas, expression of this miRNA cluster was increased, enhancing cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayashita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2005</xref>). As the same miRNA performs different functions through distinct pathways dependent on the tissue or cell type, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which miRNA regulates the cell cycle and thereby tumorigenesis.</p><p>The onset and progression of tumorigenesis involves evasion of apoptotic signals, sustained cellular proliferation, and the ability to promote tumor neoangiogenesis. <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> overexpression is found in &#x0223c;50% of human breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2004</xref>).

Furthermore, the understanding of the mechanism by which specific oncogenes regulate miRNA expression and function is limited.</p><p>By a large-scale miRnome analysis using miRNA chips on mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)&#x02013;<italic>cyclin D1</italic> transgenic mice and <italic>cyclin D1</italic> knockout mice, we determined a subset of miRNAs controlled by <italic>cyclin D1</italic>. These studies identified a novel regulatory mechanism in which <italic>cyclin D1</italic> induces a miRNA signature that includes miR-17-5p and miR-20a through the binding of the miR-17/20 promoter region. miR-17/20 in turn attenuates <italic>cyclin D1</italic> abundance via a negative feedback loop to regulate <italic>cyclin D1</italic> through a conserved 3&#x02032; UTR miRNA binding site. Given the central role for <italic>cyclin D1</italic> in cellular differentiation and tumorigenesis, the studies herein, which demonstrate that miRNAs determine <italic>cyclin D1</italic> abundance, have broad implications for cancer biology.

Amplification and overexpression of miR-17/20 has been described in B cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2005</xref>) and lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayashita et al., 2005</xref>). miR-17-5p and miR-20a are key important components of the miR-17/20 cluster. To characterize the miR-17/20 expression in breast cancer cell lines, Northern blot analysis was performed of nine breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, BT-474, MDA-MB-453, Hs578T, MDA-MB-486, SKBR-3, MDA-MB-361, MCF-7, and T-47D), one nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell line (MCF-10A), and two nonbreast tumor cell lines (HeLa and 293T; Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801079/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801079/DC1</ext-link>). The expression of miR-17-5p and miR-20a was low to undetectable in at least six of the nine breast cancer cell lines compared with either nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell (MCF-10A) or nonbreast cancer cell lines (HeLa and 293T). The reduced expression of miR-17/20 in breast cancer cells suggested the miRNA cluster may have a unique function during breast tumorigenesis.</p><p>To further investigate the role of miR-17/20 in breast cancer, a retroviral vector encoding the miR-17/20 cluster was used to infect MCF-7 and the NAFA cell line, which is derived from MMTV-ErbB2 transgenic mice breast tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).

Cellular proliferation assays were performed on the miR-17/20&#x02013;transduced cells. miR-17/20 expression inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation and cell growth by &#x0223c;60% after 72 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). To determine if miR-17/20 regulated estrogen-dependent cellular proliferation, MCF-7 cells were treated with estrogen (17&#x003b2;-estradiol). Both estrogen-dependent and -independent cell proliferation was inhibited by miR-17/20 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>).
