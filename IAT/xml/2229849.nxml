These findings extend our knowledge of the mechanism of Pol III function, which appears to have been highly conserved during eukaryotic evolution. Furthermore, these data also suggest that assembly of the 17-subunit Pol III enzyme is a dynamic process, since Polr3k overexpression can partially rescue the mutant phenotype.

Recent studies in mammalian cells have focused on how tumor suppressors, oncogenes, and cell-cycle proteins can either restrict or enhance recruitment of Pol III to its target gene promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. This control may involve up-regulation of the genes encoding Pol III transcription factors, altered protein&#x02013;protein interactions between the transcription factors, or alternatively, a direct effect on Pol III itself &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. The results reported here are distinguishable from these studies because they suggest that tissue-specific developmental defects in highly proliferative tissues may arise from impaired interaction between two Pol III subunits.</p><p>Although deregulated Pol III activity is a common feature of tumorigenic and hypertrophic cell growth in cultured cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, evidence that elevated Pol III activity is required for phenotypic transformation in a multicellular organism has been lacking. Thus, our finding that reduced Pol III transcription in zebrafish <italic>slj</italic> mutants disrupts growth and development that is dependent on cell proliferation in the digestive system, retinae, and other highly proliferative larval tissues is noteworthy. Similarly, whereas there was considerable data showing that reduced tRNA levels appear to limit the proliferation of cultured cells, the present report illustrates the potential importance of this mechanism in a multicellular organism. We found that the Pol III defect imparted by the <italic>slj</italic> mutation had a far more pronounced effect on actively cycling cells than on tissues principally populated by quiescent postmitotic cells, such as skeletal muscle, heart, and the pancreatic islet. These data further support the idea that regulation of Pol III activity is integral to cell growth and proliferation in vertebrate tissues, and moreover, illustrate tissue-specific developmental defects that arise as a result of not meeting the Pol III&#x02013;dependent demands of such cells. Finally, although it is possible that the development and function of quiescent cell types in <italic>slj</italic> mutants may be sustained by maternally derived Polr3b protein, the metabolic demand of developing cells may exceed maternal supply (as described for genes encoding subunits of the coatomer complex in the developing zebrafish notochord &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;). Thus, the sensitivity of tissue progenitor cells, rather than quiescent cells, to reduced Pol III activity caused by <italic>polr3b</italic> mutation may reflect such metabolic demands.</p><p>Although we have not compared Pol III activity levels in the tissues that were differentially affected by the <italic>slj</italic> mutation, our data suggest that the threshold of Pol III activity required to sustain development of different cell types within a specific tissue is variable. We found that intestinal stromal cell proliferation was increased in early <italic>slj</italic> larvae (InS, 48 hpf; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050312-t001">Table 1</xref>), but was normal at a slightly later stage, when epithelial proliferation is significantly reduced (72 hpf). We also found that the effect of the <italic>slj</italic> mutation varied between different tissues, with a far more pronounced effect on exocrine pancreas development than intestinal development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. A second possibility that is consistent with our data is that developing cells might require different levels of Pol III activity for their differentiation programs. This is consistent with the finding that although there is normal differentiation of most epithelial lineages in the <italic>slj</italic> intestine, epithelial morphogenesis is abnormal &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A third idea to emerge from this work is that vertebrate cells may regulate Pol III activity, in part by regulating its subunit gene expression. Even when the overall expression level of <italic>polr3b</italic> is low, such as on 3 dpf and at later stages, it was consistently most pronounced in the tissues that have a high percentage of proliferative cells, such as the intestine and pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050312-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with this idea, it was previously shown that expression of the gene encoding the Pol III subunit Rpc53/Polr3d (also known as <italic>BN51</italic>) increases in response to serum stimulation of cell proliferation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conserved Pol III Subunit Interactions in Yeast and Zebrafish</title><p>Mutants targeting yeast Rpc2p had been isolated by a genetic screen that selected for impaired termination by Pol III, and were later found to affect elongation rate with reciprocal effects on termination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b042">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Because the <italic>slj</italic> mutation was adjacent to some of these yeast <italic>rpc2</italic> mutations, and because <italic>rpc11</italic> was linked to Pol III termination and RNA 3&#x02032;-end formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, we wanted to know whether termination was affected in <italic>slj</italic> mutants. A minimal efficiency vertebrate Pol III terminator consists of a run of four thymidine (T) residues, with termination efficiency increasing as the number of T residues increases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Transcription beyond a weak Pol III terminator in vivo can be visualized on northern blots as pre-tRNA transcripts that extend beyond the 3&#x02032; terminator into flanking DNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. To examine this possibility, we identified a <italic>tRNAile</italic> gene with a minimal 4T terminator and examined its transcripts in wild-type and <italic>slj</italic> mutant fish. Using an intron probe as well as a 3&#x02032; flanking probe designed to detect read-through transcripts that extend beyond the terminator, we found no evidence of a difference in the Pol III termination efficiency of this gene in wild-type and <italic>slj</italic> larvae, since the pre-tRNA-Ile transcript size was identical in <italic>slj</italic> and wild-type larvae, with no evidence of longer transcripts on the blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050312-g005">Figure 5</xref>E and unpublished data). These data are consistent with the finding that function-altering mutations in <italic>rpc11</italic> did not affect termination efficiency in fission yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; and a revised role for Rpc11p in Pol III recycling rather than termination per se &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

Given evidence of no impairment of termination by <italic>slj</italic> Pol III, we speculate that reduced reinitiation may be the cause of decreased Pol III transcription in <italic>slj</italic> mutants.</p><p>Contrary to what might be expected from the study of a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae rpc11</italic> mutant that contained wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> Rpc2p &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050312-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, Pol III purification from <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> revealed similar Rpc53p levels in the wild-type and <italic>slj</italic> Rpc2-&#x00394;p cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050312-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). This may be explained by the fact that the genetic approaches differed (small deletion in Rpc2 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content>, versus replacement of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> Rpc11 with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> Rpc11 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>) and that very different Pol III purification schemes were used (epitope tag affinity chromatography versus extensive ion exchange chromatography) in the present and prior studies, respectively.</p><p>In summary, the work described in this study reveals an unexpected importance of the Rpc2&#x02013;Rpc11 interaction during development and demonstrates the utility of the zebrafish system. We have shown that in vivo analyses of Pol III function are feasible in zebrafish and that they complement analyses in other model systems. We have also shown that the zebrafish may be used to reveal the effects of disrupting Pol III in complex multicellular tissues. An idea suggested by these studies is that specific cell types within a multicellular organism may require different levels of Pol III activity and that this may reflect their rate of proliferation and/or growth. Thus, it is conceivable that selective Pol III inhibitors may be able to target metabolically active cells in proliferative or hypertrophic disease states.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Positional cloning of <italic>slj</italic> locus.</title><p>The <italic>slj</italic> mutation bulk-segregant analyses identified two Chromosome 18 markers linked to the <italic>slj</italic> locus (M.
