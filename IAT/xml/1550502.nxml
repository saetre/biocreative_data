The human transcript was blasted against the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Sus scrofa</named-content> trace archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?</ext-link>) by using discontiguous Mega BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/tracemb.shtml">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/tracemb.shtml</ext-link>). Two hits, pig trace sequences 812263277 and 782925243, corresponding to <italic>UCP1</italic> exons 2 and 6, were obtained and used for primer design. The complete genome sequence of pig <italic>UCP1</italic> was determined by long-range PCR and genome walking by using genomic DNA from a Large White domestic pig and the porcine bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone PigE-117H8 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020129-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; containing <italic>UCP1</italic>. An alignment with the corresponding human sequence revealed two gaps in the porcine sequence, reducing the total size from 10.1 kilobases in humans to 4.3 kilobases in the pig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020129-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Alignments with cattle <italic>UCP1</italic> showed that Gap1, located in intron 2, represents an insertion in the human lineage or a deletion that occurred before the split of the pig and cattle lineages. Gap2 is unique to the pig and eliminates exons 3 to 5, implying that <italic>UCP1</italic> is disrupted. The presence of this deletion was confirmed by PCR amplification of the deletion breakpoint in pigs representing many different breeds, as well as in European wild boars, Bornean bearded pig <italic>(S. barbatus),</italic> wart hog <italic>(Phacochoerus africanus),</italic> and red river hog <italic>(Potamochoerus porcus)</italic>.</p><p>Southern blot analysis using a porcine probe revealed a single restriction fragment consistent with the presence of a single <italic>UCP1</italic> copy in the pig genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020129-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The similarity between the end sequences of the porcine <italic>UCP1</italic> BAC clone and sequences flanking the human <italic>UCP1</italic> gene also supports the interpretation that we have analyzed the true <italic>UCP1</italic> locus and not a defect duplicated version.</p><p>The <italic>UCP1</italic> coding sequence in pigs contains three additional disrupting mutations: a two&#x02013;base pair insertion in exon 1, a 16&#x02013;base pair deletion in exon 2 (both causing frameshifts), and a nonsense mutation in exon 6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020129-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, strong purifying selection is observed at the <italic>UCP1</italic> locus in humans, cattle, and mice, as is evident from the 5- to 10-fold higher rate of synonymous (<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>) versus nonsynonymous (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>) substitutions among these species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020129-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). As expected, <italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> was nearly identical when comparing humans with pigs and humans with cattle. In contrast, <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub> was markedly elevated in all pairwise comparisons involving the pig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020129-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). For example, human versus pig: <italic>d</italic><sub>N(H-S)</sub> &#x0003d; 13.9 &#x000b1; 2.4&#x00025;, human versus cattle: <italic>d</italic><sub>N(B-H)</sub> &#x0003d; 8.8 &#x000b1; 1.9&#x00025;, <italic>Z</italic> &#x0003d; 1.66, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 in a one-sided test; <italic>Z</italic>&#x0003d;<italic>D</italic>/s(<italic>D</italic>) where <italic>D</italic>&#x0003d;<italic>d</italic><sub>N(H-S)</sub> - <italic>d</italic><sub>N(B-H)</sub>, V(<italic>D</italic>)&#x0003d;V(<italic>d</italic><sub>N(H-S)</sub>) &#x0002b; V(<italic>d</italic><sub>N(B-H)</sub>), and s(<italic>D</italic>)&#x0003d;&#x0005b;V(<italic>D</italic>)&#x0005d;<sup>1/2</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020129-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. This implies that porcine <italic>UCP1</italic> was inactivated sometime subsequent to the divergence from the cattle lineage and that it has accumulated synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions at the same rate since then. The inactivation of <italic>UCP1</italic> was dated to have happened about 20 million years ago by using the estimated <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub> rate for the human/cattle comparison and the estimated <italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> rate for the pig/cattle comparison to explain the excess of nonsynonymous substitutions in the pig <italic>UCP1</italic> sequence; the estimated time since the divergence of the human and pig/cattle lineages (94 million years) and the pig and cattle lineages (60 million years) were from Springer et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020129-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The result is consistent with the observation that <italic>UCP1</italic> is disrupted in several pig species.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that <italic>UCP1</italic> was inactivated in the pig lineage about 20 million years ago. <italic>UCP1</italic> knockout mice show only a mild phenotype; they are cold sensitive but fully viable &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020129-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, these <italic>UCP1</italic>-null mice develop BAT, which implies that the disruption of porcine <italic>UCP1</italic> cannot by itself explain the absence of BAT. A possible evolutionary scenario is that a pig ancestor lost <italic>UCP1</italic> function and the ability to use BAT for thermoregulation because of no or only weak selection for this mechanism in a warm climate; the wild boar is the only porcine species that has adapted to temperate climates, whereas all other Suidae live in tropical or subtropical environments. The wild boar has then evolved compensatory mechanisms to adapt to a cold environment. Newborn pigs use shivering for thermogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020129-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020129-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, and the wild boar is the only ungulate that builds a thermoprotective nest for giving birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020129-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). A temperature around &#x0002b;20 &#x000b0;C has been estimated in winter farrowing nests of free-ranging domestic pigs despite outside temperatures down to &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020129-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. In modern pig production, heat-lamps are used to facilitate thermocontrol in piglets.</p><p>An interesting topic for future research will be to study <italic>UCP1</italic> in more distantly related species to date more precisely the disruption of this gene in the pig lineage. It will be of considerable interest to investigate if the loss of gene expression closely correlates with changes in behavior and litter size among species. Our study does not resolve whether the disruption of <italic>UCP1</italic> was the primary event leading to the loss of BAT or whether it was a secondary event. This question could possibly be resolved by a comparative study of different Suidae species, but it cannot be answered by analyzing sequence data from one species only, because of the poor precision in dating mutation events that happened 20 million years ago. Another important question is whether the loss of <italic>UCP1</italic> and BAT is associated with other genetic changes during the evolution of the pig lineage. For instance, it is possible that the disruption of <italic>UCP1</italic> has led to an upregulation of <italic>UCP2</italic> expression, as observed in the <italic>UCP1</italic> knockout mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020129-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals and BAC resources.</title><p>We used genomic DNA representing several different breeds of domestic pigs and samples from European wild boar, wart hog <italic>(P. africanus),</italic> Bornean bearded pig <italic>(S. barbatus),</italic> and red river hog <italic>(P. porcus)</italic>.

The translated sequence reveals a premature stop codon in the pig sequence.</p><p>(76 KB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0020129.sg002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0020129-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>A List of Primers Used to Amplify and Sequence the Porcine <italic>UCP1</italic> Gene</title><p>(25 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0020129.st001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The pig sequence has been deposited in GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank</ext-link>) under accession number DQ372918.</p><p>The Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html">http://www.ensembl.org/index.html</ext-link>) accession numbers for the genes and transcripts in this paper are cattle gene (ENSBTAG00000004647), cattle transcript (ENSBTAT00000006097), human gene (ENSG00000109424), human transcript (ENST00000262999), and mouse transcript (ENSMUST00000034146).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="ack"><title/><p>Sincere thanks are due to Alain Ducos for kindly providing European wild boar samples, Dr. Malgosia Nowak-Kemp and Greger Larson for kindly providing wart hog samples, and Oliver Ryder for kindly providing a Bornean bearded pig and a red river hog sample.
