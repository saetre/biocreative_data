Ian4 expression was undetectable in 32D cells transfected with v-src, oncogenic Ha-ras or v-Abl. Murine Ian4 maps to chromosome 6, 25 cM from the centromere. The Ian4 mRNA contains two open reading frames (ORFs) separated by 5 nt. The first ORF has the potential to encode for a polypeptide of 67 amino acids without apparent homology to known proteins. The second ORF encodes a protein of 301 amino acids with a GTP&#x0002f;ATP-binding site in the N-terminus and a hydrophobic domain in the extreme C-terminus. The IAN-4 protein resides in the mitochondrial outer membrane and the last 20 amino acids are necessary for this localization. The IAN-4 protein has GTP-binding activity and shares sequence homology with a novel family of putative GTP-binding proteins: the immuno-associated nucleotide (IAN) family.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder due to a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translocation results in the fusion of a truncated breakpoint cluster region gene (<italic>bcr</italic>) with sequences of c-<italic>abl</italic>, the cellular homolog of the transforming gene of the Abelson murine leukemia virus. Depending on the site of the breakpoint in the bcr gene, two major chimeric BCR&#x0002f;ABL proteins are generated: p185, which contains a smaller BCR portion (amino acids 1&#x02013;426) and is associated with acute lymphocytic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c1">1</xref>) and p210, which contains a larger BCR portion (1&#x02013;902 or 1&#x02013;926) and is found in most cases of CML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c2">2</xref>). A third, less common 230 kDa protein is found in a cohort of patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c3">3</xref>). BCR&#x0002f;ABL proteins have constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity, which is required for transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c4">4</xref>). The oncogenic potential of BCR&#x0002f;ABL proteins has been demonstrated by a number of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays including abrogation of interleukin 3 (IL-3) dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c5">5</xref>) and induction of long-term survival of bone marrow cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c6">6</xref>), as well as induction of CML-like syndromes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c7">7</xref>).</p><p> Several mechanisms can explain the role of the BCR&#x0002f;ABL oncoprotein in the pathogenesis of CML: activation of mitogenic signaling pathways, inhibition of apoptosis and differentiation and defective cell mobility. BCR&#x0002f;ABL can activate several downstream effector molecules involved in the control of proliferation, like RAS, RAF, MYC and STAT; its ability to block apoptosis has been related to RAS activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c8">8</xref>) and Bcl-2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c9">9</xref>), but is also mediated by the activation of the PI-3 kinase&#x0002f;Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c10">10</xref>). The BCR&#x0002f;ABL protein also activates the small GTP-binding protein Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c11">11</xref>) and phosphorylates FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c12">12</xref>), two proteins critically important in cell adhesion and mobility. BCR&#x0002f;ABL mutants have been used to dissect the signaling pathways involved in leukemogenesis. The tyrosine kinase activity is essential for each feature of BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c13">13</xref>), whereas mutants in other domains show only partial defects in the BCR&#x0002f;ABL-dependent pathways promoting cell growth and apoptosis resistance. A BCR&#x0002f;ABL mutant (p185&#x00394;BCR) containing only the first 176&#x000a0;amino acids of the BCR portion failed to protect IL-3-deprived 32D cells from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c13">13</xref>). Compared to wild-type (WT) BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing cells, p185&#x00394;BCR-expressing cells showed markedly decreased Bcl-2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c14">14</xref>). Moreover, expression of mitochondrial RAF was essentially undetectable in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c14">14</xref>). Upon transfection with a mitochondria-targeted constitutively active RAF (M-RAF), these cells regained the apoptosis-resistant phenotype. In studies of <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> leukemogenesis, double transfectants &#x00394;BCR&#x0002f;M-RAF-expressing cells induced leukemia in immunodeficient mice whereas cells expressing only the p185&#x00394;BCR mutant were non-leukemogenic, suggesting that expression of mitochondrial RAF is an important BCR&#x0002f;ABL effector in apoptosis resistance and leukemogenesis. To characterize the mechanisms whereby M-RAF is activated by BCR&#x0002f;ABL, we sought to identify genes differentially expressed between WT BCR&#x0002f;ABL-transfected 32D and &#x00394;BCR&#x0002f;M-RAF double transfectants. Here we report the cloning of a novel gene, Ian4, whose expression is induced in BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing cells. This gene maps to chromosome 6 and encodes a mitochondrial membrane protein&#x000a0;belonging to the GTP-binding superfamily and the immuno-associated nucleotide (IAN) subfamily of nucleotide-binding proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>The murine IL-3-dependent 32D myeloid precursor cell line and WT BCR&#x0002f;ABL and &#x00394;BCR&#x0002f;M-RAF 32D cell transfectants were maintained in Iscove&#x02019;s modified Dulbecco medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS, 2&#x000a0;mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, penicillin&#x0002f;streptomycin (100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml) and 15&#x00025; WEHI-conditioned medium as source of IL-3.</p></sec><sec><title>Representational difference analysis (RDA)</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from WT BCR&#x0002f;ABL and &#x00394;BCR&#x0002f;M-RAF 32D cells 18 h after IL-3 starvation, with Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

To enrich for mRNAs overexpressed in BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing cells, three successive subtractions were performed with tester&#x0002f;driver ratios of 1:100, 1:800 and 1:2000, respectively.

Two primers were chosen on the initial sequence. One Ian4-specific primer was used to amplify a fragment corresponding to the 3&#x02032; part of the cDNA, and ending in the poly(A) tail. The second Ian4-specific primer was used to amplify the 5&#x02032; part of the cDNA. The PCR-amplified products were cloned and sequenced. The sequence of Ian4 cDNA was 2150 nt and included two ORFs (accession no. AF337052). The first ORF started with an ATG codon located at position &#x0002b;405, surrounded by nucleotides falling within the Kozak consensus sequence (G&#x0002f;AXXATGG) for translation initiation. This ORF extended for 67 codons and ended with TAA. The stop codon was followed by a run of five adenosine nucleotides and a second start codon. The second start codon at position 614 was also in the context of a canonical initiation sequence and extended to encode a translation product of 301 amino acids. A polyA signal (AATAAA) mapped 601 bp downstream of the translation stop codon. Bicistronic mRNAs are relatively rare in higher vertebrates and the 5&#x02032; upstream ORFs are usually very short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c19">19</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the unusual sequence arrangement of Ian4 cDNA was the result of a cloning artefact, the segment of Ian4 cDNA encompassing the two ORFs was amplified from the RNA of two BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing cell lines. Using a 5&#x02032; primer (5&#x02032;-GTCATACCGTCACACCATCTG-3&#x02032;) starting 30 nt upstream of the ATG of the first ORF and a reverse 3&#x02032; primer (5&#x02032;-GCCTGTTACAACATTCTGAAGT-3&#x02032;) beginning 26 nt downstream of the ATG of the second ORF, the corresponding Ian4 cDNA was amplified and cloned in the pSR TOPOII vector. Sequencing of seven independent clones from two BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing lines confirmed the sequence arrangement of Ian4 mRNA (data not shown).</p><p> The polypeptide that could be encoded by the first ORF of Ian4 showed no significant similarities with any protein in protein databases. Querying the second translation product against the non-redundant set of protein sequences with PSI-BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c20">20</xref>) identified hundreds of related proteins, essentially all of which have been classified as members of the GTP-binding protein superfamily. Within the GTP-binding protein superfamily, IAN-4 was most closely related to a novel family of putative GTP-binding proteins called the IAN family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c21">21</xref>). The most striking similarity was with a related human protein (accession no. AK002158) we have named IAN-5.

Y08026), a protein whose expression is induced by blood-stage infections of <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c22">22</xref>); mouse IAN-1, a thymic selection marker; the IAN-3 homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c21">21</xref>); and the IAG1 protein (accession no. U40856), a plant protein induced by bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c23">23</xref>). Murine IAN-4 was also homologous to a putative human protein (accession no. AL110151) and to NTGP4 (accession no. U64925), an isoprenylated plant protein. The sequence alignment of these proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f2">2</xref>) shows that the N-terminal portion is highly conserved while the C-terminal portion is specific to each protein. Within the GTP-binding superfamily, IAN subfamily proteins are clearly found in animals and plants. Lesser but substantial similarity was observed with Era subfamily proteins that are found in bacteria as well as metazoans and with septins such as yeast Cdc10. While the similarity between IAN-4 and distantly related members of the GTP-binding superfamily was confined to the GTP-binding consensus sequence, similarity with Cdc10-related proteins extended for &#x0223c;250 amino acids (data not shown). Several IAN-related GTP-binding proteins have been classified as organelle-localized, such as the chloroplast import-associated protein IAP36 in pea. IAN-4 does not contain a C-terminal cysteine motif that could serve as a site for isoprenylation. Instead, the 22 C-terminal residues are hydrophobic and are predicted to form a membrane anchor for IAN-4 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of Ian4</title><p>An Ian4-specific probe was used to investigate Ian4 expression in different cell lines and normal mouse tissues. Ian4 mRNA was detected only in cell lines expressing BCR&#x0002f;ABL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f3">3</xref>A). Ian4 mRNA was highly expressed in different clones of BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing 32D and DAGM cells, while no expression was detected in 32D parental cells, in CTTL2 (murine T cells) and M1 (a murine myeloid leukemia cell line) cells. Ian4 expression was also assessed in 32D cells transfected with different BCR&#x0002f;ABL mutants: p185&#x00394;BCR (deletion of amino acids 176&#x02013;426 in the BCR portion), p210&#x00394;SH2 (deletion of the SH2 domain), p210&#x00394;SH3 (deletion of the SH3 domain), TM (Y177F&#x0002f;R552L&#x0002f;Y793F triple mutant) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f3">3</xref>B). Ian4 mRNA was readily detectable in WT BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing cells, but Ian4 mRNA levels were markedly diminished in cells transfected with various BCR&#x0002f;ABL mutants, with the lowest expression detected in cells transfected with BCR&#x0002f;ABL TM. In the blot shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f3">3</xref>A, Ian4 mRNA was essentially undetectable in p210&#x00394;SH2-expressing cells: this most likely reflects low hybridization efficiency, since the signal detected with the RNA of WT BCR&#x0002f;ABL cells is much stronger in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f3">3</xref>B blot than in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f3">3</xref>A blot. Ian4 mRNA was also detectable in BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing primary mouse marrow cells (data not shown). To further investigate the pattern of Ian4 expression, the Ian4-specific probe was hybridized to a northern blot carrying various murine tissues. Low levels of Ian4 mRNA were detected in the spleen, while no signal was detected in thymus, liver and kidney (data not shown). Moreover, Ian4 was not expressed in 32D transfected with IGF-1R plus IRS-1, v-src, v-Abl or oncogenic H-ras plus IRS-1 (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that Ian4 expression is specifically induced by BCR&#x0002f;ABL in mouse cells and that the protein&#x02013;protein interaction domains and the kinase activity of BCR&#x0002f;ABL are required for the induction. Using the Ian4 probe, no expression was detected in human cells (data not shown). However, the human homolog Ian5 was preferentially expressed in Philadelphia<sup>1</sup> acute leukemia cells, compared to normal marrow cells or CML-chronic phase cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression and subcellular localization of HA-tagged IAN-4</title><p>To investigate the subcellular localization of IAN-4, the HA epitope was cloned in-frame at the predicted C-terminus of Ian4 coding sequence. The HA-tagged Ian4 cDNA was inserted in the LXSP retroviral vector and transfected by electroporation in parental or BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing 32D cells. Ectopic expression of IAN-4&#x02013;HA was assessed by western blot in mixed cell populations and in selected clones, but the levels of the HA-tagged 40 kDa protein were very low (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f5">5</xref>A). Since the presence of short upstream ORFs (uORFs) may inhibit translation from a downstream ORF, because of inefficient reinitiation, an N-terminal truncated Ian4 cDNA lacking the first ORF and with the second ORF fused to the HA tag in the C-terminus was inserted into the LXSP plasmid. Expression of IAN-4&#x02013;HA in 32D cells transfected with this modified plasmid was much more abundant, both in mixed cell populations and in selected clones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f5">5</xref>B). Interestingly, BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing 32D cells transfected with the Ian4&#x02013;HA plasmid that includes the uORF showed relatively abundant expression of IAN-4&#x02013;HA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f5">5</xref>C), suggesting that BCR&#x0002f;ABL expression may relieve the translation inhibition of Ian4 either by promoting reinitiation of ribosomes that engage at the uORF or promoting bypass of the uORF in favor of Ian-4 initiation. As a first step in characterizing the novel protein, we sought to determine the subcellular localization of IAN-4. Different subcellular fractions &#x0005b;nuclear (N), HM, LM and C&#x0005d; were prepared as described in Materials and Methods and the presence of IAN-4&#x02013;HA protein was monitored in these fractions by western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f6">6</xref>A). A signal was detected in the N and the HM fractions. The anti-COX IV antibody, which recognizes cytochrome oxidase, a protein localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and the anti-HSP90 antibody, which recognizes heat-shock protein 90 localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, were used as controls. Based on western blots with these control antibodies, the nuclear fraction appeared contaminated by mitochondrial proteins, suggesting that the IAN-4 protein might be entirely mitochondrial. To confirm its mitochondrial localization, immunocytochemistry using the anti-HA antibody was performed on Ian4-HA&#x02013;transfected 32D cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f6">6</xref>B). Overexpressed HA-tagged IAN-4 was localized on punctate structures overlapping with those stained by Mito-Tracker, a mitochondria-specific fluorescent dye.</p><p> IAN-4 lacks an N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence but contains a putative 22 amino acid transmembrane domain at the extreme C-terminus. To test whether the C-terminal domain was required for mitochondrial localization, a truncated Ian4 cDNA lacking the C-terminal 20 codons was fused in-frame with an N-terminal HA epitope and cloned in the LXSP expression vector. In transiently transfected 293T cells, full-length IAN-4&#x02013;HA was found in the mitochondria, as confirmed by co-localization with the MitoTracker dye (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f6">6</xref>C). In 293T cells transfected with the truncated Ian4 cDNA, IAN-4 was localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f6">6</xref>D). Thus, mitochondrial localization of IAN-4 depends on a C-terminal anchor. The molecular basis for direction of IAN-4 to the mitochondria by these sequences is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Submitochondrial localization of HA-tagged IAN-4</title><p>After alkali carbonate treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c24">24</xref>), the mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space (supernatant) and the membrane fraction (pellet) were assessed for IAN-4 expression. Like cytochrome oxidase, IAN-4&#x02013;HA was found in the pellet, indicating mitochondrial membrane localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f7">7</xref>A). To further analyze the membrane location of IAN-4, the mitochondrial outer membrane was selectively disrupted by digitonin treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f7">7</xref>B). At 15&#x00025; digitonin, the outer membrane is disrupted as shown by the presence of porin, an outer membrane protein, in the supernatant. At the same concentration, IAN-4 was also detected in the supernatant. Upon increasing the digitonin concentration to 20&#x00025;, the inner membrane is disrupted and cytochrome oxidase was found in the supernatant. IAN-4 behaved exactly like porin, a strong indication that it is localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane, most likely as a type II membrane protein with the GTP-binding domain exposed to the cytosol.</p></sec><sec><title>GTP-binding activity of HA-tagged IAN-4</title><p>To assess whether IAN-4 has GTP-binding activity, anti-HA immunoprecipitates from whole lysate of parental and IAN-4&#x02013;HA-expressing 32D cells were used in a nitrocellulose filtration assay after incubation with &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;GTP. By measuring the amount of &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;GTP retained on a nitrocellulose filter in four different experiments, there was a 2.5-fold increase in the radioactivity associated with the anti-HA immunoprecipitate from Ian4-expressing cells, compared to parental 32D cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f8">8</xref>). Thus, IAN-4 has GTP-binding activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Ian4 maps on the mouse chromosome 6</title><p>Genetic linkage analysis was used to establish the map location of the Ian4 gene in the mouse genome. An interspecific backcross mapping panel of (AEJ&#x0002f;Gn &#x000d7; <italic>M.spretus</italic>) F1 &#x000d7; AEJ&#x0002f;Gn progeny was used. RFLPs were detected by digestion of AEJ&#x0002f;GN and <italic>M.spretus</italic> genomic DNAs with several restriction endonucleases and subsequent Southern blotting and hybridization to labeled probes to identify the Ian4 locus. Restriction enzymes that produced informative polymorphisms were used to cleave and screen genomic DNA from each of the N2 progeny by Southern blot analysis.</p><p> The presence or absence of the <italic>M.spretus</italic>-specific fragments was followed to determine the allelic pattern of inheritance in each N2 offspring. The segregation pattern of the RFLPs specific for the <italic>M.spretus</italic> allele was compared to markers that scan the entire mouse genome (L.D.Siracusa and A.M.Buchberg, unpublished data). The segregation analysis showed that Ian4 resides on mouse chromosome 6. The specific position of Ian4 was determined by minimizing the number of multiple recombinants along the length of the chromosome.</p><p> The data position Ian4 in the central region of mouse chromosome 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f9">9</xref>A) between the <italic>Tcrb</italic> and <italic>Igk</italic> gene complexes. The Ian4 gene maps &#x0003c;1 cM proximal to the <italic>D6Mit118</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c17">17</xref>). The results place Ian4 just proximal to a region of synteny with human chromosome 7p15&#x02013;p14. A specific position is difficult to predict unequivocally because of the break in synteny between human chromosome 7p15&#x02013;p14 and 7q34&#x02013;q35 that is evident in the Ian4 region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f9">9</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have cloned and identified a novel gene, Ian4, preferentially expressed in WT BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing 32D cells compared to cells co-expressing a p185&#x00394;BCR mutant and a constitutively active mitochondrial RAF. Expression of the Ian4 gene in cell lines expressing WT BCR&#x0002f;ABL seems rather specific: cells transfected with various BCR&#x0002f;ABL mutants show markedly lower Ian4 expression, and no transcript is detected in cells transfected with v-src, H-ras plus IRS-1 or v-Abl. Ian4 is not expressed in non-lymphoid organs such as liver and kidney, whereas a slight signal is detected in the spleen, but not in the thymus. Thus, Ian4 expression may be restricted to certain hematopoietic cells.</p><p> The Ian4 mRNA contains an uORF of 67 codons preceding the 301 amino acid coding sequence. uORFs are present in 5&#x02013;10&#x00025; of mRNAs but are usually shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c27">27</xref>) than the one reported here. Most of the genes with an uORF encode growth factors, growth factor receptors, oncogenes and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c18">18</xref>). Because both initiation codons are in an optimal KOZAK context, it is likely that translation of Ian4 depends on leaky scanning past the upstream ATG codon or reinitiation after translation of the uORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c18">18</xref>). Compared to cells transfected with the plasmid containing both ORFs, the steady-state levels of IAN-4 protein were higher in 32D cells transfected with the plasmid lacking the uORF, suggesting that translation of Ian4 is inhibited by the uORF. However, in BCR&#x0002f;ABL-expressing-cells transfected with the plasmid containing both ORFs, IAN-4 levels were higher than in 32D cells, suggesting that BCR&#x0002f;ABL expression may bypass the block in translation at the second ORF imposed by the uORF.</p><p> IAN-4 is a member of both the GTP-binding protein superfamily and the IAN subfamily of predicted GTP-binding proteins. This family includes IAN-1, IAN-3 and IAP38 in mice and IAG-1 in plants. IAN-4 was also highly homologous to IAN-5, a human protein whose corresponding mRNA is readily detectable in Philadelphia<sup>1</sup> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke235f4">4</xref>). There was also significant homology (&#x0223c;42&#x00025; in the N-terminus) with a conceptual human reading frame (accession no. AL110151). Ian1 is predominately expressed in T cells; in thymocytes, its expression is switched on during thymic selection events. IAP38 is predominantly expressed in B cells and macrophages and is induced in splenocytes by <italic>P.chabaudi</italic> malaria. The plant protein IAG-1 is known to be induced upon bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c22">22</xref>). Thus, two of these proteins are expressed in response to pathogens. However, the function of these proteins is not yet known. Few proteins with GTP-binding activity have been localized in mitochondria. Among these, the <italic>Drosophilia</italic> fuzzy onions <italic>(fzo)</italic> gene encodes a mitochondrial transmembrane GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c28">28</xref>) required for mitochondria fusion during spermatogenesis, perhaps by spanning both the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes at contact sites. Other studies have shown the localization of GTP-binding proteins in the contact points between the inner and outer membrane of mitochondria, and it has been proposed that these proteins may regulate the traffic of both proteins and cholesterol through the mitochondria contact points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke235c29">29</xref>). As septins have been shown to have positive roles in the cell cycle and cytokinesis, it seems plausible that IAN proteins, including mitochondrial septins in animals and chloroplast septins in plants, play a role in cell survival in immune responses and cellular transformation.</p><p> Though Ian4 expression is induced by BCR&#x0002f;ABL in 32D cells, ectopic expression of Ian4 was insufficient to render p185&#x00394;BCR-expressing cells growth factor-independent (data not shown). The presence of a GTP-binding motif and a C-terminal mitochondrial anchor suggests two potential routes to constructing dominant-negative alleles of Ian4. It will be interesting to see whether inactivation of Ian-4 inhibits leukemogenesis as the IanmRNA appears to be among the most highly regulated markers of BCR&#x0002f;ABL activity.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke235f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> RDA of cDNA from &#x00394;BCR &#x0002b; M-Raf and Bcr&#x0002f;Ab1-expressing cells.
