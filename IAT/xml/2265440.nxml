Here we show that natural variation in shoot Mo content across 92 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accessions is controlled by variation in a mitochondrially localized transporter (<underline>Mo</underline>lybdenum <underline>T</underline>ransporter 1 - <italic>MOT1</italic>) that belongs to the sulfate transporter superfamily. A deletion in the <italic>MOT1</italic> promoter is strongly associated with low shoot Mo, occurring in seven of the accessions with the lowest shoot content of Mo. Consistent with the low Mo phenotype, <italic>MOT1</italic> expression in low Mo accessions is reduced. Reciprocal grafting experiments demonstrate that the roots of Ler-0 are responsible for the low Mo accumulation in shoot, and GUS localization demonstrates that <italic>MOT1</italic> is expressed strongly in the roots. MOT1 contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and expression of <italic>MOT1</italic> tagged with GFP in protoplasts and transgenic plants, establishing the mitochondrial localization of this protein. Furthermore, expression of <italic>MOT1</italic> specifically enhances Mo accumulation in yeast by 5-fold, consistent with MOT1 functioning as a molybdate transporter. This work provides the first molecular insight into the processes that regulate Mo accumulation in plants and shows that novel loci can be detected by association mapping.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Plants must acquire all the mineral nutrients they require for survival from the complex chemical and biological environment of the soil. A better understanding of the way plants do this would not only allow improvements in sustainable agricultural productivity, but could also improve human health through enhancement of the nutritional quality of foods. One such essential mineral nutrient required by plants is molybdenum (Mo), which is needed as a cofactor in several critical biochemical reactions, including the utilization of nitrogen from the soil. By searching through numerous natural populations of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis), we were able to identify a DNA deletion that drives the natural variation in Mo accumulation observed in these populations. This deletion reduces expression of a gene (<italic>MOT1</italic>) that the authors establish to encode a mitochondrially localized molybdenum transporter. Loss of expression of <italic>MOT1</italic> in the roots of Arabidopsis causes a significant reduction in whole plant Mo accumulation, though the mechanism by which this Mo transporter regulates whole plant Mo from the mitochondria remains to be established.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants have developed complex biochemical and regulatory pathways to acquire mineral nutrients from the soil environment and distribute them to appropriate tissues.

While a substantial amount is known about the biochemistry, enzymology and underlying genetics of molybdopterin biosynthesis, very little is known about the mechanisms for Mo uptake, distribution and accumulation in plants. In this study, natural variation in whole plant Mo accumulation has been coupled with genomics techniques and genetics to identify a mitochondrial Mo transporter (<italic>MOT1</italic>) that regulates whole plant Mo content in Arabidopsis. Alleles of this gene are demonstrated to be responsible for low Mo accumulation across a diversity collection of 92 Arabidopsis accessions.

Furthermore, Ler-0 also has a reduced Mo content in roots when compared to Col-0, suggesting that the low shoot Mo content is not due to enhanced accumulation of Mo in the roots, but rather to reduced Mo uptake by the roots. Grafting experiments were performed to determine if low shoot Mo in Ler-0 is determined by the root or shoot. Shoots and roots from 5-day old seedlings of Ler-0 and Col-0 were reciprocally grafted, and grafted plants grown for 4 weeks in soil with short days. Plants with Ler-0 roots had significantly lower (p&#x0003c;0.01) shoot Mo contents than plants with Col-0 roots, whether the shoots were Ler-0 or Col-0.

Despite its importance as a cofactor in processes ranging from nitrogen metabolism to hormone biosynthesis, we still know relatively little about the regulation, uptake and transport of this transition metal. Using an ionomics approach to identify genes that affect the elemental composition of plants, we identified <italic>MOT1</italic> as the causal gene driving reduced shoot Mo in various accessions of Arabidopsis. We have combined several lines of evidence to support this conclusion. First, a 54 bp deletion in the promoter of <italic>MOT1</italic> was found to be strongly associated (p&#x0003c;0.0001) with low shoot Mo content across 92 Arabidopsis accessions. Given the strong association between the presence of this deletion and low shoot Mo content, and the rate of linkage disequilibrium decay in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000004-Kim1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, if this deletion is not the causal polymorphism, it is within 20 kb of the causal polymorphism. Second, deficiency complementation with a T-DNA allele (SALK_118311) indicates that the <italic>MOT1</italic> allele found in Ler-0 and Van-0, accessions with a low content of shoot Mo, is responsible for this reduced Mo content. Third, <italic>MOT1</italic> shows reduced expression in both Ler-0 and Van-0 compared to Col-0, and the <italic>mot1-1</italic> null allele in the Col-0 background phenocopies the low shoot Mo observed in both Ler-0 and Van-0.</p><p>Given the fact that MOT1 belongs to the sulfate transporter superfamily, and can transport Mo when expressed in yeast, it is easy to imagine how reduced expression of a Mo transporter could lead to low shoot Mo content, either via reduction in uptake from the soil and/or translocation to the shoot. In Col-0, the functional <italic>MOT1</italic> allele is strongly expressed in the root differentiation zone and in mature vasculature tissue of both the roots and the shoots, suggesting a defect in either or both roles could be the possible explanation for the observed phenotype. Our grafting experiments clearly show that the Mo defect is associated with the roots. Surprisingly, the MOT1 protein is not localized to the plasma membrane of roots cells where it could function in uptake into cells, but rather MOT1 is localized to the mitochondria. Based on these observations, and the grafting data, it is hypothesized that MOT1 regulates whole plant Mo accumulation at the level of the mitochondria in the root. Interestingly, the first committed step in molybdopterin biosynthesis has recently been shown to occur in the mitochondria, and this is consistent with the mitochondria acting as a control point in regulating whole plant Mo content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000004-Mendel1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that characterized members of the sulfate transporter superfamily are SO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x02212;2</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> co-transporters, we speculate that MOT1 is transporting MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x02212;2</sup> from the acidic mitochondrial intermembrane space to either the cytoplasm or the matrix.</p><p>While we have localized MOT1 to the mitochondria, the question of how Mo enters the root cells remains. Based on its homology, <italic>ST5.1-1</italic> is a candidate for this role, however a ST5.1 C-terminal GFP fusion was found to localize to the vacuole (Buchner and Hawkesford, unpublished). Additionally, the <italic>st5.1-1</italic> T-DNA insertional mutant does not have altered shoot Mo content, and heterologous expression of <italic>ST5.1</italic> cDNA in yeast has no effect on Mo accumulation. <italic>ST5.1</italic> also appears not to interact with <italic>MOT1</italic> since the double mutant <italic>st5.1mot1-1</italic> showed the same reduction in Mo content as <italic>mot1-1</italic>.</p><p>Alternatively, the putative plasma membrane molybdate transporter could be from a family unrelated to the SUL gene family, as multiple gene families have been shown to transport Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000004-Sanders1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000004-Guerinot1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, it remains possible that MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x02212;</sup> is transported across the plasma membrane through a promiscuous transporter(s) with broad ion specificity as shown for <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000004-Self1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

This frequency is higher than we would expect if the lowered Mo content strongly reduced fitness. For example, the overall reduction in Mo content might cause a reduction in molybdopterin, negatively impacting the activity of MoCo containing enzymes like nitrate reductase. However, we found no significant reduction in growth, N accumulation or nitrate reductase activity in <italic>mot1-1</italic> lines when grown with nitrate as the sole N source (data not shown). This suggests that MoCo levels are not limiting in <italic>mot1-1</italic>. Alternatively, loss of MOT1 function might increase the fitness of Arabidopsis by some as yet unknown process, and the association of Mo with population structure is consistent with Mo accumulation having a selective effect. However, an analysis of haplotype sharing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000004-Toomajian1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> around this gene gave no indication of recent selection on the <italic>MOT1</italic><sup>Ler-0</sup> allele (C.

We attribute these inconsistencies to differences in constructs and localization systems used in the two studies. To determine the localization of MOT1 Tomatsu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000004-Tomatsu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> reported that they prepared a construct in which GFP was fused to the N-terminus of MOT1, blocking the predicted mitochondrial localization signal, and likely mislocalizing the GFP::MOT1 fusion protein in the tobacco BY-2 cells used for transient expression. Results reported here were obtained using a C-terminally fused MOT1::GFP construct that was expressed both transiently and stably in Arabidopsis and that clearly localized to the mitochondria.</p><p>In summary, natural variation has been used here to identify a mitochondrially localized Mo transporter that controls both root and shoot Mo content in Arabidopsis. This discovery demonstrates that natural accessions of Arabidopsis are a rich source of interesting alleles, useful for the functional characterization of genes of unknown function.
