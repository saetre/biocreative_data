However, the relationship of the CSF-1R<sup>+</sup> CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophage/DC precursor (MDP) with other DC precursors and the role of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 in macrophage and DC development remain unclear. We show that MDPs give rise to conventional DCs (cDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (PDCs), and monocytes, including Gr1<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes that differentiate into TipDCs during infection. CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 deficiency selectively impairs the recruitment of blood Gr1<sup>+</sup> monocytes in the spleen after transfer and during acute <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection but does not affect the development of monocytes, cDCs, and PDCs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Monocytes, macrophages, and DCs form networks of phagocytic cells throughout most tissues, the development of which are dependent on the CSF-1 receptor (csf1r, also known as CD115, c-fms, and M-CSF receptor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). These cells, which are sometimes referred to as the mononuclear phagocyte system, play major roles in development, scavenging, inflammation, and antipathogen defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). They are highly heterogeneous in phenotype, tissue distribution, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Considerable attention is currently focused on the characterization of their progenitors and precursors, the signals driving their development in the BM, their migration to tissues, and their homeostasis in peripheral tissues. CSF-1R and its two known ligands, M-CSF and IL34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), are critical for the development of this lineage because M-CSF&#x02013;deficient mice (op/op and csf1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) have a milder phenotype than the Csf1r-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Other cytokines, such as GM-CSF, FLT3, LT-&#x003b1;1&#x003b2;2 (LT-&#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) have also been shown to control the development and homeostasis of the macrophage and DC networks.</p><p>Cellular cloning and transplantation studies have shown that many macrophage subsets, most of the conventional DCs (cDCs) in the secondary lymphoid organs of mice, and at least a fraction of the DCs in the mouse thymus probably originate from myeloid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs [reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>]) include a clonogenic BM macrophage/DC precursor (MDP) that gives rise to spleen cDCs (both the CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> subsets) directly, with no monocytic intermediate, and to monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). The MDP has no significant granulocytic potential, and initial studies failed to detect a plasmacytoid DC (PDC) potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Another precursor, common DC precursor (CDP), was recently shown to give rise to cDCs and PDCs but not to monocytes, and it did not respond to CSF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). This result was interpreted as indicating the existence of two pathways for cDC generation. However, MDPs and CDPs are both included in the CD115<sup>+</sup> lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> fraction of BM progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) and could represent different stages of differentiation along the same pathway. It is also possible that differences in differentiation potential between these cells reported by different groups may reflect differences in experimental protocols rather than intrinsic properties of the cells.</p><p>The chemokine receptor and adhesion molecule CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 is not expressed on early hematopoietic progenitors and is first detected on MDPs. CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 is therefore associated with the commitment of myeloid progenitors to the monocyte/macrophage/DC lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). However, its role in the development and homeostasis of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system remains unknown.</p><p>In this paper, we therefore reevaluated the differentiation potential of the MDP and the possible roles of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 in the differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes in mice using adoptive transfer and disease models. We found that MDPs can give rise to PDCs, as well as to cDCs and monocytes, after adoptive transfer and that MDPs and CDPs share a similar surface phenotype (Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL7Ra<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD117<sup>int</sup> CD135<sup>+</sup> CD115<sup>+</sup> CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup>). The use of AFS98, an antibody designed to block CSF-1 binding to its receptor CD115, and CSF-1&#x02013;dependent proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) to purify MDP did not impair the ability of MDP to give rise to monocytes, cDCs, or PDCs in vivo. Because MDP can give rise to PDCs, cDCs, and monocytes/macrophages, whereas CDP only give rise to PDCs and cDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), MDP appears to exhibit a broader differentiation potential than CDP and may represent an earlier precursor. CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 deficiency decreased the recruitment into the spleen of CD115<sup>+</sup> Gr1<sup>+</sup> monocytes (TipDC precursors) after irradiation and during acute <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection and decreased the efficiency of bacterial clearance but did not affect the development of cDCs or PDCs. The results from this study, therefore, clarify the family tree of mononuclear phagocytes and uncover the role of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 in Gr1<sup>+</sup> monocyte recruitment to the spleen during inflammation and infection.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>MDPs and CDPs are phenotypically overlapping cell populations in mouse BM</title><p>Expression of the chemokine receptor CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 in GMPs (Lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD117<sup>+</sup> Sca1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> IL7R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> CD16/32<sup>+</sup> BM cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) characterizes the MDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and is thus associated with the commitment of myeloid progenitors toward the macrophage/DC lineage. The MDP is also characterized by a low expression of CD117 (c-kit, the receptor for stem cell factor), as compared with GMPs and CMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), and expression of functional CSF-1R (CD115) and FLT3 (CD135) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). More recently, a precursor common to cDCs and PDCs (CDP) was reported and proposed to be distinct from the MDPs because the CDP gave rise to both cDCs and PDCs but not to monocytes/macrophages, whereas the MDPs give rise to cDCs and monocytes/macrophages but not to PDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). We performed an analysis of mouse BM Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> precursors by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>), and the results indicated that most CDPs expressed CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 at levels similar to its level of expression on MDPs, and that most MDPs expressed both CSF-1R/CD115 and CD135 at levels similar to their expression on CDPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). These data confirm the data from Waskow et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) suggesting that MDPs and CDPs had an overlapping phenotype in the BM, and we therefore sought to reevaluate the differentiation potential of MDPs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>MDP and CDP share a similar phenotype.</bold> BM cells from <italic>Cx<sub>3</sub>cr1</italic><sup>gfp/+</sup> reporter mice were labeled with antibodies against lineage markers (CD11c, CD11b, NK1.1, CD3, Ter119, CD19, and Gr1), ckit (CD117), FLT3 (CD135), and CSF-1-R (CD115) and analyzed by FACS.

In addition, the availability of PDCA1 antibody now permits a better phenotypic definition of PDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). We thus investigated the differentiation potential in vivo of MDP, purified as previously described (Fig. S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), after i.v. adoptive transfer. BM MDP from CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>gfp/+</sup> of the <italic>Cd45.1/Cd45.2</italic> genotypes was injected i.v. into <italic>Cd45.2</italic>-irradiated hosts, and splenocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry 6&#x02013;7 d after transfer.

First, our data confirmed that CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 was associated with the commitment of myeloid progenitors to the monocyte/macrophage/DC lineage. The recently described CDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) also expresses CX<sub>3</sub>CR1, CD115, and FLT3, and its phenotype was overlapping with the MDP (this study and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). MDP can give rise to both DCs (PDCs and cDCs) and monocytes/macrophages but do not have the potential to give rise to granulocytes. Thus, they have a more restricted differentiation potential than CMPs, which can give rise to all myeloid cells, and GMPs, which can give rise to granulocytes, macrophages, and DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 d</xref>). CDP has been reported to give rise to cDCs and PDCs but not macrophages and, thus, has a more restricted differentiation potential than MDPs and may be placed downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 d</xref>). Further studies will be needed to investigate the developmental relationship between MDPs and CDPs.</p><p>CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 is a later marker than CSF-1R in myeloid lineage commitment. In this study, we investigated the role of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1/CX<sub>3</sub>CL1 in the development of MDP-derived cells by studying mice lacking CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 or its ligand CX<sub>3</sub>CL1/fractalkine during acute and chronic inflammation and in a sensitive competitive adoptive transfer model. This study revealed an important role of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 in the recruitment of CD115<sup>+</sup> Gr1<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes, which are immediate precursors to TipDCs, to the spleen during infection and for the control of bacterial growth during primary infection in two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c).</p><p>Impaired recruitment of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-deficient Gr1<sup>+</sup> monocytes/TipDCs is the most likely mechanism underlying our observations for the following reasons: in situ hybridization experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> and Fig. S4) indicated that fractalkine is expressed in the marginal zone/T cell areas of the spleen, where TipDC accumulate during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>); short-term adoptive transfer of BM monocytes into irradiated hosts decreased the accumulation of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-deficient monocytes in the spleen by a factor of ten (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>); during acute <italic>Lm</italic> infection, the number of monocytes was higher in the blood of infected CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-deficient mice but decreased in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), and the frequency of annexin-V<sup>high</sup> monocytes was not increased in spleen from infected CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-deficient mice (Fig. S6); CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 deficiency does not appear to influence the survival of CD115<sup>+</sup> Gr1<sup>+</sup> monocytes in the periphery (Fig. S9); and finally, we have found that CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 was redundant for MDP development, survival, homing to the spleen, and differentiation in vivo and in vitro (Fig. S10) and MDP-derived spleen cDCs and PDCs appear to develop normally.</p><p>It is of note that although CD115<sup>+</sup> Gr1<sup>+</sup> (CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>low</sup>) inflammatory monocytes were present in normal numbers in both CX<sub>3</sub>CR1- and CX<sub>3</sub>CL1-deficient mice, the present data confirm that CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 deficiency also slightly decreases the survival of the CD115<sup>+</sup> Gr1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> monocytes (Fig. S9). This result was expected and consistent with the conclusions that we made from our earlier adoptive transfer experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) and with a more recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 has been previously shown to be important for the adhesion of CD115<sup>+</sup> Gr1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup>) monocytes to the endothelium of blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). The mechanism underlying the selective survival defect of CD115<sup>+</sup> Gr1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> monocytes may thus be related to the unique patrolling behavior of these cells, which attach themselves to the luminal side of the endothelium via a CX<sub>3</sub>CR1- and LFA1-dependent mechanism, crawling onto the endothelium for considerable periods of time without extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Human CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>high</sup> cells also adhere to the endothelium via a CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), and adhesion is known to increase survival as has been shown for CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-expressing cells binding to CX<sub>3</sub>CL1 via a mechanism involving an Akt/GSK-3&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated antiapoptotic signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>).</p><p>The role of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 for the recruitment of CD115<sup>+</sup> Gr1<sup>+</sup> monocytes/TipDC precursors is reminiscent of the phenotype of CCR2-, MCP1-, and MCP3- deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). However, the disruption of the CCR2 axis results in a much more dramatic phenotype because both Gr1<sup>+</sup> monocytes exit from the BM into the bloodstream, and the recruitment into tissues of the few monocytes that exit the BM is impaired in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Thus CCR2-deficient mice have reduced numbers of TipDCs. In contrast, BM output is intact in CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-deficient mice, the number of blood Gr1<sup>+</sup> monocytes are normal, and only their recruitment is impaired. Similarly, CCR2-deficient mice have a dramatically impaired innate response to <italic>Lm</italic> infection and die of infection within a few days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>), whereas CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-deficient hosts exhibit a reduced clearance of <italic>Lm</italic> at 24 h after infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), but at later time points we did not observe significant differences in the survival of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1-deficient and control mice (not depicted).
