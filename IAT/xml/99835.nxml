This definition also includes that such regions of general DNase I-sensitive chromatin are flanked by domain boundary&#x0002f;insulator elements, which act to segregate or protect against chromosomal position effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c1">1</xref>). Three prominent examples of such functional domains are the chicken lysozyme locus, and the chicken and human &#x003b2;-globin loci (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c2">2</xref>). However, the genome-wide relevance of this model has been questioned, as a number of characterised loci are not organised into structurally confined regulatory units (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c3">3</xref>). Evidence is mounting that a functional gene domain can be equally well defined by the gene-specific interaction of <italic>cis</italic>-elements (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c4">4</xref>).</p><p>Chicken lysozyme is expressed in the oviduct and in myeloid cells, where expression progressively increases during macrophage differentiation. In these tissues, lysozyme is located in a 24-kb domain of general DNase I sensitivity, whose 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; boundaries are 14 kb upstream and 6 kb downstream, respectively, of the lysozyme transcription start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c5">5</xref>). The transition from increased to decreased DNase I sensitivity at each domain boundary coincides with matrix attachment regions (MARs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c6">6</xref>). Consequently, the lysozyme chromatin domain was thought to be structurally isolated. It was hypothesised that this separation from the chromosomal environment is required for the appropriate expression of the lysozyme gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c6">6</xref>). This hypothesis was supported by the finding that a reporter gene was buffered from position-effects when flanked by the 5&#x02032; MAR and stably transfected into cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c7">7</xref>). Several DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) have been identified around the lysozyme coding region, most of which correspond to discrete <italic>cis</italic>-elements that regulate the spatial and temporal expression of lysozyme, such as enhancers, a silencer, hormone response element, a promoter (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c8">8</xref>) and a replication origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Bonifer <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c10">10</xref>) demonstrated that transgenic mice carrying multiple copies of a 21.4-kb domain fragment randomly integrated into the genome, expressed lysozyme in a copy number-dependent manner, leading to the conclusion that the chicken lysozyme chromatin domain acted as a functional regulatory unit. Deletion analysis experiments aimed at localising the elements responsible for this feature revealed that position independence was conferred by the combined effect of several upstream tissue-specific <italic>cis</italic>-elements and the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c11">11</xref>). However, questions remain about how the tissue-specific activity of the lysozyme locus is assured at the molecular level. Subsequent studies have, for that reason, focused on the molecular interactions at various <italic>cis</italic>-elements, particularly at the level of chromatin fine structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c12">12</xref>) and non-histone protein&#x02013;DNA associations (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c13">13</xref>).</p><p>We report here that a BLASTN search of the complete genomic sequence of the chicken lysozyme domain resulted in the discovery of a widely expressed second gene, <italic>cGas41</italic>, that is highly homologous to a ubiquitously expressed human gene of unknown function, but which is often amplified in gliomal tumors (glioma-amplified sequence; GAS41<italic>)</italic>. We also report the preliminary characterisation of <italic>cGas41</italic> and discuss the implications of its proximity to <italic>cLys</italic>, as well as its general location within the lysozyme chromatin domain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines, tissues and RNA preparation</title><p>Cell lines MEP, HD37, DT40, MSB1, BM2 and HD11 were all grown in Iscove&#x02019;s modified Dulbecco&#x02019;s medium containing <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Gibco BRL), 8&#x00025; foetal calf serum, 2&#x00025; chicken serum, 100 U&#x0002f;ml penicillin, 100 mg&#x0002f;ml streptomycin and 0.15 mM monothioglycerol.

As a result of its GC-richness, PCR of cGas41 was performed with HotStarTaq DNA polymerase and Q-solution (Qiagen). cLys and control (chicken &#x003b2;-actin, mouse GAPDH) PCR reactions were all performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c12">12</xref>).

AF410481). This sequence was used in a BLASTN search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant nucleotide database. To our surprise, high percentage identity to human glioma-amplified sequence (<italic>GAS41</italic>, GenBank accession no. NM&#x0005f;006530) was observed at several discrete sequences in the 3&#x02032; half of the lysozyme domain. The finding that each region of homology corresponded to individual human <italic>GAS41</italic> exons suggested that we had identified the chicken orthologue of this gene. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf138f1">1</xref>A, the first sequence with homology to human <italic>GAS41</italic> (exon 1, 92&#x00025; identity over 38 bp) is located immediately 3&#x02032; to the chicken lysozyme coding region, in a CpG island reported previously to function as an origin of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c9">9</xref>). Other sequences in the lysozyme domain exhibiting homology to human <italic>GAS41</italic> are located further downstream (exon 4, 88&#x00025; identity over 50 bp; exon 5, 86&#x00025; identity over 93 bp; exon 7, 84&#x00025; identity over 151 bp) and extend into the 3&#x02032; MAR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf138f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>Human <italic>GAS41</italic> was initially identified as part of a multigene region at 12q13.15 that was amplified and expressed in gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c14">14</xref>). As a result of its homology to human AF-9 and ENL genes, it is believed to be a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c16">16</xref>). The chicken <italic>Gas41</italic> genomic locus spans &#x0003e;2.8 kb and consists of seven exons and six introns. All of the exon&#x0002f;intron junctions except one, at the 3&#x02032; end of intron 4, conform to the GT&#x0002f;AG rule. <italic>cGas41</italic> encodes either a 223 or 227 amino acid protein, depending on which of two possible translation start sites are used, and a multiple sequence alignment using the Pileup and Pretty programs from the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software package illustrates that GAS41 is highly conserved, with <italic>cGas41</italic> exhibiting 97.4 and 96.5&#x00025; identity to human and mouse Gas41, respectively, at the amino acid level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf138f1">1</xref>B). Interestingly, the proximity of lysozyme and <italic>GAS41</italic> is conserved in humans, where they are located 5.53 kb apart on 12q14.3.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf138f2">2</xref> details the results of RT&#x02013;PCR analyses of endogenous <italic>cGas41</italic> expression in various chicken tissues and cell lines. The forward and reverse PCR primers were designed to anneal to exons 1 and 2, respectively, so that PCR products containing the intervening intron 1 region could be easily identified. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf138f2">2</xref>A, several chick and adult hen tissue samples were tested, all of which were positive for <italic>cGas41</italic> expression. The two bands obtained for <italic>cGas41</italic> correspond to spliced and unspliced transcripts. No such PCR products were obtained in control reactions done without reverse transcriptase (data not shown). In contrast, <italic>cLys</italic> is only expressed in adult hen oviduct tissues. Faint bands corresponding to lysozyme expression in all the chick tissues were most likely due to the inevitable contamination of tissues with peripheral blood (and therefore macrophages) at harvest. This was confirmed by analysis of six chicken cell lines grown as pure cultures, corresponding to multipotent myeloid progenitor cells (HD50 MEP), erythroblasts (HD37), B cells (DT40), T cells (MSB1), monocytes (BM2) and macrophages (HD11) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf138f2">2</xref>B). <italic>cGas41</italic> is clearly expressed to a similar extent in all the chicken cell lines tested, whilst <italic>cLys</italic> exhibits its characteristic tissue and developmental stage-specific expression profile, with a low level of expression in monocytes and a high level of expression in macrophages. In summary, endogenous <italic>cGas41</italic> is widely expressed and, whilst the range of tissues tested was not exhaustive, a <italic>cGas41</italic> non-expressing tissue was not identified. Expression of chicken <italic>Gas41</italic> thus seems to be similar to the ubiquitous expression seen for human <italic>GAS41</italic>.</p><p>RLM-RACE was used to determine the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the <italic>cGas41</italic> transcript and the results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf138f3">3</xref>. The full-length <italic>cGas41</italic> transcript is comprised of 1125 nt, and is contained entirely within the chicken lysozyme chromatin domain. More specifically, <italic>cGas41</italic> transcription is in the same orientation as <italic>cLys</italic> and starts 207 bp downstream of the lysozyme polyadenylation site, in a previously characterized unmethylated CpG island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c9">9</xref>). As such, <italic>cGas41</italic> appears to have a CpG island promoter typical of constitutively expressed genes, including a 26-bp GC-box with perfect dyad symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c17">17</xref>). At the 3&#x02032; end, <italic>cGas41</italic> exons 5&#x02013;7 and the 3&#x02032; untranslated region are all either partially or fully localized within a previously characterized MAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c6">6</xref>). In accordance with its widespread expression, the CpG island promoter of <italic>cGas41</italic> displays a DHS in all tissues tested so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c19">19</xref>). These earlier DHS mapping studies as well as experiments performed in our laboratory studies also demonstrated that probes covering most of <italic>cGas41</italic> do not cross-hybridise with any other gene in the chicken genome (M.Huber and C.Bonifer, unpublished observation).</p><p>A transgenic mouse line, TgH(cLys)3, carrying a single copy of the 21.4-kb <italic>cLys</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>cGas41</italic> chromatin domain targeted to the X-linked mouse <italic>Hprt</italic> locus, and created to further examine chicken lysozyme regulation, was used to determine whether <italic>cGas41</italic> expression could be reproduced in the mouse genome (S.Chong, J.Kontaraki, C.Bonifer and A.Riggs, manuscript in preparation). Previous studies revealed expression of the chicken lysozyme transgene only in the brain and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c11">11</xref>; data not shown). In contrast, the results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf138f2">2</xref>C show that the expression of the <italic>cGas41</italic> transgene is detectable in all tested mouse tissues. Control experiments with the embryonic stem (ES) cell lines used to generate the transgenic mice and non-transgenic ES cells demonstrate that <italic>cGas41</italic> expression originates exclusively from the transgene.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p><italic>cGas41</italic> was identified when a BLASTN comparison of the 21.4-kb chicken lysozyme chromatin domain to the NCBI nucleotide database revealed high homology to human <italic>GAS41</italic> cDNA. The <italic>cGas41</italic> genomic locus is at least 2.8 kb and consists of seven exons. A 1.1-kb <italic>cGas41</italic> mRNA is produced in the same orientation as <italic>cLys</italic> transcription, and encodes a 223&#x02013;227 amino acid protein, which exhibits at least 96&#x00025; identity to human and mouse Gas41 at the amino acid level. Accordingly, an avian example can be added to the growing list of highly conserved GAS41 proteins of fungal, yeast, plant and mammalian origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c16">16</xref>). Human <italic>GAS41</italic> is a nuclear protein that has a proposed role as a transcription factor, but no apparent DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c16">16</xref>).</p><p>Human <italic>GAS41</italic> produces a single transcript of &#x0223c;1.7 kb, which is present in a wide range of human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c16">16</xref>). Likewise, RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of endogenous <italic>cGas41</italic> revealed its constitutive expression in a range of adult hen and chick tissues as well as chicken cell lines. Initiation of <italic>cGas41</italic> transcription occurs 207 bp downstream of the <italic>cLys</italic> polyadenylation site. This is intriguing for a number of reasons. First, the 5&#x02032; end of <italic>cGas41</italic> coincides with a region characterised previously both as a CpG island and replication origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c9">9</xref>). Unmethylated CpG islands are commonly associated with the promoters of housekeeping genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c20">20</xref>), and this report establishes that the CpG island at the 3&#x02032; end of <italic>cLys</italic> is, similarly, associated with the promoter of the widely expressed <italic>cGas41</italic>. It has also been shown that many CpG islands are origins of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c22">22</xref>). Correspondingly, the GC-rich region between <italic>cLys</italic> and <italic>cGas41</italic> represents a specific example of a CpG island with dual promoter&#x0002f;origin function. Moreover, as it was reported that replication at this site is bidirectional and initiates early in S phase in both lysozyme-expressing and non-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c9">9</xref>), the question arises whether in this case a common replication origin is used for both a constitutive gene and a tissue-specific gene.</p><p>The most important result from this study is our finding that a highly expressed, tissue-specific gene and a widely expressed gene with a housekeeping promoter coexist in close proximity on the same structurally defined chromatin domain. Moreover, the expression in several tissues of a <italic>cLys</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>cGas41</italic> transgene in the mouse genome suggests that all of the required <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements may be present on the transgene and thus in the chromatin domain. Support for this notion comes from earlier DHS mapping experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c19">19</xref>). A second, constitutive DHS is located 4 kb downstream of the <italic>cGas41</italic> transcription start site and is contained within the transgene. No other DHS is found within the next 15 kb downstream of this site. Our results also invite a re-evaluation of the literature regarding the definition of a domain of general DNase I sensitivity. The example presented here suggests a strong link between gene expression levels and the degree of nuclease sensitivity across the entire chromatin domain, as in <italic>cLys</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>cGas41</italic> expressing cells a significant difference in nuclease sensitivity could be detected as compared with cells expressing <italic>cGas41</italic> only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf138c5">5</xref>). A similar link between promoter activity and general DNase I sensitivity is also apparent in the &#x003b2;-globin locus where intergenic transcripts were identified that may be implicated in the generation of open chromatin in this locus (23).</p><p>Our data provide an example of two unrelated, differentially expressed vertebrate genes coexisting in the same functional chromatin domain. The implications to chicken lysozyme regulation, in particular, and functional chromatin domains, in general, illustrate the power of genomics to both alter established view points and to open up new avenues of research.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf138f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Summary of important features in the <italic>cLys</italic> chromatin domain.
