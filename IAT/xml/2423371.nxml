Hashimoto Thyroiditis (H.T.), an autoimmune thyroid disease, is characterised morphologically by inflammatory infiltrate and diffuse fibrosis which typically leads to progressive thyrocyte depletion. This loss of thyrocyte capacity results in impaired thyroid hormone production and clinical hypothyroidism. However the exact molecular mechanisms by which thyrocyte destruction occurs remains to be seen.</p><p>The <italic>ret</italic>/PTC oncogenes represent activated, rearranged forms of the <italic>RET </italic>proto-oncogene. They were initially thought to be specific for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), but have subsequently been found in benign thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto Thyroiditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The <italic>ret</italic>/PTC oncogenes are formed as a result of chromosomal inversions within chromosome 10 resulting in the fusion of the tyrosine kinase domain of <italic>RET </italic>to another donor gene. The most commonly detected rearrangement is <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 (~70%), in which the tyrosine kinase moiety of <italic>c-ret </italic>is fused to the 5' end of the H4 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The observation that <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 was not restricted to PTC raised the possibility that a) H.T. might represent an early malignant state to which some patients are able to mount an immune response, or b) that <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 occurs in the absence of malignancy and is not specific for PTC.</p><p>In either event <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 activation is associated with florid lymphocytic infiltration. The objective of this study was to investigate the immune response elicited by a normal and endogenously expressing <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 thyroid cell line after co-culture with autoimmune H.T. and normal lymphocytic supernatant using functional genomics. Immunoprofiling TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>low density arrays were used to evaluate the expression profiles of <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 positive and negative thyrocytes over a time course of co-culture with activated T cell supernatant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>low density array immunoprofiling data was analyzed using SDS 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).

Its presence has also been noted in lesions which have an affiliated inflammatory infiltrate. However, despite extensive studies into the prevalence and sequelae of the presence of activated <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 it remains unclear if <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 activation orchestrates, maintains or modulates the inflammatory response so often observed as a feature of <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 positive lesions.</p><p>The aim of this project was to observe the immune response elicited by a normal thyroid cell line model upon exposure to lymphocytic supernatant derived from a H.T. and normal donor at varying time points. To further evaluate the role of the <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 oncogene in a similar setting, we also observed the immune response elicited by an endogenously expressing <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 thyroid cell line stimulated with H.T. and normal lymphocyte supernatant. We chose to use an endogenously expressing <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 cell line rather than transfecting the normal cell line with <italic>ret </italic>as we felt that in the setting of this experiment, it was more biologically plausible to compare a normal thyroid cell line with a thyroid cancer cell line which natively expresses the oncogene. We decided to utilise supernatant from activated T-lymphocytes in each group to stimulate the cell line models to ensure assessment of gene expression accurately reflected the repertoire of the epithelial cells alone.</p><sec><title>Nthy-ori gene expression pattern</title><p>When thyroid cells from the Nthy-ori cell line model were exposed to Hashimoto Thyroiditis (H.T.) lymphocyte supernatant, a universal up-regulation of all immune targets was observed when compared to exposure to control lymphocyte supernatant (with the exception of Heme oxygenase-1 where expression between each cohort was equivocal) (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>However, within the global increased expression on stimulation by H.T. supernatant, some clusters of genes appeared to be particularly interesting. They included subsets of targets which may contribute to the pathogenesis of H.T. via cell mediated cytotoxic cell death and TCR signalling.</p><p>Thyrocyte specific CD8 cytotoxic T cell responses are a pivotal factor in the tissue specific destruction that is seen in H.T. Cell mediated cytoxicity is initiated through two different mechanisms 1) effector cell expression of death ligands presented to target cells and 2) effector cell release of exocytic granules containing perforin and granzyme B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Over expression of both Fas ligand (FasL) and granzyme B, was seen when the normal thyroid cell line model was stimulated with H.T. lymphocyte supernatant compared to control supernatant.</p><p>Granzyme B is a serine protease that plays an important role in inducing apoptotic changes in target cells during granule exocytosis-induced cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] while FasL induces apoptosis by binding to and activating its receptors, which in turn bind to adaptor molecules that activate the caspase family.</p><p>Increased expression of these cytotoxic agents in the normal thyroid cell line model exposed to H.T. lymphocyte supernatant suggests that these targets are specifically involved in cytotoxic cell death in H.T. leading to apoptosis of thyroid follicular epithelial cells and the resultant destruction of thyroid tissue that is indicative of H.T.</p><p>Moreover, targets involved with the T cell receptor (TCR) and T cell signalling were also up-regulated which may be responsible for exacerbation of the destructive process seen in H.T. These targets included CD3, CD25, CD28, CD152 and CD45.</p><p>T cell activation requires not only the generation of an initial signal through interaction of the antigenic peptide with the TCR-CD3 complex but also a subsequent antigen non-specific co-stimulatory signal, provided primarily by the interaction of CD28 on T cells with B7 molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. CD152 is implicated in this process via competitive binding to B7. CD45 is involved in maintaining protein tyrosine kinases in a dephosphorylated state prior to participation in signal transduction upon subsequent TCR ligation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is interesting to hypothesize that these over-expressed TCR and T cell signalling associated targets may be involved in the disease pathogenesis seen in H.T. via dysregulation of T cell signalling and control of T cell activation resulting in the over-activity of immune responses typically seen in autoimmune diseases such as H.T.</p><p>Finally, a large fold change difference (RQ value) was observed for granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) when comparing thyrocytes exposed to H.T. and control lymphocyte supernatant in the normal cell line model (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). G-CSF elicits an effect on the immune system via its role in monocyte/macrophage activation, neutrophil stimulation and regulation of inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production. One cause of tissue damage in the thyroid is infiltration by lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. The over-expression of G-CSF in thyrocytes exposed to H.T. lymphocyte supernatant suggests that G-CSF may play a role in promoting the inflammatory aggravation and subsequent tissue destruction seen in autoimmune thyroid diseases such as H.T.</p></sec><sec><title>TPC-1 gene expression pattern</title><p>We further wanted to evaluate the expression and role of the <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 oncogene in a similar context and so we reapplied our co-culture conditions to another thyroid cell line expressing this oncogene (TPC-1 cell line).</p><p>As previously stated, the Nthy-ori co-culture displayed up-regulation of a discrete subset of immune targets which may contribute to the disease pathogenesis seen in H.T. These targets included granzyme B, CD3, CD25, CD152 and CD45; targets which are involved in apoptosis, T cell signalling and T cell activation. In the <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 cell line model, these 5 targets showed a shift in gene expression pattern whereby they were down-regulated in <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 positive thyrocytes exposed to H.T. supernatant when compared to exposure to control supernatant. There has been much speculation surrounding the role that <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 plays in the inflammatory response in <italic>ret </italic>positive lesions. In this study we have seen that exposure to supernatant derived from H.T. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) results in the normal thyroid cell line model and the <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 positive thyroid cell line model producing different immunogenic patterns. Perhaps the expression of the <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 oncogene in the TPC-1 cell line acts to down-regulate apoptotic and T cell signalling targets, resulting in this change in gene expression pattern that we have seen. As a result of this expression pattern in the stimulated <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 expressing cell line, it is interesting to speculate that <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 activation in AITD may dampen the immune response and facilitate tumour growth and development.</p><p><italic>ret</italic>/PTC has been shown to function in the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling cascade by binding adaptor proteins such as growth receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), which in turn activate RAS. RAS activates AF kinases such as BRAF and its downstream signalling cascade including MEK (MAP kinase) and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases or MAPK). Activated ERK1 and ERK2 translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription factors such as ELK-1 and STAT3. Hwang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] have demonstrated that <italic>ret</italic>/PTC associates with and activates STAT3, while microarray analysis has demonstrated up-regulation of STAT3 in <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-3 thyrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore STAT3 has been shown to contribute to malignancy by inactivating intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>ret</italic>/PTC activation and the resultant STAT3 transcription factor activation via the MAPK signalling cascade may be involved in impeding apoptosis in thyrocytes by down-regulation of granzyme B. Although a link between STAT3 activation and dysregulation of apoptotic mechanisms via granzyme B down-regulation cannot be proven from this study alone it is interesting to speculate that STAT3 activation through <italic>ret</italic>/PTC MAPK signalling may contribute to malignancy in the setting of thyroid neoplasia.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has highlighted a set of immune related gene expression markers which were shown to be up-regulated in a normal thyroid cell line model upon exposure to H.T lymphocyte supernatant when compared to control. These targets included genes which could plausibly be in involved in exacerbating the disease pathogenesis seen in H.T. To further ascertain the extent to which the oncogene <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 is involved in immunogenic responses in AITD, we used a <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 positive thyroid cell line model employing the same co-culture methods. We found that when this cell line was stimulated with H.T. supernatant, a shift in the immunogenic pattern was seen, whereby the same set of immune markers were down-regulated compared to control supernatant stimulation. We hypothesise that <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 expression in the TPC-1 thyroid cell line may lead to down-regulation of these immune targets. Consequently we can speculate that <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 activation in the setting of AITD may lead to under-expression of these immune targets, resulting in tumour growth and development. Nonetheless, this study, utilising TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>low density immune arrays, has given us further insight into the molecular immunogenesis of H.T. and some of the targets that may be involved in exacerbating disease pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Nthy-ori 3-1 (ECACC, Wiltshire, UK) represents a normal human thyroid follicular epithelial cell line which has been immortalised by transfection with a plasmid encoding for the SV40 large T gene.</p><p>TPC-1 is a cell line derived from a papillary thyroid carcinoma and expresses the <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 oncogene.</p><p>Both cell lines were grown to confluence in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37&#x000b0;C in the following plating medium: RPMI 1640 with 2 m M L-glutamine (Invitrogen-GIBCO, MD, USA), 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen-GIBCO, MD, USA), penicillin (100 U/ml) (Invitrogen-GIBCO, MD, USA) and streptomycin (100 U/ml) (Invitrogen-GIBCO, MD, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Lymphocyte isolation</title><p>Gene expression analysis was performed at three distinct time points for each cell type and co-culture variable; 0 hours, 6 hours and 18 hours.

This phenomenon was most likely due to HLA incompatibility and/or contact inhibition. Hence, it was decided to extract supernatant from activated T-cells for stimulation of thyrocytes to provide a uniform trigger across both <italic>ret</italic>/PTC-1 + and - cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and cDNA archiving</title><p>At 0, 6 and 18 hour time points' cells were tripsinised (Sigma-aldrich, MO, USA) and centrifuged to remove supernatant. RNA was extracted using RNeasy <sup>&#x000ae; </sup>mini kit (Qiagen Ltd., West Sussex, UK) according to manufacturer's protocol. RNA quantity was assessed using a NanoDrop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Wilmington, USA).

The panel of assays included in the TLDA format is designed to simultaneously assess gene expression patterns of multiple targets in a micro-fluidic system. Each immune profiling TLDA contains lyophilised gene expression reagents (primers and probes [FAM labeled]) in a preconfigured 384 well format (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> for an illustration of the gene expression reagents that were factory loaded onto the TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>TLDAs). Each of the 8 separate loading ports feeds into 48 separate wells, with 4 well replicates per assay.</p><p>One sample was analysed per card. Each loading port was filled with a 100 &#x003bc;l volume containing 5 &#x003bc;l cDNA (20 ng/&#x003bc;l), 45 &#x003bc;l of nuclease free water and 50 &#x003bc;l of TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>universal PCR master mix (2&#x000d7;). After loading, the cards were placed in Sorvall<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>/Heraeus<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>custom buckets (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and centrifuged in a Sorvall Legend T EASYset centrifuge (Thermo Electron Corporation, Germany) for a total of 2 consecutive 1 minute spins at 1200 rpm to ensure complete distribution of the sample from the loading port into each well. Following centrifugation, cards were sealed with a TLDA sealer (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) to prevent cross contamination. Real time RT-PCR amplification was performed on an ABI Prism<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>7900 H.T. Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 2 minutes at 50&#x000b0;C, 10 minutes at 94.5&#x000b0;C, and for 40 cycles, 30 seconds at 97&#x000b0;C and 1 minute at 59.7&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>low density array analysis</title><p>TLDA cards were analyzed with relative quantification (RQ) documents and RQ manager software for automated data analysis (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). For analysis purposes, the Nthy-ori time points and the TPC-1 time points were analysed as two separate RQ studies. Expression values were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (C<sub>t</sub>) method. Briefly, this technique uses the formula 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;C</sup>t [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] to calculate the expression of target genes normalised to a calibrator (un-stimulated N-thy-ori or TPC-1 at 0 hours). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was selected as the endogenous control.</p><p>The threshold cycle C<sub>t </sub>indicates the cycle number by which the amount of amplified target reaches a fixed threshold. The C<sub>t </sub>data for all inflammation target genes and GAPDH were used to create &#x00394;C<sub>t </sub>values [&#x00394;C<sub>t </sub>= C<sub>t </sub>(target gene)-C<sub>t </sub>(GAPDH)]. &#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>t </sub>values were calculated by subtracting the calibrator (Nthy-ori at 0 hrs or TPC-1 at 0 hrs) from the &#x00394;C<sub>t </sub>value of each target. Relative quantification (RQ) values were calculated using the equation 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;C </sup><sub>t.</sub></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KD carried out the co-culture and gene expression analysis and wrote original and final versions of this manuscript.,PS carried out statistical and analytical analysis of gene expression data and helped draft the manuscript, SC helped with analysis of gene expression data and carried out cell culture, RF helped with analysis of gene expression data, JHL and SA carried out cell culture, JOL and OS conceived the study and helped write the manuscript.
