Perturbations in phosphorylation-based signaling networks are typically studied in a hypothesis-driven approach, using phospho-specific antibodies. Here we apply quantitative, high-resolution mass spectrometry to determine the systems response to the depletion of one signaling component. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> cells were metabolically labeled using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and the phosphatase Ptp61F, the ortholog of mammalian PTB1B, a drug target for diabetes, was knocked down by RNAi. In total we detected more than 10,000 phosphorylation sites in the phosphoproteome of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> Schneider cells and trained a phosphorylation site predictor with this data. SILAC-based quantitation after phosphatase knock-down showed that apart from the phosphatase, the proteome was minimally affected whereas 288 of 6,478 high-confidence phosphorylation sites changed significantly. Responses at the phosphotyrosine level included the already described Ptp61F substrates Stat92E and Abi. Our analysis highlights a connection of Ptp61F to cytoskeletal regulation through GTPase regulating proteins and focal adhesion components.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Information processing in biological systems relies heavily on activation and inactivation of proteins by phosphorylation. This key post-translational modification is involved in the regulation of most cellular processes and mediates many rapid responses as well as long-term gene expression changes in response to stimuli. Protein kinases and protein phosphatases coordinately regulate this highly dynamic and reversible modification. Phosphorylation is usually studied in a candidate-based approach by <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays or by immune techniques employing phospho-specific antibodies. Despite the success of this reductionist approach, it does not afford a systems-wide observation of the effects upon perturbations of signaling networks.</p><p>Recent advances in MS-based<xref ref-type="fn" rid="G1"><sup>1</sup></xref> proteomics now allow the identification of thousands of phosphorylation sites from complex protein mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Most large-scale phosphoproteomics studies have been qualitative rather than quantitative; however, isotope-based methods enable precise quantitation of phosphorylation sites between two or more cellular states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Our group has applied the metabolic labeling technology termed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) for the quantitative comparison of phosphoproteomes. For example, we quantified phosphorylation dynamics in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation. Out of a measured phosphoproteome of several thousand sites only a minority (about 10%) was regulated by the signal, highlighting the importance of quantitation in pinpointing specific systems responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> is a well established model system to study key players in cell signaling and development. Genetic studies have been performed for decades whereas more recently also RNA interference (RNAi) has been employed for gene function studies using a highly efficient silencing protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A further advantage of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> as a model system is the lower degree of functional redundancy compared with higher vertebrates while maintaining a high level of conservation of human genes linked to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Two large-scale, non-quantitative <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> phosphoproteome studies were carried out in embryonic Kc167 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Both studies identified more than 10,000 sites of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> phosphoproteome.</p><p>We have recently adapted the SILAC methodology for quantitative proteomics to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content>. Schneider line 2 (SL2) cells were treated with either mock dsRNA or dsRNA against ISWI, a component of chromatin remodeling complexes. The combination of RNAi and SILAC allows the unbiased &#x0201c;phenotypization&#x0201d; of the gene knock-down directly at the proteome level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Here we determined a high-quality basal phosphoproteome in SL2 cells and characterized its structural and evolutionary properties. We compared kinase substrate motives between <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> and human and trained a <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> phosphorylation site predictor.</p><p>To explore the potential of quantitative phosphoproteomics in a systems-wide manner, we focused on the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> non-transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase Ptp61F. This phosphatase is the ortholog of mammalian PTB1B, which is thought to be involved in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and which is the target of several ongoing drug development projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Ptp61F is a negative regulator of JAK/STAT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and, together with the Ableson kinase (Abl), involved in the regulation of the Abl interacting protein (Abi) and lamella formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Both PTP1B and Ptp61F are among the best studied protein tyrosine phosphatases in their respective organisms; however the characterization of their substrates is still far from complete. Two recent mass spectrometric studies employed substrate trapping to identify direct substrates of PTP1B and Ptp61F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The PTP1B study was combined with phosphotyrosine peptide enrichment, which led to site-specific detection of potential PTP1B targets. PTP1B function was additionally investigated by quantitative phosphotyrosine proteomics comparing wild type and PTP1B-deficient fibroblasts. In contrast, the Ptp61F study identified potential substrates without site-specific information. One of these was PVR, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> homolog of VEGFR and PDGFR, suggesting that Ptp61F - like its mammalian counterpart - counteracts receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Apart from Abi, further components of the SCAR/WAVE complex as well as its regulatory kinase Abl were identified as potential Ptp61F substrates. This supports an involvement of Ptp61F in the regulation of actin reorganization and remodeling.</p><p>To study the role of Ptp61F in a global and unbiased approach we combined global quantitative phosphoproteome analysis with RNA interference. We profiled tyrosine, serine and threonine phosphorylation changes upon ablation of Ptp61F by RNAi. In parallel, we quantified changes in the proteome, which allowed us to normalize changes in phosphorylation sites to corresponding changes at the protein level. Interestingly, we observed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein tyrosine kinase Abl which suggests an enhanced Abl activity upon Ptp61F RNAi. We additionally detected up-regulated phosphotyrosine sites on GTPase regulating proteins (like RhoGAP15B and Vav) and constituents of focal adhesions (like Paxillin and Lasp) which expand the proposed involvement of Ptp61F in the regulation of cytoskeleton organization. Our work represents proof-of-principle that the combination of large-scale phosphoproteomics and a loss-of-function approach can contribute significantly to elucidating the role of key players in phosphorylation-dependent signaling. Importantly, this systems-wide approach measures the net effect of the perturbation on the entire signaling network, without the need to define specific substrate-kinase or substrate -phosphatase relationships or other direct functional mechanisms.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> Schneider SL2 cells were a kind gift from Peter Becker's laboratory.

MS/MS spectra were searched by Mascot (version 2.2.04, Matrix Science) against the FlyBase (version 5.4) (containing 20,822 entries) combined with 175 common contaminants and concatenated with the reversed versions of all sequences. The following parameters were set for the Mascot searches. Trypsin allowing for cleavage N-terminal to proline and cleavage between aspartic acid and proline was chosen as enzyme specificity. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was selected as a fixed modification, whereas protein N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation and serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation were selected as variable modifications. Depending on a priori knowledge about the number of Arg and Lys in the precursor ion determined by MaxQuant before the search, Arg-10 and Lys-8 were used as additional fixed or variable modifications. Maximally three (version 1.0.11.5) or two missed cleavages (version 1.0.12.33) and three labeled amino acids were allowed. Initial mass deviation of precursor ion and fragment ions were up to 7 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. MaxQuant automatically quantified SILAC peptides and proteins. SILAC protein ratios were calculated as the median of all peptide ratios assigned to the protein. A false discovery rate of 0.01 was required for proteins and peptides with a minimum length of 6 amino acids. In addition a posterior error probability for each MS/MS spectrum below or equal to 0.1 was required. In case the identified peptides of two proteins were the same or the identified peptides of one protein included all peptides of another protein, these proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic> isoforms and homologs) were combined by MaxQuant and reported as one protein group. Phosphorylation sites were made non-redundant with regards to their surrounding peptide sequence. Nevertheless all alternative proteins that matched a particular phosphosite were reported as one group. The PTM score was used for assignment of the phosphorylation site(s) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).

The essential feature of each instance that was used for this machine learning approach was the raw sequence: the phosphorylated residue along with its surrounding sequence (&#x000b1;6 residues). This yields 260 dimensions in the feature space reflecting the surrounding amino acids. Each feature dimension presents a certain residue on a certain position within the given 13 amino acid sequence window. To generate a negative set of the same size, we randomly chose sites from fly proteins that were not, to date, detected to be phosphorylated. The positive and negative datasets were split into a training set (90%) and a test set (10%). The parameters C and &#x003c3; were optimized by varying them from 2<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> to 2<sup>10</sup> in multiplicative steps of two on the basis of a 5-fold cross validation on the training set. The optimal C and &#x003c3; parameters for predicting phosphoserines were 32 and 0.125, respectively. In the case of phosphothreonines the best parameters were 4 and 0.125, respectively.

Here we employed the SILAC method instead to measure quantitative changes in the levels of <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation sites. In a first SILAC experiment, we compared basal phosphorylation to phosphatase inhibitor mixture-induced phosphorylation. This involves application of cell permeable inhibitors of serine/threonine and tyrosine protein phosphatases (see below) and has an analytical rather than a functional goal; it is advantageous because we trigger the identification of very low abundant endogenous phosphorylation sites that are up-regulated in response to the inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, the presence and mass spacing of the SILAC pair distinguish peptides from noise and allow counting the number of labeled amino acids, thereby decreasing the search space in database identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The second SILAC experiment in which we quantified changes in the phosphoproteome upon RNAi-mediated knock-down of a phosphatase (see below) has both an analytical and a functional goal: it increases the measured endogenous phosphoproteome, which we subsequently analyzed bioinformatically, and it supplies information on the cellular roles of the phosphatase. Analytically, these two experiments lead to the detection of different sets of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M800559-MCP200/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Tables 8 and 9). All phosphorylation sites in either SILAC experiments that are present in the control state (manifest as SILAC pairs) thus reflect the endogenous phosphorylation status of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> SL2 cells here termed &#x0201c;basal phosphoproteome&#x0201d;.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Basal phosphoproteome of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> SL2 cells.</bold><italic>A</italic>, experimental procedure for quantitative phosphoproteomics with phosphatase inhibitor mixture treatment of the heavy labeled SL2 cell population.

The two SILAC populations were combined in equal amounts, and their total protein extract was in-solution digested. To enrich phosphopeptides, we employed both multiple rounds of TiO<sub>2</sub> chromatography in batch mode and the combination of SCX followed by TiO<sub>2</sub> chromatography (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M800559-MCP200/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Fig. 1). Phosphopeptide fractions were separated by reverse-phase chromatography and on-line detected in a high-resolution linear ion trap-orbitrap instrument (LTQ-Orbitrap) (LC-MS/MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). A phosphorylation site not responding to inhibitor treatment is detected as a phosphopeptide peak pair with the same peak intensities (ratio H/L = 1). An up-regulated phosphorylation site has a ratio H/L &#x0003e; 1 and a down-regulated one H/L &#x0003c; 1. In total, we identified 6,752 high-confidence phosphorylation sites (Class I sites: 99% peptide identification confidence and &#x0003e;75% amino acid localization confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>)). Of the phosphotyrosine sites, 88% were regulated upon phosphatase inhibitor treatment whereas only 44% of the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine sites changed by more than 1.5-fold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M800559-MCP200/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Fig. 2).

Since dsRNA treatment for 8 days can also alter the proteome, we additionally analyzed global protein expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>).

However, while 1,274 phosphorylated proteins were identified in all three studies, 334 phosphoproteins were exclusively found in our study indicating that none of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> phosphoproteomes is exhaustive yet. This observation is even more striking at the level of phosphorylation sites. We detected 4,691 novel phosphorylation sites, while 5,051 sites (51.8%) were already covered by the other two studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M800559-MCP200/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Fig. 4B).</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatics Analysis of the SL2 Phosphoproteome</title><p>Insects are at considerable evolutional distance to mammals, in which most phosphoproteomic studies have been done. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content>, in particular, serves as an important model organism, but so far it is not known how closely the phosphoproteome resembles that of mammals.

SABLE assigns the predicted secondary structure (coil, helix, or &#x003b2;-sheet) to each residue of a given input sequence along with calculated accessibility values ranging from 0 (fully buried) to 9 (fully exposed).

In total, 91% of phosphorylated serines were found to be located in loop regions in comparison to 77% of the serines that were not identified to be phosphorylated on the same proteins. The resulting degrees of accessibilities calculated by SABLE 2.0 were also significantly higher for phosphorylated residues compared with their non-phosphorylated counterpart (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M800559-MCP200/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Fig. 6B).

With assigned gene transcripts in hands, we compared the conservation of detected phosphorylated proteins with the one of all proteins from FlyBase that are defined as &#x0201c;known&#x0201d; due to former experimental evidence. We found that phosphorylated proteins show more orthologs throughout all eukaryotes than all other annotated proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M800559-MCP200/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Table 5 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M800559-MCP200/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Fig. 8). For example, around 70% of proteins that are phosphorylated in fly have orthologous counterparts in mosquito; in comparison, around 60% of the other known proteins are homologous to mosquito proteins. The same tendency was found for the homology to more distantly related species such as human or even yeast. The results of the analysis on the inter-species level are in concordance with ones of the intra-species level. We found that more than half (55%) of all fly proteins show paralogs, whereas a mere 27% of the phosphorylated subset shows homology within the same species.

It was found 10-fold up-regulated upon Ptp61F RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>), which represents the most extreme tyrosine responder in the entire dataset.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Quantitative phosphoproteome upon Ptp61F RNAi.</bold><italic>A</italic>, plot of normalized ratios of all quantified phosphorylation sites against their summed heavy and light peptide intensities (<italic>n</italic> = 6537). <italic>B</italic>, SILAC peptide pair of STAT92E, the most up-regulated phosphotyrosine peptide upon Ptp61F RNAi. <italic>C</italic>, SILAC peptide- pair of Abl, 1.9-fold up-regulation on a C-terminal autophosphoylation site.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zjw0070934280005"/></fig><p>One category of proteins with up-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation sites are likely direct substrates of Ptp61F because they are also found in a recent substrate trapping assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). These are the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase Abl, its interacting protein Abi (also found by Huang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>)), the focal adhesion protein Lasp, the GTPase activating protein RhoGAP15B, and the sorting nexin DSH3PX1. However, the substrate trapping experiment did not identify specific sites, and our experiment now provides this important information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The kinase Ack was also identified by substrate trapping. The high-confidence tyrosine phosphorylation site Tyr-987 of Ack was up-regulated 1.3-fold but was not statistically significant by our definition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). This was also the case for the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of SCAR (1.3-fold) and Pvr (1.2-fold), suggesting that our significant thresholds are conservative.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Direct and indirect targets of Ptp61F.</bold> The H/L phosphopeptide ratios upon Ptp61F RNAi and in brackets their corresponding values normalized to the protein expression are indicated.

In support, mammalian Paxillin was identified in a PTP1B substrate assay experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Furthermore, the same study found increased tyrosine phosphorylation of mammalian Vav3 comparing wild type and in PTP1B-deficient mouse fibroblasts by quantitative phosphotyrosine proteomics. The tyrosines of the identified Paxillin and Vav phosphorylation site are conserved but not yet described as PTP1B target sites. The translation elongation factor EF1-alpha, the vacuolar protein sorting 4 homolog CG6842, the adaptor protein Dos, the GTPase Rab1, and Prosap are potential novel Ptp61F substrates with conserved tyrosine sites in human (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M800559-MCP200/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Fig. 10). The positive regulator of Stat92E-dependent signaling CG15784 and the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Tctp are novel potential substrates where either the protein or the detected regulated phosphorylation site is not conserved in human.</p><p>Our approach is designed to measure systems-wide effects of pathway perturbation in an unbiased way, rather than to discriminate direct and indirect actions of the phosphatase. In addition to up-regulation of direct targets, changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation levels can also be due to activation of substrate tyrosine kinases. Illustrating this point, we found the direct target Abl with increased phosphorylation on Tyr-540 within the activation loop and on Tyr-1515 within a potential autophosphorylation sequence at the C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). The activation loop phosphorylation of Abl has been detected in oncogenic Abl kinases <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), and this is the first direct observation of endogenous activation at this site upon Ptp61F depletion. Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Abl in general and activation loop phosphorylation in particular increases its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Activated Abl propagates the effects of the Ptp61F RNAi to a second layer of effector molecules. Several proteins with up-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation in our experiment are known to be phosphorylated by Bcr-Abl or c-Abl in human cell lines. These include Paxillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) and Vav1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).</p><p>Abi is an interesting example because its phosphorylation is regulated by both Abl and Ptp61F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Thus its increased phosphorylation upon Ptp61F RNAi is the combined effect of increased Abl activity and depleted phosphatase. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> screen shows that the net effect is a 1.5-fold up-regulation of Tyr-248. Similarly, the up-regulation of Paxillin and Vav phosphorylation sites, in our experiment could reflect the separate or combined action of Abl and Ptp61F. Since mammalian Paxillin was also identified in a PTP1B substrate assay experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) a dual action of Abl and Ptp61F on Paxillin is likely.</p><p>With regards to the up-regulation of several metabolic enzymes at the protein level, it is interesting that Bcr-Abl signaling has been linked to up-regulation of phosphofructokinase expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Furthermore, Bcr-Abl signaling activates c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>), possibly providing the mechanism for increased threonine phosphorylation on the fly homolog dJun within the transactivation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, we detected 101 up- and 115 down-regulated phosphorylation sites upon Ptp61F RNAi (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M800559-MCP200/DC1">supplemental</ext-link> Table 7), emphasizing the broad effects of the phosphatase on the phosphoproteome. There are a number of serine/threonine kinases whose phosphorylation level is altered such as Fray (1.6-fold up) and MEKK-1 (1.3-fold up), which although not all passing our threshold for significance could be the mechanistic link to these broad effects. Note that phosphorylation of a kinase can either enhance or inhibit its activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we have, for the first time, combined quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics to study the effects of perturbing phosphorylation-dependent signaling network by ablating one of its components. This approach differs from &#x0201c;chemical proteomics&#x0201d; involving ATP-based enrichment or classical <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches in that it measures the net effect of the perturbation on the signaling network and the expressed proteome in a completely generic and hypothesis-free approach. Effects on the phosphorylation pattern are captured at the quantitative phosphoproteomics level, whereas resulting gene expression changes are measured by quantitative proteomics. These effects are both upstream and downstream of the intermediate output measured by mRNA-based technologies.</p><p>We also introduced the concept of parallel acquisition of a proteome and a phosphoproteome for the system-wide analysis of a perturbed system. This is generally necessary in perturbations that last longer than the time required for protein expression changes (generally 20&#x02013;30 min) because it enables assigning changes to the stoichiometry of the phosphorylation site (phosphorylation change relative to protein amount) and the absolute phosphorylation changes resulting from a protein expression change. Biologically, the total amount of phosphorylation, the relative fraction of phosphorylation, or both, may be important.</p><p>We chose to ablate the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila</named-content> homolog of a disease relevant phosphotyrosine phosphatase, Ptp61F by RNAi. The detected potential substrates were enriched for the categories cytoskeleton regulation and adhesion signaling and thus our data further support and expand a role of Ptp61F in these processes. Our results show a limited effect of the Ptp61F RNAi on the proteome in contrast to a pronounced effect on the phosphoproteome. This indicates that the phosphatase predominantly affects phosphorylation-mediated signaling rather than downstream gene expression. Therefore a microarray experiment may not have been efficient at defining the most pertinent effects of this phosphatase knock-down.</p><p>Our proof of principle study clearly demonstrates the power of combined quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics to study system-wide effects of signaling network perturbation. With increasing throughput and automation of MS, signaling networks could routinely be probed in this way. Although we used RNAi, other obvious perturbations include gene knock-outs of kinases and phosphatases as well as small molecule inhibitors.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Juergen Cox and Nadin Neuhauser helped in the analysis of large-scale datasets, and Jesper Olsen advised on the phosphoproteome acquisition.
