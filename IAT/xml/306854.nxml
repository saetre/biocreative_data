The 2462 bp cDNA for this gene contains a large open reading frame (ORF) encoding 685 amino acids with predicted M(r) = 77,507 Da. The protein sequence has approximately 60% identity with B. mori GlyRS and 45% identity with S. cerevisiae GlyRS and contains motifs 2 and 3 characteristic of Class II tRNA synthetases. A second ORF encoding 47 amino acids is found upstream of the large ORF. Translation of this ORF may precede the expression of GlyRS as a possible regulatory mechanism. The enzyme was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with a 13 kDa biotinylated tag with an apparent M(r) = 90 kDa. The fusion protein was immunoprecipitated from crude bacterial extract with human EJ serum, which contains autoantibodies directed against GlyRS, and with rabbit polyclonal serum raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted amino acid sequence of human GlyRS. Bacterial extract containing the fusion protein catalyses the aminoacylation of bovine tRNA with [14C]-gly at 10-fold increased level above normal bacterial extract and confirms that the cDNA encodes human GlyRS.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00008-0038-a" xlink:role="1308"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00008-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1307"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00008-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1308"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00008-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1309"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00008-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1310"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
