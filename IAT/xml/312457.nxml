In somatic cells, the pim-1 gene is expressed as a 2.8 kb transcript while a shorter sized transcript (2.3 kb) is expressed in rat testes. We have determined that the shorter testes-specific pim-1 transcript arises through the use of an alternate polyadenylation signal present in the 3' untranslated region of the gene. This alternate polyadenylation event results in the removal of an A/U-rich regulatory element located in the 3' untranslated region of the pim-1 gene. This A/U-rich motif has been shown by a number of laboratories to destabilize the transcripts of genes that contain this sequence. Consistent with these findings, we have demonstrated that the shortened testes-specific pim-1 transcript is more stable than the longer A/U-rich containing somatic transcript. We suggest that the functional significance of different sized pim-1 transcripts may be directly related to their different stabilities and that the greater stability of the testes-specific transcript may be essential for the translational delay observed in post-meiotic male germ cells.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00086-0244-a" xlink:role="3186"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00086-0245-a" xlink:role="3187"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00086-0245-b" xlink:role="3187"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00086-0241.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3183"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00086-0242.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3184"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00086-0243.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3185"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00086-0244.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3186"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00086-0245.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3187"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00086-0246.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3188"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00086-0247.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3189"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
