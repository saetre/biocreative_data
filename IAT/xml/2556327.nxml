The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, which are predisposed to develop the disease, have served as a model for studying the mechanism, pathogenesis and interventions of the human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In NOD mice, a unique major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II allele (IA<sup>g7</sup>) in combination with a defect in the programmed cell death pathway is thought to permit autoreactive T cells to escape negative selection in the thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the periphery, additional defects in peripheral tolerance mechanisms enable activation of the autoreactive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], leading to the disease development.</p><p>Besides development and activation of autoreactive T cells, factors that regulate T cell trafficking likely contribute to the disease development because destruction of &#x003b2;-cells requires infiltration of autoreactive T cells into the islets. Chemokines are a group of low molecular weight proteins and regulate cell trafficking by binding to specific G-protein-coupled seven-span transmembrane receptors on target cells. For example, CXCL12, also known as stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and its receptor CXCR4 play a critical role in regulating hematopoietic cell trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is required for fetal liver-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to colonize the bone marrow during embrogenesis and retention/homing of these cells in the bone marrow in the adult. It also regulates trafficking of many other cell types that express CXCR4, including lymphocytes and cancer stem cells. In humans, polymorphisms in CXCL12 gene are linked to TID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In NOD mice, the onset of diabetes is significantly delayed by reducing the level of CXCL12 either by antibody-mediated neutralization or G-CSF-induced suppression of CXCL12 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Despite these initial observations, however, how chemokine CXCL12 affects development of TID has not been fully investigated.</p><p>In this report, we show that expression of chemokine CXCL12 is elevated in the bone marrow of NOD mice, resulting in accumulation of both T cells and HSC in the bone marrow. Treatment of NOD mice with CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] mobilizes T cells from the bone marrow to peripheral lymphoid tissues, and significantly delays the onset of insulitis and diabetes. Our findings suggest that the elevated CXCL12 expression in the bone marrow likely promotes TID in NOD mice by altering T cell trafficking and stem cell mobilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Naive T cells accumulate in the bone marrow of NOD mice</title><p>Compared to age-matched Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice, prediabetic NOD mice (15&#x02013;16 week-old and no detectable urine glucose) had a significantly higher percentage of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells (~3-fold) in the bone marrow (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and data not shown). The increase was even more pronounced in diabetic NOD mice (23 week-old, urine glucose &#x02265; 500 mg/dl), reaching up to 15-fold of that in Balb/c mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Correspondingly, the number of CD4 T cells in the bone marrow of prediabetic NOD mice (0.86 &#x000b1; 0.38 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) was 3 times higher than that in the Balb/c bone marrow (0.29 &#x000b1; 0.16 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>), although both bone marrows had similar number of cells (41.6 &#x000b1; 11.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>versus 46.4 &#x000b1; 13.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>, p &#x0003c; 0.09) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In diabetic NOD mice, the percentages of CD4 T cells in the bone marrow increased with age (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and the increase was correlated with a decrease of CD4 T cell number in the spleen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).

Furthermore, in EA16 mice, which do not develop diabetes because the transgenic expression of an I-E molecule confers almost complete protection from insulitis of NOD mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the percentage of CD4 T cells in the bone marrow was significantly increased as compared to Balb/c mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>).

Distribution of CFSE-positive donor CD4 T cells in the recipients was assayed 2 hours following the transfer. No significant difference was detected in T cell distribution in the lymph nodes between Balb/c and NOD mice when either NOD or Balb/c T cells were transferred (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> right panel), demonstrating that T cells from Balb/c and NOD mice have equivalent motility. However, significantly more transferred Balb/c and NOD T cells were detected in the bone marrow of NOD than Balb/c mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> left panel). Forty-eight hours after the transfer, the difference between T cell distribution in the bone marrow of NOD and Balb/c recipients was even greater (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Therefore, enhanced recruitment likely contributes to the accumulation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells in the bone marrow of NOD mice. Because the enhanced recruitment is restricted to the bone marrow and independent of the source of the donor T cells, factors that mediate the preferential homing of na&#x000ef;ve T cells likely reside in the bone marrow of NOD mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Elevated CXCL12 expression promotes T cell recruitment to the bone marrow of NOD mice</title><p>To identify chemokines that mediate the observed preferential T cell homing, we compared chemokine transcription in the bone marrow between NOD and Balb/c mice using Mouse Chemokines &#x00026; Receptors Microarrays. Only chemokine CXCL12 and CCL19 transcripts were elevated in the bone marrow of NOD mice as compared to Balb/c mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the CXCL12 transcript was 3&#x02013;5 fold higher in the bone marrow of NOD than Balb/c mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), whereas the difference in the level of CCL19 transcript was not confirmed.

Thus, prediabetic NOD mice were given AMD3100 (5 mg/kg) daily for 8 days and the distribution and phenotype of T cells in their bone marrow were assayed. AMD3100 treatment significantly reduced the proportion of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the bone marrow of the prediabetic NOD mice as compared to prediabetic NOD mice that were given PBS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

To test whether continuous AMD3100 treatment can inhibit the development of diabetes, prediabetic NOD mice (15 weeks of age) were given AMD3100 daily for 14 weeks. PBS-treated NOD mice started to show evidence of diabetes at 16 weeks of age and by 29 weeks of age, all mice developed diabetes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). In contrast, none of the AMD3100-treated mice developed the disease during the same period. These results show that AMD3100 treatment inhibits leukocyte infiltration in the islets (insulitis) and continuous treatment delays development of overt diabetes.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>AMD3100 treatment inhibits leukocyte infiltration and development of diabetes in NOD mice</bold>.

CXCL12 specifically stimulates chemotaxis of cells that express CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The elevated CXCL12 levels are therefore expected to have a significant effect on recruitment and retention of CXCR4-expressing cells in the bone marrow of NOD mice. Based on analyses of young, prediabetic, diabetic NOD mice and EA16 mice, the phenotype of CXCR4-expressing T cells, the effect of AMD3100 treatment, and direct recruitment assay, our studies unequivocally demonstrate that the elevated CXCL12 expression results in recruitment and accumulation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells in the bone marrow of NOD mice. Because there is no difference in the proportion of T cells that express CXCR4 between NOD and Balb/c mice, and because Balb/c T cells are also preferentially recruited to the NOD bone marrow, the observed recruitment and accumulation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells in the bone marrow of NOD mice appears to be due solely to the elevated CXCL12 expression. In addition, our results show that the elevated CXCL12 expression also leads to the accumulation/retention of Tregs and HSC in the bone marrow.</p><p>What is the relationship between the elevated CXCL12 expression in the bone marrow and development of diabetes in NOD mice? The elevated CXCL12 expression is unlikely a consequence of inflammation or hyperglycemia associated with insulitis or diabetes in NOD mice because CXCL12 transcript was detected in the bone marrow of EA16 mice and young (4&#x02013;5 week old) NOD mice. More likely, NOD mice are predisposed to express elevated CXCL12 in the bone marrow. Conversely, because EA16 mice do not develop diabetes despite the elevated CXCL12 expression and accumulation of T cells in the bone marrow, the elevated CXCL12 expression alone is insufficient to initiate diabetes in the absence of autoreactive T cells. Nevertheless, the elevated CXCL12 expression likely promotes diabetes development. In humans, polymorphisms in CXCL12 gene are linked to susceptibility to TID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Using allele-specific transcript quantification in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, one study reported evidence that polymorphisms have a cis-acting effect on CXCL12 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, whether TID patients with specific CXCL12 polymorphisms have elevated CXCL12 expression has not been reported. In NOD mice, neutralization of CXCL12 by administration of antibody suppresses insulitis and delays the onset of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Similarly, administration of G-CSF, a cytokine known to induce suppression of CXCL12 transcription, also reduces insulitis and diabetes in NOD mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Consistent with these previous observations, we found that the elevated CXCL12 expression and its consequent effect on T cell trafficking are positively correlated with the disease progression in NOD mice. Complete Freund adjuvant (CFA), which is known to inhibit diabetes development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], also inhibits CXCL12 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and T cell accumulation in the bone marrow of NOD mice (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Finally, treatment of prediabetic NOD mice with AMD3100 abolishes T cell accumulation in the bone marrow and simultaneously inhibits disease development. Together, these findings strongly suggest that CXCL12 promotes development of diabetes in NOD mice and perhaps in humans.</p><p>Our findings also suggest potential mechanisms by which the elevated CXCL12 expression promotes disease progression in NOD mice. We found that the elevated CXCL12 expression leads to homing of na&#x000ef;ve T cells to the bone marrow. A recent study showed that diabetogenic T cells also preferentially home to the bone marrow of NOD mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], perhaps as a result of the elevated CXCL12 expression shown here. It is possible that accumulation of T cells in the bone marrow of NOD mice might lead to lymphopenia in the peripheral lymphoid organs and homeostatic proliferation and differentiation of autoreactive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], which in turn promotes diabetes development. It is also possible that elevated CXCL12 expression may promote disease progression in NOD mice through its effect on trafficking of autoreactive T cells, especially into islets. Studies have shown that CXCL12-CXCR4 interaction is required for recruitment of autoreactive T cells to rheumatoid arthritis synovium and the inflamed joint of collagen-induced arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In a virus-induced TID model, blockade of CXCL10 (IP-10) prevents diabetes development by impeding expansion of autoreactive T cells and their migration into the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We showed that inhibition of CXCR4 by AMD3100 significantly reduced insulitis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Although we did not detect any difference in CXCL12 expression in pancreas between prediabetic NOD mice and BALB/c mice (data not shown), dysregulation of lymphocyte trafficking is likely a significant contributing factor to the development of TID in NOD.</p><p>The elevated CXCL12 expression may promote disease progression in NOD mice through its effect on Treg trafficking, which is partly regulated by CXCL12-CXCR4 interaction. A large body of evidence suggests that Tregs play a critical role in suppressing autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In NOD mice, the frequency and function of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>Tregs were reported to decrease with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We show that more Tregs were present in the bone marrow of NOD mice than age-matched BALB/C mice. Following AMD3100 treatment of NOD mice, the number of Tregs was significantly decreased in the bone marrow whereas the number was significantly increased in the spleen (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). However, because the number of Tregs in the bone marrow is only about one tenth of that in the spleen, Treg mobilization from the bone marrow alone cannot account for the significant increase in Treg numbers in the spleen. Regardless where the splenic Tregs come from, because a threshold ratio of Tregs to autoreactive T cells is important for Treg suppression of autoreactive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], sequestering Tregs in the bone marrow or some other organs in NOD mice may tip the balance in favor of autoreactive T cells.</p><p>The elevated CXCL12 expression also leads to retention of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow of NOD mice. Because bone marrow-derived stem cells initiate pancreatic regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], it is possible that sequestering HSC and possibly other stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow might contribute to disease progression in NOD mice by limiting their availability for islet regeneration. In support of this notion, systemic administration of CXCL12 ameliorates diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], perhaps partly by mobilizing HSC from the bone marrow to the periphery. The same mechanism may partly explain the effectiveness of CFA plus adoptive transfer of splenocytes, which contain a significant number of HSC and probably other progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], in curing diabetic NOD mice through regeneration of islets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>AMD3100 was originally developed to treat HIV infection through its antagonism of the CXCR4, a co-receptor for the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Currently, it is being developed as an agent to mobilize HSC from bone marrow to peripheral blood for transplantation of stem cells in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or multiple myeloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We found that AMD3100 treatment of prediabetic NOD mice significantly delays insulitis and the onset of diabetes. In contrast, a recent study reported that AMD3100 treatment promotes diabetes development in a model where diabetes was induced by adoptive transfer of splenocytes from female NOD mice into sublethally irradiated male NOD mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In the transfer model, transferred T cells undergo homeostatic proliferation and acquire effector functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Irradiation of the recipient mice also introduces additional factors and processes which are not active in the non-irradiated prediabetic mice. Thus, the disease induction mechanisms in the transfer model could be significantly different from those in un-manipulated female NOD mice. Although the precise mechanism underlying the discrepancy between the two studies has yet to be determined, our finding provides a basis for further exploring the use of AMD3100 to prevent and/or treat TID and possibly other autoimmune diseases in patients with elevated CXCL12 or CXCR4 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Elevated CXCL12 expression in the bone marrow of NOD mice likely promotes development of TID by altering T cell and hematopoietic stem cell trafficking. The findings suggest the possibility of preventing and/or treating TID in humans by modulating either the expression or function of CXCL12 and CXCR4.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>NOD mice from Taconic Farms were bred in our facilities.
