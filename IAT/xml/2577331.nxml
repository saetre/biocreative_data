Here we demonstrate that overexpression of the SOS-inducible <italic>tisAB</italic> gene inhibits several SOS functions <italic>in vivo.</italic> Wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> overexpressing <italic>tisAB</italic> showed the same UV sensitivity as a <italic>lexA</italic> mutant carrying a noncleavable version of the LexA protein unable to induce the SOS response. Immunoblotting confirmed that <italic>tisAB</italic> overexpression leads to higher levels of LexA repressor and northern experiments demonstrated delayed and reduced induction of <italic>recA</italic> mRNA. In addition, induction of prophage <bold>&#x003bb;</bold> and UV-induced filamentation was inhibited by <italic>tisAB</italic> overexpression. The <italic>tisAB</italic> gene contains antisense sequences to the SOS-inducible <italic>dinD</italic> gene (16 nt) and the <italic>uxaA</italic> gene (20 nt), the latter encoding a dehydratase essential for galacturonate catabolism. Cleavage of <italic>uxaA</italic> mRNA at the antisense sequence was dependent on <italic>tisAB</italic> RNA expression. We showed that overexpression of <italic>tisAB</italic> is less able to confer UV sensitivity to the <italic>uxaA dinD</italic> double mutant as compared to wild-type, indicating that the <italic>dinD</italic> and <italic>uxaA</italic> transcripts modulate the anti-SOS response of <italic>tisAB.</italic> These data shed new light on the complexity of SOS regulation in which the <italic>uxaA</italic> gene could link sugar metabolism to the SOS response via antisense regulation of the <italic>tisAB</italic> gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Exposure of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to agents that damage DNA or interfere with DNA replication induces expression of a set of genes termed the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Many of the SOS-inducible genes encode proteins that are involved in DNA repair, recombination, DNA replication and cell division. If <italic>E. coli</italic> contains a &#x003bb; prophage, the lytic cycle of phage &#x003bb; is also induced as part of the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). RecA protein and the LexA repressor are the key regulators of SOS induction. Following DNA damage RecA and single-stranded DNA form a nucleoprotein filament, which catalyzes autocleavage of LexA repressor, leading to induction of more than 30 genes including <italic>recA</italic> and <italic>lexA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The kinetics of SOS induction in <italic>E. coli</italic>, measured by monitoring LexA cleavage after UV irradiation, is understood in great detail. The induction starts 1 min after UV irradiation, reaches a maximum after 4 min and stays fully induced for at least 20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Genes containing operators that bind LexA repressor weakly, such as the promoter of the <italic>uvrAB</italic> genes, are first to be turned on during SOS induction. As the level of LexA declines, genes with operators binding LexA more strongly, like <italic>recA</italic> and <italic>sulA</italic>, will be induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). This rapid induction of SOS functions reflects the need for increased capacity to tolerate and to repair DNA damage.</p><p>Less is known about how the SOS response is turned off. It is believed that repairing DNA damage removes or reduces the amount of RecA nucleoprotein filament leading to accumulation of uncleaved LexA repressor and repression of the SOS genes. Turning off the SOS response can also be an active process and several factors inhibiting SOS induction have been described. The plasmid encoded PsiB protein inhibits SOS induction during transfer of conjugative plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>), and overexpression of the chromosomally encoded DinI and RecX proteins directly interferes with the formation of the RecA nucleoprotein filament inhibiting LexA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the more than 30 genes under direct control of LexA repressor, the transcriptional level of more than 1000 genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> are affected by treatment with DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The translational levels of several proteins are also known to be upregulated by DNA damage in a LexA-independent but RecA-dependent manner. One such example is the Eda protein, the last enzyme in the Entner&#x02013;Doudoroff pathway, whose function is necessary for the recovery of respiration following the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>The SOS-inducible <italic>tisAB</italic> gene (synonym gene name <italic>ysdAB</italic>), was first described as an SOS-inducible transcript containing the two open reading frames YsdA and YsdB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), and later by mutational analysis shown to encode the toxin TisB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Recently it has been shown that <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of TisB is mediated by a shorter endonucleolytically processed <italic>tisAB</italic> transcript, termed +42 <italic>tisAB</italic>. Translation of +42tisAB RNA is initiated by upstream ribosome binding to a ribosome standby site and may involve sliding of the ribosome to a downstream translational initiation region. Binding of the sRNA <italic>istR-1</italic> to the ribosome standby site prevents loading of ribosomes and inhibits translation of +42 <italic>tisAB</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>In this article we describe how overexpression of plasmid encoded <italic>tisAB</italic> inhibits and slows down induction of the SOS response. In addition, we find that overexpression of <italic>tisAB</italic> is necessary for cleavage of the <italic>uxaA</italic> mRNA, encoding altronate dehydratase, an enzyme specific for feeding the sugar acid galacturonate into the Entner&#x02013;Doudoroff pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The presence of antisense sequences to <italic>uxaA</italic> and also to the SOS-inducible gene, <italic>dinD</italic>, suggests additional regulatory complexity in the <italic>tisAB</italic> function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids and media</title><p>The experiments were carried out in strains AB1157 (<italic>arg, his, leu, pro, thr, ara, gal, lac, mtl, xyl, thi, tsx, rpsL</italic>, <italic>supE and kdgK</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), MG1655 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), DM49 (<italic>lexA3</italic> derived from AB1157) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and ER2566 (<italic>lacZ::T7 gene1</italic>) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA).

The library was transformed into wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strain AB1157 and plated on media containing chloramphenicol, or chloramphenicol and 3 mM of the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS).

Unexpectedly, one plasmid clone, pBK410, was selected on the basis of conferring MMS sensitivity to AB1157. Sequencing of pBK410 revealed a 759-bp insert from the intergenic region between <italic>ilvBL-emrD</italic>.

The DM49 (<italic>lexA3</italic>) like UV sensitivity of wild-type AB1157 carrying pBK410 could be explained by a delay in SOS induction caused by higher levels of <italic>tisAB</italic>. We therefore tested the effect of <italic>tisAB</italic> overexpression on LexA repressor cleavage in UV irradiated cells. The level of LexA in protein extracts from strain AB1157 carrying either pBK410 or the cloning vector pKK232-8 were followed for 60 min after UV irradiation by immunoblotting with LexA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The level of uncleaved LexA repressor in unirradiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 2) is higher in AB1157 in the presence of pBK410 compared to AB1157 carrying only pKK232-8. A scan of the LexA immunoblot suggests that the level of LexA repressor in AB1157 is approximately twice the amount in cells carrying pBK410 compared to normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B suggest that in cells carrying pBK410 the amount of LexA repressor 5 min after irradiation is comparable to the basal level of LexA in unirradiated cells carrying only pKK232-8, indicating a 5-min delay of SOS induction due to <italic>tisAB</italic> overexpression. Both the kinetics of LexA degradation after UV irradiation and the accumulation of LexA 10&#x02013;20 min after UV irradiation appears to be parallel in cells carrying pBK410 compared to normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B), and indicates that only the endpoint levels of LexA is higher. Our immunoblotting experiments could not detect any differences in the amount of crossreacting (CR) proteins appearing on the western blot, suggesting that the effect from pBK410 is specific to LexA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The results demonstrate that the constitutive overexpression of <italic>tisAB</italic> from pBK410 elevates the level of LexA in uninduced AB1157 resulting in higher LexA levels throughout the induction period and a shorter phase of full induction. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Immunoblotting and quantitation of LexA repressor in AB1157 transformed with pKK232-8 (cloning vector) or pBK410 (<italic>tisAB</italic> overexpression).

An obvious candidate is the TisB peptide which has been reported to encode an SOS-inducible toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, our protein expression constructs containing the TisB or TisA reading frames under transcriptional control of an IPTG-inducible promoter failed to confer cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) or to produce detectable UV sensitivity to the host, as compared to plasmid pBK410 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Assuming that the TisB peptide is the component mediating inhibition of SOS functions, the lack of phenotype from pET28 constructs could simply be explained by a lack of TisB expression from this system. It has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> that TisB translation is effective only from the +42 transcript of <italic>tisAB</italic>, suggesting that the RNA structure and context could be important for TisB translation. In addition, our observation that the TisB1(M1I) mutation in pBK410 still confers considerable UV sensitivity to wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) suggests that the role of TisB translation <italic>in vivo</italic> needs to be further investigated. However, our data indicate that the actual function of the <italic>tisAB</italic> gene under normal levels of induction is not a toxin that kills cells under stress, but a function inhibiting or regulating activities important during SOS induction. Several steps in the sequential events leading to SOS induction could be affected by <italic>tisAB</italic>. Overexpression of <italic>tisAB</italic> could directly or indirectly affect the cleavage or binding properties of LexA repressor and &#x003bb; cI repressor leading to higher basal levels of the proteins. By example, a change in internal pH affects LexA affinity for operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The RecA filament or the RecA protein itself could be inhibited by <italic>tisAB</italic> overexpression analogous to the function of DinI and RecX proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The key to understand the target of <italic>tisAB</italic> appears to rest in how and if TisB is translated <italic>in vivo</italic> and the possible target and location of the protein.</p><p>The presence of antisense sequences to both the <italic>uxaA</italic> gene and the SOS-inducible <italic>dinD</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D) suggests additional complexity in the way <italic>tisAB</italic> mediates its anti-SOS effect and also the way <italic>tisAB</italic> itself is regulated. Typically, antisense RNA sequences affect RNA stability or translation of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We were able to demonstrate that <italic>tisAB</italic> expression affects processing of <italic>uxaA</italic> mRNA by mediating cleavage of the <italic>uxaA</italic> transcript, giving rise to a 300 nt cleavage fragment from the 3&#x02032;-end of <italic>uxaA</italic>. Since cleavage occurs in the coding region of <italic>uxaA</italic> it will result in inactivation of the <italic>uxaA</italic> mRNA, and possibly having a polar effect on the upstream <italic>uxaC</italic> on the same mRNA. The <italic>uxaA</italic> gene is specific for galacturonate catabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the UxaA enzyme (altronate dehydratase) mediates formation of 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate (KDG) from galacturonate which is further phosphorylated to a substrate for the Eda enzyme in the Entner&#x02013;Doudoroff pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The Eda enzyme is known to play a role in the SOS response, as the Eda protein is induced by DNA-damaging agents in an RecA-dependent manner, and it is hypothesized that Eda is necessary for recovery of respiration following the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We may speculate if overexpression of <italic>tisAB</italic> reduces the level of UxaA and the amount of KDG formed, thereby inhibiting the cells&#x02019; ability to recover respiration following SOS induction.</p><p>We also investigated the opposite possibility that <italic>uxaA</italic> mRNA via the <italic>uxaA</italic>/<italic>tisAB</italic> antisense region had a role in generating +42 <italic>tisAB</italic> RNA. In our hands the level of +42 <italic>tisAB</italic> RNA from UV exposed log phase cells were found to be below detection level in acrylamide northern experiments (data not shown). However, in agreement with Vogel <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) the +42 <italic>tisAB</italic> cleavage product was present in northern experiments with RNA obtained from stationary phase cells exposed to UV (data not shown). Further, wild-type and <italic>uxaA</italic> cells showed the same level + 42 <italic>tisAB</italic> RNA after UV exposure indicating that <italic>uxaA</italic> mRNA may not promote cleavage of <italic>tisAB</italic>. Nevertheless, these experiments are not excluding that <italic>uxaA</italic> modulate processing of <italic>tisAB</italic> RNA. In fact we may speculate if <italic>uxaA</italic> mRNA inhibit <italic>tisAB</italic> cleavage under growth conditions in which <italic>uxaA</italic> is upregulated to avoid an SOS inhibitory effect of the +42 <italic>tisAB</italic> transcript.</p><p>We were not able to demonstrate any <italic>tisAB</italic>-mediated degradation of <italic>dinD</italic> mRNA, similar to <italic>uxaA</italic> mRNA degradation. It is intriguing that <italic>tisAB</italic> and <italic>dinD</italic>, both being induced by the SOS response, has sequences with potential of mediating interaction between the two RNA transcripts. The DinD protein function is not known, the gene is dispensable for growth, and the only phenotype known of dinD is an <italic>recA</italic>-dependent cold sensitivity of the <italic>dinD</italic> mutation <italic>pcsA68</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). It should also be noted that SOS-mediated induction of &#x003b2;-galactosidase from the <italic>dinD2</italic>::Mud(Ap<sup>R</sup>,lac) mutant is delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), suggesting a possible role for DinD in SOS induction.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Norwegian Research Council (FUGE-CAMST); and the Anders Jahres Foundation for Medical Research.
