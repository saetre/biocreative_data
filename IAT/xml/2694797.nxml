The locomotory nervous system consists of several pairs of interneurons and three major classes of motor neurons, all with stereotypical patterns of connectivity that include gap junctions. Mutations in the two innexin genes <italic>unc-7 </italic>and <italic>unc-9 </italic>result in identical uncoordinated movement phenotypes, and their respective gene products were investigated for their contribution to electrical synapse connectivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>unc-7 </italic>encodes three innexin isoforms. Two of these, UNC-7S and UNC-7SR, are functionally equivalent and play an essential role in coordinated locomotion. UNC-7S and UNC-7SR are widely expressed and co-localize extensively with green fluorescent protein-tagged innexin UNC-9 in the ventral and dorsal nerve cords. A subset of UNC-7S/SR expression visualizes gap junctions formed between the AVB forward command interneurons and their B class motor neuron partners. Experiments indicate that expression of UNC-7S/SR in AVB and expression of UNC-9 in B motor neurons is necessary for these gap junctions to form. In <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte pairs, both UNC-7S and UNC-9 form homomeric gap junctions, and together they form heterotypic channels. <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte studies and co-localization studies in <italic>C. elegans </italic>suggest that UNC-7S and UNC-9 do not heteromerize in the same hemichannel, leading to the model that hemichannels in AVB:B motor neuron gap junctions are homomeric and heterotypic.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>UNC-7S and UNC-9 are widely expressed and contribute to a large number of the gap junctions identified in the locomotory nervous system. Proper AVB:B gap junction formation requires UNC-7S expression in AVB interneurons and UNC-9 expression in B motor neurons. More broadly, this illustrates that innexin identity is critical for electrical synapse specificity, but differential (compartmentalized) innexin expression cannot account for all of the specificity seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and other factors must influence the determination of synaptic partners.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Gap junctions mediate intercellular communication through diffusion of small (1 kDa) molecules. Single gap junction channels are formed from half channels (hemichannels) contributed by apposing cells. The six subunits forming a hemichannel may be homomeric or heteromeric, and the hemichannels in one channel may be identical (homotypic) or not (heterotypic). Until recently it was thought that all vertebrate gap junction subunits are connexins, and invertebrate gap junction proteins are innexins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although connexins and innexins share functional properties, they are likely unrelated evolutionarily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Members of a third protein family, the pannexins, were recently shown to form gap junction channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Pannexins are found in vertebrates and lower chordates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and share sufficient sequence similarity with innexins to be considered related. Individual connexin, innexin and pannexin proteins have all been shown to form gap junction channels with similar properties as assayed in paired <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]).</p><p>Previously we showed that the innexin <italic>unc-7 </italic>gene is essential for coordinated locomotion in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We are using <italic>unc-7 </italic>as a means to understand how electrical synapses are specifically established between cell partners. Electrical synapses are widespread in invertebrates and vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Approximately 600 electrical synapses and 5,000 chemical synapses were described in the reconstruction of the <italic>C. elegans </italic>non-pharyngeal nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although most neurons make electrical synapses, they do not form gap junctions with all available neighbors; little is known about how such selectivity is achieved. Because subunit composition can influence the docking between hemichannels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], it might be possible to pattern synaptic connections through selective expression of innexins, of which 25 exist in <italic>C. elegans </italic>(reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Alternatively, electrical synaptic specificity might be determined through other means, such as activity dependence.</p><p>A detailed model for coordinated locomotion provides a framework that makes <italic>C. elegans </italic>well suited for examining issues of synaptic target recognition and function (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). Changes in locomotion reflect the final output for tactic, avoidance, and mating behavior. Accumulated observations from serial electron micrographs (EMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], laser ablations of specific neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], localization of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and electrophysiological studies in the similar nervous system of <italic>Ascaris suum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] have contributed to this model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Ablation of the AVB interneuron pair results in a forward Unc (uncoordinated) phenotype. AVBs form gap junctions with target dorsal and ventral nerve cord excitatory B class (DB and VB) motor neurons. Ablation of AVA interneurons results in a backward Unc phenotype, and AVAs form both gap junctions and chemical synapses with excitatory A class (DA, VA, AS) motor neuron targets. D class motor neurons receive input from excitatory motor neurons in either the dorsal or ventral nerve cord and inhibit contralateral muscles. PVC and AVD interneurons are considered modulatory &#x02013; ablation of either interneuron pair alone has little effect on locomotion, but phenotypes are exacerbated if co-ablated with corresponding command interneurons (PVC with AVB, AVD with AVA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Motor neurons may form intra-class gap junctions or gap junctions to others in the same 'compartment' (forward, reverse, inhibitory), but they rarely form gap junctions with motor neurons of another compartment, though their processes lie in close proximity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>unc-7(e5) </italic>wiring defect and <italic>unc-7 </italic>point mutations</bold>.

Instead of propagating smooth sinusoidal waves they kink. Forward and backward movement are both affected, but the forward Unc phenotype is more severe. The cause of the Unc phenotype is unknown but could be due to loss of functional gap junctions or to extra ectopic gap junctions established between AVA interneurons and B motor neurons, noted in EM serial sections of an <italic>unc-7(e5) </italic>animal (White <italic>et al</italic>., personal communication, originally cited in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The related <italic>unc-9 </italic>innexin gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] has an Unc phenotype similar to that of <italic>unc-7</italic>, but no EM reconstruction data for <italic>unc-9 </italic>are available.</p><p>To gain an understanding of how electrical synapses specifically form between neurons, we are interested in determining which gap junctions identified in the reconstruction of the nervous system have UNC-7 as a component, which other innexins contribute to these junctions, what determines specificity for forming complete channels, and how these gap junctions function to direct information flow in the nervous system. We demonstrate that the formation of specific gap junctions between AVB and B motor neurons depends on interactions between <italic>unc-7 </italic>and <italic>unc-9 </italic>gene products, and that the expression of <italic>unc-7 </italic>and <italic>unc-9 </italic>influences formation of a large proportion of the gap junctions in the locomotory nervous system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>unc-7(e5) </italic>mutants lack functional gap junction channels</title><p>Since <italic>unc-7 </italic>encodes a gap junction protein, we presumed that the mutant Unc-7 uncoordinated phenotype reflects a loss of functional gap junction channels. However, partial EM reconstruction of an <italic>unc-7(e5) </italic>mutant revealed ectopic gap junctions formed between AVA interneurons that direct backward movement and B class motor neurons involved in forward movement. No other connectivity changes were noted. Therefore, part of the characterization of the Unc-7 phenotype involves understanding how ectopic gap junction channels arise in the absence of the UNC-7 innexin, and whether or not these ectopic neuronal connections contribute to the Unc phenotype.</p><p>Ectopic gap junctions might form if wild-type UNC-7 acts to restrict neuronal gap junction formation in some manner, or they could arise due to neomorphic or hypermorphic activity of a mutant UNC-7 protein that initiates formation of new gap junction connections. DNA sequencing of <italic>unc-7 </italic>mutants revealed that the molecular lesion associated with the <italic>unc-7(e5) </italic>allele is a premature stop (Q216*) in the first predicted extracellular loop (EL1) of UNC-7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). <italic>e5 </italic>therefore represents a probable null mutation, and ectopic gap junctions seen in <italic>unc-7(e5) </italic>animals are not the result of UNC-7 over-expression. A truncated <italic>e5 </italic>product might interfere with channel formation and mimic a loss of function mutation, but it seems unlikely that a product lacking extracellular domains could initiate formation of ectopic gap junctions. Therefore, we conclude that the appearance of ectopic gap junctions in <italic>unc-7 </italic>mutants is due to loss of the UNC-7 product, consistent with the recessive nature of the <italic>e5 </italic>allele.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><italic>unc-7 </italic>alleles</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Allele</td><td align="left">Mutagen</td><td align="left">Molecular lesion</td><td align="left">Phenotype</td><td align="left">Anti-UNC-7 staining pattern</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>e5</italic></td><td align="left">EMS</td><td align="left">Q216*(CAA&#x02192;TAA)</td><td align="left">Severe</td><td align="left">No staining</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>e42</italic></td><td align="left">EMS</td><td align="left">W498*(TGG&#x02192;TAG)</td><td align="left">Severe</td><td align="left">No staining</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>e65</italic></td><td align="left">EMS</td><td align="left">A177T (GCC&#x02192;ACC)</td><td align="left">Weak</td><td align="left">Wild-type staining</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>e133</italic></td><td align="left">EMS</td><td align="left">Undetected</td><td align="left">Moderate</td><td align="left">Strong nr, rvg; weak vnc, dnc</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>e139</italic></td><td align="left">EMS</td><td align="left">Undetected</td><td align="left">Moderate</td><td align="left">Strong nr, rvg; weak vnc, dnc</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>hs9</italic></td><td align="left">EMS</td><td align="left">P224L (CCG&#x02192;CTG)</td><td align="left">CS</td><td align="left">Weak signal, mostly cytoplasmic</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>hs10</italic></td><td align="left">EMS</td><td align="left">C238Y (TGC&#x02192;TAC)</td><td align="left">CS</td><td align="left">Wild-type staining</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>mn382</italic></td><td align="left">&#x003b3;-Ray</td><td align="left">Translocation; break point in intron 1</td><td align="left">Severe</td><td align="left">Strong nr, rvg; weak vnc, dnc</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>mn383</italic></td><td align="left">&#x003b3;-Ray</td><td align="left">6-kb deletion, intron 1</td><td align="left">Severe</td><td align="left">Strong nr, rvg; weak vnc, dnc</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>mn384</italic></td><td align="left">&#x003b3;-Ray</td><td align="left">2-kb insertion, intron 1</td><td align="left">Weak</td><td align="left">Wild-type staining</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>mn409</italic></td><td align="left">EMS</td><td align="left">P237L (CCA&#x02192;CTA)</td><td align="left">Severe</td><td align="left">Weak signal, mostly cytoplasmic</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>CS, cold-sensitive; dnc, dorsal nerve cord; nr, nerve ring; rvg, retrovesicular ganglion; vnc, ventral nerve cord.

If ectopic gap junctions are the sole cause of the Unc-7 phenotype, then laser ablation of AVAs should eliminate communication between these interneurons and the B motor neurons and restore normal forward locomotion; in conjunction with AVA ablation, animals should be backward Unc (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We targeted AVA interneurons for ablation in ten wild-type L1 stage animals. Eight animals displayed a severe backward Unc phenotype but were still capable of forward locomotion, confirming that AVAs had been properly ablated. The AVA interneurons in ten <italic>unc-7(e5</italic>) L1 animals were then targeted; none displayed improvement in forward locomotion, supporting the conclusion that ectopic AVA:B gap junctions are not the sole cause of the Unc-7 phenotype. Therefore, the Unc-7 locomotory defect reflects loss of <italic>unc-7 </italic>gap junction channel function, regardless of ectopic gap junction formation, and we sought to determine which gap junctions in the nervous system include UNC-7 as a component.</p></sec><sec><title>Two isoforms of UNC-7 rescue locomotion</title><p>UNC-7 [Swiss-Prot:<ext-link ext-link-type="sprot" xlink:href="Q03412">Q03412</ext-link>] is unusual in the innexin family in having a predicted amino terminus extending 120 amino acids upstream of the canonical innexin translational start site (M121; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

Using anti-GFP antibodies, two major protein bands, not present in wild-type, were detected in <italic>unc-7(e5) </italic>animals rescued with <italic>unc-7S::GFP </italic>+ F56B12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>). These bands approximated the sizes predicted for UNC-7S::GFP and UNC-7SR::GFP.

To determine if UNC-7L might have functional activity, we tried to eliminate expression of predicted UNC-7S and UNC-7SR isoforms. The <italic>Punc-7S </italic>promoter sequences in intron 3 were eliminated by substituting this region with <italic>unc-7 </italic>cDNA sequence from exons 2&#x02013;6 (<italic>unc-7-2cDNA6</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). This construct (plus F56B12) fully rescued <italic>unc-7(e5)</italic>, suggesting that either UNC-7L can rescue locomotion, or UNC-7SR is produced through internal translation initiating at M121. M121 was mutated to L in <italic>unc-7S&#x00394;1S</italic>; this construct (<italic>unc-7S&#x00394;1S-M121L</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>) plus F56B12 failed to rescue <italic>unc-7</italic>, suggesting that UNC-7L does not have rescuing activity. To demonstrate that mutation of M121 did not lead to loss of an essential protein function, exon 1S was added back to allow for expression of UNC-7S(M121L), and this construct (<italic>unc-7S-M121L</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>) fully rescued. Therefore, <italic>unc-7 </italic>locomotion defects can be rescued by either UNC-7S or UNC-7SR, but UNC-7L cannot substitute for this function (although it may have a subtle role or function in another process). Furthermore, it appears that UNC-7SR can be produced by internal translation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). We will refer to the predicted products of the <italic>unc-7 </italic>rescuing transcript as UNC-7S with the understanding that UNC-7SR is also translated.</p></sec><sec><title>UNC-7 is expressed throughout the nervous system</title><p>We used specific antibodies and GFP fusions to examine UNC-7 expression.

Typically, all three innexins were found to form homotypic channels with symmetrical gating properties in response to transjunctional voltage (V<sub>j</sub>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A&#x02013;C</xref>). The decay in junctional currents, even at high V<sub>j</sub>, is relatively slow, taking approximately 15 s to reach steady state. The initial conductances (G<sub>j0</sub>) for both UNC-7 isoforms increase slightly with V<sub>j </sub>of either polarity. This is in contrast to UNC-9, where G<sub>j0 </sub>decreases with V<sub>j </sub>of either polarity, indicating a rapid gating event that was not resolved by the current clamp. The slower gating response of these channels can be followed by plotting the steady state conductance (G<sub>j&#x0221e;</sub>) normalized to G<sub>j0 </sub>at the same voltage.

UNC-7S and UNC-7L each formed heterotypic channels with UNC-9, with asymmetric gating profiles that again were essentially indistinguishable from one another (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D, E</xref>). Given that the gating profile when the UNC-7S or L side is relatively negative (UNC-9 positive) is similar to that of homotypic UNC-7, and when UNC-9 is relatively negative the limited gating response resembles UNC-9 homotypic, we conclude that these members of the innexin family close the series gate on the negative side (this is the reverse of most, but not all, connexins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). However, it did appear that the hemichannels of all of the innexins studied here showed a higher sensitity to V<sub>j </sub>in the heterotypic conformation compared to the homotypic, as reflected in lower G<sub>min</sub>s and V<sub>0</sub>, and higher A values (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The asymmetry of the V<sub>j </sub>response of these UNC-7:UNC-9 heterotypic channels was not restricted to the steady state response of these cells, but also was seen in the rectifying nature of the initial conductance that increases as the UNC-9 cell becomes more positive. Such rectifying behavior has been reported for some connexins, and has been shown to arise from the pairing of two hemichannels with different ion selectivities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Based on these previous modeling studies, we would predict that UNC-9 channels are more cation selective than either of the UNC-7 isoforms.</p><p>The UNC-7 isoforms were also found to form heterotypic channels with one another (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F</xref>). These channels were more symmetric, but did show some differences, particularly in terms of the G<sub>min </sub>for each side and the rectification of G<sub>j0</sub>. We also tested more complex pairings by co-expressing multiple innexins within one cell. UNC-7S was expressed in one oocyte and equal amounts of UNC-7L and UNC-9 RNA were injected in the other. The channels showed a V<sub>j </sub>gating profile that was intermediate between UNC-7S:UNC-9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D</xref>) and UNC-7S:UNC-7L channels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F</xref>) in that the G<sub>j0 </sub>response was intermediate between those of UNC-7S:UNC-9 and UNC-7S:UNC-7L pairings, while the G<sub>j&#x0221e; </sub>was similar to the UNC-7S:UNC-7L pairing (see Boltzmann parameters in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). This could be interpreted as UNC-7L and UNC-9 forming heteromeric channels, with ion selectivity properties that are influenced by both isoforms (as this dictates the rectification of G<sub>j0</sub>), but V<sub>j </sub>gating properties dominated by UNC-7L (as this dictates the shape of the G<sub>j&#x0221e; </sub>plot). Alternatively, the data could also be consistent with a mixture of heterotypic pairings of UNC-7S hemichannels with homomeric UNC-7L or UNC-9 hemichannels, where pairings with UNC-7L are favored (explaining the dominant influence of UNC-7L on G<sub>j&#x0221e;</sub>). Even in the case of G<sub>j0</sub>, the response is somewhat more similar to an UNC-7 response than UNC-9, and thus is not inconsistent with this model.</p><p>The marked similarity between the voltage gating behavior of UNC-7S and L could indicate that the amino terminus has little effect on voltage gating of these channels, in stark contrast to what has been found for connexins (summarized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]); alternatively, it is possible that both <italic>unc-7 </italic>expression constructs might utilize the internal start site (M121) and similarly produce UNC-7SR. To test this possibility, UNC-7L(M121L) mRNA was transcribed from pCS2+. This mRNA, which should no longer generate the UNC-7SR product, failed to produce intercellular currents in oocytes, suggesting that the previously observed UNC-7L currents may reflect inclusion of UNC-7SR translation products. However, the asymmetry seen in the UNC-7S:UNC-7L pairings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F</xref>) may indicate that some of the full length translation product, while not capable of forming functional channels alone, could possibly combine with the shorter product and modify its gating. Results from SDS-PAGE analysis of <italic>in vitro </italic>translation products derived from UNC-7 mRNAs (in rabbit reticulocyte lysates) are consistent with this interpretation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>UNC-7L and UNC-7S fail to heteromerize with UNC-9::GFP</title><p>Studies in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte pairs could not provide a definitive resolution of whether UNC-7 and UNC-9 isoforms heteromerize, although it is clear that heterotypic interactions between all three isoforms studied here can and do form, even if some may be favored.

UNC-9::GFP was widely expressed in the ventral nerve cord as puncta, but UNC-7L was principally associated with cell bodies, and no co-localization was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10E</xref>). It therefore appears unlikely that UNC-9 heteromerizes with either UNC-7S or L isoforms. This result helps in the interpretation of the <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte studies, which now would suggest that UNC-7S in one cell would favor pairing heterotypically with UNC-7L over UNC-9 homomeric hemichannels expressed in the apposed cell. If this preferential pairing also worked in the opposite direction (that is, UNC-9 prefers to pair with UNC-9 over UNC-7 channels) this could explain why mis-expression or over-expression of UNC-9 in AVB (or other neurons) might interfere with UNC-7S localization to AVB:B motor neuron gap junctions. UNC-9 expressed in AVB cells might be expected to compete with, and displace, endogenous UNC-7S from these gap junctions.</p><p>These and previous results lead to the simple model that AVB:B motor neuron gap junction channels are homomeric and heterotypic, with hemichannels composed solely of UNC-7S provided by AVB and hemichannels composed solely of UNC-9 provided by the B motor neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>Model for composition of heterotypic AVB: B motor neuron gap junction channels</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-8104-4-16-11"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Function of AVB:B motor neuron gap junctions</title><p>Rescue of forward locomotion in <italic>unc-7 </italic>mutants coincided with localization of UNC-7S to AVB:B motor neuron gap junctions; an attractive model emerged that UNC-7S in AVB might rescue forward locomotion by docking with UNC-9 in B motor neurons, restoring functional gap junctions. <italic>Psra-11::unc-7S::gfp </italic>expressed in AVB did not rescue forward locomotion in <italic>e5 </italic>animals; the <italic>Pcex-1::unc-7s:gfp </italic>construct, expressed in AVA and AVD but not AVB, did, however, rescue <italic>e5 </italic>forward locomotion. Therefore, one common feature of heterologous promoter::UNC-7S fusions that rescued forward locomotion was expression in AVA. AVA interneurons are implicated primarily in reverse rather than forward locomotion. Could undetectably low levels of UNC-7S expression driven by heterologous promoters in AVB account for rescue? To address this, genetic mosaic analysis of rescue of forward locomotion by the <italic>unc-7S </italic>construct was carried out. Briefly, we screened for mosaic animals that had lost the rescuing array somewhere in the AB lineage (giving rise to virtually all the interneurons and motor neurons implicated in locomotion) but still showed good forward movement. Results were consistent with an AVA requirement for UNC-7S expression (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>), suggesting that the formation of AVB:B gap junctions alone is insufficient to rescue forward movement. Rescue of forward locomotion through AVA expression of UNC-7S may indicate some underlying plasticity to the neural circuitry instructing locomotion.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>UNC-7 and UNC-9 interactions</title><p>A major motivation for characterizing <italic>unc-7 </italic>and <italic>unc-9 </italic>was to investigate how specificity of gap junction formation between neurons might be achieved. Although numerous studies have provided insights into factors impacting neural process migration, there is little understanding of how neurons make their final target selection. Understanding how electrical synapses are established may relate to the general question of how neurons recognize their eventual targets.</p><p>In the ventral nerve cord of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, neurons of the locomotory nervous system form gap junctions with some neighbors but not others; the mechanisms regulating recognition and formation of gap junctions between synaptic partners are unknown. From numerous studies in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>paired oocyte system and various cell culture systems, a reasonable assumption might be that if two cells express the same connexin or innexin and lie in close membrane apposition, gap junctions will probably be established between them; this assumption has not been investigated rigorously <italic>in vivo</italic>. Reconstruction of the <italic>C. elegans </italic>nervous system by EM serial section showed that 92 of 104 motor neuron classes establish gap junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This assessment excludes any gap junctions that might be developmentally specific (for example, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). Although there are 25 innexin genes, only a subset of these are neuronally expressed. We sought to investigate if the scale of electrical synaptic specificity seen in the <italic>C. elegans </italic>nervous system could be explained through a model whereby gap junction formation between neighbors is restricted by the identity of expressed innexins.</p><p>Characterization of the <italic>unc-7 </italic>locus led to identification of multiple isoforms, offering the potential that isoforms could play different roles in determining synaptic specificity. Because <italic>unc-7 </italic>and <italic>unc-9 </italic>mutants are indistinguishable, it has long been thought that these genes may interact. The phenotype of <italic>unc-9 unc-7 </italic>double mutants is no more severe than either single mutant phenotype, consistent with the co-localization of UNC-9::GFP and UNC-7S. Experiments to dissect the nature of UNC-7 and UNC-9 interactions were governed by the complex nature of gap junctions, that is, a gap junction plaque may consist of hundreds of single channels, and co-localization of innexins might represent: individual homomeric channels coalesced in the same gap junction plaque; localization to different homomeric hemichannels in the same heterotypic channel; or heteromeric subunits in a single hemichannel. From the widespread and overlapping expression patterns of UNC-7S and UNC-9, it appeared likely that both of these innexins contribute subunits to most of the gap junctions in the locomotory nervous system.</p><p>Restricted expression of UNC-7S from the <italic>Punc-7S </italic>promoter allowed us to recognize AVB:B motor neuron gap junctions in live animals and has served as a useful tool for examining changes in synaptic connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Our present analysis leads us to propose a model that these gap junctions are heterotypic for UNC-7S and UNC-9. Phenotypic rescue is commonly used as a measure of wild-type function, and expression of UNC-7S on the AVB side of these junctions was coincident with rescue of forward locomotion. However, use of heterologous promoters and genetic mosaic analysis indicated that rescue can be effected by UNC-7S expression in AVA, and, therefore, locomotion rescue is not a reliable measure of functional reconstitution of AVB:B gap junctions; other means had to be employed to assess the innexin composition of these channels.</p><p>Using <italic>unc-9 </italic>mutants and heterologous promoters, we showed that expression of UNC-9 in B class motor neurons is necessary to rescue the localization of UNC-7S expressed in AVB. A reciprocal dependence for UNC-9::GFP expressed in B motor neurons on AVB-expressed UNC-7S was found. This was somewhat surprising given that both UNC-7S and UNC-9 can form homomeric channels in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes. Possibly in the respective mutant backgrounds homomeric channels may form but are not recognizable by our methods because they do not particularly stand out as brighter puncta offset from the ventral nerve cord near B cell bodies. If such is the case, it would suggest that the strength of electrical synapse (size and brightness of punctum) may be dependent on the proper composition and function of the gap junction channels formed between AVB and B motor neurons; little is known about what factors may regulate the size or positioning (cell soma or cell process) of gap junction plaques.</p><p>Although we found evidence that UNC-9 and UNC-7S are both expressed in AVB and B motor neurons, co-expression of UNC-7 isoforms and UNC-9 in the same cells showed little evidence of co-localization, and in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes showed little evidence of association, suggesting that these innexins do not heteromerize in the same hemichannel. We therefore favor the model as depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>. This does not rule out a possible contribution of other innexins to these channels, and candidates include INX-19::GFP in AVA and AVB and INX-1::GFP in motor neurons. However, UNC-7S::GFP was found to properly localize to AVB:B motor neuron gap junction plaques in <italic>nsy-5/inx-19(tm1896) </italic>loss-of-function mutant animals, and although INX-1 co-localizes extensively with UNC-9::GFP in body wall muscles, it does not co-localize with UNC-7::GFP or UNC-9::GFP in the nerve cords (data not shown). Recently, it was shown that the <italic>Drosophila </italic>innexins 2 and 3 interact through their carboxyl termini <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]; likewise, our GFP constructs suggest that the carboxyl terminus of innexins is necessary for localization into plaques, possibly due to an inability to oligomerize. Co-localization or binding studies would be useful to show whether other innexins might heteromerize with UNC-7S or UNC-9 and possibly contribute to AVB:B gap junctions.</p><p>Our analysis of gap junction formation focussed primarily on later larval stages and adults. At this stage animals are large enough such that the cell bodies of motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord are well spaced, making it less ambiguous in deciding if presumptive gap junction puncta are associated with a particular motor neuron. However, the locomotory nervous system undergoes significant changes late in the first larval stage, involving the wiring of emergent and the rewiring of extant motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Motor neurons at this stage appear to express at least four innexins, including <italic>inx-3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], <italic>unc-7</italic>, <italic>unc-9</italic>, and <italic>inx-1 </italic>(these studies). The relationship, if any, between these innexins and the rewiring involved is unknown. Understanding the relationship between UNC-7 and UNC-9 in establishing AVB:B motor neuron gap junctions found in later larval stages will provide a context for examining earlier developmental formation of electrical synapses.</p></sec><sec><title>Gap junction function</title><p>The heterotypic relationship between UNC-7S and UNC-9 can explain why <italic>unc-7 </italic>and <italic>unc-9 </italic>mutants share identical phenotypes; however, it is still uncertain which of the gap junctions they form are critical for locomotion. Because over- or mis-expression of UNC-7S driven by <italic>Punc-7S </italic>in interneurons rescues forward locomotion in <italic>e5 </italic>animals, it appears that any intra-class motor neuron junctions to which UNC-7 contributes may not be crucial for locomotion, or UNC-9 homotypic channels might compensate for the loss of UNC-7 in motor neurons. It is of interest to note that gap junctions between motor neurons have not been observed in the highly similar <italic>Ascaris </italic>locomotory nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>It was surprising that re-establishment of AVB:B motor neuron gap junctions was not implicated in the rescue of <italic>unc-7(e5) </italic>forward locomotion by <italic>unc-7S</italic>. Ablation of command interneurons by restricted expression of the human caspase ICE showed that even in the absence of interneuron input, worms can still move in a sinusoidal wave in a limited manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. A model has been proposed that control of locomotion in <italic>C. elegans </italic>can be regarded as a distributed bistable switch regulating the time durations worms move forward or backward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In such a model AVB:B gap junctions could play a role in maintaining the duration of forward locomotion or restricting the duration of backward locomotion; that is, AVB might be instructive to B class motor neurons or receptive to them. Here a comparison to <italic>Ascaris </italic>is of interest as well. Whereas in <italic>C. elegans </italic>forward locomotion is effected by a backwards propagating wave, <italic>Ascaris </italic>moves forward via forward-propagating waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Although the classes and arrangement of motor neurons in both species are virtually identical, there may be underlying changes in interneuron function that contribute to this difference. AVB gap junctions with B motor neurons may reflect at least part of this difference.</p><p>How the heterotypic nature of AVB:B motor neuron gap junction channels influences their function is unknown, but we found that in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes, UNC-7S:UNC-9 heterotypic channels are rectifying both in terms of gating and instantaneous current flow, a property not found for either homomeric channel. Without more detailed analyses of the properties of the AVB:B motor neuron synapse <italic>in vivo </italic>it is difficult to divine the potential significance of this rectifying behavior. Since gating is only seen when the UNC-7 cell is relatively hyperpolarized compared to the UNC-9 cell, this would ensure that the channels do not close when depolarizing impulses are passed from AVB to B motor neurons. However, the time constant of the gating of these channels is so slow that it is unlikely to be significant in the time frame of a neuronal impulse. The rectification of G<sub>j0 </sub>would appear to favor conduction of depolarizing potentials from the motor neuron to AVB, rather than the reverse, but again the degree of rectification is minimal enough that it may not play a major role physiologically.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrical synapse specificity</title><p>Most motor neurons in the locomotory nervous system appear to express both UNC-7 and UNC-9. Examination of innexin expression patterns ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and these studies) provided only a small number of other candidates that might contribute to specificity in the locomotory nervous system. Although the <italic>unc-7 </italic>locus encodes three isoforms that differ in their amino termini, two of these appear functionally equivalent, and the ability of UNC-7L to contribute to junctions is still uncertain. (It is possible that UNC-7L requires processing or association with another innexin to be incorporated into junctions, or has another function altogether.) Therefore, the simple model that gap junction synaptic specificity is determined strictly by differential expression of innexins unique to particular neuron classes seems untenable. Questions remain concerning why neurons that apparently express similar innexins (the different motor neuron classes) rarely form gap junctions with one another, if gap junctions are subject to constant formation and reformation in the nervous system, and why there appears to be a consistency in subcellular localization (soma versus process) of certain gap junctions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>How synaptic specificity is achieved is poorly understood. Innexins UNC-7 and UNC-9 contribute to a large number of electrical synapses in the <italic>C. elegans </italic>locomotory nervous system. Examination of specific gap junctions between AVB interneurons and B class motor neurons indicated that these junctions are likely composed of heterotypic UNC-7S:UNC-9 gap junction channels, and the formation of these junctions specifically requires UNC-7S expression in AVB and UNC-9 expression in B class motor neurons. Co-expression of UNC-7 and UNC-9 in the same cells does not lead to heteromerization, and it is likely that most of the co-localization seen between these innexins represents heterotypic channels. Although interactions between UNC-7S and UNC-9 are critical for effecting electrical synaptic specificity, differential innexin expression is inadequate to account for the entirety of specificity observed among the interneurons and motor neurons involved in locomotion, and other factors must be involved. The ability to recognize specific electrical synapses may allow investigation of the factors determining how neurons recognize and establish gap junctions with their synaptic partners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>Worms were cultured by standard techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].

We carried out a non-complementation screen for new alleles of <italic>unc-124 </italic>and identified four new mutations. All of these mutations mapped to the right of <italic>unc-3 </italic>(+21.3 cM) and were presumed to be new alleles of <italic>unc-7</italic>. A failure to identify new <italic>unc-124 </italic>alleles led us to sequence the <italic>unc-7 </italic>coding region cloned from <italic>unc-124(hs10</italic>) mutants (strain HH34), and a TGC to TAC change (C238Y) in the predicted second TM domain of UNC-7 was identified. Two other strains carrying the <italic>unc-124(hs10) </italic>mutation have been deposited with the <italic>C. elegans </italic>Genetic Center, and we sequenced the <italic>unc-7 </italic>region in HH123 <italic>unc-2(e55) unc-124(hs10) </italic>and HH132 <italic>dpy-8(e130) unc-124(hs10)</italic>; the same <italic>unc-7 </italic>mutation was identified in both strains.</p><p>To verify that <italic>hs10 </italic>mapped to the <italic>unc-7 </italic>locus, HH123 and HH132 hermaphrodites were crossed to N2 males, resultant cross-progeny hermaphrodites back-crossed to N2 males, and wild type and recombinant non-Dpy 'Unc-124' or non-Unc-2 'Unc-124' males grown and scored at 15&#x000b0;C. For <italic>++/unc-2 unc-124 </italic>crosses, 111 wild type and 58 non-Unc-2 Unc-124 males were counted, placing <italic>unc-2 </italic>34.3 cM from <italic>unc-124</italic>, which positions <italic>hs10 </italic>very close to <italic>unc-7 </italic>and quite distant from its original mapped location. For <italic>++/dpy-8 unc-124 </italic>crosses, 132 wild type and 41 non-Dpy Unc-124 males were counted, placing <italic>dpy-8 </italic>23.7 cM from <italic>hs10</italic>, and again positioning <italic>hs10 </italic>very close to <italic>unc-7</italic>.</p><p>Was it possible that the original HH34 strain was a double mutant that carried mutations in both <italic>unc-124 </italic>and <italic>unc-7</italic>?

Heterozygous non-Dpy non-Lin hermaphrodite cross progeny were grown at the restrictive temperature (15&#x000b0;C), and non-Dpy Lin segregants were identified and isolated. Broods from these animals grown at 15&#x000b0;C were later examined for the presence of any animals displaying a kinker (Unc-124-like) phenotype. In two separate experiments, a total of 29 non-Dpy Lin animals were isolated and none of them segregated any progeny displaying a kinker phenotype. We conclude that there is no Unc mutation that maps to the left of <italic>lin-2 </italic>in <italic>unc-124(hs10) </italic>strains currently held at the <italic>C. elegans </italic>Genetic Center, and that <italic>hs10 </italic>is an allele of <italic>unc-7</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic mosaics identify the AB lineage as the focus of action for <italic>unc-9</italic></title><p>Mosaic analysis of <italic>unc-9 </italic>followed the same strategy used for <italic>unc-7 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The genetic markers employed were used to distinguish early duplication losses from the founder cell AB (giving rise to nearly all non-pharyngeal neurons), or P<sub>1 </sub>(giving rise to the germ line as well as all but one of the 95 body wall muscle cells). Two different strains were used. SP800 was of genotype <italic>unc-93(e1500) III; unc-9(e101) unc-3(e151) sup-10 (mn219) osm-1(p808) X; mnDp3 (X, f) [unc-9(+) unc-3(+) sup-10(+) osm-1(+)]</italic>. <italic>unc-93(e1500) </italic>confers a gain-of-function rubberband phenotype that is suppressed by the recessive <italic>sup-10 (mn219) </italic>mutation. The focus of action of the <italic>e1500 </italic>rubberband phenotype is the body wall muscles &#x02013; when the <italic>sup-10(+) </italic>free duplication <italic>mnDp3 </italic>is present in body wall muscles, the animals have a rubberband phenotype due to <italic>unc-93</italic>. If in a rare mitotic event <italic>mnDp3 </italic>is lost in the lineage giving rise to body wall muscles, animals will be wild type due to recessive suppression by <italic>sup-10</italic>. <italic>unc-3 </italic>animals are severe Unc coilers, and <italic>unc-3 </italic>is epistatic to <italic>unc-9</italic>; the focus of action of <italic>unc-3 </italic>is widely distributed in the ABp lineage. The focus of action of <italic>osm-1 </italic>is in sensory neurons associated with amphids and phasmids that also derive from AB. We used SP800 to screen for rare non-Unc-3 non-Unc-93 non-Osm-1 animals. These animals are predicted to maintain <italic>mnDp3 </italic>in the AB lineage (non-Unc-3 and non-Osm-1 phenotypes) but will have lost <italic>mnDp3 </italic>in the P<sub>1 </sub>lineage (non-Unc-93 because loss of <italic>mnDp3 </italic>from body wall muscles allows the recessive <italic>sup-10 </italic>mutation to suppress <italic>unc-93</italic>). Further verification of the loss of <italic>mnDp3 </italic>from P<sub>1 </sub>is the absence of <italic>mnDp3 </italic>from any of the progeny (that is, all progeny are expected to be Unc-3 Osm-1 non-Unc-93). We screened approximately 10,000 animals and identified 7 hermaphrodites that were non-Unc-3 non-Unc-93 non-Osm-1 and gave rise to broods that showed only Unc-3 progeny (<italic>osm-1 </italic>was not scored in the broods). None of these seven animals displayed an Unc-9 phenotype, suggesting that the focus of action of <italic>unc-9 </italic>is not in the P1 derived lineage, and that <italic>mnDp3 </italic>maintained in the AB lineage of these animals rescued the <italic>unc-9 </italic>mutation.</p><p>The second strain employed was of genotype <italic>unc-9(e120) daf-6(e1377) sup-10(n983); mnDp3 [unc-9(+) daf-6(+) sup-10(+)]</italic>. The gain-of-function <italic>sup-10(n983) </italic>allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] confers a rubberband phenotype with focus of action in body wall muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]; the focus of action of <italic>daf-6 </italic>is in the amphid and phasmid sheath cells that derive from ABp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], and <italic>daf-6 </italic>animals are defective in the dye-filling (Dyf phenotype) of sensory neurons associated with these structures. This strain gives rise to wild-type (carrying <italic>mnDp3</italic>) and Unc-9 Rubberband (lacking <italic>mnDp3</italic>) progeny. If the <italic>unc-9 </italic>focus of action is derived from AB, we expected to find rare Unc-9 non-Rubberband animals arising from loss of <italic>mnDp3 </italic>only in the AB lineage. Such animals were expected to be non-Rubberband because <italic>mnDp3 </italic>complements the <italic>sup-10 </italic>mutation in the body wall muscles, dye-filling defective because of the ABp focus of <italic>daf-6</italic>, and to give rise to both wild-type and Unc Rubberband progeny because of maintenance of <italic>mnDp3 </italic>in the germline derived from P<sub>1 </sub>descendants. Of approximately 15,000 animals screened, 2 were identified that met the criteria of being Unc-9 non-Rubberband Dyf and giving rise to both wild-type and Unc Rubberband progeny. Additionally, six were identified as Unc-9 non-Rubberband non-Dyf, giving rise to both wild-type and Unc Rubberband progeny. Five of the latter were classified as exhibiting a weaker Unc-9 phenotype. We interpret the latter group as potentially representing losses of mnDp3 within the ABa lineage, or representing a more complex pattern of mosaicism within the ABp lineage that maintains mnDp3 in the amphid and phasmid sheath cells.</p><p>Although the focus of action of <italic>unc-9 </italic>cannot be precisely determined from these mosaic experiments, the results are consistent with the interpretation that loss of <italic>unc-9(+) </italic>function from the P<sub>1 </sub>lineage can be tolerated without apparent effects on locomotion, and that the loss of <italic>unc-9(+) </italic>function from within the AB lineage gives rise to the Unc-9 phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>cs: cold-sensitive; EM: electron micrograph; GFP: green fluorescent protein; RACE: rapid amplification of cDNA ends.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TAS carried out all experiments involving <italic>C. elegans </italic>and contributed to writing of the manuscript, IMS and JX carried out electrophysiology experiments in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes and JX contributed to writing of the manuscript, BJN participated in design and coordination of electrophysiological studies and contributed to writing of the manuscript, and JES participated in design and coordination of <italic>C. elegans </italic>experiments and contributed to writing of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional file 1</title><p><bold>Anti-UNC-7 staining of <italic>unc-7 </italic>mutants</bold>.
