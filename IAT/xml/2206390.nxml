However, little is known about its effect on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study, we investigated the effects of TauCl on synovial expression of MMPs. The effects of TauCl on MMP expression in IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were studied using the following techniques. Real-time PCR and semi-quantitative PCR were employed to analyze the mRNA expression of MMPs. ELISA was used to determine protein levels of MMPs. Western blot analyses were performed to analyze the mitogen-activated protein kinase and inhibitor of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B) kinase signalling pathways. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunohistochemistry were used to assess localization of transcription factors. IL-1&#x003b2; increased the transcriptional and translational levels of MMP-1 and MMP-13 in rheumatoid arthritis FLSs, whereas the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were unaffected. TauCl at a concentration of 400 to 600 &#x003bc;mol/l greatly inhibited the transcriptional and translational expression of MMP-13, but the expression of MMP-1 was significantly inhibited at 800 &#x003bc;mol/l. At a concentration of 600 &#x003bc;mol/l, TauCl did not significantly inhibit phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or I&#x003ba;B degradation in IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated rheumatoid arthritis FLSs. The degradation of I&#x003ba;B was significantly inhibited at a TauCl concentration of 800 &#x003bc;mol/l. The inhibitory effect of TauCl on I&#x003ba;B degradation was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunochemical staining for localization of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B. TauCl differentially inhibits the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-13, and inhibits expression of MMP-1 primarily through the inhibition of I&#x003ba;B degradation, whereas it inhibits expression of MMP-13 through signalling pathways other than the I&#x003ba;B pathway.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) include chronic proliferative synovitis, infiltration of inflammatory immune cell types into the synovial fluid of joints, and cartilage destruction. Proliferative fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) play crucial roles in both joint damage and propagation of inflammation because they produce many mediators of inflammation and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to cartilage degradation in joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Immune cells recruited into joint cavities by FLSs also contribute to progressive destruction of cartilage in distal joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Among the range of detrimental immune cells that are present in RA joints, neutrophils have been a primary focus of research in RA because of their number and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Once activated, neutrophils secrete various mediators, including MMPs and, in particular, the reactive oxygen intermediates nitric oxide and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, neutrophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>However, neutrophils also appear to possess homeostatic mechanisms that can reduce the inflammatory response. Activated neutrophils contain substantial quantities of taurine, which is one of the most abundant free intracellular amino acids present in mammalian tissues and blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Taurine acts as a scavenger of HOCl, which is produced by the myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/chloride system of activated neutrophils and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It reacts with HOCl to form taurine chloramine (TauCl). Notably, TauCl has been shown to play a major role in downregulating the expression of inflammatory mediators such as chemokines, cytokines, cyclo-oxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in various types of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Such inhibitory effects have also been demonstrated in animal models of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These inhibitory effects may stem from the suppressive effects of TauCl on expression of proinflammatory mediators (prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, nitric oxide, and cytokines) and bone erosion related enzymes, such as MMPs.</p><p>MMPs, which are primarily produced in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) in RA, are proteases that participate in irreparable proteolytic degradation and in the remodelling of the extracellular matrix. MMPs can be classified into five main groups, according to their substrate specificities, primary structures and cellular localizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]: collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13), gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), stromelysins (MMP-3 and MMP-10), matrilysins (MMP-7 and MMP-26) and membrane-bound membrane-type MMPs (MMP-14, MMP-15, MMP-16, MMP-17, MMP-24 and MMP-25). The MMP-1 and MMP-13 collagenases play dominant roles in RA and osteoarthritis because they are rate-limiting components of the collagen degradation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In particular, MMP-13 is a potent protease that is capable of degrading a wide range of collagenous and noncollagenous extracellular matrix macromolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. MMP-13 is remarkably active against collagen type II, which is the predominant collagen in cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To date, investigations of TauCl have focused on its inhibitory effects on the expression of proinflammatory mediators. However, despite the important roles played by MMPs in cartilage erosion, the effects of TauCl on expression of MMPs are not well understood. In this report we show that TauCl inhibits the increased expression of the MMP-1 and MMP-13 genes in IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated RA FLSs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Primary culture of fibroblast-like synoviocytes</title><p>After obtaining informed consent, synovial tissues were collected from RA patients who met the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of RA and who were undergoing therapeutic joint surgery.

IL-1&#x003b2; is also known to stimulate many proinflammatory mediators in a variety of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In addition, IL-1&#x003b2; is a potent inducer of metalloproteinase production by FLSs; however, little investigation has been conducted to determine its effects on the gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the present study, we found that IL-1&#x003b2; strongly stimulated the expression of collagenases (MMP-1 and MMP-13). Gelatinase expression was weakly activated by IL-1&#x003b2; stimulation. However, IL-1&#x003b2; is known to induce high levels of gelatinase expression in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2; activates different signalling pathways in different cell types. Thus, we investigated signalling pathways in IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated RA FLSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated the pathways of both MAPK (ERK, p38 and JNK) and I&#x003ba;B kinase within 30 min, with pathway activation subsiding to the basal levels of nonstimulated cells by 60 min. The activation of these pathways led to the activation of a number of transcriptional factors that enhance the expression of various proinflammatory mediators. Among these factors, NF-&#x003ba;B is a key regulator of inflammatory gene transcription, and it is known to be activated in RA synovia and chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>TauCl differentially inhibited the expression of MMPs in IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated RA FLSs. The expression of MMP-13 was significantly inhibited at concentrations of 400 to 600 &#x003bc;mol/l TauCl, whereas the expression of MMP-1 was not significantly inhibited at this concentration. To clarify the inhibitory mechanism of TauCl on MMPs, the levels of both MAPK phosphorylation and I&#x003ba;B degradation were investigated in IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated RA FLSs. TauCl did not significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK-1/2, p38, or JNK, even at 800 &#x003bc;mol/l, whereas I&#x003ba;B degradation was significantly inhibited at 800 &#x003bc;mol/l. These findings indicate that the inhibition of the I&#x003ba;B signalling pathways by TauCl was primarily dependent on the inhibition of I&#x003ba;B degradation. This finding is consistent with previous reports showing that TauCl modifies the backbone of I&#x003ba;B through amino acid oxidation of I&#x003ba;B, thus allowing I&#x003ba;B to become resistant to degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Confocal microscopic examination of the NF-&#x003ba;B immunostaining results indicated that a TauCl concentration of 800 &#x003bc;mol/l was required to inhibit I&#x003ba;B degradation completely. Partial inhibition of I&#x003ba;B degradation was seen at a TauCl concentration of 600 &#x003bc;mol/l, as reflected by NF-&#x003ba;B immunostaining in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This may indicate that signalling pathways other than the MAPK and I&#x003ba;B pathways are involved in the stimulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13. In support of this idea, protein kinase C&#x003b4; is known to play a key role in the stimulation of MMP-13 via crosstalk with MAPKs in basic fibroblast growth factor stimulated human adult articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. At concentrations lower than 800 &#x003bc;mol/l, TauCl may inhibit or block minor pathways that are involved in the upregulation of MMP-1 and MMP-13. At a critical concentration (600 to 800 &#x003bc;mol/l), I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation is completely inhibited, thereby preventing the migration of NF-&#x003ba;B into the nucleus.</p><p>TauCl is less toxic than its precursor HOCl/OCl<sup>-</sup>, but cytotoxic effects of TauCl at high concentrations have been reported. Its toxicity appears to differ between cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Kontny and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] reported that TauCl caused progressive necrosis of RA FLSs at concentrations of 500 &#x003bc;mol/l or greater. In our study, the RA FLSs used in the experiments were not significantly affected by a TauCl concentration of 800 &#x003bc;mol/l for 24 hours, even though cytotoxicity was detected in RA FLSs from some patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). TauCl toxicity appeared to vary between individual RA patients. In addition, different cell passages might have contributed to the variance in sensitivity to TauCl, because RA FLSs exhibit different characteristics according to passage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Although it remains uncertain whether the TauCl concentration used in this experiment can be a physiologic concentration, TauCl may remain at a high concentration in extracellular fluids because the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of taurine in mammalian tissues are 10 to 70 mmol/l and 20 to 100 &#x003bc;mol/l, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Effect of TauCl on the viability of RA FLSs.

An AG-rich element regulatory site was recently found in the human MMP-13 proximal promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This and other transcription factors may contribute to the increased expression of MMP-13 in IL-1&#x003b2; stimulated FLSs. The interaction of TauCl with these as yet unidentified factors remains unknown. Furthermore, these transcription factors may function at a TauCl concentration that inhibits the degradation of I&#x003ba;B.</p><p>The degree of the inhibitory effect of TauCl was compared with that of an NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor, namely MG132. At a concentration of 800 &#x003bc;mol/l, the inhibitory effect of TauCl on I&#x003ba;B degradation was as potent as that of 1 &#x003bc;mol/l MG132. Because MMP-13 exhibits the greatest activity toward the degradation of type II collagen, a major component of the cartilage extracellular matrix, the control of MMP-13 expression is crucial when attempting to delay the degradation of cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. At lower concentrations of TauCl, inhibition of MMP-13 expression would be a potentially effective strategy to control the destruction of joint cartilage in RA and osteoarthritis. Above all, TauCl may be produced as a part of the homeostatic response to infection and inflammation, thus playing a critical role in limiting the duration and intensity of immune inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].
