(Contour-clamped Homogeneous Electric Fields] into a series of 13 bands ranging from 0.1 Mb to over 2 Mb in size. Since this organism has only seven chromosomes (estimated to be 1-10 Mb), and -90 copies of an 88-kilobase linear ribosomal DNA molecule (14% of genome), it was apparent that not all of these bands were whole chromosomes. However these bands were reproducibly obtained with the cell preparation used. They fell into three categories: i) four large poorly resolved DNA molecules (-2 Mb in size) which represent very large fragments or intact chromosomes, ii) eight faint bands ranging from 0.1 Mb to 2 Mb, iii) a prominent band in the apparent size range of about 0.15 Mb. Cloned Fragment V of an EcoR1 digest of the ribosomal DNA, hybridized to the 0.15 Mb band indicating it contained the linear ribosomal DNA. This chromosomal banding pattern was used to examine the stability and location of vector DNA in 16 transformed strains of D. discoideum. Each transformed strain was initially selected on the basis of G418 resistance with an integrating vector containing pBR322 sequences. Eleven transformants still carried pBR322 sequences after more than 60 generations of growth without selection on G418. All four strains transformed with constructs containing regions of the D. discoideum plasmid Ddp1 had lost their pBR322 insert, indicating that integration of Dictyostelium plasmid DNA into chromosomes leads to instability. Orthogonal field electrophoresis of the eleven strains still carrying pBR322 sequences revealed at least seven different integrating sites for the transforming DNA. We conclude that these vectors have many possible sites of integration in the D. discoideum genome.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0151-a" xlink:role="4895"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0153-a" xlink:role="4897"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0154-a" xlink:role="4898"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4891"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4892"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4893"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4894"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4895"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4896"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4897"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0154.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4898"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4899"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4900"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4901"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00154-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4902"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
