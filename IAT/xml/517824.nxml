Rapid polymerization occurs in the absence of observable intermediates, and both targeted kinetic and direct single-molecule fluorescence measurements indicate that fibers grow by monomer addition. A three-step model (nucleation, monomer addition, and fiber fragmentation) accurately accounts for the distinctive kinetic features of amyloid formation, including weak concentration dependence, acceleration by agitation, and sigmoidal shape of the polymerization time course.

Amyloid formation is associated with a range of disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and the self-propagating nature of amyloids is thought to underlie prion inheritance.

Efforts to decipher the underlying mechanism of amyloid conversion have been greatly complicated by the near ubiquitous presence of smaller, oligomeric aggregates during fiber formation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Serio1">Serio et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Bitan1">Bitan et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Caughey1">Caughey and Lansbury 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Souillac1">Souillac et al. 2003</xref>). These oligomers vary widely in morphology, and include spherical, protofibrillar, and annular structures. A growing body of evidence suggests that certain oligomers may be the toxic species that gives rise to amyloid disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Caughey1">Caughey and Lansbury 2003</xref>). Furthermore, it remains an open question whether the fibers themselves are toxic, neutral, or even protective in some cases. However, despite great interest in these oligomers, it is unknown whether they are critical intermediates for amyloid formation or if fibers can form in their absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Goldberg1">Goldberg and Lansbury 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Ross1">Ross et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Scheibel1">Scheibel et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>The yeast prion state &#x0005b;<italic>PSI<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>&#x0005d;, which results from self-propagating aggregation of the translation termination factor Sup35 and leads to a nonsense suppression phenotype, provides an excellent system for studying amyloid fiber formation and prion propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Tuite1">Tuite and Cox 2003</xref>).

De novo NM polymerization is characterized by a long lag phase followed by a cooperative conversion into amyloid. The lag phase can be eliminated by addition of preformed NM fibers. Oligomers similar to those seen during polymerization of other amyloidogenic proteins have been observed during NM fiber formation and even have been seen localized proximal to fiber ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Serio1">Serio et al. 2000</xref>). The kinetic role of these oligomers, however, remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Scheibel1">Scheibel et al. 2004</xref>); for example, does amyloid growth occur by capture of oligomeric intermediates at fiber ends, as suggested in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Serio1">Serio et al. 2000</xref>)? Here we use a combination of kinetic studies designed to report on specific, well-defined steps in the polymerization reaction together with direct single-molecule fluorescence measurements to explore the mechanism of formation and growth of the infectious NM amyloids.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We first examined the distribution of oligomeric species present during NM amyloid formation using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Equilibrium AUC indicated the material was predominantly monomeric, giving fitted average molecular masses of 28.5 &#x000b1; 1.7 kDa (calculated monomer mass is 29.6 kDa), with no appreciable concentration dependence from 1.5 to 5.8 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g001">1</xref>B). By velocity AUC, which is better suited to resolve a small population of a larger oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Schuck2">Schuck et al. 2002</xref>), the vast majority of the material fit well to a single peak in a sedimentation coefficient distribution obtained by direct boundary modeling &#x0005b;c(s)&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Schuck2">Schuck et al. 2002</xref>) with a sedimentation coefficient of 1.9 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The lack of other detectable peaks is significant, as we were readily able to detect the presence of small amounts of a larger protein complex (10&#x00025; GroEL) added to an NM sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Thus, on the time scale of the 5&#x02013;20 h needed for the AUC analysis, which exceeds the polymerization reaction times in our present studies, the large majority of NM is monomeric. This has allowed us to examine fiber formation in the absence of significant off-pathway aggregation, which was seen to obscure the underlying kinetics of other amyloid systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Rhoades1">Rhoades et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Padrick1">Padrick and Miranker 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Souillac1">Souillac et al. 2003</xref>). However, our AUC data did not address whether a rare oligomeric species serves as a critical on-pathway intermediate for fiber growth.</p><p>To explore this possibility, we looked at the concentration dependence of the initial rate of growth of soluble NM onto the ends of a well-defined amount of preformed fibers. If a rare oligomer is critical for fiber growth, then mass action dictates that the quantity and rate of formation of such oligomers will be highly concentration dependent. As a consequence, the initial rate of polymerization should depend strongly on the concentration of soluble NM. Using a thioflavin T binding assay that allows continuous measurement of amyloid formation, we measured the rate of amyloid growth after mixing a quantity of soluble NM with a known amount of preformed nuclei. We found that the initial rate of fiber growth was directly proportional to the concentration of soluble NM over a range of 0&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). This linear dependence of fiber growth on NM concentration was not dependent on the method used to monitor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g002">2</xref>C). We also looked at the dependence of the polymerization rate on seed concentration. As expected, this rate was directly proportional to concentration of fiber ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g002">Figure 2</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g002">2</xref>F), and importantly, the rate was still linear up to a concentration of seed at which half of the soluble material was polymerized in less than 3 min. Therefore, NM in solution is in rapid equilibrium with conformations competent to add to fibers.</p><p>Interestingly, at higher NM concentrations (&#x0003e;10 &#x003bc;M), the rate of fiber elongation shows a weaker-than-linear dependence on NM concentration. Accumulation of off-pathway aggregates, which we can observe at high &#x0005b;NM&#x0005d;, could contribute to such an effect. However, in the presence of moderate levels of denaturant (100 mM guanidine hydrochloride &#x0005b;GuHCl&#x0005d; and 100 mM urea), NM remained monomeric up to at least 20 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), and under these conditions we still observed that the rate of polymerization becomes largely independent of the concentration of NM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). This suggests that a conformational rearrangement of NM after binding to fiber ends becomes rate limiting at high NM concentrations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). As would be expected if unconverted NM is occupying fiber ends, even at the highest NM levels the rate of polymerization remains linearly dependent on the amount of seed added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, inset). This conformational rearrangement may be analogous to the locking step observed in A&#x003b2; polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Esler1">Esler et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Cannon1">Cannon et al. 2004</xref>), although here it occurs on a faster time scale. Estimates from growth rates measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicate that the rearrangement occurs within &#x0223c;1 s (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), a time similar to that seen for the folding of comparably sized &#x003b2;-sheet&#x02013;rich proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Reid1">Reid et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>A model in which growth of NM fibers is largely limited by the encounter rate of monomer and fiber end still has two puzzling features of the polymerization process to explain. First, like many other amyloid formation reactions, NM polymerization is dramatically accelerated by agitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-DePace2">DePace et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Serio1">Serio et al. 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), which has been hypothesized to increase the fiber growth rate by breaking up off-pathway aggregates or speeding up diffusion of large on-pathway oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Serio1">Serio et al. 2000</xref>). Neither of these explanations applies to a predominantly monomeric solution where fibers grow by monomer addition. Previous attempts to understand agitation were complicated by the multistep nature of the polymerization process, which includes nucleation, growth, and other steps. We specifically looked at the effect of agitation on the fiber growth step using two identical seeded reactions, one agitated and one undisturbed. Remarkably, we found that seeded polymerizations initially proceeded at exactly the same rate with or without agitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). However, after extensive growth of the added seeds (&#x0223c;20 min) the rate of the agitated reaction began to accelerate markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, inset), whereas unagitated reactions slow down as the pool of monomeric NM becomes depleted.</p><p>At a given NM concentration the rate of polymerization is proportional to seed concentration, and therefore the acceleration seen in the agitated reaction implies that the number of fiber ends is increasing with time, perhaps due to the ability of agitation to fragment long fibers. To test this possibility, we prepared long fibers by allowing prolonged growth of NM onto preformed seeds in the absence of agitation, and then subjected the fibers to end-over-end rotation. Prior to rotation, the fibers were very long and had a weak ability to seed polymerization of monomeric NM. After 1 h of rotation, we saw many more fibers of much shorter length, and the seeding activity had increased 10-fold. Further rotation (14 h) produced still shorter fibers and higher seeding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g004">4</xref>D). Interestingly, a reanalysis of the kinetics of de novo NM polymerization, based on the fact that the rate of polymerization is linearly dependent on the amount of seed present and the amount of monomer remaining (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g002">Figure 2</xref>), indicates that the number of seeds increases exponentially during NM polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). Thus, while agitation does not affect the rate of NM addition to fiber ends, it accelerates polymerization by increasing the number of ends through amyloid fragmentation.</p><p>The second unusual feature of NM polymerization that must be reconciled with a model of monomer addition is the weak dependence (less than first order) of the length of the lag time on the concentration of NM in unseeded polymerizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-DePace2">DePace et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Serio1">Serio et al. 2000</xref>). This finding, together with the sigmoidal curve shape involving a pronounced lag phase followed by an abrupt increase in the rate of polymerization, provided key evidence against a simple nucleation-polymerization model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-DePace2">DePace et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Serio1">Serio et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Padrick1">Padrick and Miranker 2002</xref>), which is characterized by an initially parabolic (t<sup>2</sup>) time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Ferrone1">Ferrone 1999</xref>). We similarly observed a lag phase that depends on approximately the 0.4 power of initial concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g005">5</xref>B). In other systems, this weak concentration dependence has been attributed to an accumulation of large off-pathway species whose formation is competitive with on-pathway processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Rhoades1">Rhoades et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Serio1">Serio et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Padrick1">Padrick and Miranker 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Souillac1">Souillac et al. 2003</xref>). However, in our experiments NM is predominantly monomeric, so the observed weak concentration dependence is not a simple consequence of the accumulation of off-pathway aggregates.</p><p>Previous work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Ferrone1">Ferrone (1999)</xref> using a linearized model demonstrated that addition of fragmentation to a nucleation-polymerization process could lead to sigmoidal polymerization curves. We explored whether fragmentation could also explain the weak concentration dependence using both numerical integration and direct fitting of the data to a linearized model. We modeled a simple polymerization process involving nucleation, growth, and fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Numerical integration confirmed the expected strongly sigmoidal curve shape, but we also found that fragmentation greatly reduced the concentration dependence. For example, a nucleus size (the number of monomers in the smallest stable amyloid species) of six gives a third-order concentration dependence in nucleated polymerization but only approximately a first-order dependence with fragmentation, and the apparent concentration dependence decreases further for smaller nucleus sizes. We additionally tried fitting data to the linearized analytical solution which is valid for early parts of the polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Ferrone1">Ferrone 1999</xref>; we restrict ourselves to the first 3&#x00025;) and only requires fitting two parameters. Fixing nucleus size and fitting polymerization curves at seven concentrations, we obtained residuals of fits at a series of potential nucleus sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Although more direct measurements are needed to define the exact size of the minimal stable seed, both approaches suggest a small nucleus size (three monomers or smaller), consistent with recent observations on polyglutamine polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Chen1">Chen et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>The advent of single-molecule fluorescence technology enabled an independent and more direct way to test whether fibers grow by monomer addition. Previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Inoue1">Inoue et al. 2001</xref>) established that fluorescent NM fibers attached to a microscope slide could be grown and visualized using epifluorescence. Here we examined fiber growth using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF), which allows single-molecule detection. We attached Cy5-labeled NM fibers to a slide through a biotin-streptavidin linkage and added a solution of Cy3-labeled soluble NM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Working at a label concentration of 133 nM (200 nM or more total soluble NM) to minimize background fluorescence, we could readily detect addition of individual Cy3 fluorophores at the ends of Cy5-labeled fibers. Two observations indicate that we were monitoring growth events mediated by fiber ends. First, after extended time (&#x0223c;1 h) at our working concentration, bright Cy3 fluorescence (consisting of many labeled NM molecules) accumulated specifically at fiber ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Second, Cy3 addition events at fiber ends were long lived (55&#x00025; of spots at fiber ends remained visible in the second frame measured 15 s later, whereas in the absence of fiber ends fewer than 20&#x00025; of spots remained).</p><p>By following the intensities of single fluorescent addition events, we could directly determine the size of the unit of addition. Oligomer addition (unlike monomer addition) predicts that the fluorescence intensity of a single addition event should depend strongly on the fraction of NM that is fluorescently labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). We prepared NM at both 67&#x00025; (133 nM label, 200 nM total soluble NM) and 9&#x00025; (89 nM label, 966 nM total soluble NM) labeling efficiency. Intensities of Cy3 spots that appeared at fiber ends were then measured, and for each degree of labeling, a histogram of intensities was created. Strikingly, we observed that the distribution of intensities was independent of the degree of labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). Furthermore, the intensity distribution of the fiber addition events was comparable to that of NM-Cy3, which was confirmed to be monomeric by single-step photobleaching experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020321-g006">Figure 6</xref>E). Together these data establish that amyloid growth is occurring by the addition of NM monomers onto fiber ends.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Amyloid formation is a ubiquitous feature of polypeptides. However, compared to protein folding reactions, for which a wide range of biophysical, structural, and analytical approaches have provided detailed information on the pathways by which native states are obtained, very little is known about the underlying steps by which amyloid fibers assemble and grow. In large part this is due to the complexity of the amyloid formation reaction, which can involve a wide spectrum of on- and off-pathway intermediates. In the present study, we have used a combination of kinetic analysis designed to look at specific mechanistic steps and single-molecule fluorescence to determine how amyloid fibers of Sup35, the prion determinant of the yeast state &#x0005b;<italic>PSI<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>&#x0005d;, form and grow.</p><p>A key finding is that Sup35 NM amyloids grow efficiently by the addition of monomers to fiber ends. We also establish that monomer addition, in combination with fiber fragmentation, accurately predicts the otherwise puzzling features of de novo polymerization kinetics.

Additionally, with approximately 200 seeds in a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Cox1">Cox et al. 2003</xref>) and the second-order rate constant we observe (approximately 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), soluble Sup35 would have a half-life of about 3 min, which is comparable to the time scale of Sup35 translation and much faster than the doubling time of yeast (90 min). Thus, the monomer growth mechanism would lead to the depletion of Sup35 characteristic of the &#x0005b;<italic>PSI<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>&#x0005d; state (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Moreover, the properties of Sup35 polymerization we observe seem particularly well suited to explain the prion phenotype in yeast. De novo nucleation of new fibers is extremely slow, but existing fibers grow rapidly and their fragility may allow them to be divided easily.

Whether other amyloids do in fact grow by monomer addition and how the role of oligomeric species in the polymerization process correlates with toxicity remain important open questions. Many of the analytical approaches and experimental techniques used in this work should be directly applicable for exploring these issues in other systems. A broader understanding of the role of oligomeric species in the formation and growth of amyloids will be critical for determining the physiological effects of amyloidogenesis as well as guiding efforts to counteract amyloid toxicity. For example, the conclusion that amyloid growth and oligomer formation can occur in distinct, competitive reactions may help explain the poor correlation between formation of visible aggregates and toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases of protein misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Saudou1">Saudou et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Cummings1">Cummings et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Goldberg1">Goldberg and Lansbury 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Wittmann1">Wittmann et al. 2001</xref>). More speculatively, the finding that fiber growth does not require oligomeric intermediates raises the possibility that agents designed to promote direct fiber formation, by disfavoring oligomer formation, may help prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic oligomeric intermediates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Cy3 mono maleimide Gold and Cy5 mono maleimide Gold were purchased from Amersham (Little Chalfont, United Kingdom).

The following is a general description of the strategy used for numerical modeling. A set of differential equations was written to account for the following steps: formation of a new stable nucleus from a defined number (n) of monomers, growth of fibers by monomer addition (limited by the rate of encounter of monomer and fiber end), and production of new fibers by fragmentation of existing fibers. Fiber growth was modeled to be irreversible (i.e., fibers do not depolymerize) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-DePace1">DePace and Weissman 2002</xref>), because experimentally the critical concentration for growth appeared to be very small (less than 50 nM), if one exists. Fragmentation was modeled as a length-dependent process (long fibers break more easily than short fibers), and to simplify calculations, it was assumed that no fiber breaks to yield a fragment as small or smaller than the size of the smallest stable nucleus. This is likely to be true for the large majority of fragmentation events because of the tendency of fibers to break closer to their center rather than their ends and because of the low propensity of short fibers to break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020321-Hill1">Hill 1983</xref>). Concentrations of monomers and fibers of each length from n to 3,016 monomers were modeled as a function of time. An upper bound for fiber length was necessary to make the calculations possible, and the total of 3,016 was chosen because increasing this bound had no measurable impact on results.</p><p>Variables and parameters used for modeling were the following: <italic>t</italic> &#x0003d; time; <italic>x</italic> &#x0003d; concentration of monomers; <italic>y</italic><sub>i</sub> &#x0003d; concentration of fibers containing i monomers; <italic>y</italic> &#x0003d; concentration of all fibers of length n or greater; n &#x0003d; the number of monomers in the smallest stable species; BreakDep &#x0003d; the power to which the rate of fragmentation of a fiber depends on its length.
