Mutations in the helicase domain perturb accumulation of diverse RNA classes, and Sen1p has been implicated in 3&#x02032; end formation of non-coding RNAs. Using a combination of global and candidate-specific two hybrid screens, eight proteins were identified that interact with Sen1p. Interactions with three of the proteins were analyzed further: Rpo21p(Rpb1p), a subunit of RNA polymerase II, Rad2p, a deoxyribonuclease required in DNA repair, and Rnt1p (RNase III), an endoribonuclease required for RNA maturation. For all three interactions, the two-hybrid results were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Genetic tests designed to assess the biological significance of the interactions indicate that Sen1p plays functionally significant roles in transcription and transcription-coupled DNA repair. To investigate the potential role of Sen1p in RNA processing and to assess the functional significance of the Sen1p/Rnt1p interaction, we examined U5 snRNA biogenesis. We provide evidence that Sen1p functions in concert with Rnt1p and the exosome at a late step in 3&#x02032; end formation of one of the two mature forms of U5 snRNA but not the other. The protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;RNA interactions reported here suggest that the DNA/RNA helicase activity of Sen1p is utilized for several different purposes in multiple gene expression pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic gene expression involves a complex interplay between proteins devoted to the synthesis of primary transcripts and those involved in transcript maturation including 5&#x02032; capping, splicing, transcription termination, 3&#x02032; end processing and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) export. Transcription is accomplished by a holoenzyme whose complexity is much greater than previously anticipated. The RNA polymerase II holoenzyme forms a cytologically visible &#x02018;transcriptosome&#x02019; several megadaltons in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c1">1</xref>) that interacts with multiple sub-complexes allowing for regulated coupling of transcription with the maturation of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c2">2</xref>).</p><p>Many of the proteins that are part of the transcriptosome associate with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, which corresponds to Rpb220p/Sua8p/Rpo21p/Rpb1p (referred to throughout as Rpo21p) in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c3">3</xref>). CTD-binding proteins include those of the Ser-Arg-rich (SR) protein family called CASPs (CTD-associated SR-like proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c3">3</xref>). These proteins form a bridge between the polymerase and RNA. We have been studying a yeast DNA/RNA helicase called Sen1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>) that has been shown by others to co-purify with evolutionarily conserved transcriptosomal components involved in polymerase-associated formation of the 5&#x02032; cap (Sto1p/Cbc1p/Cbp80p/Grc3p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c9">9</xref>), cleavage and polyadenylation of mRNAs (Dis2p/Cid1p/Glc7p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c11">11</xref>), capping and maturation of snRNAs and formation of snRNPs (Sto1p and Smd3p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c12">12</xref>), and nucleotide excision repair associated with transcription factor TFIIH (Rad1p/Lpb9p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c10">10</xref>). In this paper we show that one of the underlying bases for co-purification of Sen1p with transcriptosomal components is a physical interaction between Sen1p and the CTD of the Rpo21p subunit of RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, we show that Sen1p physically interacts with Rad2p, a single-strand endonuclease that acts during transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c14">14</xref>).</p><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Sen1p and its ortholog from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> are 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ATP-dependent helicases of the helicase I family, which can unwind both DNA and RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c15">15</xref>). Sen1p helicase activity is required for the expression of diverse classes of non-protein-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c16">16</xref>). In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, the <italic>SEN1</italic> gene codes for a 252 kDa protein that localizes to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c6">6</xref>) and is essential for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c4">4</xref>). Strains carrying the <italic>sen1-2</italic> allele, which lacks the first 975 N-terminal amino acids, but retains the ATP-helicase and nuclear localization domains, are viable but the growth rate is reduced. Also, the diffuse nuclear distribution of truncated sen1-2p differs from the granular nuclear distribution typical of wild-type Sen1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c6">6</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, genetic studies of temperature-sensitive mutations causing amino acid substitutions in the helicase domain of Sen1p indicate that loss of function causes altered accumulation of intron-containing tRNA precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c4">4</xref>), ribosomal RNA precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>) and 3&#x02032;-extended forms of some snoRNAs and snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c16">16</xref>), as well as mislocalization of core snoRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c6">6</xref>). A study of the snoRNA snR13 showed that impaired function of Sen1p causes aberrant forms of snR13 RNA to accumulate that have truncated 5&#x02032; ends and long 3&#x02032; ends extending beyond the site of normal transcription termination into the next adjacent gene on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>). Mutations in <italic>SEN1</italic> or <italic>NRD1</italic>, which codes for a CTD-binding SR protein, cause transcription termination read-through for some snoRNA transcripts, including snR13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c17">17</xref>).</p><p>In addition to physical interactions with Rpo21p and Rad2p, we show in this report that Sen1p interacts with Rnt1p (RNase III), an endonuclease involved in 3&#x02032; end processing of snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c19">19</xref>), snoRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c21">21</xref>) and pre-rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c23">23</xref>). The relationship between Sen1p and Rnt1p was investigated by examining the maturation pathway for U5 snRNA as a paradigm for how Sen1p might function in snRNA 3&#x02032; end formation.

RNAs (10 &#x000b5;g) were fractionated on 6&#x00025; polyacrylamide (29:1), 8 M urea gel and transferred to GeneScreen Plus (DuPont, Inc.) using a BioRad Trans Blot Cell (Hercules, Inc.).

The C-terminal half of 2231 amino acid Sen1p contains the conserved ATP-helicase domain. This region was excluded in the two-hybrid screen, limiting the proteins recovered to those that bind to the first 975 amino acids, which was used as the bait (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>Approximately 500 000 colonies from Library C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c25">25</xref>) were screened for the ability of fusion proteins to activate <italic>ADE2</italic> and <italic>HIS3</italic> reporters, which confer growth in the absence of exogenous adenine or histidine, respectively. Eighteen clones that gave rise to colonies in the initial screen were verified by DNA sequence analysis and retesting to express fusion proteins that interact with Sen1p(1&#x02013;975). These clones corresponded to segments from seven different genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh561tb1">1</xref>). In this report, we focused on two of the interactions in greater detail: <italic>RPO21</italic>, which codes for the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II; and <italic>RAD2</italic>, an endonuclease involved in DNA repair.</p><p>RPO21 codes for a protein 1733 amino acids in length. Among three independent RPO21 clones, the plasmids recovered expressed identical fusion proteins containing amino acid residues 1497&#x02013;1733, which correspond to the CTD of Rpo21p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>B). Segment 1&#x02013;565 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>B) and 1&#x02013;975 of Sen1p (not shown) activated the ADE2 and HIS3 reporters in the presence of an Rpo21p(1497&#x02013;1733) fusion protein. Another segment of Sen1p(549&#x02013;1153) that overlaps with segment 1&#x02013;565 by 17 amino acids failed to activate reporters in the presence of Rpo21p(1497&#x02013;1733) (not shown). These results indicate that the Sen1p&#x02013;Rpo21p interaction requires the N-terminal 565 amino acids of Sen1p. To test the strength of the interaction between Sen1p(1&#x02013;565) and Rpo21p(1497&#x02013;1733), growth was assessed in the presence of 3AT, which inhibits the activity of the His3p reporter enzyme. Growth persisted in the presence of 5 mM 3AT, indicating a relatively strong interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>B).</p><p>Protein extracts from strains expressing Rpo21p-HA, which contains a heamaglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the C-terminus, and either full-length Sen1p or truncated sen1-2p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>A) were used to test whether Sen1p and Rpo21p co-immunoprecipitate. The proteins were bound to immobilized anti-HA antibodies (Materials and Methods), and the eluates were analyzed on western blots probed with anti-Sen1 antibodies (Materials and Methods) that recognize full-length Sen1p and truncated sen1-2p. The truncated protein lacks the region that interacts with Rpo21p in the two-hybrid system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>C). Sen1p was detected when Rpo21p-HA and full-length Sen1p were expressed, but was not detected in the absence of Rpo21p-HA or when sen1-2p was expressed instead of full-length Sen1p. The RNA binding domain for type I helicases, including Sen1p, is located in C-terminal motif VI in the helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c28">28</xref>). This region is not required for the two-hybrid interaction between Sen1p and Rpo21p. Furthermore, the region required for the interaction does not resemble any known RNA binding motif. Similar arguments can be made for the Sen1p/Rad2p interaction described below. The results are consistent with the conclusion that Sen1p interacts with the CTD of Rpo21p through a protein&#x02013;protein interaction.</p><p>We examined the growth phenotype that resulted when the function of both proteins was compromised. A single haploid strain containing two temperature-sensitive mutations, one in <italic>SEN1</italic> (<italic>sen1-1</italic>) and one in <italic>RPO21</italic> (<italic>rpb1-1</italic>), exhibited extremely slow growth at temperatures that are permissive for each single mutation (not shown). The synthetic slow growth phenotype of the double mutant suggests that Sen1p may function in the context of an association with the CTD of Rpo21p. The close physical proximity to the CTD-binding protein Nrd1p in the transcriptosome complex may explain the similarity of <italic>sen1</italic> and <italic>nrd1</italic> mutant phenotypes with respect to read-through of snoRNA transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c16">16</xref>). However, <italic>NRD1</italic> was not recovered in the two-hybrid screen using Sen1p segment 1&#x02013;975 as bait, and full-length Nrd1p failed to interact with any of the Sen1p segments shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>A.</p><p><italic>RAD2</italic>, which codes for a DNA endonuclease 1031 amino acids in length, is required for nucleotide excision repair of damage from several agents including UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c14">14</xref>). Among five independent <italic>RAD2</italic> clones, the plasmids recovered expressed fusions containing different but overlapping segments spanning residues 327&#x02013;672 of Rad2p (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh561tb1">1</xref>). The minimal Rad2p segment responsible for the interaction includes residues 491&#x02013;544. Clones carrying this segment activated the <italic>ADE2</italic> and <italic>HIS3</italic> reporters in the presence of the Sen1p(1&#x02013;565)GBD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>B) and Sen1p(1&#x02013;975)GBD (not shown). The growth rates on media lacking adenine or histidine (&#x0002b;1 and 5 mM 3AT) were similar for all fusions where positive interactions were detected. By comparison with the Rpo21p/Sen1p interaction, the Rad2p&#x02013;Sen1p interaction was stronger.</p><p>Protein extracts from strains expressing GST-Rad2p (Rad2p fused to glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase) and N-terminal epitope-tagged cMyc&#x02013;Sen1p were used to test whether Rad2p and Sen1p co-immunoprecipitate. The proteins were bound to immobilized anti-GST antibodies, and the eluates were analyzed on western blots probed with anti-GST and anti-cMyc antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>C). cMyc&#x02013;Sen1p was detected only when GST-Rad2p was co-expressed with the eptiope-tagged cMyc&#x02013;Sen1p fusion.</p><p>We examined the extent to which isogenic strains carrying <italic>sen1-1</italic> alone and <italic>sen1-1</italic> combined with a <italic>rad2</italic> null allele (<italic>rad2::kanB:kanC</italic>, referred to as <italic>rad2</italic>&#x00394;) are sensitive to UV-induced DNA damage. The growth rates for single and double mutant strains were monitored at 30&#x000b0;C using serial dilution drop tests after irradiation with 0&#x02013;3 mJ of UV light (Materials and Methods). The <italic>sen1-1</italic> mutation prevents growth at 33&#x000b0;C and above, while at 30&#x000b0;C, function is partially impaired but growth is permitted. At 30&#x000b0;C the growth of the single mutant carrying <italic>sen1-1</italic> was about the same with or without exposure to UV light (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>D). By contrast, deletion of the N-terminal 975 amino acids (sen1-2p) had a slight effect on UV sensitivity (not shown). The growth of the single mutant carrying <italic>rad2</italic>&#x00394; was diminished after exposure to UV light. Growth was completely inhibited at an exposure of 5 mJ of UV. When cells were plated after UV exposure, we found that the <italic>sen1-1 rad2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant lost viability more rapidly than the <italic>rad2</italic>&#x00394; single mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>D). At doses of 1&#x02013;1.5 mJ, cell viability of the double mutant was &#x0223c;60&#x00025; less than the <italic>rad2</italic>&#x00394; single mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Candidate-specific screens: Sen1p interaction with Rnt1p (RNaseIII)</title><p>We screened individual proteins for interaction with Sen1p based on previous information about potential co-participation in the synthesis of non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>). An interaction was detected with Rnt1p, the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> ortholog of bacterial RNase III, which is required for cleavage of numerous precursor RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c21">21</xref>). The 471 amino-acid-long Rnt1 protein consists of several regions including an N-terminal domain that affects the efficiency of RNA binding and cleavage, a central nuclease domain required for site-specific cleavage, and a C-terminal domain for dsRNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c29">29</xref>).</p><p>Two-hybrid assays were conducted using three <italic>RNT1</italic> segments coding for amino acid residues 1&#x02013;191, 1&#x02013;321 and the full-length protein (1&#x02013;471). The Rnt1p hybrid fusions were examined in combination with four <italic>SEN1</italic> segments coding for amino acid residues 1&#x02013;565, 549&#x02013;1153, 1132&#x02013;1785 and 1761&#x02013;2231 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>A). The N-terminal region of Rnt1p (residues 1&#x02013;191) interacted the strongest with Sen1p(1&#x02013;565), but also interacted weakly with Sen1p(549&#x02013;1153) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f2">2</xref>). The weaker interaction between Rnt1 fusions and Sen1p(549&#x02013;1153) might be due to the overlapping residues shared in common between Sen1p(1&#x02013;565) and Sen1p(549&#x02013;1153). No interaction was detected between any of the Rnt1 fusions and Sen1p(1132&#x02013;1785) or Sen1p(1761&#x02013;2231) (not shown).</p><p>The interactions were best detected using the <italic>GAL1-HIS3</italic> reporter. Rnt1p(1&#x02013;191) and full-length Rnt1p conferred growth in the presence of 1 mM 3AT when expressed in combination with Sen1p(1&#x02013;565), but no growth was observed at higher 3AT concentrations. The interactions between the Rnt1p(1&#x02013;191) and full-length Rnt1p fusions with Sen1p(549&#x02013;1153) were not detected in the presence of 1 mM 3AT, indicating that the most likely domain of interaction resides in the Sen1 segment spanning residues 1&#x02013;565. Interactions between Sen1p(1&#x02013;565), Rnt1p(1&#x02013;191) and a weaker interaction with Rnt1p(1&#x02013;321) were also detected using the <italic>GAL2-ADE2</italic> reporter. Analysis of a third reporter, <italic>GAL7-lacZ</italic>, revealed that the Rnt1p(1&#x02013;191)&#x02013;Sen1p(1&#x02013;565) and the Rnt1p(1&#x02013;471)&#x02013;Sen1p(1&#x02013;565) interactions caused a 6&#x02013;8-fold induction of <italic>lacZ</italic> and a corresponding increase in &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. A weaker 2-fold increase was observed for the Rnt1p(321)&#x02013;Sen1p(1&#x02013;565) interaction. The remaining Sen1p&#x02013;Rnt1p combinations had &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities that were comparable to vector-only controls.</p><p>Protein extracts from strains expressing GST-Rnt1p and N-terminal epitope-tagged cMyc&#x02013;Sen1 were used to test whether Rnt1p and Sen1p co-immunoprecipitate. The proteins were bound to immobilized anti-cMyc antibodies, and the eluates were analyzed on western blots probed with anti-GST and anti-cMyc antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f2">2</xref>B). GST-Rnt1p was detected only when cMyc&#x02013;Sen1p was co-expressed with the GST-Rnt1p fusion. These results indicate that Sen1p interacts <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> with Rnt1p.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions and epistatic effects of Sen1p and Rnt1p in U5 snRNA 3&#x02032; end formation</title><p>We performed an experiment to assess the overall number and extent to which different RNAs co-purify with Sen1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f3">3</xref>A). RNAs were purified in the presence (&#x0002b;) and absence (&#x02013;) of the Sen1&#x02013;&#x003b2;-galactosidase fusion to which anti-SEN1 antibodies were directed. The fusion protein competitively inhibits the formation of the Sen1p/anti-SEN1 antigen&#x02013;antibody complex.

Nine RNAs detected in this experiment (identified with an asterisk in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f3">3</xref>A) were shown previously to co-IP with Sen1p or are considered likely candidates for binding to Sen1p based on genetic evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c16">16</xref>).

Since Sen1p and Rnt1p were shown previously to affect the accumulation of RNAs related to snRNA U5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c18">18</xref>), we performed an experiment similar to the one described above, but instead of using 3&#x02032; end-labeling for detection, we used a probe specific for U5 RNA. Two forms of mature U5 snRNA exist called U5S (180 nt) and U5L (214 nt), which differ in length at their 3&#x02032; ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c30">30</xref>). Sen1p was immunoprecipitated using anti-1 antibodies directed against an internal peptide (residues 1539&#x02013;1551) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>). The precipitates were analyzed on northern blots using a U5-specific probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f3">3</xref>B). A small amount of U5L and U5S RNA were bound non-specifically to the agarose beads using pre-immune serum or in the absence of antibodies. Significantly more RNA was bound in the presence of antibodies, and the binding was specific as indicated by the diminished amount of the U5 RNAs detected in the presence of a competing peptide. Less than 1&#x00025; of the amount of U5S and U5L present in total RNA extracts was bound specifically in Sen1p precipitates. The relatively inefficient immuno-precipitation of the U5 snRNAs suggests a transient interaction. Consistent with this, Sen1p is not a structural subunit of the U5 snRNP particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c31">31</xref>), but may nonetheless participate in the formation of mature U5 RNAs through transient association with the U5 snRNP and through its interaction with Rnt1p.</p><p>The largest detectable U5-related RNA is &#x0223c;690 nucleotides in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c21">21</xref>). Rnt1p cleaves this RNA or possibly a shorter derivative of this RNA at two alternative sites, &#x003bb; and &#x003c3;, leading to the two alternative mature forms of U5 snRNA, U5L and U5S (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f4">4</xref>A). The cleavages at the &#x003bb; and &#x003c3; sites produce two RNA intermediates, designated U5L-3&#x02032; and U5-3&#x02032;a, that undergo further processing by the exosomal and Rex nucleases to produce U5L and U5S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c32">32</xref>).</p><p>We examined the accumulation of U5-related RNAs in strains carrying single mutations in <italic>RNT1</italic> (<italic>HIS3:pet56:rnt1</italic>, referred to as <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394;) or <italic>SEN1</italic> (temperature-sensitive <italic>sen1-1</italic>) and in a double mutant strain carrying <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sen1-1</italic>. The U5L-3&#x02032; and U5-3&#x02032;a intermediates were undetectable in the strain lacking a functional <italic>RNT1</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f4">4</xref>B and C). The accumulation of U5L was severely reduced, whereas U5S was present at a level similar to wild type (the U5S/U5L ratio was 28 compared to 0.9 for wild type). Except for a small increase in U5-3&#x02032;b RNA, no significant accumulation of other large U5-related RNAs was observed. The lack of accumulation of the precursors of Rnt1p cleavage in the <italic>rnt</italic>&#x00394; strain suggests that the uncleaved precursors are alternatively processed or degraded. The pattern of RNA accumulation is consistent with the pattern previously reported for <italic>rnt1</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c21">21</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>sen1-1</italic> mutant accumulated 2&#x02013;3-fold more of the U5L-3&#x02032; precursor than wild type at the restrictive temperature of 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>). The levels of accumulation of U5S and U5L were similar, but the ratio was slightly altered in favor of U5S (0.9 for wild type versus 1.2 for <italic>sen1-1</italic>). Similar to the <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; strain, a small amount of longest detectable RNA, U5-3&#x02032;b, was evident in the <italic>sen1-1</italic> strain at 37&#x000b0;C, whereas this RNA species was below detectable levels in wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f4">4</xref>B).</p><p>The accumulation of RNAs in the <italic>sen1-1 rnt1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant exhibited some features typical of the <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; single mutant and some features unique to the double mutant. Similar to the <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; single mutant, the precursor to U5L (U5-3&#x02032;a) was not detected and very low levels of U5L were present. However, unlike the <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>sen1-1</italic> single mutants, numerous U5 RNAs were detected that extend in size up to that of U5-3&#x02032;b, which accumulated to a relatively high level compared to either single mutant. These longer RNAs were detected at much lower levels in both of the single mutants but were not detected in wild type. U5-3&#x02032;b RNA, which is a precursor to Rnt1p cleavage, is presumably acted upon by alternate nucleases in the <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; single mutant strain, but U5-3&#x02032;b is partially stabilized in the double mutant. These results suggest an epistatic relationship between Sen1p, Rnt1p and the alternative nucleases that degrade the Rnt1p substrate when Rnt1p is absent.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of Sen1p and truncated sen1-2p on the accumulation of U5-related RNAs</title><p>We compared the accumulation of U5-related RNAs in a wild-type <italic>RNT1</italic> genetic background in strains carrying <italic>SEN1</italic> and <italic>sen1-2</italic> which were either chromosomally integrated in a single copy or carried on multi-copy 2 &#x000b5;m plasmids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f5">5</xref>). The truncated <italic>sen1-2</italic> allele is missing the domains that mediate binding of Sen1p to Rpo21p, Rad2p and Rnt1p as well as the native <italic>SEN1</italic> promoter, and is expressed from a cryptic promoter instead (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f1">1</xref>A). Strains carrying a lethal null allele of <italic>SEN1</italic> are viable when they express truncated sen1-2p. The average U5S/U5L ratio was 2.4 for <italic>SEN1</italic> strains and 6.4 for <italic>sen1-2</italic> strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f5">5</xref>). Gene copy number had little effect on the ratio. The 2.5&#x02013;3-fold difference in the ratio indicates that the N-terminal segment of Sen1p has a demonstrable effect on the accumulation of U5L.</p><p>To compare the effects of deleting the N-terminal region of Sen1p with the effects that result from loss of ATP-helicase function, a depletion experiment was performed using <italic>GAL1::sen1-2</italic> which expresses the N-terminally truncated protein from a galactose inducible, glucose-repressible promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f5">5</xref>). After a shift from galactose to glucose, growth slowed starting at 16 h, but 80&#x02013;90&#x00025; of the cells remained viable for 30 h as measured by colony formation and resistance to methylene blue staining (not shown). By 24 h, the U5S/U5L ratio was 27.7 compared to an initial ratio of 6.4, indicating a 4&#x02013;4.5-fold reduction in the accumulation of U5L. In addition, we observed a time-dependent increase in the accumulation of U5L-3&#x02032;, the precursor to U5L (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f4">4</xref>). After 30 h, a 2.3-fold increase in U5L-3&#x02032; was observed. Compared to isogenic wild-type strains grown in galactose, the overall change in the U5S/U5L ratio was 11&#x02013;12-fold. No other larger RNAs were observed to accumulate in the upper portion of the northern blot (not shown). The results indicate that the overall reduction in the accumulation of U5L is partly due to the absence of the N-terminal segment in sen1-2p and partly due to depletion of the truncated protein containing the ATP-helicase domain. These results suggest that, like Rnt1p, Sen1p is required for the accumulation of U5L RNA but not U5S RNA and that at least two regions of Sen1p contribute to the formation of U5L.</p></sec><sec><title>Synthetic growth rate reduction in double mutants</title><p>Since Sen1p, Rnt1p and the exosome all participate in 3&#x02032; end formation of numerous RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c21">21</xref>), we examined the overall effects on growth when the <italic>sen1-1</italic> mutation was combined with a <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; null allele and an <italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394; null allele.

The corresponding single mutant strains carrying either <italic>sen1-1</italic> or <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; grew much better than the double mutant, although these strains still did not grow as well as the wild-type strain. Although U5 snRNA is essential for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c30">30</xref>), the synthetic slow growth of the double mutant is probably not the result of reduced U5L snRNA synthesis since U5S accumulates to levels comparable to wild type and because strains carrying <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; by itself exhibit levels of U5L and U5S accumulation similar to the double mutant and are viable.</p><p>The nuclease Rrp6p, an ortholog of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c33">33</xref>) is a nuclear component of the exosome known to participate in the maturation of U5 snRNA. Exosomal nucleases trim nucleotides from the 3&#x02032; ends of U5 RNAs following cleavage by Rnt1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c32">32</xref>). We examined double mutants carrying <italic>sen1-1</italic> and the null allele <italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394; to look for synthetic phenotypes with regard to both U5 snRNA synthesis and growth. The pattern of accumulation of U5 RNAs most closely resembled the pattern observed for an <italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394; single mutant (not shown). This is most likely because there are alternate routes for the production of substrates for Rrp6p and for the accumulation of U5L and U5S in the absence of functional Sen1p. When growth rates were examined, it was found that growth of the double mutant was reduced at 30&#x000b0;, 24&#x000b0; and 15&#x000b0;C compared to either single mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f6">6</xref>).</p><p>The slow growth phenotypes of <italic>sen1-1 rnt1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sen1-1 rrp6</italic>&#x00394; double mutants suggest an underlying functional relationship among the proteins because Sen1p, Rnt1p and the exosome are needed in a common subset of RNA maturation pathways. It is unlikely that synthetic slow growth is due to non-specific, additive effects because no synthetic growth phenotypes were observed when <italic>sen1-1</italic> was combined with mutations that severely affect nuclear cytoplasmic transport (<italic>nup1::LEU2</italic>; <italic>nup100&#x02013;1::URA3</italic>, <italic>nup116&#x02013;6::URA3</italic>, <italic>nup145&#x02013;1::URA</italic>), tRNA maturation (<italic>sen2-1</italic>, <italic>lig1-2</italic>) or nuclear-cytoplasmic RNA shuttling (<italic>rna1-1</italic>, <italic>prp20&#x02013;1</italic>) (not shown). Synthetic slow growth could be due to reduced accumulation of a single essential RNA other than U5 snRNA or to the cumulative effects of multiple RNAs that require Sen1p, Rnt1p and exosomal nucleases for maturation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Seven proteins were identified in a global two-hybrid screen that interact with Sen1p. Since Sen1p is exclusively nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c6">6</xref>), we focused on further characterization of two of the nuclear-localized interacting proteins that were recovered: the RNA polymerase II subunit Rpo21p and the single-strand DNA endonuclease Rad2p. Both interactions are mediated by an N-terminal segment of Sen1p spanning amino acids 1&#x02013;565. Sen1p interacts with the CTD of Rpo21p and an internal segment of Rad2p.</p><p>Sen1p appears to be functionally related to the SR protein Nrd1p, which binds to the CTD of Rpo21p and also contains an RNA recognition motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c17">17</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>NRD1</italic> and <italic>SEN1</italic> cause the accumulation of aberrant snoRNAs with 3&#x02032; ends extending past the site of transcription termination. The snoRNA snR13, which co-immunoprecipitates with Sen1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f3">3</xref>A), is one of the best-studied examples of this. Mutant alleles of <italic>nrd1</italic> and <italic>sen1</italic> exhibit reduced accumulation of mature snR13 and increased accumulation of RNAs that extend through the snR13 transcription termination site and extend to the site of transcription termination of the next downstream gene on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c16">16</xref>). Despite the fact that two hybrid interactions between Sen1p and Nrd1p were not detected, the physical proximity of Sen1p and Nrd1p in the CTD-binding complex is consistent with a role for both proteins in transcription termination as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c17">17</xref>).</p><p>A strong interaction was detected between Sen1p and Rad2p, which is likely to serve a purpose in DNA repair, because <italic>sen1 rad2</italic> double mutants are hypersensitive to UV irradiation. The nucleotide excision reactions needed to repair DNA damage are related to transcription in two respects. DNA coding strands are repaired at a faster rate than non-coding strands possibly because certain types of DNA damage inhibit the ability to transcribe through a damaged region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c34">34</xref>). Secondly, repair of UV damage requires the transcription complex TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c35">35</xref>), which consists of at least nine proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c36">36</xref>). TFIIH acts in concert with two single-strand DNases, Rad1p/Rad10p and Rad2p, which cut on the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; sides of a damaged region, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c14">14</xref>). Our results indicate that Sen1p interacts directly with Rad2p, but other studies show it also co-purifies with Rad1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c10">10</xref>). These results are suggestive of a role for Sen1p in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Redundancies of function may exist, however, because the <italic>sen1-1</italic> mutation did not by itself affect UV sensitivity under semi-permissive growth conditions. UV hypersensitivity was only apparent in the <italic>sen1-1 rad2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant. Further studies will be required to understand what role Sen1p plays in DNA repair.</p><p>It was shown previously that Sen1p interacts with Smd3p, a component of the Sm complex that assembles with snRNAs to form snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c12">12</xref>). We did not recover Smd3p in our two-hybrid screens because the Smd3p binding domain in Sen1p was not included in the Sen1p segment used as bait. Since this interaction suggests a role for Sen1p in RNA processing, we examined the pathway for formation of two variant forms of mature U5 snRNA, U5L and U5S. It was known previously that the <italic>sen1-1</italic> mutation causes excess accumulation of U5L-3&#x02032; RNA, a precursor to U5L RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f4">4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c7">7</xref>). We found that U5L and U5S RNAs co-immunoprecipitate with Sen1p and that residues 1&#x02013;565 interact with N-terminal residues 1&#x02013;191 of Rnt1p (RNase III), a nuclease involved in U5 snRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c37">37</xref>).</p><p>To examine the effects of Sen1p on U5 snRNA accumulation, we used two mutant alleles of <italic>SEN1</italic> described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c6">6</xref>). The first allele, <italic>sen1-1</italic>, contains a substitution of an evolutionarily conserved residue within a domain required for ATP-dependent DNA/RNA helicase activity. The <italic>sen1-1</italic> mutation causes temperature-sensitive growth. The second allele, <italic>sen1-2</italic>, codes for a truncated version of Sen1p that is missing the first 975 N-terminal amino acids residues, including the binding domains for Rpo21p, Rad2p and Rnt1p.</p><p>The most noticeable U5-related phenotype of strains carrying <italic>sen1-1</italic> is that the product of Rnt1p cleavage at the &#x003bb; cleavage site (U5-3&#x02032;, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f4">4</xref>) accumulates to a higher level compared to wild type. Both U5L and U5S accumulate at near normal levels with slightly lower levels of U5L and slightly higher levels of U5S. When sen1-2p was expressed from a <italic>GAL1&#x02013;sen1-2</italic> fusion, the U5S/U5L ratio was increased 2.5&#x02013;3-fold compared to Sen1p. This shows that the relative accumulation of U5L is decreased when the N-terminal 975 amino acids are deleted from Sen1p. We speculate that this may be due to absence of the Sen1-Rnt1 binding domain, which could help facilitate a Rnt1&#x02013;RNA interaction.</p><p>When sen1-2p was depleted following transcriptional shut-off of the <italic>GAL1&#x02013;sen1-2</italic> fusion, the U5S/U5L ratio increased to about 28. The increased ratio reflects a much lower level of U5L RNA accumulation. By comparison, deletion of <italic>RNT1</italic> resulted in a U5S/U5L ratio of about 45. Similar changes in U5L RNA accumulation were not evident in experiments using the <italic>sen1-1</italic> allele because the time window between temperature-shift and cell death is small relative to the rate of decay of mature U5L. Stable U5L RNA made prior to the temperature shift probably masks a reduced rate of synthesis. Finally, the precursor to U5L, U5L-3&#x02032;, shows a time-dependent increase in accumulation, indicating that the precursor U5L-3&#x02032; accumulates at the expense of the product U5L.</p><p>Since exosomal nucleases convert U5L-3&#x02032; to U5L, these nucleases appear to act less efficiently in the absence of Sen1p. We suggest that the Sen1p/Rnt1p interaction is required for normal formation of U5 snRNA, and that the absence of the Rnt1p binding domain in sen1-2p explains the phenotypes that occur upon depletion of sen1-2p. Since the product of Rnt1p cleavage at the &#x003bb; site accumulates following depletion, we suggest that Sen1p may function at the interface between Rnt1p cleavage and subsequent processing by the exosome. The &#x003bb; cleavage site occurs in a stem&#x02013;loop, and Sen1p might help unwind the stem during or after Rnt1p cleavage to enhance access of the 3&#x02032; end to exosomal nucleases. Given that <italic>sen1-1</italic> confers a synthetic growth defect when combined in double mutants with <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394;, it is likely that Sen1p, Rnt1p and the exosome function together in other pathways in addition to the U5 snRNA maturation pathway.</p><p>The proposed function for Sen1p in U5 RNA processing described above is distinct from the role proposed for Sen1p in transcription termination, which may be mediated by the interaction between Sen1p and the CTD of Rpo21p. Sen1p may function twice in U5 snRNA expression. The accumulation of U5-related RNAs single or double mutants could be a composite consequence of separate roles for Sen1p in transcription and processing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh561f7">7</xref>). It is not yet clear whether the ladder of RNAs that accumulate in <italic>sen1-1 rnt1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants are a consequence of defects in transcription termination or processing. Although the site of transcription termination for U5 RNA is not known, the largest detectable U5-related RNA, U5-3&#x02032;b, is below detectable levels in wild type, accumulates to a small extent in <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sen1-1</italic> strains, and accumulates to a much larger extent in a <italic>sen1-1 rnt1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant. The double mutant also accumulates an extensive ladder of RNAs that may be partially degraded forms U5-3&#x02032;b RNA. Interestingly, exosomal nucleases including Rrp41p, Rrp45p and Rrp6p, exhibit nearly identical ladders of RNAs compared to the <italic>sen1-1 rnt1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant when the corresponding nuclease genes are disrupted or when the protein products are depleted in strains carrying <italic>rnt1</italic>&#x00394; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c21">21</xref>).</p><p>Either U5-3&#x02032;b RNA is the primary transcript or it is a read-through transcript that accumulates when Sen1p, Rnt1p or the exosomal nucleases are inactivated. Since it is unlikely that Rnt1p and the exosomal nucleases promote read-through of transcription termination, we favor the view that U5-3&#x02032;b is the primary transcript. However, this does not preclude the possibility that Sen1p influences termination of the primary U5 transcript through its interaction with the CTD of Rpo21p. Read-through transcripts may fail to accumulate because they may be rapidly degraded.</p><p>In conclusion, we note that mutations in Senataxin, the human ortholog of yeast <italic>SEN1</italic>, were recently identified in patients diagnosed with ataxia-ocular apraxia 2, a genetic disorder affecting the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c38">38</xref>). Given that Sen1p appears to function in multiple pathways for gene expression in yeast, it is not yet clear in humans what role Sen1p might play in the neurological impairment associated with this disease. The link between Sen1p and human disease provides an additional incentive to continue efforts to understand what roles are played by helicases like Sen1p in gene expression.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh561f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Sen1p physically interacts with Rpo21p and Rad2p.

The primary events in the maturation of U5 RNA were described previously, including the involvement of Rnt1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c37">37</xref>), the exosomal and Rex nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c40">40</xref>), and the Sm complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c42">42</xref>). Data in this paper suggest a model in which a U5 post-transcriptional RNA complexes with Rnt1p and Sen1p; Rnt1p cleaves at the &#x003bb; and &#x003c3; cleavage sites and then dissociates; the seven subunit Sm complex associates with U5 RNA; Sen1p binds to one of the Sm subunits, Smd3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh561c12">12</xref>); and the exosome trims U5 RNAs yielding the two mature products, U5L and U5S. The Sm proteins and U5 RNA form the core U5 snRNP, but Sen1p dissociates and is not part of the final snRNP. Variations on the exact order of events are possible. It is not known whether the Sen1p that is bound to Rpo21p leaves with the polymerase after transcription is completed, in which case a second molecule of Sen1p must bind to the RNA, or whether the Sen1p molecule that functions in transcription remains bound to the RNA and functions with Rnt1p in subsequent processing events.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkh561f7"/></fig><table-wrap id="gkh561tb1"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Proteins recovered from a global two-hybrid screen that interact with residues 1&#x02013;975 of Sen1p</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1" width="85%"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr valign="top"><th valign="top">Protein</th><th valign="top">Length (amino acids)</th><th valign="top">No. times recovered</th><th valign="top">Residues in clone</th><th valign="top">Function</th><th valign="top">Cellular location</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Gcr2p<hr/></td><td valign="top">534<hr/></td><td valign="top">2<hr/></td><td valign="top">163&#x02013;534<hr/></td><td valign="top">Transcription activator<hr/></td><td valign="top">Nucleus<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Nup49p<hr/></td><td valign="top">472<hr/></td><td valign="top">1<hr/></td><td valign="top">21&#x02013;472<hr/></td><td valign="top">Nuclear export<hr/></td><td valign="top">Nuclear pore<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Pyc2p<hr/></td><td valign="top">1180<hr/></td><td valign="top">1<hr/></td><td valign="top">696&#x02013;979<hr/></td><td valign="top">Pyruvate carboxylase<hr/></td><td valign="top">Cytoplasm<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Rad2p<hr/></td><td valign="top">1031<hr/></td><td valign="top">3<hr/></td><td valign="top">327&#x02013;672<hr/></td><td valign="top">DNA repair<hr/></td><td valign="top">Nucleus<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Rad2p<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td valign="top">1<hr/></td><td valign="top">327&#x02013;544<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Rad2p<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td valign="top">1<hr/></td><td valign="top">491&#x02013;606<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Rpo21p(Rpb1p)<hr/></td><td valign="top">1733<hr/></td><td valign="top">3<hr/></td><td valign="top">1497&#x02013;1733<hr/></td><td valign="top">RNA polymerase<hr/></td><td valign="top">Nucleus<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">YPR148C<hr/></td><td valign="top">435<hr/></td><td valign="top">2<hr/></td><td valign="top">95&#x02013;435<hr/></td><td valign="top">Function unknown<hr/></td><td valign="top">Cytoplasm<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Prs3p<hr/></td><td valign="top">320<hr/></td><td valign="top">1<hr/></td><td valign="top">142&#x02013;204<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td valign="top">Cytoplasm<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Prs3p</td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">142&#x02013;320</td><td valign="top">Ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase 3</td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Information on the genes and proteins can be found in the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">http://www.yeastgenome.org/</ext-link>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><ack><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This research was supported by the University of Wisconsin Medical School and the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, and Public Health Service Grant GM9019 (M.R.C.).
