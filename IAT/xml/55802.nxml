Oxidative deamination of DNA primarily converts DNA base amino groups to keto groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c2">2</xref>). Thus, adenine is converted to hypoxanthine (HX), guanine to xanthine (X) and cytosine to uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c4">4</xref>). These bases can trigger an increased mutation rate. HX is biologically important because A:T&#x02192;G:C transitions are induced at the site when DNA is damaged by oxidative deamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c6">6</xref>). Most organisms contain repair enzymes that are specific for these deaminated bases. Endonuclease V attacks DNA containing HX or X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c8">8</xref>), whereas uracil-DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylase deals effectively with uracils in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c9">9</xref>). In addition, two other enzymes found in several organisms, including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, methylpurine DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylase and 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, are also active on HX-containing DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c11">11</xref>). However, oxidative deamination of DNA bases occurs not only in duplex DNA strands but also in the free nucleotide pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c12">12</xref>). Previously, some evidence for the presence of ITP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c14">14</xref>) and an enzyme hydrolyzing ITP, dITP and XTP was presented for human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c15">15</xref>) and rabbit tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c16">16</xref>). A possible role for this enzyme in cells is to protect the human genome from incorporation of rogue nucleotides, such as ITP, dITP and XTP, into DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c16">16</xref>). The model for the formation and degradation of ITP and IMP, the so-called inosinate cycle, was demonstrated in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c17">17</xref>). Moreover, as it is conceivable that oxidative damage to DNA bases occurs even more frequently in the nucleotide pool of organisms than in their chromosomal DNA, HX residues in DNA could be generated by misincorporation of dIMP from dITP in the nucleotide pool during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c19">19</xref>).</p><p> The initial characterization of a hypothetical protein <italic>Mj</italic>0226 from a hyperthermophile, <italic>Methanococcus jannaschii</italic>, identified a novel dNTP pyrophosphatase by a protein structure-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c20">20</xref>). This enzyme hydrolyzes non-canonical nucleotides, including dITP, under physiological conditions, suggesting that <italic>Mj</italic>0226 is an important factor in preventing the misincorporation of aberrant nucleotides into DNA, as are MutT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c22">22</xref>) and dUTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c25">25</xref>), eliminating 8-oxo-dGTP and dUTP from the nucleotide precursor pools, respectively. Studies of these mutagenic bases have revealed a complex system that both repairs such lesions already in DNA and sanitizes the nucleotide precursor pool, from which 8-oxo-dGTP and dUTP can be incorporated into DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c26">26</xref>). As dITP is also misincorporated into DNA by DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c27">27</xref>), two factors blocking HX misincorporation were presumed to exist. The first is a sanitizing enzyme hydrolyzing the triphosphate nucleotide to the nucleoside monophosphate and pyrophosphate. Secondly, a base excision enzyme, HX <italic>N</italic>-glycosylase or endonuclease V, removing the HX base. The latter enzyme is already known in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c28">28</xref>), whereas the protein hydrolyzing non-canonical nucleotides such as dITP and XTP to their monophosphates has yet to be identified.

In particular, the hydrolytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) for dITP (or ITP) and XTP was &#x0003e;10&#x000a0; 000 times higher than that for dATP. <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein hardly hydrolyzed the pyrimidine dNTPs, dCTP and dTTP, whereas the purine dGTP (or GTP) was hydrolyzed with modest efficiency. We also examined whether <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein showed activity for 8-oxo-dGTP and dUTP, specifically hydrolyzed <italic>in vitro</italic> by the DNA repair proteins MutT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c22">22</xref>) and dUTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c24">24</xref>), respectively, but these activities were extremely low (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke423tb2">2</xref>). Thus, dITP (or ITP) and XTP are the preferred substrates of <italic>Mj</italic>0226.</p><p> Besides the substrates in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke423tb2">2</xref>, pyrophosphate (for inorganic pyrophosphatase activity), triphosphate (for triphosphatase activity), trimetaphosphate (for trimetaphosphatase activity), FAD (for FAD pyrophosphatase activity) and NAD (for NAD pyrophosphatase activity), which are substrates for other hydrolases acting on phosphorous-containing anhydrides (EC 3.6.1), were examined as substrates for <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein, and were not hydrolyzed (data not shown). As <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein has an optimum activity under alkaline conditions, the activity of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1), which is active at high pH and has wide specificity, was also tested, with no activity being detected (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Does <italic>Mj</italic>0226 have a DNA endonuclease or error correction function?</title><p>Base analogs such as HX (the base of dITP) and X (the base of XTP) can arise in DNA from adenine and guanine by oxidative deamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c33">33</xref>).

Whether <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein has 3&#x02032;-terminal exonuclease activity was investigated using duplex substrates (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke423tb1">1</xref>, duplex B) containing dIMP at the 3&#x02032;-terminus of one strand (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f3">3</xref>A). Since the oligonucleotide containing dIMP was labeled on the 5&#x02032;-end with &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP, the distinct electrophoretic mobilities of the oligonucleotide products could be observed. It could be seen that dIMP was not removed from the DNA strand by <italic>Mj</italic>0226 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f3">3</xref>A, lanes 3&#x02013;6), whereas Klenow fragment efficiently hydrolyzed it (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f3">3</xref>A, lane 1).</p><p> Endonuclease activities of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein were also tested, similarly to the exonuclease experiments.

Using the polymerase subunit of <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA polymerase I (exonuclease<sup>&#x02013;</sup>), incorporation of dITP into synthetic DNA templates was examined. 5&#x02032;-End-labeled 15mer primer DNA was annealed to template DNA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke423tb1">1</xref>, duplex C) and polymerized with dITP by DNA polymerase I. dITP was efficiently inserted opposite dC residues in the template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f4">4</xref>A), with no evidence of incorporation of dITP opposite dA, dT or dG.

Like <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein, these homologous proteins showed maximum activity under alkaline conditions (data not shown). As a result, the biochemical function of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein was confirmed with certainty and these hypothetical proteins, including <italic>Mj</italic>0226, may be indispensable for a part of cellular metabolism in all organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>It has been observed that <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein has pyrophosphate-releasing activity by hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c20">20</xref>). An analogous reaction has been shown with the enzymes 8-oxo-dGTPase (MutT protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c22">22</xref>) and dUTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c25">25</xref>), removing inappropriate members from the nucleoside triphosphate pool. It is notable that these enzymes release PPi from their respective substrates in the same way as <italic>Mj</italic>0226. The importance of the dUTPase function in <italic>E.coli</italic> and eukaryotic systems has been firmly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c25">25</xref>), whereas MutT is important in preventing misincorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c21">21</xref>). 8-oxo-dGTP is hydrolyzed faster than dGTP, making it the likely preferred biological substrate for MutT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c22">22</xref>). <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein acts like these repair enzymes, so the preferred substrates of this protein are likely to be in the nucleotide pool, before they are misincorporated into DNA. Therefore, identification of the specific substrate of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein is of great significance.</p><p> The data in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke423tb2">2</xref> show the results for several nucleoside triphosphates in order to assess the relative importance of the various functional groups on hydrolysis rate. Of the non-standard nucleotides, <italic>Mj</italic>0226 showed a remarkably higher activity for dITP (or ITP) and XTP, suggesting that the O6 atom (6-keto group) of these nucleotides is critical for the reactivity of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f6">6</xref>). The O6 atoms of X, HX and guanine can form a hydrogen bond to the N&#x003b4;2 of Asn19 of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 with a slight conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c20">20</xref>). Although dGTP also has a 6-keto group, its hydrolysis rate is &#x0223c;150- to 180-fold less relative to those of dITP and XTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f6">6</xref>), indicating that the exocyclic 2-amino group of guanine likely reduces reactivity of dGTP with the protein.</p><p> The sugar ring structure of the substrate is less important, as indicated by the similar reactivities of dITP and ITP (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke423tb2">2</xref>). With respect to the phosphate linkage, <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein is highly specific for a phosphoanhydride bond of triphosphate form. The modified form of the phosphate linkage, as in GMP-PNP and GTP-&#x003b3;-S, was not hydrolyzed by <italic>Mj</italic>0226 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke423tb2">2</xref>). The di- and monophosphates are entirely resistant and <italic>Mj</italic>0226 cannot hydrolyze the phosphodiester linkages in an oligonucleotide strand containing a HX residue (data not shown). Thus, dITP (or ITP) and XTP are the specific substrates for <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein.</p><p><italic> Mj</italic>0226 protein also showed no activity with some chemical mutagens, such as 2-aminopurine triphosphate, 2,6-diaminopurine triphosphate and dHAPTP (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke423tb2">2</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f6">6</xref>). These nucleotide analogs, it is believed, induce mistakes during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c38">38</xref>). Although the structure of these nucleotide analogs is similar to dITP (or XTP), they were not hydrolyzed by <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein due to lack of a 6-keto group.</p><p> While the mutagenic mechanism of hypoxanthine already incorporated into DNA is clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c33">33</xref>), the precise mutagenic mechanisms of incorporation of dITP into DNA templates opposite dN and vice versa remain interesting questions. dITP was incorporated into DNA by DNA polymerase I <italic>in vitro</italic> instead of dGTP and, less efficiently, instead of dATP, dCTP and dTTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f4">4</xref>A). These results confirm those of Thomas <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c27">27</xref>), while in earlier reports an <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction between HX and dN in synthetic DNA has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c41">41</xref>). The basis for these results is that the HX residue can form base pairs with multiple bases as well as cytosine. We also observed that HX, when present in template DNA, directs incorporation of all four dNTPs by Klenow fragment with similar rates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f4">4</xref>B). It is proposed that initial incorporation of dITP opposite dC leads to mutation generation in the next replication cycle with high probability, as random dNTPs would be incorporated opposite HX. Thus it is supposed that dITP incorporation would generate transversion as well as transition mutations. However, HX in DNA can occur not only by spontaneous deamination of dA residues but also by misincorporation of dIMP from dITP during replication by DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c19">19</xref>). Also, the mutagenic properties of dITP have been ascertained by site-specific mutagenensis <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c34">34</xref>). Therefore, HX mutagenesis might also occur by incorporation of dITP, although it is likely to be quantitatively less important. These results suggest that a major biological function of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein is to remove dITP from the nucleotide pool. Since the fidelity of the polymerization reaction may in part depend on the fidelity of various DNA polymerases, studies on the fidelity of dITP incorporation with a variety of DNA polymerases are on-going. Although DNA polymerase insertion data using an oligonucleotide containing xanthosine were not obtained, we presume that DNA polymerase fidelity with XTP is similar to that with dITP, as some evidence of mutagenesis by xanthine has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c45">45</xref>).</p><p> How does <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein act on DNA? The first possibility is that it could act as an exonuclease, removing dIMP from a terminal dN:dI mismatch. This was examined as described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f3">3</xref>A. It can be seen that dIMP was not removed from the oligonucleotide duplex by <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein, whereas Klenow fragment did hydrolyze it. Thus, <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein does not have an error correction function. The second possibility is that <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein has endonuclease activity, namely HX-specific endonuclease activity. The endonuclease activity of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein was also tested, similarly to the exonuclease experiments, but <italic>Mj</italic>0226 does not have endonuclease activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f3">3</xref>B). This HX residue can be removed by some DNA repair enzymes, DNA glycosylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c11">11</xref>) and endonuclease V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c46">46</xref>). A third possibility is that <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein prevents formation of dN:dI mispairs during DNA synthesis by sanitizing dITP in the nucleotide pool. This sanitizing reaction has been seen for MutT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c47">47</xref>) and dUTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c48">48</xref>), removing unwelcome nucleotides from the nucleotide pool. From the distinct nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis by <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein it seems that the biological function of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein is to prevent misincorporation of dITP and XTP into DNA.</p><p> We have shown, using multiple alignment, that hypothetical homologs of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 exist in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c20">20</xref>). Their functions have been unknown until now and, interestingly, the amino acid sizes of these proteins are similar and several regions are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke423c20">20</xref>). These results suggest that the biological function of the homologous proteins is likely similar to that of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein. Two homologs of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 were purified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke423f5">5</xref>) and their biochemical functions were verified (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke423tb3">3</xref>). Many organisms have a significant proportion of their gene products involved in a variety of repair mechanisms. It seems that <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein and its homologs from other organisms have a major role in preventing mutation caused by misincorporation into DNA of dITP and XTP, which are formed spontaneously in the nucleotide pool.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke423f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Optimal conditions for the nucleotide hydrolysis activities of <italic>Mj</italic>0226 protein.
