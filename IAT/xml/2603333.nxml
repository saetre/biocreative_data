Identification of these peptide hormones is a difficult and important problem. We describe a computational framework that models <italic>spatial</italic> structure along the genomic sequence simultaneously with the <italic>temporal</italic> evolutionary path structure across species and show how such models can be used to discover new functional molecules, in particular peptide hormones, via cross-genomic sequence comparisons. The computational framework incorporates <italic>a priori</italic> high-level knowledge of structural and evolutionary constraints into a hierarchical grammar of evolutionary probabilistic models. This computational method was used for identifying novel prohormones and the processed peptide sites by producing sequence alignments across many species at the functional-element level. Experimental results with an initial implementation of the algorithm were used to identify potential prohormones by comparing the human and non-human proteins in the Swiss-Prot database of known annotated proteins. In this proof of concept, we identified 45 out of 54 prohormones with only 44 false positives. The comparison of known and hypothetical human and mouse proteins resulted in the identification of a novel putative prohormone with at least four potential neuropeptides. Finally, in order to validate the computational methodology, we present the basic molecular biological characterization of the novel putative peptide hormone, including its identification and regional localization in the brain. This species comparison, HMM-based computational approach succeeded in identifying a previously undiscovered neuropeptide from whole genome protein sequences. This novel putative peptide hormone is found in discreet brain regions as well as other organs. The success of this approach will have a great impact on our understanding of GPCRs and associated pathways and help to identify new targets for drug development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Peptide hormones, or neuropeptides, are made up of a string of amino acids ranging from approximately 3 to 50 residues. These peptides are processed from a larger protein called a prohormone and activate a class of proteins called G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Neuropeptides signal neurons and other cells leading to changes in cellular biochemistry and potentially gene expression. There are a number of &#x0201c;orphan&#x0201d; GPCRs, i.e., receptors that have been discovered either by genomic sequence or by cloning, in which its respective peptide hormone is unknown. We have devised a computational method that models patterns in protein sequence simultaneously with evolutionary differences across species in order to identify previously unknown peptide hormones. We have used this computational methodology to identify a previously unknown putative prohormone that contains up to four potential neuropeptides, and we have characterized this prohormone with respect to location in rat brain and various human tissues. This computational technique will be useful for the identification of additional neuropeptides and help to characterize orphan GPCRs. Because roughly half of all pharmaceuticals act through activation or inhibition of GPCRs, this technique should lead to the identification of additional pharmaceutical targets and ultimately clinically used drugs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) probably represent the largest gene family, making up 3&#x00025; of the mammalian genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Venter1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. These proteins are made up of several subfamilies, including Class A rhodopsin-like, Class B secretin-like, Class C metabotropic glutamate/pheromone-like, and other nonmammalian receptors. Within each class, there is a very large number of smaller subclassifications, such as a family of receptors for peptide hormones within rhodopsin-like receptors. There are approximately 1,000 GPCRs, the vast majority of which are olfactory receptors, with more than 650 GPCRs in the rhodopsin family alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Lander1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. A large number of these receptors have been identified only by computational methods, while others have been cloned and transfected into cells; however, the cognate neurotransmitter and the receptor functions for many GPCRs are currently unknown. Any receptor for which the native neurotransmitter is unknown is considered an orphan receptor. Of all the orphan receptors that remain, some percentage represents receptors for peptide hormones.</p><p>This large family of proteins is important not only from a basic science perspective, but because of their extracellular sites of action and importance as first messengers for cellular signaling, GPCRs have become a primary target for drug development. In fact, over 30&#x00025; of all pharmaceuticals act either as agonists or antagonists of GPCRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Lim1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Many pharmaceutical companies are identifying, cloning, and patenting new orphan GPCRs, with the hope that orphan receptors will ultimately lead to new drug development and new pharmaceutical agents.</p><p>Although the identification of putative GPCRs can be accomplished relatively easily, the discovery of the endogenous ligands that activate these receptors is far more difficult. These ligands can exist as small molecules, lipids, peptides, or proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Civelli1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Civelli2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Many, such as ATP, may have important functions other than activating a GPCR. Even within a class of hormones, there are seldom obvious clues that identify a new candidate. This is particularly true within the family of peptide hormones, as they are processed from a larger species known as preprohormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Douglass1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Peptide hormones, or neuropeptides, are a string of amino acids ranging from approximately 3 to 50 residues. They are found within a larger protein (a preprohormone), and the production of the actual hormone usually follows specific rules. Preprohormones are secreted proteins, and each has a signal sequence that is necessary for the transport of the protein out of the Golgi complex into a secretory vesicle for processing and secretion where the signal sequence is removed, revealing the prohormone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Gainer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In general, hormones are surrounded by a pair of basic residues, <italic>i.e.</italic> Arg-Arg, Arg-Lys, Lys-Arg, or Lys-Lys, which are found directly adjacent to the putative hormone. These double basic residues act as recognition sites for processing enzymes, usually serine proteases that cleave the prohormone to liberate the active peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Gainer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Lindberg1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In many cases, there is more than a single active peptide within one precursor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Douglass1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Even with these common features, the identification of a peptide hormone from a DNA or protein sequence is very difficult. Even though all of the GPCRs are obviously related based upon DNA or protein sequence, the neuropeptides that bind to the receptors are only obviously related within discrete families of prohormones. For instance, the family of opioid-like peptides has four members. These prohormones, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proenkephalin, prodynorphin, and pronociceptin (proN/OFQ), share similar genomic structures and a very slight similarity of protein sequence, most notably the Y(F)GGF of enkephalin, &#x003b2;-endorphin, dynorphin, and N/OFQ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Mollereau1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Reinscheid1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, if one were to conduct a BLAST search in Genbank for DNA sequences similar to proenkephalin, one would not find any other neuropeptide. Simple search strategies within Genbank are not adequate for identifying novel neuropeptides, especially those not belonging to known neuropepeptide families.</p><p>There is an additional feature of neuropeptides that may more clearly differentiate them from other types of molecules. Neuropeptides are usually well conserved among various species (rat, mouse, human), while the intervening sequences, presumably because they are simply discarded, are not well conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Mollereau2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

This kind of hierarchical alignment is significantly more informative than a conventional multiple sequence alignment in that it provides a segmentation that has to satisfy higher-level constraints.

In this formulation, for the sake of descriptive efficiency, we are describing the basic two-level hierarchy of models, which can, in our implementation, entail more levels.

Estimation of models based on alignments of a multitude of genomes (more than five for example) requires considerable resources in terms of both CPU power and data. This fact limits their applicability as general filters or data mining tools that operate on large repositories of sequences for discovery. In our processing of all the protein sequences that were available to us, we had to address this difficulty, for which we used the hierarchical structure to our advantage by first forming initial raw alignments based on parsing of sequences with our functional element grammar, and aligning based on functional element identity alone. Then, the resulting sequences were realigned by the HIGHER model in order to obtain the fine alignment as well as the discriminatory features. More specifically, processing of the sequences followed three main steps: two multiple alignment steps; (i) raw multiple alignment via functional element detection, and (ii) fine multiple alignment via fitting of the MPHMM, and (iii) a final discrimination step where a score is generated from the multiple alignment.

putative proteins from mouse and human genomes using the Celera Discovery System (CDS) database. These two sets of proteins were matched using HIGHER and the resulting output examined for known and potentially novel peptide hormones. Each potential match was examined using the CDS that lists families to which these unknown proteins might belong. BLAST searches were also conducted on both the predicted protein and the mouse and human gene, using both CDS and Genbank. A gene family was evident for many of the potential matches, suggesting that these proteins did not represent novel neuropeptides. For a smaller number of matches, the function of the protein was unknown. We consider these to be potential novel preprohormones.</p><p>One novel protein identified is the perfect example of our hypothetic neuropeptide model, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000258-g005">Figure 5</xref>. Between double basic residues, the homology is high. Outside these residues the conservation is quite low. The protein sequence of the human and rat were predicted from gene finding programs. These proteins have no apparent homology to any other proteins, and no known biological function. Of the four potential neuropeptides (highlighted in yellow, beginning at the end of the signal sequence and ending at the fourth set of basic residues), the most likely candidate would be the NPQ peptide NWTPQAMLYLKGAQ-NH<sub>2</sub>, although we should emphasize that one or more of the others (APQRLLE, FISDQS, and KDLSDRPLPE) are also likely to have biological activity. This amidated 14 amino acid peptide (we expect the G before the RR to be a substrate for the amidating enzyme peptidylglycine a-amidating monooxygenase, PAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Eipper1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>) is fully conserved among human and mouse. A further search of homologies for this protein found strong conservation for the amidated 14 amino acid peptide as far back as fugu. The fact that this portion of the protein is so highly conserved, including amidation and processing sites, strongly suggests the importance of this peptide sequence.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000258-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000258.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Amino acid sequence of preproNPQ.</title><p>Sequences shown were obtained from GenBank.

The rat protein has a mutation in the GRR at the C-terminal portion of the NPQ peptide. A single nucleotide change produces the sequence Gly-His-Arg. This complicates the processing of the rat gene product. It is possible that an endopeptidase may function at a His-Arg bond, and if so, it would become a substrate for carboxypeptidase E (CPE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Smyth1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, and the processed peptide would end Gln-Gly-His, without the amidation of the more abundant analog.</p><p>ESTs for preproNPQ have very recently appeared in GenBank indicating that the human protein can be found in brain, ovary, kidney and lung cancer cells.

We have cloned and sequenced the human, mouse, and rat cDNAs, and have verified the single nucleotide change that leads to the GHR sequence in the rat preproNPQ gene. Northern analysis using a human tissue blot (Clontech) showed the presence of preproNPQ mRNA in brain and pancreas, but most prominently in the kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000258-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

An initial mapping study of preproNPQ mRNA demonstrated that its expression in the brain is restricted to the mesopontine tegmentum. At its caudal extent preproNPQ mRNA is confined to the Barrington's nucleus, which can be identified by its expression of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000258-g007">Figure 7B, arrow</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000258-g007">Figure 7A&#x02013;C</xref>, regional distribution of preproNPQ mRNA overlaps closely with that of CRF, suggesting possible cellular co-localization of these two mRNAs. In contrast, preproNPQ signal is distinct from that of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000258-g007">Figure 7D&#x02013;F</xref>), which is selectively expressed in locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000258-g007">Figure 7E, arrow</xref>).

Bakalkin and colleagues have examined the bioinformatics of neuropeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Bakalkin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Bakalkin2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>; they have computed the amino acid composition and relative amino acid arrangements in the neuropeptide portion and compared them to the intervening portions of a prohormone. Using this statistical method, they have found an increased content of certain residues, as well as an increased occurrence of certain pairs of residues, as compared to proteins and non-regulatory peptides.</p><p>Although these biochemical and bioinformatics approaches can provide useful information about neuropeptides and potentially identify new neuropeptides, if the cognate receptor is unknown, they will not be able to provide a general format for the computational identification of this class of hormones. Such a general format can be achieved using more sophisticated computational tools such as Hidden Markov Models.</p><p>Hidden Markov models were originally developed for speech recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Rabiner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and have long come to form the basis of the state of the art in that field. Estimation and hypothesis testing algorithms for HMMs have been well studied, and a wealth of experience makes it possible to train and test large-scale models from large amounts of data. Development of automatic speech recognition systems has motivated one of the key aspects of the presented approach in that there is a direct analogue between using hierarchical sentence, word, and phone hidden Markov models in speech recognition and the hierarchical modeling of functional elements in this work. A prohormone may be viewed as a sentence formed in a certain grammar using specific words, i.e. functional elements, which in turn are modeled by a sequence of phones, i.e. amino acids.</p><p>It is useful to differentiate between two usages of HMMs in biological sequence analysis: (1) <italic>Pairwise-HMMs</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Bucher1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> are a stochastic generalization of the sequence alignment algorithms and may be regarded as probabilistic model based counterparts of existing techniques, such as BLAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Altschul1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Their distinguishing characteristic is that as models they generate alignments of two sequences, their hidden states corresponding to insertions, deletions or substitutions. (2) <italic>Profile HMMs</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Haussler1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Krogh1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> have proven to be a major breakthrough in biological sequence analysis, enabling modeling of protein families with a high degree of functional accuracy. For over a decade they have formed the basis of the most widely used applications of sequence modeling in molecular biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Eddy1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Profile HMMs, as models, generate a single sequence with a set of hidden states corresponding to the genomic structure of the molecule.</p><p>The basic computational units in this work are Match-profile HMMs (MPHMMs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Sonmez1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Sonmez2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, which combine the capabilities of the two types of HMMs in that they can be viewed as using a profile HMM structure in modeling the sequence structure and a pairwise HMM (or a multiple-genome generalization thereof) in modeling the evolutionary characteristics of variation across species. In particular, the composite structure by which the preprohormone evolution is modeled is a <italic>hierarchical grammar</italic> of MPHMMs. Hierarchical grammars of MPHMMs are probabilistic models that take into account the manner in which substitutions take place in the evolutionary path at specific sites along the genome and the specific patterns of change from one site to the next. This kind of hierarchical alignment is significantly more informative than a conventional multiple sequence alignment (e.g., a la ClustalW) in that it provides segmentation of functional context. For example, for the peptide hormone problem, the most important feature of a cross-genome alignment turns out to be the difference between the substitution rates of the functional and the nonfunctional subsequences around (predominantly double basic residue) splicing sites.</p><p>There are several approaches in the literature for addressing similar problems. Phylogenetic HMMs, or phylo-HMMs, are probabilistic models that combine HMMs and phylogenetic trees in order to explain the spatial (genomic) and temporal (evolutionary) characteristics of a sequence, an excellent review of which is provided by Siepel and Haussler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Siepel1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The first introduction of phylo-HMMs was motivated by the need to improve phylogenetic models that allow for variation in the substitution rate across sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Felsenstein2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Yang1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>; subsequently the problem of secondary structure prediction was addressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Goldman1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Thorne1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently there is increased interest in these models as cross-genomic data become available in large quantities, and approaches that are informed by evolutionary pressures become enormously useful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Waterston1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Gibbs1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, they have been applied to cross-genome gene prediction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Pedersen1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-McAuliffe1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Another similar structure is the evolutionary HMM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Holmes1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Holmes2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> that accounts for the phylogenetic information using generalizations of pairwise-HMMs, in a way similar to our approach. Evolutionary HMMs do not model the genomic structure in a targeted manner, as we do through the use of hierarchical grammars, and the spatial part of the model is used to track shifts in phylogenetic parameters.</p><p>Recently, a paper describing a different HMM-based method for the genomic identification of neuropeptides was published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Mirabeau1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. This paper used a single species method containing the peptide features we describe here, including a signal sequence, peptide, and prohormone cleavage site. The main difference of our approach from the published work is the use of cross-species comparisons through evolutionary models. In fact, there is prior work on discovery based on genomic structure alone. The problem of computational peptide hormone discovery based on genomic structure alone proves to be difficult. For example, an attempt to build models by specifying rules via deterministic grammars within the inductive logic grammar framework is described by Muggleton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Muggleton1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. In their manuscript, by enforcing the existence of signal sequences and splicing sites through a deterministic context-free grammar, a sieve for possible prohormone sequences is proposed. Even without the insight provided by evolutionary forces, the resulting method is able to eliminate unlikely candidates, but due to the ubiquitous existence of double basic residues throughout protein sequences, its selectivity turns out to be poor. In our approach, it is because of the signature of stochastic evolutionary pressures on the protein sequences that small functional peptide islands can be identified in the midst of a sea of diverged sequences.</p><p>In addition to our proof of principle using the Swiss Prot database, we have identified a number of potential preprohormones and their proposed processed neuropeptides. There were many unknown secreted proteins identified directly from the sequence matching protocol that fit the simple criterion of a pair of basic residues surrounding 4&#x02013;50 amino acids. Visual examination of each possibility often detected reasons to decrease the likelihood that a particular protein was in fact a prohormone. There were three proteins for which we determined the presence of transcripts in the brain, and only one that was further characterized. Because preproNPQ, contains four potential biologically active agents, and because one of these was amidated, we considered this our most likely prohormone, with the most likely neurpeptide being the 14 amino acid amidated NPQ peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000258-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This peptide is conserved in mouse, dog, cow, and human sequences. It is conserved, except for a single amino acid change, as far back as fugu. The mRNA coding for this protein is found in brain, with higher levels in kidney.</p><p>Anatomical localization of preproNPQ mRNA with ISH demonstrated that its distribution is restricted to a very specific site in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000258-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000258-g008">8</xref>). Our studies indicate that preproNPQ-containing cells overlap in their distribution with cells that express CRF in Barrington's nucleus, as well as those that are serotonergic and dopaminergic in the ventrolateral PAG. These results raise the possibility that preproNPQ may be co-localized in the same neurons with these neurotransmitters. Furthermore, this peptide is distributed closely to the cholinergic neurons of the mesopontine tegmentum raising the possibility that NPQ peptides may also interact with the cholinergic system.</p><p>The functional significance of these findings will require additional behavioral and physiological investigations, but it is reasonable to speculate that NPQ peptides may be involved in regulating a number of diverse functions. These likely include regulation of urinary, gastrointestinal and general autonomic functions, since Barrington's nucleus contains neurons that send polysynaptic projections to the bladder, colon, spleen and kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Cano1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-RouzadeDominguez1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. CRF-containing neurons in the Barrington's nucleus have been proposed to play a role in mediating stress-induced colonic alterations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Valentino1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the close overlap between CRF and preproNPQ, it seems feasible that NPQ peptides may play a role in the pathophysiology of stress-induced gastrointestinal disturbances.</p><p>Along the same lines of modulation of stress responses, dopaminergic (TH-positive) neurons of the ventrolateral PAG have been shown to project to the CRF-containing area of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Meloni1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Hasue1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, where these projections have been proposed to modulate CRF-initiated startle response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Meloni1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Since we found close overlap between preproNPQ ISH signal and that for TH in the ventrolateral PAG, it is tempting to speculate that one of the NPQ peptides may play a role in regulating CRF-induced stress responses. The biological activity of the NPQ peptides is now under investigation.</p><p>Using a different HMM-based method for the genomic identification of neuropeptides, Mirabeau et al. identified two putative prohormones and processed peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Mirabeau1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. One peptide that was termed Spexin is identical to NPQ. They found spexin to co-localize with insulin in secretory granules, when transfected into rat pancreatic cells. ISH studies detected spexin mRNA only in the submucosal layer of the esophagus and stomach. Spexin mRNA was not reported in the brain. Finally, they showed that the amidated 14- amino acid peptide induced contractions of the rat fundus muscle of the stomach. This is an interesting observation, since our findings indicate that the rat almost certainly does not make amidated peptide because of the single amino acid change found within the C-terminal cleavage site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000258-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Demonstration of functional activity of this compound in the rat stomach suggests that the C-terminal portion of NPQ is likely not involved in binding to its still unidentified receptor.</p><p>The computational method that led to the discovery Spexin identified another peptide that the authors named augurin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Mirabeau1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Augurin is an uncharacteristically long peptide, 78 amino acids within a prohormone of length 148 amino acids. In terms of scoring, we are heavily penalizing peptides that are long with respect to their flanking non-functional sequences, and in the viewer, we have a filter that eliminates altogether any hit with length greater than 50&#x00025; of the whole protein length. An experiment that modified our scoring and filters to test whether our model also works for augurin, verified that augurin was indeed detected by HIGHER as an instantiation of the following structure<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000258.e030.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>in our grammar.</p><p>There are other neuropeptides, which were not identified using our MP-HMM techniques. There are several potential reasons for other missing neuropeptides, the first and probably most important of which relates to the dataset used. The datasets of known and hypothetical proteins do not contain all the preprohormones. Although the genomes of mouse and human have been sequenced, the complement of predicted proteins is constantly changing and is different in the different databases. Another reason for not identifying prohormones is that the MP-HMM methodology utilized is statistical in nature and will not necessarily identify 100&#x00025; of the target proteins. There are also many prohormones that do not have the classical profile of pairs of basic residues surrounding the neuropeptide. We are currently implementing a single basic residue algorithm based upon known splicing characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000258-Devi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> that should lead to the identification of additional neuropeptides.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have presented a computational framework that is capable of accounting for protein structure and cross-species evolutionary divergence simultaneously. By aligning low-level evolutionary HMM modules within a high-level functional-element grammar, it is possible to build precise models of the effects of evolutionary pressures on genomic structures. In particular, we have applied this technique to modeling of prohormones across species with the goal of identifying novel prohormones and associated peptide hormones based on their evolutionary divergence profiles and genomic structures. This technique has resulted in high accuracy detection in a known dataset and led to putative hormones in a set of hypothetical proteins. Biochemical validation of the findings has resulted in the initial characterization of the prohormone preproNPQ, containing four potential previously undiscovered neuropeptides.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of cDNA from Brain Using Species-Specific Primers</title><p>In order to determine if the putative transcript named preproneuropeptide Q (preproNPQ) is found in the brain, we performed PCR using rat, human and mouse specific primers with their corresponding cDNAs.
