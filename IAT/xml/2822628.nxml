We investigated its biological function in the generation of cellular immune responses using cellular prion protein gene-specific small interfering ribonucleic acid <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our results were confirmed by blocking cellular prion protein with monovalent antibodies and by using cellular prion protein-deficient and -transgenic mice. <italic>In vivo</italic> prion protein gene-small interfering ribonucleic acid treatment effects were of limited duration, restricted to secondary lymphoid organs and resulted in a 70% reduction of cellular prion protein expression in leukocytes. Disruption of cellular prion protein signalling augmented antigen-specific activation and proliferation, and enhanced T cell receptor signalling, resulting in zeta-chain-associated protein-70 phosphorylation and nuclear factor of activated T cells/activator protein 1 transcriptional activity. <italic>In vivo</italic> prion protein gene-small interfering ribonucleic acid treatment promoted T cell differentiation towards pro-inflammatory phenotypes and increased survival of antigen-specific T cells. Cellular prion protein silencing with small interfering ribonucleic acid also resulted in the worsening of actively induced and adoptively transferred experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Finally, treatment of myelin basic protein<sub>1&#x02013;11</sub> T cell receptor transgenic mice with prion protein gene-small interfering ribonucleic acid resulted in spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Thus, central nervous system autoimmune disease was modulated at all stages of disease: the generation of the T cell effector response, the elicitation of T effector function and the perpetuation of cellular immune responses. Our findings indicate that cellular prion protein regulates T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation, differentiation and survival. Defects in autoimmunity are restricted to the immune system and not the central nervous system. Our data identify cellular prion protein as a regulator of cellular immunological homoeostasis and suggest cellular prion protein as a novel potential target for therapeutic immunomodulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>small interfering RNA</kwd><kwd>prion</kwd><kwd>immunosuppression</kwd><kwd>T cell signaling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A physiological function for cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>c</sup>), a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored sialoglycoprotein, is still enigmatic. So far, PrP<sup>c</sup> has mainly been studied in the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, specifically as the substrate for the replicative cycle of prions. PrP<sup>c</sup> is highly expressed in neurons (DeArmond <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1999</xref>). However, high expression levels of PrP<sup>c</sup> in lymphoid cells (Cashman <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1990</xref>; Antoine <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2000</xref>; Durig <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2000</xref>; Li <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>) and myeloid cells (Burthem <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2001</xref>; Krebs <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2006</xref>) suggest a biological function of PrP<sup>c</sup> outside the CNS. The recently reported localization of PrP<sup>c</sup> in the immunological synapse, and its co-precipitation with the T cell receptor (TCR) (Mattei <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2004</xref>) prompted us to investigate more closely the role of PrP<sup>c</sup> in mediating T cell activation and function. The role and function of T cells in neuroinflammation can be paradigmatically examined in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of the human disorder multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Here, we silenced the PrP gene (<italic>Prnp</italic>) product with small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA). We observed a significant and selective decrease of PrP<sup>c</sup> expression in lymphoid tissue, but not in the CNS. Also, silencing of PrP<sup>c</sup> resulted in a significant worsening of clinical EAE. This finding was confirmed in genetic PrP<sup>c</sup>-deficient mice (Manson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1994</xref>) whereas mice overexpressing PrP<sup>c</sup> (Fischer <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1996</xref>) were relatively resistant to EAE induction. Finally, we were able to show that PrP<sup>c</sup> silencing in T lymphocytes accounted for the observed clinical effects through enhanced T cell activation, TCR signalling and propagation of T cell differentiation towards proinflammatory T helper cell (Th)-1 and Th17 phenotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Peptides and antibodies</title><p>The siRNAs were purchased as purified duplexes from Dharmacon RNA Technologies:</p><p><italic>Prnp</italic>-SiRNA 5&#x02032;-GUGCACGACUCAAUAdT dT; 3&#x02032;-dTdTCACGUGCUGACGCAGUUAU-5&#x02032; and nonsense siRNA 5&#x02032;-CGAACGAGUACCGUACACUdTdT; 3&#x02032;-dTdTGCUUGCUCAUGGCAUGUGA-5&#x02032;. myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)<sub>p35&#x02013;55</sub>, myelin basic protein (MBP)<sub>Ac1&#x02013;11</sub>, proteolipid protein (PLP)<sub>p139&#x02013;151</sub> and ovalbumine (OVA)<sub>p323&#x02013;339</sub> were synthesized by S.C.

For preparation of total cell lysates, cells were collected, spun down and resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate-lysis buffer. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min and spun down to remove cell debris. Total cell lysates were also made from the brains of mice using a tissue homogenizer and lysing with sodium dodecyl sulfate-lysis buffer. Protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin) were added to all lysates at the time of preparation. Prior to the western blot, the protein concentration of these extracts was determined by using the BioRad Protein Assay. The extracts were diluted in sodium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer, boiled for 3 min and were electrophorectically separated on 4&#x02013;20% sodium dodecyl sulfate&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. After transfer of the gels to nitrocellulose membranes, the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in tris-buffered saline. The primary antibody was diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer and was added to the membrane for 2 h. The membrane was washed three times in tris-buffered saline/Tween. The secondary antibody was diluted 1:1000 and was added to the membrane for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times and a chemiluminescent substrate (Bio-rad Inc.) was added for 1 min; the blot was then exposed to film for various times (0.05&#x02013;10 min). The density of the bands was determined by using ImageQuant 5.2 program. Data were normalized by dividing the density of the PrP<sup>c</sup> band by the density of the &#x003b2;-actin band.

In the EAE model of CNS autoimmunity, we describe that PrP<sup>c</sup> is an important inhibitor of peripheral immune function. Deletion, knockdown or blockade of PrP<sup>c</sup> resulted in accelerated and more severe autoimmunity while PrP<sup>c</sup> overexpression (on a PrP knockout background) resulted in diminished autoimmunity.</p><p>Consistent with recently published findings (Tsutsui <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2008</xref>; Ingram <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2009</xref>), we have found that EAE severity was significantly increased in PrP knockout mice. Based purely on the knockout results, however, it remained unclear whether the effects of PrP<sup>c</sup> on CNS autoimmunity were due to alterations in the susceptibility of the CNS to inflammation (i.e. neuronal survival) or due to alterations of the inflammatory response. Additionally, because the knockout animals lack all PrP<sup>c</sup> expression, it was not apparent whether alterations in immune function were due to defects in development or thymic negative selection. Pharmacological <italic>in vivo</italic> silencing of PrP<sup>c</sup> using <italic>Prnp-</italic>siRNA allowed us to define the role of this molecule more precisely in different disease stages. PrP<sup>c</sup> expression was effectively silenced solely in cells of the peripheral immune system but not brain tissue after treatment with <italic>Prnp</italic>-siRNA. In addition, Cy3-labelled siRNA was undetectable in CNS tissue indicating that the major location of siRNA knockdown is the periphery. Consequently, we conclude that the major effects of PrP<sup>c</sup> in EAE pathogenesis are based on the decrease in PrP<sup>c</sup> expression in lymphatic tissues. Furthermore, <italic>Prnp-</italic>siRNA administration in adult mice resulted in rapidly enhanced immune responses, thereby bypassing the potential for thymic defects to account for the observed exacerbated autoimmunity. Although we cannot discount the function of PrP<sup>c</sup> in the thymic maturation processes in the knockout mouse, it appears that PrP<sup>c</sup> disruption in the peripheral immune system is sufficient to enhance immune responses.</p><p>The finding that PrP<sup>c</sup>-silencing could exacerbate disease when delivered at the time of immunization, onset of disease, or at later stages of autoimmunity strongly suggests that PrP<sup>c</sup> is an important negative regulator of T cell responses.</p><p>Our data on <italic>in vivo</italic> T cell tracking of cells treated with fluorescent <italic>Prnp</italic>-siRNA or nonsense-siRNA strongly suggest that some of the effects we observed in mice treated with <italic>Prnp</italic>-siRNA, including the increased number of inflammatory infiltrates in the CNS, may be an indirect effect of <italic>Prnp</italic>-silencing on other lymphocyte populations, resulting in an amplification of the initial immune response. These data are complementary to observations we made in our adoptive transfer experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>E, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/awp298/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>F) and in some of the survival experiments. Specifically, <italic>Prnp</italic>-siRNA or nonsense-siRNA-transfected purified OVA<sub>323&#x02013;339</sub> TCR transgenic CD45.2<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were transferred intravenously into C57BL/6 CD45.1<sup>+</sup> wild-type mice that were immunized with OVA<sub>323&#x02013;339</sub> in complete freund's adjuvant 24 h after cell transfer to investigate whether an effect of PrP<sup>c</sup> on the survival of activated antigen-specific T cells may account for some of its effects on CNS autoimmune disease. At Day 5 post transfer, there was no difference with regard to <italic>in vivo</italic> antigen-specific proliferation between OVA<sub>323&#x02013;339</sub> TCR transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells transfected with <italic>Prnp</italic>-siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>B), or with nonsense-siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>C). In contrast, silencing of <italic>Prnp in vitro</italic> resulted in increased proliferation of bulk T cell populations obtained from splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>A&#x02013;D).</p><p>To study the role of PrP<sup>c</sup> as a negative regulator of T lymphocyte responses in more detail, we examined the effects of PrP<sup>c</sup> knockdown on T cell activation and survival.</p><sec><title>PrP<sup>c</sup> is a negative regulator of TCR signalling</title><p>We consistently observed an increased antigen-specific proliferation when PrP<sup>c</sup> was silenced only on T cells, rather than on T cells and antigen-presenting cells. At this point, we are investigating the differential effect of PrP<sup>c</sup> silencing and overexpression on different cell types. From preliminary data it appears that silencing of PrP<sup>c</sup> in dendritic cells may be pro-apoptotic, while it is anti-apoptotic in T cells.</p><p>TCR signalling is critical to the development of EAE at the immunization and elicitation phases of the disease. Among the earliest events of TCR engagement is recruitment of leukocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of the TCR zeta chain. Phosphorylated zeta serves as a binding site for ZAP-70 (Chan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">1992</xref>), which then phosphorylates numerous substrates including linker of activated T cells. Although it is so far unclear how PrP<sup>c</sup> interacts with or influences ZAP-70, PrP<sup>c</sup> immunoprecipitated with ZAP-70 in activated T cells in a previous study (Mattei <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2004</xref>).</p><p>We found an increased phosphorylation of ZAP-70 in activated T cells after PrP<sup>c</sup> silencing. Suppression of the ZAP-70 dependent pathway by PrP<sup>c</sup> was confirmed by demonstrating that basal and CD3/CD28-stimulated transcription from NFAT/AP-1, two transcription factors crucial in T cell activation and differentiation, were also enhanced upon silencing PrP<sup>c</sup> in T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>B). Interestingly, NFAT transcription was not altered in the PMA/ionomycin-stimulated T cells. Due to the fact that PMA/ionomycin induces NFAT/AP-1-dependent transcription by activation of protein kinase C/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase and calcium mobilization, respectively (Chatila <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1989</xref>; Liu and Heckman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1998</xref>), our results support the notion that PrP<sup>c</sup> functions as a regulator of TCR-proximal signalling. The <italic>in vivo</italic> importance of PrP<sup>c</sup> as a negative regulator of TCR signals was demonstrated by the increased incidence of spontaneous EAE in the autoimmune-prone MBP<sub>1&#x02013;11</sub> TCR-transgenic mice after treatment with <italic>Prnp</italic>-siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>C).</p><p>We also demonstrate that PrP<sup>c</sup> may exert an indirect immunosuppressive function by promoting T cell death. Increased numbers of antigen-specific T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> after silencing of <italic>Prnp</italic> allow several explanations: (i) a decreased sequestration of these cells from secondary lymphoid organs into other compartments; (ii) a decrease of Fas-mediated apoptotic cell death; (iii) a diminished growth factor withdrawal due to decreased antigen-specific proliferation or (iv) a push of these cells into cell cycle. The latter scenario was basically ruled out by showing that there was no difference in proliferation of antigen-specific T cells transfected with <italic>Prnp</italic>-siRNA or nonsense-siRNA. Furthermore our results on increased T cell survival <italic>in vitro</italic> after silencing of PrP<sup>c</sup> strongly argue against the hypothesis of diminished growth factor withdrawal from the <italic>Prnp</italic>-siRNA-treated cells, as more cells were competing for growth factors in a closed system for a 10 day period. These results also rule out differences in tissue sequestration between the two treatment groups. Thus, PrP<sup>c</sup> may promote apoptosis in activated antigen-specific T cells, possibly mediated through a Fas pathway, or other tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary and proposed model for PrP<sup>c</sup></title><p>In summary, we reveal PrP<sup>c</sup> as a molecule critically influencing T cell functions, by modulating TCR signals and limiting survival. We can thereby clearly assign an essential function to PrP<sup>c</sup> beyond being the replicative substrate or transport molecule for prions. Whether the conversion from PrP<sup>c</sup> to the infectious PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformer also involves changes in T cell function, and whether these have anything to do with prion disease mechanisms is currently unclear. It is possible that the effect for PrP<sup>c</sup> on regulating TCR signals may suggest a similar function in other cell types. Other cellular receptors, including the B cell receptor, Fc receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin receptor possess a similar signalling architecture as the TCR. Our observations put PrP<sup>c</sup> at the intersection of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Funding for this project was provided through a Merit Award from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
