The Dbf4p regulatory subunit binds Cdc7p and is essential for Cdc7p kinase activation, however, the N-terminal third of Dbf4p is dispensable for its essential replication activities. Here, we define a short N-terminal Dbf4p region that targets Cdc7p-Dbf4p kinase to Cdc5p, the single Polo kinase in budding yeast that regulates mitotic progression and cytokinesis. Dbf4p mediates an interaction with the Polo substrate-binding domain to inhibit its essential role during mitosis. Although Dbf4p does not inhibit Polo kinase activity, it nonetheless inhibits Polo-mediated activation of the mitotic exit network (MEN), presumably by altering Polo substrate targeting. In addition, although <italic>dbf4</italic> mutants defective for interaction with Polo transit S-phase normally, they aberrantly segregate chromosomes following nuclear misorientation. Therefore, Cdc7p-Dbf4p prevents inappropriate exit from mitosis by inhibiting Polo kinase and functions in the spindle position checkpoint.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cdc7p-Dbf4p is a two-subunit enzyme required to copy the genetic material present on every chromosome in a process termed DNA replication. Dbf4p is an essential regulatory subunit of this enzyme that likely directs the Cdc7p subunit to its targets within the cell. We found that Dbf4p physically interacts with another protein called Polo that acts during mitosis, a later step in the cell cycle when the newly copied chromosomes are equally divided to mother and daughter cells. Polo is a master regulator of mitosis and impacts many other proteins required for cell division. We determined that Cdc7p-Dbf4p is a Polo inhibitor and, further, that Cdc7p-Dbf4p delayed or prevented chromosome segregation when errors occurred during the cell division process. Interestingly, Dbf4p may bind the Polo substrate-binding domain using a type of interaction not previously described. Thus, we have uncovered a new activity for Cdc7p-Dbf4p in the cell cycle to inhibit chromosome segregation, and these findings impact multiple fields that investigate how cells accurately copy and segregate their chromosomes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate ordering of cell cycle events is an important requirement for the viability of all eukaryotic organisms. Once cells commit to duplicate their genome they must restrain mitosis until replication is complete and then accurately coordinate mitosis with cytokinesis to ensure the faithful transmission of chromosomes to daughter cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Hartwell1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, errors in cell cycle checkpoints that enforce this ordering can be deleterious for accurate chromosome transmission. For instance, DNA damage or replication fork arrest during S-phase elicits a reversible block to mitotic progression by the budding yeast Mec1p (HsATR) and Rad53p (HsChk2) checkpoint kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Allen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Weinert1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In the absence of Mec1p or Rad53p, replication fork arrest during S-phase is not sensed leading to premature mitotic events and cell death (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Osborn1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>). Additionally, since daughter cell growth is highly polarized in the budding yeast, exit from mitosis is prevented until sister chromatids segregate through the bud neck and into the daughter cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Pereira1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Pearson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This ensures that spindle disassembly and mitotic exit are not initiated until accurate chromosome partitioning between mother and daughter cells has occurred. Failure to block mitotic exit when nuclear division takes place within the mother cell results in polyploid and anucleate progeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Pereira2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-DAquino1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. It is not surprising therefore, that both entry into and exit from mitosis are delayed by cellular checkpoints that respond to replication stress, chromosome damage, or spindle disruption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Hartwell1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Errors in these mitotic checkpoints are catastrophic and result in ploidy defects and genetic alterations, which are frequently observed in human cancers (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Kops1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>The Cdc7p-Dbf4p kinase is required to catalyze the initiation of DNA synthesis at the beginning of S-phase (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Sclafani1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>). Cdc7p kinase activity is tightly regulated during the cell cycle by binding the Dbf4p regulatory subunit, which is cyclically expressed. Dbf4p accumulates in late G1, is present throughout S-phase and then is destroyed during mitosis and early G1 by anaphase promoting complex (APC)-dependent degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Cheng1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Weinreich1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, Cdc7p-Dbf4p kinase activity is low following exit from mitosis and entry into G1-phase until it is needed to initiate a new round of DNA synthesis in late G1-phase of the following cell cycle. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Cdc7p-Dbf4p activates the MCM DNA helicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Hardy1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Sato1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> that is assembled at origins of replication in early G1 in an inactive form (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Bell1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Stillman1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its essential role in replication initiation, several studies suggest that the Cdc7p-Dbf4p kinase responds to DNA damage or replication fork stalling but its precise role in these activities is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Weinreich1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Fung1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Takeda1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Together, these data suggest that the Dbf4p N-terminus encodes non-essential regulatory functions that target the kinase to particular substrates.</p><p>To identify proteins that interact with the Dbf4p N-terminus, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with an N-terminal region of Dbf4p and identified an interaction with the Cdc5p kinase, the only Polo ortholog in yeast.

Activation of the MEN is promoted by Tem1p-GTP and antagonized by Bfa1p-Bub2p, a two-component GTPase activating protein (GAP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Fesquet1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Shou1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

The Polo requirement for Dbf2p kinase activation may reflect that Polo also promotes Cdc14p release in the FEAR pathway, which primes the MEN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Visintin1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, Polo promotes accumulation of Tem1p-GTP and activation of the downstream MEN kinases Cdc15p and Dbf2p, which ultimately cause full release of Cdc14p from the nucleolus. In response to replication fork arrest, Rad53 inhibits MEN activation, which may or may not impact Polo activity since the molecular basis of this regulation is not understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Liang1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000498-Sanchez1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, Dbf4 protein is required for proper functioning of the spindle position checkpoint most likely by antagonizing the ability of Polo to promote Cdc14p release in either the FEAR or MEN pathways. Our work therefore reveals a previously unrecognized function for Dbf4p in the regulation of mitotic progression through a direct interaction with Polo.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Cdc5p Polo-Box Domain Interacts with the Dbf4p N-Terminus</title><p>We conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the Dbf4p N-terminus (residues 67&#x02013;227) and recovered multiple clones encoding the polo-box domain (PBD) of Cdc5p.

These data suggest that phosphorylation of Dbf4p is not crucial for Polo binding. Our observation that the Dbf4p PIR purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> directly interacted with the Polo PBD also supports this notion.

Our data clearly demonstrate a role for Dbf4p in inhibiting mitotic exit, since loss of the Dbf4p PIR suppressed both <italic>cdc5</italic> and <italic>dbf2</italic> ts mutants and allowed sustained Cdc14p phosphatase release and cytokinesis in the <italic>cdc5-1</italic> mutant at the NPT. However, during an unperturbed cell cycle the absence of this regulation had little impact.

What remains unclear however, is whether this Dbf4p activity is regulated following activation of the SPOC. For instance, Cdc7p-Dbf4p may inhibit Polo to buffer against premature release of Cdc14p during late S-phase or early M-phase whether or not the SPOC is activated. Therefore, in the absence of the Dbf4p-Polo regulation Polo may prematurely activate the MEN before a nuclear orientation defect is sensed by the SPOC. Following APC-Cdc20p and APC-Cdh1p activation during anaphase onset and exit, we suggest that degradation of Dbf4p provides a positive feedback loop for full Polo activation of the MEN and ultimately, cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>How Does Dbf4p Inhibit Polo and Mitotic Exit?</title><p>Dbf4p did not influence Polo protein levels or overall kinase activity.

Our observation that the <italic>dbf2-1</italic> temperature sensitivity was also suppressed by loss of the Dbf4p PIR suggests that Dbf4p may specifically inhibit Polo activation of Dbf2p kinase independently of Bfa1p-Bub2p phosphorylation.

Deletion of the Dbf4p PIR also did not allow rebudding in the presence of spindle poisons as seen in <italic>bub2&#x00394;</italic> mutants, again suggesting that Dbf4p plays a minor or redundant role to inhibit Polo phosphorylation of Bfa1p-Bub2p.</p><p>Cdc7p-Dbf4p kinase phosphorylated the Polo PBD <italic>in vitro</italic> suggesting that Cdc7p-Dbf4p may antagonize Polo substrate binding.
