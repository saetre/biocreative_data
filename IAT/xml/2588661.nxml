They are ubiquitously present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and modify the steady-state level of DNA supercoiling. Biochemical analyses indicate that Topoisomerase 3&#x003b1; (TOP3&#x003b1;) functions together with a RecQ DNA helicase and a third partner, RMI1/BLAP75, in the resolution step of homologous recombination in a process called Holliday Junction dissolution in eukaryotes. Apart from that, little is known about the role of TOP3&#x003b1; in higher eukaryotes, as knockout mutants show early lethality or strong developmental defects. Using a hypomorphic insertion mutant of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>top3&#x003b1;-2</italic>), which is viable but completely sterile, we were able to define three different functions of the protein in mitosis and meiosis. The <italic>top3&#x003b1;-2</italic> line exhibits fragmented chromosomes during mitosis and sensitivity to camptothecin, suggesting an important role in chromosome segregation partly overlapping with that of type IB topoisomerases. Furthermore, AtTOP3&#x003b1;, together with AtRECQ4A and AtRMI1, is involved in the suppression of crossover recombination in somatic cells as well as DNA repair in both mammals and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Surprisingly, AtTOP3&#x003b1; is also essential for meiosis. The phenotype of chromosome fragmentation, bridges, and telophase I arrest can be suppressed by At<italic>SPO11</italic> and At<italic>RAD51</italic> mutations, indicating that the protein is required for the resolution of recombination intermediates. As At<italic>rmi1</italic> mutants have a similar meiotic phenotype to At<italic>top3&#x003b1;</italic> mutants, both proteins seem to be involved in a mechanism safeguarding the entangling of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The requirement of AtTOP3&#x003b1; and AtRMI1 in a late step of meiotic recombination strongly hints at the possibility that the dissolution of double Holliday Junctions via a hemicatenane intermediate is indeed an indispensable step of meiotic recombination.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The topoisomerases of the class IA are present in all three eukaryotic kingdoms&#x02014;plants, fungi, and animals&#x02014;and are involved in DNA replication and DNA repair. During the course of their action, they introduce transient single-strand nicks into DNA. In higher eukaryotes, two different classes of the enzymes are present: TOP3&#x003b1; and TOP3&#x003b2;. TOP3&#x003b1; is essential, as disruption of its function usually results in lethality of the affected organism. Using a mutant of TOP3&#x003b1; that retains some activity, we show that the protein has multiple, different functions in the model plant <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Besides its action in somatic cells, where it is required for mitosis as well as DNA repair, we demonstrate that TOP3&#x003b1; together with its protein partner RMI1 is essential for meiosis. Here, both proteins are involved in DNA recombination&#x02014;the exchange of information between parental chromosomes. Disruption of either TOP3&#x003b1; or RMI1 leads to grave defects and an early termination of meiosis, resulting in the sterility of the mutant plants. Our detailed analysis indicates that both proteins are involved in a late step of meiotic recombination, in a mechanism that prevents entanglement of the parental chromosomes. Thus, meiotic recombination seems to be more complex than previously anticipated.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Topoisomerases are enzymes with crucial functions in DNA metabolism.

Topoisomerases are required for cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, recombination and chromatin remodeling to release topological forces by cleaving the DNA backbone in a reversible manner. Topoisomerases are sorted into two basic classes that differ in their ability to create either single strand (class I) or double strand breaks (class II). They can be subdivided into two classes each, which have been defined either by their chemical properties (IA and IB) or by structural differences between the enzymes (IIA and IIB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Champoux1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Corbett1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. There are three topoisomerases in yeast: TOP1, 2 and 3. In contrast to TOP1 and 2, which are well characterized and involved in DNA replication (TOP1, type IB) or decatenation of linked chromosomes (TOP2, type IIA), the role of TOP3 (type IA) is poorly understood. Mutants of <italic>TOP3</italic> in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> show hyper-recombination, chromosome instability and do not sporulate, whereas <italic>top3</italic> mutants in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> are lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Gangloff1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Goodwin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In higher eukaryotes, two homologues of TOP3 were found and annotated as TOP3&#x003b1; and &#x000df;, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Hanai1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Wilson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. A knockout of <italic>TOP3&#x003b1;</italic> leads to early embryogenic lethality in mice and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and to pleiotropic effects, such as germ cell proliferation abnormalities in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Kim1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Plank1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

We recently demonstrated that a T-DNA insertion line of Arabidopsis TOP3&#x003b1; (<italic>top3&#x003b1;-1</italic>) also exhibits severe developmental defects resulting in lethality of the plantlets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Hartung1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In animals and plants, TOP3&#x003b1; proteins show an intimate physical and genetic interaction with one or more RecQ helicases. A tripartite protein complex indeed exists and consists of i) a RecQ helicase; ii) a TOP3&#x003b1; homolog and iii) a recently characterized protein named BLAP75 (for <underline>Bl</underline>ooms <underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>p</underline>rotein 75kd, in mammals) or Rmi1 (for <underline>R</underline>ecQ <underline>m</underline>ediated <underline>i</underline>nstability 1, in yeast) that mediates the complex formation of all three proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Chang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Yin1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Representative meiotic stages of PMCs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000285-g005">Figure 5</xref>. In the early stages of meiosis, the <italic>top3&#x003b1;-2</italic> mutant appears normal, and the first defects become visible during the late prophase when more than five bivalent structures appear, indicating the presence of breaks in the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000285-g005">Figure 5</xref> B2). In metaphase I, further chromosome condensation is disturbed and fragmentation becomes more visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000285-g005">Figure 5</xref> B3).

During anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes separated to the poles (A4) and decondensed in telophase I (A5). During anaphase II, the chromatids slightly condensed and separated (A6), followed by another decondensation phase in telophase II and ended up in tetrads (A7).

For At5g63540, we performed a cDNA analysis obtaining the same sequence that was deposited in the GenBank database and predicted as a hypothetical protein of 644 amino acids (acc. no. AY735746). Interestingly, the genes of AtTOP3&#x003b1; and AtRMI1 (At5g63540) are located in close vicinity on chromosome V, spaced by only 130 kilobases.

It seems that during meiosis, both TOP3&#x003b1; and RMI1 are essential for the proper resolution of homologous chromosomes, as mutations in both genes show very similar meiotic defects. The most intriguing feature is that TOP3&#x003b1; as well as RMI1 mutants do not progress through meiosis past telophase I. This is in contrast to all meiotic mutants described in plants to date, which all complete meiosis even if chromosome fragmentation occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Caryl1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Mercier1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The telophase I arrest found here is most likely due to the fact that the homologous chromosomes (HC) are not separated properly, and a signal to proceed with meiosis, which may require resolution of the chiasmata between HC, is not given. An alternative explanation might be that the meiotic abrogation occurs due to the extensive damage that may mechanically hinder the progression of meiosis. Conversely, severe damage also accumulates in other meiotic mutants, which are still able to enter meiosis II.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Role of TOP3&#x003b1;/RMI1 during Meiotic Recombination</title><p>Our data unambiguously demonstrate that both TOP3&#x003b1; and RMI1 are required in the late steps of meiotic recombination. It is difficult, however, to define their particular role in detail. The lack of either TOP3&#x003b1; or RMI1 clearly leads to plain sterility due to meiotic arrest during telophase I, as the proteins appear to be involved in the resolution of recombination intermediates. A major question of debate has been what the nature of Holliday Junction resolvases responsible to resolve the CO-structures during meiosis. It has been shown that at least two different complexes are present in most eukaryotes. One protein complex consists of the MUS81/EME1 endonuclease, and the other is associated with RAD51C and XRCC3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Bleuyard1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Taylor1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. As it is generally assumed that such an enzyme complex should be able to resolve dHJs into COs, we are reluctant to assume that TOP3&#x003b1;/RMI1 are participating in CO-formation because both proteins are involved in the suppression of COs in somatic cells. Furthermore, topoisomerases of class I are not classical HJ resolvases. Together with the help of a helicase, dHJs can be transformed into hemicatenanes, which then can be resolved into two unlinked double strands by topoisomerase-mediated strand passage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Schwacha1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The classical DSB repair (DSBR) model predicts a dHJ as the key intermediate, whose resolution leads to either CO or nCO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Szostak1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. This theoretical prediction has been sustained later on the molecular level in yeast by 2D gel analysis, demonstrating that the dHJ is a major heteroduplex intermediate in yeast meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Schwacha1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Schwacha2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. A revised model of meiotic recombination was suggested in 2001. It was postulated that a major number, if not all nCO recombinants, do not arise from dHJs but rather from synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) using an intermediate D-loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Allers1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-McMahill1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. The revised DSBR model involves an intermediate called single end invasion (SEI), which occurs at the transition state between D-loop and dHJ during yeast meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Hunter1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. It was proposed that the CO-decision is made very early during leptotene/zygotene, probably by a differential loading of RAD51 or DMC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Hunter1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Zickler1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Taking the revised model into account, it is tempting to speculate that TOP3&#x003b1;/RMI1 may function at the resolution step of dHJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000285-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Our hypothesis is that TOP3&#x003b1;/RMI1 acts as a type of safeguard system to resolve dHJs to nCO that were not resolved by a bona fide resolvase, even though they had been channelled into the CO pathway. This mode of dHJ resolution by a topoisomerase type I has was proposed long ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Thaler1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Schwacha and Kleckner also discussed this potential resolution of mature dHJs via a topoisomerase function as either an alternative to the modified DSBR model or as a backup mechanism for the resolution of an HJ that aberrantly persists beyond pachytene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Schwacha1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. We favour the hypothesis that the resolution step in the CO pathway of meiotic recombination is either surprisingly error prone or rate limiting. Whenever HJ resolution fails, only the alternative dissolution of an HJ into nCO guarantees the progression of meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Allers1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Hunter1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Failure of the TOP3&#x003b1;/RMI1 function could lead to the persistence of HJs that would have been processed into hemicatenane structures. These structures, however, could only be cleaved by a topoisomerase and no longer by a resolvase. Thus, due to mechanical shearing of the irresolvable interlinked homologues, we observed the fragmentation of chromosomes and telophase I arrest. An alternative explanation would be that TOP3&#x003b1; is specifically required in meiotic chromosome condensation during or after recombination to remove torsional stress. If the enzyme is not functional, chromosome breakage may occur. We, however, disfavour this hypothesis as at least yeast TOP3, in contrast to TOP1 and 2, is insufficient to remove supercoils <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Kim2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, it is not clear why an RMI1 homologue would be involved in such a function as, in contrast to TOP3&#x003b1;, it is not required for mitosis in Arabidopsis.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Safeguarding Meiosis</title><p>Our results demonstrate that both genes, TOP3&#x003b1; and RMI1, are essential for proper meiotic progression, and if disturbed, result in fragmented chromosomes and meiotic arrest at telophase I. In an independent study, the group of Mathilde Grelon (Chelysheva et al., submitted to PLoS) identified RMI1-deficient plants in a screen for sterile Arabidopsis mutants. Their detailed analyses of the meiotic role of RMI1 are in complete accordance with our results presented here. Moreover, they showed that RMI1 is not required for synaptonemal complex formation. Analyzing crosses between <italic>rmi1</italic> and <italic>dmc1</italic> or <italic>rad51</italic>, they were further able to demonstrate that the protein is required for meiotic DSBR using either the homologue or the sister chromatid as a template.</p><p>Thus, two independent studies strongly indicate that higher eukaryotes possess a safeguard mechanism to guarantee the untangling of homologous chromosomes in the late meiotic prophase. This process seems to be conserved in yeast as it has been demonstrated that the mutation of the unique TOP3 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> leads to both mitotic defects and sterility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Gangloff1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Gangloff2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Although no detailed cytological analysis was performed, it could be demonstrated that the phenotype was the result of a defect in meiotic recombination.</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that the role of TOP3&#x003b1;/RMI1-1 in meiosis is functionally related to their roles in suppression of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) during replication in mitosis. Nevertheless, both processes seem to be different because in plants, RECQ4A is also involved in SCE suppression along with TOP3&#x003b1; and RMI1. The fact that <italic>recq4a</italic> mutants are fertile does not necessarily imply that RECQ4A has no role in meiosis. It has been recently shown that SGS1, the unique RecQ homologue of yeast, is indeed directly involved in meiosis by suppressing formation of joint molecules comprising three and four interconnected duplexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Oh2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Important aims of future research will therefore be to elucidate the role of AtRECQ4A in meiois as well as to identify the putative helicase that, according to our hypothesis, might be involved in the dissolution of dHJs in concert with AtTOP3&#x003b1; and AtRMI1 in meiosis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Molecular Characterization of the T-DNA Insertion Lines and RACE</title><p>The genotyping of the different mutants was perfomed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000285-Hartung1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> using primers flanking the T-DNA insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000285-g001">Figure 1A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000285.s003">Table S1</xref>).
