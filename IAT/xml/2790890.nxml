We previously observed that in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a single <italic>DOT1</italic> gene encodes two Dot1 protein species. Here, we show that the relative abundance of the two isoforms changed under nutrient-limiting conditions. A mutagenesis approach showed that the two Dot1 isoforms are produced from two alternative translation start sites as a result of leaky scanning by the ribosome. The leaky scanning was not affected by the 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-untranslated regions of <italic>DOT1</italic>, indicating that translation initiation is determined by the <italic>DOT1</italic> coding sequence. Construction of yeast strains expressing either one of the isoforms showed that both were sufficient for Dot1&#x02019;s role in global H3K79 methylation and telomeric gene silencing. However, the absence of the long isoform of Dot1 altered the resistance of yeast cells to the chitin-binding drug Calcofluor White, suggesting that the two Dot1 isoforms have a differential function in cell wall biogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Dot1 is a histone methyltransferase that was originally identified in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The enzyme, which is conserved from yeast to humans, catalyzes mono-, di- and trimethylation of lysine 79 on histone H3 (H3K79), a residue located on the nucleosome core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). In yeast, Dot1 methylates &#x0223c;90% of histone H3 and is involved in gene silencing, activation of the DNA damage response and the pachytene checkpoint in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). In addition, genetic interactions have been reported between <italic>DOT1</italic> and different genes involved in cell wall biogenesis, suggesting a function for Dot1 in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In mammals, Dot1 plays a role in Ras-induced gene silencing and aldosterone-induced gene repression as well as in inappropriate gene activation in certain types of leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13">10&#x02013;13</xref>).</p><p>Our antibodies directed against yeast Dot1 detect two protein species on immunoblots, even though the protein is encoded by a single gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Several mechanisms can result in the formation of two different protein species from one gene. First, full-length proteins can be processed by proteases, resulting in the generation of N- or C-terminally truncated forms. Second, several posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination can result in an altered mobility of proteins on immunoblots. Finally, different protein isoforms can be generated by alternative translation, which can be caused by variations in the mRNA sequence (for example due to alternative mRNA splicing or alternative transcription start site selection) or by the usage of multiple translation start sites. Translation from multiple start codons can occur when the mRNA contains an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), or when the ribosome scanning over the mRNA molecule skips the first start codon and subsequently initiates translation from a downstream alternative start codon, a phenomenon called &#x02018;leaky scanning&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Alternatively, the ribosome can bind to the mRNA on the 5<bold>&#x02032;-</bold>side of the start codon via the normal mechanism, but then jumps over the first start codon to initiate transcription from a downstream start codon, a process called ribosome shunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Translation start site selection is a highly regulated process that is critical for differential gene regulation in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Mutations that affect translation initiation have been associated with a range of genetic diseases in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, there are still many open questions regarding the molecular mechanisms of start codon selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we determined the mechanism by which the two Dot1 isoforms are generated. We show by protein tagging, protein truncation and mutational analysis that they are the result of leaky scanning by the ribosome. This enabled the construction of yeast strains expressing either one of the isoforms. The two Dot1 isoforms were found to have indistinguishable functions in global methylation and gene silencing. However, they showed distinct functions in resistance to the chitin-binding molecule Calcofluor White (CFW), suggesting that they play different roles in cell wall biogenesis. Our results suggest that leaky scanning of the <italic>DOT1</italic> mRNA is affected by sequences downstream of the start codon, whereas the efficiency of translation initiation is usually thought to depend mainly on the 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-context of the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The discovery of unconventional leaky scanning events like the one reported here will be instrumental to unravel the complex mechanisms that regulate translation initiation in yeast and higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, plasmids and media</title><p>Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Yeast media were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Silencing assays were performed using media containing 1 g/l 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) (Toronto Research Chemicals). CFW sensitivity of cells was tested using YEP media containing 20 &#x000b5;g/ml CFW (Sigma). Cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to the media at a concentration of 50 &#x000b5;g/ml to inhibit protein synthesis. NKI3031 was derived from a cross between BY4740 and BY4742 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). NKI3049 and NKI3066 were derived from NKI3031 by integration of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter in front of the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene using plasmid pYM-N22 and PCR-mediated gene replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>); in NKI3049 the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter was integrated such that 62 bp of the endogenous <italic>DOT1</italic> 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-untranslated region was maintained, whereas in NKI3066 the endogenous <italic>DOT1</italic> 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>-UTR was replaced by <italic>GAL1</italic> and vector sequence present in pYM-N22. NKI1060 was constructed from UCC7164 using PCR-mediated gene replacement and plasmid pFA6a-KanMX-PGAL1-3HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The single-copy pLEU2-DOT1 vector (pDOT1) and the multi-copy <italic>GAL1</italic>-promoter pTRP1-DOT1 plasmid (pFvL18) were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene in these plasmids were introduced by Quikchange (Stratagene) or a three-step PCR protocol and verified by sequencing. Details of the mutant <italic>DOT1</italic> genes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A. pFvL201 was generated by replacing the first methionine of <italic>DOT1</italic> in pDOT1 by a single FLAG tag followed by a SGGSGG spacer. pFvL212 was derived from pRS314-DOT1 (single-copy pTRP1-DOT1) by integration of a GSGGSGGS spacer, single HA TAG and TAP tag behind the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene; the TAP tag sequence was amplified from pBS1479 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). pFvL215 was generated by deletion of amino acids 4&#x02013;20 from pFvL212 by gap-repair. pFvL221 was generated from pFvL18 by integration of a GSGGSGGS linker behind the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene. pTW055 was derived from pFvL221 by insertion of the yeast-enhanced citrine tag from plasmid pKT211 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) behind the linker using an AatII-AscI digest. Mutations in pTW055 were generated by integrating the SalI-EcoRI fragment from pGH03 and pGH04 in SalI-EcoRI digested pTW055 to generate pGH024 and pGH025, respectively. <table-wrap id="T1"

The slow-migrating protein is usually more abundant than the fast-migrating protein. The goal of this study was to determine the identity, regulation and the function of the two protein isoforms of Dot1. Since Dot1 is involved in activation of the DNA damage checkpoint upon exposure to UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), we tested whether the relative abundance of the two proteins was affected by DNA damage. Thirty minutes after UV irradiation, there was no detectable difference in relative abundance of the two isoforms, while phosphorylation of the central checkpoint kinase Rad53 confirmed activation of the DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). To investigate whether the production of the two isoforms was regulated by growth conditions, exponentially growing cells were compared with cells arrested by nutrient depletion. After starving the cells for two days, the abundance of the slow-migrating Dot1 protein was reduced while the fast-migrating protein was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). This change in the ratio of the Dot1 isoforms probably does not reflect a difference in protein stability, since the two isoforms showed approximately the same rate of degradation when protein synthesis was blocked by addition of cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). These results show that the relative abundance of the two Dot1 isoforms is dependent on growth conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>A long and a short Dot1 protein</title><p>Our aim was to express the two Dot1 isoforms separately in yeast, to determine whether the existence of the two isoforms and the differential expression is relevant for the function of Dot1. Therefore, first the mechanism of production of the two isoforms was determined. Previous results had shown that the addition of a single N-terminal FLAG tag to the Dot1 protein resulted in a shift in mobility as well as expression of only one Dot1 isoform [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>)]. In contrast, introduction of a TAP tag at the C-terminus of Dot1 (and the concomitant replacement of the <italic>DOT1</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR with that of the <italic>ADH1</italic> gene) did not affect the expression of the two isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G). However, an internal deletion of amino acids 4&#x02013;20 (Dot1&#x00394;4&#x02013;20) resulted in the expression of only one Dot1 isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G). These results indicated that the protein sequence or the coding sequence of the first 20 amino acids was involved in the expression of the two isoforms. These results also suggested that the production of two isoforms was not caused by a posttranslational modification of Dot1 because the double band was disrupted by two non-overlapping mutations: N-terminal tagging (which affects the N-terminal residue of Dot1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F) as well as an internal deletion (which leaves the first three N-terminal residues of Dot1 intact; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G).</p><p>The Dot1&#x00394;4&#x02013;20 protein migrated at approximately the same size as the smaller isoform of Dot1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G), suggesting that the slower migrating Dot1 band might represent the full-length protein and the fast-migrating band a Dot1 protein that is missing part of the N-terminus. A smaller protein can be generated by degradation or protein processing of a larger protein or by alternative translation. Inspection of the coding sequence of Dot1 showed that it contains a second in frame AUG codon (AUG17), 16 codons downstream of the first AUG (AUG1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Alternative translation initiation at this second start codon would give rise to a Dot1 protein 16 amino acids shorter than the full-length protein. To distinguish between protein processing and alternative translation as the mechanisms responsible for Dot1 isoform production, point mutations were introduced in the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene expressed from a single-copy plasmid. The wild-type and mutant plasmids were then introduced in <italic>dot1&#x00394;</italic> strains. First two frameshift mutants (FSMs) were generated by introduction of an extra base between the first and the second AUG (FSM1 and FSM2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Both of these insertions result in a stop codon at amino acid position 10, which prevents the generation of full-length Dot1. We reasoned that if the smaller protein is generated by processing of the full-length protein, the frameshift mutations should destroy production of both full length and the smaller Dot1 protein. In contrast, if it is generated by alternative translation, frameshift mutations should not affect production of the smaller Dot1 isoform. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, when the FSMs were expressed in yeast, the short isoform was still present whereas the larger isoform was absent. These experiments rule out the possibility that the smaller Dot1 protein is a processed form of the full-length protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Two Dot1 isoforms as a result of alternative translation</title><p>To confirm that the two Dot1 isoforms are generated as different translation products from the two start codons present in the 5&#x02032;-part of the <italic>DOT1</italic> coding sequence the first or the second AUG was mutated. Mutation of AUG1 to ACU, changing the initiator Met codon to a non-initiator Thr codon (Dot1-M1T) resulted in the expression of a single protein that had the same size as the small isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), confirming that translation can initiate at a downstream start codon. Mutation of AUG17 to UUA, changing the initiator Met codon to a Leu codon (Dot1-M17L) generated a single protein with the same size as the large isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), showing that translation starts at AUG1 as well as AUG17. These results suggest that the two isoforms are indeed two translation products starting at M1 or M17, respectively.</p><p>Next, the cause of alternative translation was investigated. Two translation products can be generated from two different transcript molecules: one initiated upstream of the first AUG, and one initiated in between the first and second AUG. Alternatively, they can be generated from a single long transcript by alternative start codon usage. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the endogenous <italic>DOT1</italic> promoter was replaced by the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, which is induced when cells are grown in media containing galactose. In this case, 54 bp of the <italic>DOT1</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTR was retained to avoid changes in the context of the start codon. When Dot1 was expressed from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, the two isoforms were generated in the same ratio as found when the gene was expressed from its endogenous promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Since it is unlikely that two unrelated promoters use identical transcription start sites (i.e. upstream of the first AUG and in between the first and second AUG) and with identical relative frequencies, this result suggests that the two isoforms are not generated by alternative transcription start site selection.</p><p>Alternative translation can be caused by ribosome shunting, by leaky scanning of the ribosome or by an IRES. In ribosome shunting, which has mainly been described for viruses, the ribosome binds to the mRNA on the 5&#x02032;-side of the start codon via the normal mechanism, but then `jumps&#x02019; over the first start codon to initiate transcription from a downstream start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In leaky scanning, the ribosome does scan over the first start codon but does not recognize it in a significant fraction of initiation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). An IRES is an mRNA sequence that has special structural properties allowing the recruitment of ribosomes without using the standard mechanism of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>To address the mechanism of alternative translation, the <italic>DOT1</italic> promoter and the complete 5&#x02032;-UTR were replaced by an exogenous <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter and 45 bp of non-yeast vector sequence immediately upstream of the open reading frame of <italic>DOT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). As a control, the <italic>DOT1</italic> promoter was replaced by the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter cassette such that 62 bp of the endogenous <italic>DOT1</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTR was retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). When transcription from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter was induced, the two isoforms were generated in approximately the same ratio in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F), suggesting that the 5&#x02032;-context of the start codon did not affect the initiation of translation. Therefore, ribosome shunting was not a likely cause of the alternative translation. We note that the overall Dot1 abundance was higher in the presence of the heterologous 5&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F), indicating that the 5&#x02032;-UTR might affect mRNA stability or transcription.</p><p>Most IRES elements are over 100 bp long, even though the minimal IRES modules may be shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The few bases between the first and second start codon of Dot1 seem insufficient to constitute an IRES. Leaky scanning by the ribosome thus seemed to be the most plausible explanation for the generation of the two isoforms. To verify this, a new start codon was inserted in between AUG1 and AUG17 at position 7 by changing the Ile codon to an initiator Met codon (I7M, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). If an IRES element was the cause of the alternative translation, the Dot1-I7M mutation could have two different effects. This mutation might interfere with the activity of the IRES element, resulting in loss of expression of the shorter isoform. Alternatively, the mutation could leave initiation at AUG17 unaffected, which would lead to normal expression of the two isoforms. In contrast, if leaky scanning was the cause of the alternative translation, skipping of AUG1 would lead to translation initiation at the new start codon AUG7 and thereby prevent translation start at AUG17. When the Dot1-I7M mutant was expressed two isoforms were produced, but the smaller one had become slightly larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>G). Although the effect of the 10 amino acid size difference was small, we consistently detected a slower migration of the short isoform in the Dot1-I7M mutant in multiple independent experiments (data not shown). This result shows that translation initiated at the new start codon, indicating that the two isoforms of Dot1 result from leaky scanning by the ribosome.</p><p>More support for this model comes from the Dot1-M1T and Dot1-M17L mutants in which only one of the isoforms is expressed. In the wild-type <italic>DOT1</italic> transcript skipping of the first AUG occurs in a fraction of the translation events. However, if the first AUG is mutated, every ribosome will start translation from AUG17, which is expected to lead to an increase in abundance of the short Dot1 protein. This is indeed what was observed in the Dot1-M1T mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). This was not the case in the FSMs, in which AUG1 was still present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). As expected, in the Dot1-M17L mutant the larger isoform was expressed at the same level as in wild-type cells, indicating that mutation of the downstream AUG had no major effects on translation initiation at AUG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). We note that no smaller isoforms of Dot1 are detected in this mutant suggesting that no proteins were produced by translation initiation at a downstream start codon such as AUG40.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of leaky scanning</title><p>Little is known about factors that affect leaky scanning. The 5&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene is unlikely to be involved in determining the efficiency of translation initiation because replacement of the complete <italic>DOT1</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTR by an exogenous sequence did not significantly affect the rate of leaky scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). The efficiency of translation initiation is thought to be mainly determined by the nucleotide sequence upstream of the start codon, as a consequence of the linear scanning of the ribosome along the mRNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The Kozak consensus sequence defines the optimal context for translation initiation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), but the requirements in yeast seem less strict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Recently, a genome-wide computational study showed that there is a strong bias in the yeast genome for an A at position &#x02013;3 and a C at position +5. Presence of these residues was also correlated with the strength of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). According to these observations AUG1 of the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene is not located in an optimal context, with a G at position &#x02212;3 and a G at position +5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). In contrast, AUG17 does have an optimal sequence context. To test if the &#x02212;3 and +5 positions determine the efficiency of translation initiation of AUG1 of <italic>DOT1</italic>, they were mutated to the optimal A&#x02013;3 and C + 5, both separately and in combination. However, in these mutants the two Dot1 isoforms were still produced with approximately the same ratio as in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), showing that the sub-optimal proximal context of AUG1 is not the cause of leaky scanning. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Effect of sequences proximal to the start codon on leaky scanning.

Although this structure has not been experimentally determined, the RNA fold algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) predicts that the region of the mRNA around AUG1 contains a stem loop, which might somehow impair the binding of initiation factors or the polymerase complex to this sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). To test this idea, mutations were made that were predicted to disrupt the overall structure of this part of the <italic>DOT1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and C). Although these mutations slightly increased the expression of Dot1, none of the mutations affected the rate of leaky scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and D).

In addition, there was no difference in activation of the DNA damage response after UV irradiation (data not shown).</p><p>Genetic interactions of <italic>DOT1</italic> indicate that Dot1 might have a function in cell wall biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). To verify this notion, the sensitivity to the antifungal agent CFW was examined of yeast cells with or without Dot1. Altered sensitivity to CFW is an indication of a defect in chitin biosynthesis and/or cell wall biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). When yeast cells were grown on rich media containing galactose cells lacking Dot1 were more resistant to CFW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), lending support to the idea that Dot1 is required for cell wall function. To examine whether the two Dot1 isoforms might have differential functions in cell wall biogenesis, we tested whether strains expressing either one of the isoforms showed altered sensitivity to CFW. Two strains were constructed in which the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter and a 3xHA tag were integrated either upstream of AUG1 of the endogenous <italic>DOT1</italic> coding sequence (<italic>P<sub>GAL1</sub>-3HA-DOT1</italic>) or immediately downstream of AUG17, thereby deleting the first 17 amino acids (<italic>P<sub>GAL1</sub>-3HA-DOT1&#x00394;1-17</italic>). In both cases, a single protein species was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). These promoter-integration strains were used instead of strains expressing Dot1 from a plasmid since CFW is unstable in synthetic media necessary to ensure propagation of the plasmids. The strain expressing only full-length Dot1 from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter was as sensitive to CFW as the wild-type strain. In contrast, the strain expressing only the short form of Dot1 was more resistant to CFW, just like a <italic>dot1&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). This result suggests that the N-terminus of Dot1 influences its cell wall-related function. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Dot1 is involved in cell wall function.

However, no differences were observed for any of the conditions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp765/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). To assess a possible function for Dot1 in cell wall biogenesis more directly, electron microscopy was used to visualize the yeast cell wall in wild-type cells, <italic>dot1&#x00394;</italic> cells and cells expressing only full-length Dot1 or only the short isoform from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. As a control, <italic>kre1&#x00394;</italic> cells were used, which have been reported to lack the outer layer of the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), as is also clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C. Whereas the cell wall of wild-type cells and <italic>dot1&#x00394;</italic> cells has a finely delineated outer layer, this layer was somewhat less structured and more rough in texture in cells overexpressing only full-length Dot1, and especially in cells overexpressing only the short Dot1 isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). This result supports the notion that Dot1 affects cell wall metabolism. However, this function of Dot1 is found only when Dot1 is overexpressed and is not differentially affected by the two isoforms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Yeast cells express two isoforms of the H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1. Using mutational analysis, we determined that alternative translation by leaky scanning results in the expression of a full-length protein and a shorter Dot1 protein lacking the first 16 amino acids. Starved cells lose expression of full-length Dot1 and maintain the short Dot1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), suggesting that the leaky scanning of the <italic>DOT1</italic> transcript is dependent on growth conditions.</p><p>The two isoforms showed indistinguishable localization, bulk H3K79 methylation and silencing properties, indicating that the global activity of Dot1 is not affected by its N-terminus. However, yeast cells expressing either one of the two Dot1 isoforms showed a modest but reproducible difference in sensitivity to CFW. Since CFW has a high affinity for chitin in the cell wall of fungi, cells that are resistant to CFW are thought to have a defect in chitin biosynthesis and/or cell wall biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Interestingly, the Dot1 homolog in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>grappa</italic>, has also recently been implicated in stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Our results suggest that cells expressing the wild-type Dot1 products or only the full-length protein are more sensitive to CFW than cells lacking Dot1 or expressing the short Dot1 protein only. Thus, the Dot1&#x00394;1-17 protein does not complement the loss of Dot1, suggesting that the sensitivity to CFW is mediated by the N-terminal part that is missing in the Dot1 protein synthesized after leaky scanning. Inspection of the cell wall by electron microcopy revealed no difference between wild-type and <italic>dot1&#x00394;</italic> cells, suggesting that the CFW resistance is not caused by large structural re-arrangements of the cell wall. However, the outer layer of the cell wall had a slightly altered structure in cells overexpressing either isoform of Dot1 compared to wild-type or <italic>dot1&#x00394;</italic> cells. This effect was strongest in cells expressing only the short Dot1 isoform. These results suggest that loss of the Dot1 N-terminus causes subtle changes in cell wall metabolism probably related to chitin deposition, whereas overexpression of Dot1 causes more pronounced changes of the cell wall.</p><p>Two previous studies have reported genetic interactions between <italic>DOT1</italic> and genes involved in cell wall assembly and chitin synthesis. Deletion of <italic>DOT1</italic> is synthetically lethal with deletion of either <italic>CHS5</italic>, encoding a protein that regulates targeting of the chitin synthase Chs3 to sites of polarized growth, or of <italic>GAS1</italic>, a gene required for cell wall assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). <italic>CHS5</italic> also shows genetic interactions with <italic>BRE1</italic> and <italic>LGE1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), which encode subunits of the H2B ubiquitin ligase complex and are required for efficient H3K79 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). However, expression of <italic>GAS1</italic> and <italic>CHS5</italic> was unaffected in strains lacking Dot1 or expressing either one of the two isoforms in the absence or presence of 20 &#x003bc;g/ml CFW (data not shown). The same was true for four genes that are induced by high CFW concentrations (<italic>ARO9</italic>, <italic>YEA4</italic>, <italic>FUR4</italic> and <italic>TUS1</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) (data not shown). In addition, in genome-wide expression profiling studies, loss of <italic>DOT1</italic> had no or only a very minor effect on genome-wide transcription levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). We note that in contrast to the functions of Dot1 in telomeric silencing and the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), our results suggest that the cell wall function of Dot1 is independent of global methylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Therefore, mechanism by which Dot1 affects the yeast cell wall is still elusive.</p><p>The two isoforms of the Dot1 protein in yeast are the result of leaky scanning. Leaky scanning is a common phenomenon in mammals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and a few examples have been described in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). However, it is unclear how frequent the leaky scanning mechanism is in yeast. In higher eukaryotes, there are strict requirements for the sequence context around the start codon to allow efficient translation initiation. The optimal sequence is defined by the Kozak rule: a purine at position &#x02013;3 and/or a G at position +4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In yeast, these residues seem to be less critical for the initiation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, a recent computational study demonstrated a strong bias in yeast for an A at position &#x02013;3 and a C at position +5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Our studies show that changes in position &#x02212;3 and +5 had very little, if any, effect on leaky scanning of AUG1 of <italic>DOT1</italic>. Moreover, even replacement of the complete <italic>DOT1</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTR by an exogenous sequence did not significantly affect the rate of leaky scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). Together these results strongly suggest that the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene is not a factor in determining the efficiency of translation initiation.</p><p>Besides a sub-optimal sequence context, the length of the mRNA leader sequence can also contribute to leaky scanning. Some mRNA transcripts have a 5&#x02032;-leader sequence that is too short for the ribosome to bind efficiently, leading to skipping of the first start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). A leader shorter than 12 nucleotides has been shown to promote leaky scanning, and increasing the leader to more than 20 nucleotides restores proper initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Recently, the transcription start sites of most yeast genes have been mapped using RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). This study showed that the mRNA transcript generated from the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene has a 5&#x02032;-leader sequence of &#x0223c;80 bps, which is longer than the median of all genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) and much longer than the minimal length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Thus, it is very unlikely that the first AUG is positioned too close to the 5&#x02032;-end of the mRNA to be recognized by the ribosome. Translation can also be affected by the 3&#x02032;-UTR of a transcript. In mammals and plants, binding of a microRNA to its recognition sequence in the 3&#x02032;-UTR of a target mRNA can inhibit cap-dependent translation initiation by a mechanism that is not yet well-understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). In addition, in specific tumor cells, the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the Her-2 oncogene can override translational inhibition of the Her-2 mRNA, showing that such mechanisms are important in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). In the case of the <italic>DOT1</italic> transcript, however, the 3&#x02032;UTR is not a key factor in translation initiation because introduction of a C-terminal tag and thereby replacing the endogenous <italic>DOT1</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR with the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>ADH1</italic> gene did not affect the synthesis of the two Dot1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G). This indicates that leaky scanning of the <italic>DOT1</italic> mRNA is affected by features in the open reading frame of the gene. Interestingly, several cases have been reported for a role of downstream coding sequences in translation initiation in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). However, mutagenesis of the sequence proximal to the initiator codon did not affect the rate of leaky scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that sequences more downstream are involved.</p><p>One possibility is that the structure of the Dot1 RNA molecule affects the efficiency of translation initiation. However, mutation of the sequences immediately downstream of the initiator codon that were predicted to disrupt a putative stem-loop did not affect the rate of leaky scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Another possibility might be that the sequence between AUG1 and AUG17 contains several &#x02018;uncommon&#x02019; codons for low-abundance tRNAs. If this is the case, production of the long isoform would be energetically more taxing for the cell and leaky scanning might therefore be favorable. However, inspection of the codons between AUG1 and AUG17 suggests that this is unlikely. Only three of the 15 codons have the lowest usage frequency for the amino acid they encode. Furthermore, the average codon usage of the 15 codons (0.024) is higher than the average codon usage for all yeast genes (0.016). Thus, the mechanism by which the open reading frame of the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene affects leaky scanning is still unclear.</p><p>Recent RNA sequencing of the yeast transcriptome predicts that transcripts of as many as 321 yeast genes (&#x0223c;6% of the yeast genome) contain small open reading frames (uORFs) upstream of the first in-frame start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Moreover, uORFs are present in almost half of all human and mouse transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). A number of uORFs have now been shown to control translation of the downstream gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>) and a key question is how the start codons of the uORFs of a gene are used or skipped to tune the efficiency of protein expression. The frequent occurrence in eukaryotic mRNAs of upstream AUGs or sub-optimal start codons indicates that alternative translation initiation plays an important role in regulation of protein expression and might be more widespread than thought previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). The discovery of alternative translation events like the one described here will be instrumental for understanding the mechanisms of translation start site selection.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp765/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>EU 6th framework program NOE &#x02018;The Epigenome&#x02019; (LSHG-CT-2004-503433); the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (Special Fellow 3409-04 to F.v.L.); VIDI grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (to F.v.L.).
