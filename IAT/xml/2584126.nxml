Moreover, skeletal muscle has insulin-independent mechanisms to increase glucose transport, including the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by stimuli, such as hypoxia, ischemia, or exercise, although the precise role of AMPK in exercise-induced glucose uptake is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). The AKT substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) has emerged as a point of convergence for both effectors of glucose transport and seems to modulate GLUT4 trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Because skeletal muscle accounts for the majority of glucose disposal in the body it is, therefore, the major site for suffering insulin resistance. Obesity is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes, due in part to the fact that adipose tissue secretes cytokines that may influence insulin sensitivity. Among these molecules, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and interleukin (IL)-6 have been proposed as a link between obesity and insulin resistance because <italic>1</italic>) the majority of type 2 diabetic patients are obese, <italic>2</italic>) TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 are overexpressed in adipose tissues of obese animals and humans, and <italic>3</italic>) elevated plasma concentrations of IL-6 are detected in obese and insulin-resistant patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). We previously investigated how TNF-&#x003b1; treatment induces a state of insulin resistance in vivo and in vitro at the level of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Accordingly, we identified the Ser307 residue in IRS-1 as a site for TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;impaired insulin signaling in myotubes, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibitor &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B) kinase are involved in the phosphorylation of this residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>).</p><p>The role of IL-6 in the etiology of insulin resistance is not fully understood and has been a matter of controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). Pretreatment with IL-6 in vivo blunted the ability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production and to stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). However, other studies reported a lack of effect or a positive effect of IL-6 on whole-body glucose disposal in rats and humans, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Alternatively, IL-6 induced insulin resistance in hepatocytes, adipocytes, and myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). In addition, palmitate-induced IL-6 production led to inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myocytes, as demonstrated by the prevention of these effects with anti&#x02013;IL-6 or anti&#x02013;Toll-like receptor-2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). The IL-6 protein content in adipose tissue has been negatively correlated with insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, and a chronic elevation of IL-6 is not desirable because it may compromise insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). Furthermore, a single polymorphism in the IL-6 gene promoter has been linked to reduced insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, skeletal muscle also secretes IL-6. After exercise, IL-6 plasma levels rise because of increased local production in muscle, and this increase may enhance substrate metabolism and whole-body glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). In this regard, an impaired ability to exercise and to oxidize fatty acids was observed in the IL-6 knockout mouse at 3 months of age, and by age 9 months, these mice were obese and insulin-intolerant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). The role of IL-6 seems to be anti-inflammatory in such physiological situations. Accordingly, in this study, we have evaluated the impact of IL-6 treatment on insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle cells depending on the duration of exposure.</p><p>Nuclear receptors comprise a superfamily of related proteins that act as transcription factors for target genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. These proteins are activated by naturally produced lipids and by synthetic compounds, some of which display insulin-sensitizing effects and anti-inflammatory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). Thus, the effectiveness of different nuclear receptor agonists to overcome IL-6&#x02013;induced insulin resistance has also been evaluated in this work.</p><p>Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) acts as a physiological negative regulator of insulin, which increases expression in muscle and adipose tissue of obese and diabetic humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). In this regard, transgenic overexpression of PTP1B in muscle decreased glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>); meanwhile, ablation of PTP1B specifically in this tissue improved systemic insulin sensitivity when on a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Furthermore, mice lacking PTP1B also exhibit increased insulin sensitivity under both dietary or polygenic insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). We recently found upregulation of PTP1B by TNF-&#x003b1; and protection against insulin resistance by this cytokine in mice and cells lacking PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Accordingly, our final goal was to investigate whether PTP1B deficiency confers protection against insulin resistance by IL-6.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Insulin, AICAR, Wortmannin, 4-(&#x0005b;E&#x0005d;-2-&#x0005b;5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl&#x0005d;1-propenyl) benzoic acid (TTNPB), phytanic acid, rosiglitazone, and antibody anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-ACTIN were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); PD169316, PD98059, and compound C were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA); SP600125 and GW501516 were from Alexis (Lausen, Switzerland); IL-6 was from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN); T0901317 was from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI); WY14643 was from Biomol (Plymouth, U.K.).

IL-6 treatment increased glucose uptake by 40&#x00025; at 3 h, and this effect was maintained for 24 h (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), with optimal stimulatory effect at 20 ng/ml (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). IL-6 treatment activated AMPK for 24 h with a peak of phosphorylation at 3&#x02013;6 h but failed to activate AKT (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Moreover, IL-6 also induced phosphorylation of JNK1/2, p38MAPK, and ERK1/2 for 24 h and activated the degradation of I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; between 3 and 24 h, with total levels of these proteins and &#x003b2;-ACTIN remaining unchanged.</p><p>To investigate the signaling pathways involved in the induction of glucose uptake by IL-6, we blocked AMPK, JNK1/2, and AKT by the use of chemical inhibitors and siRNA (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). The stimulatory effect of IL-6 at 3 h on glucose uptake was completely impaired by compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK activity that did not preclude its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>), but was not impaired by wortmannin or SP600125, inhibitors of AKT and JNK1/2, respectively. Moreover, when AMPK&#x003b1; was knocked down with siRNA, IL-6 failed to activate glucose uptake, an effect that was not observed with JNK1/2 or control siRNA. These data seem to indicate that activation of glucose uptake by IL-6 is dependent on the activation of AMPK. Accordingly, we further explored the mechanism by which IL-6 activates AMPK by examining LKB1, an upstream activator, and ACC and AS160, downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>). IL-6 treatment for 3 h produced the sequential phosphorylation of LKB1, AMPK, ACC, and AS160 in C2C12 cells, and phosphorylation of ACC and AS160 was prevented by compound C. When AMPK&#x003b1; was knocked down with siRNA, a robust 80&#x00025; reduction of AMPK protein was detected, and, therefore, phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC, and AS160 by IL-6 was completely impaired.</p></sec><sec><title>Short-term IL-6 treatment displays an additive effect with insulin on glucose uptake, but chronic treatment with this cytokine causes insulin resistance in myotubes.</title><p>We explored whether the duration of exposure to IL-6 was affecting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes. Pretreatment with IL-6 for 3 h and stimulation with insulin for 30 min resulted in an additive effect on glucose uptake that was not observed after treatment with the cytokine for 6 h (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). However, insulin did not further stimulate glucose uptake after chronic treatment (24 h) with IL-6, and this inhibitory effect was dose dependent and maximal at 20 ng/ml (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). In parallel, the phosphorylation of AKT by insulin detected in cells pretreated with IL-6 for 3 h was impaired at 24 h (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). AKT phosphorylation was detected as early as after 5 min of insulin stimulation and remained increased for at least 30 min, the time required for optimal translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (supplementary Figure S1, which is available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1062">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1062</ext-link>). Insulin decreased the activation of AMPK by IL-6 at 24 h but not at 3 h. AS160 was phosphorylated by IL-6 and insulin individually, and when combined, an additive effect was produced at 3 h of IL-6 treatment. In contrast, complete inhibition of AS160 phosphorylation was observed at 24 h. These results indicate a reciprocal negative cross talk in the signaling pathways elicited by insulin and IL-6 under chronic treatment with the cytokine.</p><p>Because mouse C2C12 myotubes did not have an efficient insulin-sensitive phenotype in term of glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>), we explored whether chronic treatment with IL-6 was producing insulin resistance in rat primary neonatal myotubes, a system previously shown to be sensitive to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Insulin stimulation significantly increased (80&#x00025;) glucose uptake in neonatal myotubes (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>). Cells pretreated with IL-6 for 24 h showed a 40&#x00025; higher glucose uptake than untreated cells, but under this circumstance, insulin did not further stimulate glucose uptake. The expression of GLUT4 or GLUT1 was not modified by chronic treatment with IL-6 (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>). When examining GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane by Western blot (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>F</italic></xref>) or indirect immunofluorescence (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>G</italic></xref>), both insulin and IL-6 individually produced this effect, but when cells were pretreated with IL-6 for 24 h, insulin failed to translocate GLUT4.</p></sec><sec><title>Long-term IL-6 treatment inhibits insulin-induced glucose transport by impairing insulin signaling at the level of the IRSs in a JNK-dependent manner.</title><p>To investigate whether the sustained activation of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, or JNK1/2 by IL-6 could be contributing to insulin resistance, these pathways were blocked with chemical inhibitors as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). In the presence of inhibitors, no significant changes in insulin- or IL-6&#x02013;stimulated glucose uptake were detected either in C2C12 myotubes or neonatal myotubes (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). However, treatment with SP600125 but not with PD98059 or PD169316 completely restored insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in the presence of IL-6 in both cell types. These data seem to indicate that although IL-6 activates several stress kinases, it is mostly JNK1/2 that contributes to the IL-6 inhibitory effect on insulin action in myocytes. This hypothesis was confirmed by the use of JNK1/2 siRNA, which completely restored insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the presence of IL-6 (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>The next step was to identify at which level IL-6 was interfering with the insulin-signaling cascade and whether that interference could be avoided when inhibiting JNK1/2. Insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and serine phosphorylation of AKT was significantly impaired under chronic treatment with IL-6, without significant changes in the expression of these proteins (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Moreover, IL-6 produced phosphorylation on the Ser307 residue of IRS-1 in a JNK-dependent manner (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). Accordingly, treatment with SP600125 completely restored phosphorylation of IRS-1 and AKT by insulin in the presence of IL-6. All of these data indicate that IL-6&#x02013;impaired insulin activation of IRS/AKT signaling cascades in a JNK-dependent manner, in a similar fashion as detected for glucose uptake. This hypothesis was confirmed when the JNK1/2 protein was almost completely knocked down (90&#x00025;) by the use of siRNA, which totally blocked phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Ser307) and reestablished insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in the presence of IL-6 (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Liver X receptor agonists restore insulin action in the presence of IL-6 by downregulation of <italic>socs3</italic> and <italic>ptp1b</italic> expression.</title><p>To overcome insulin resistance produced by chronic treatment with IL-6, we used ligand activation of nuclear receptors as a pharmacological approach (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). From the various compounds tested, only the liver X receptor (LXR) agonists, GW3965 and, to a lesser extent, T0901317, completely restored insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the presence of IL-6, in a similar fashion to that observed with AKT phosphorylation (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Furthermore, glucose uptake was not only normalized by GW3965 treatment but, in fact, improved greatly by increasing GLUT4 protein content (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), as previously detected in brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>).</p><p>Induction of SOCS3 has been proposed as a mechanism for IL-6&#x02013;induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>).

The expression of <italic>socs3</italic> increased by 40 and 90&#x00025; after 3 and 6 h of IL-6 treatment, respectively (data not shown), although maximal accumulation (fourfold) was detected at 24 h (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>).

However, IL-6 effects on PTP1B expression and activity were completely prevented by treatment with GW3965 or SP600125.</p></sec><sec><title>PTP1B-deficient myocytes do not develop insulin resistance to glucose uptake by IL-6.</title><p>Because IL-6 upregulated PTP1B expression, we decided to explore whether the lack of PTP1B might confer protection against IL-6&#x02013;induced insulin resistance (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Wild-type myocytes displayed insulin resistance to glucose uptake by chronic IL-6 treatment in a similar fashion as C2C12 myotubes or neonatal myotubes (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). However, insulin was able to stimulate glucose uptake in PTP1B<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> myocytes regardless of the presence of IL-6. Moreover, in wild-type myocytes, insulin resistance was detected in terms of tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 and serine phosphorylation of AKT (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). However, PTP1B-deficient cells displayed activated insulin signaling regardless of the presence or absence of IL-6. Furthermore, IL-6 increased the protein content of PTP1B in wild-type cells, although the content of other phosphatases, such as SH-PTP2 or PP2A, remained unaltered.</p></sec><sec><title>Modulation of insulin sensitivity by IL-6 in mice: a lack of PTP1B prevents chronic effects of IL-6.</title><p>Our last step was to study whether IL-6 might modulate insulin sensitivity in vivo in a similar fashion as observed in vitro. Accordingly, GTTs and ITTs were performed in wild-type male mice treated for various times with IL-6 (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). An improvement in GTTs was observed in mice treated for 3 h with IL-6. However, pronounced and sustained hyperglycemia was found in mice treated with IL-6 for 48 h. No effect was observed at 24 h. Regarding ITTs, an increase in insulin sensitivity was observed in mice at 3 h of IL-6 treatment, without change at 24 h. However, impairment of the hypoglycemic effect of insulin was produced at 48 h (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). The fact that PTP1B-deficient mice showed normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity after 48 h with IL-6 (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>) indicates that the lack of PTP1B might protect against systemic insulin resistance by chronic treatment with this cytokine. Finally, when we studied the impact of treatment with IL-6 in insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, again a dual effect was found. At the short term (3 h), IL-6 activates AMPK without affecting AKT phosphorylation by insulin. Separately, IL-6 and insulin activate the phosphorylation of AS160, and together, this effect was additive (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). In contrast, chronic treatment (48 h) with IL-6 completely impaired insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation without changes in the amount of total AKT protein in wild-type mice (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>). However, skeletal muscle from PTP1B-deficient mice showed insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT regardless of the presence of IL-6. Moreover, an enhancement of PTP1B protein content in muscle was found in IL-6&#x02013;treated wild-type mice. Altogether, these results seem to indicate that the absence of PTP1B in mice confers protection against systemic and muscular insulin resistance by the chronic presence of IL-6.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>IL-6 has been described as a proinflammatory cytokine that can contribute to insulin resistance in peripheral tissues when overproduced by adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). However, IL-6 is also expressed by skeletal muscle during exercise, with positive metabolic effects that can modulate insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). So far, the data regarding the impact of IL-6 in muscle insulin sensitivity are highly controversial. Accordingly, in this study, we explored the hypothesis that IL-6 effects in skeletal muscle cells may depend on the duration of exposure. Although IL-6 per se activated glucose uptake, a dual effect on insulin action was observed: short-term IL-6 treatment was additive to insulin on activating glucose uptake and AS160 phosphorylation, which resulted in an improvement on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice, whereas chronic exposure produced insulin resistance both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>IL-6 activates glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner regardless of the time of treatment as a consequence of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane in C2C12 myotubes and neonatal myotubes, in a similar fashion as reported in L6 cells and human skeletal muscle strips, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). We observed that IL-6 induces the sequential phosphorylation of LKB1, AMPK, and AS160. LKB1 was phosphorylated by IL-6 at Ser431, although the state of phosphorylation of this kinase did not significantly affect LKB1 catalytic activity or its cellular location, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). Furthermore, direct inhibition of AMPK activity with either compound C or siRNA in the presence of IL-6 blocked phosphorylation of AS160 and impeded glucose uptake. Activation of AMPK by IL-6 was previously observed in skeletal muscle, whereas diminished AMPK activity was found in muscle from the IL-6 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). Moreover, deficiency of LKB1 in skeletal muscle was reported to prevent AMPK activation and glucose uptake during contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>), although muscle contraction activates AMPK by a mechanism independent of direct activation of LKB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). However, recent observations indicate that activation of AMPK by cytokines, such as adiponectin, involves activation of LKB1 in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>).</p><p>Short-term (3 h) pretreatment with IL-6 followed by acute insulin stimulation produced an additive increase in glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes. This increase is a consequence of the activation of AMPK and AKT by IL-6 and insulin, respectively, and is additive to AS160 phosphorylation, as observed in C2C12 cells and in skeletal muscle, in agreement with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). Moreover, an improvement in GTTs and ITTs was observed in mice treated for 3 h with IL-6. This situation can mimic the positive effect of IL-6 on insulin sensitivity when released from muscle after exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>), as schematized in <xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. Chronic exposure (24 h) to IL-6 impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in both C2C12 and neonatal myotubes. Accordingly, insulin-stimulated IRS-1 and AKT phosphorylation was inhibited by IL-6. Moreover, no phosphorylation of AMPK or AS160 was detectable, a fact that indicates a reciprocal negative cross talk in the signaling pathways elicited by insulin and IL-6 under chronic treatment with the cytokine. Furthermore, IL-6 treatment for 48 h also impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle in vivo and caused systemic insulin resistance as observed from GTTs and ITTs. This situation imitates the chronic elevation of IL-6 that causes insulin resistance when secreted by adipose tissue in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). This dual behavior of IL-6 in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake has been previously observed in human skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>); meanwhile, inhibition of insulin signaling by IL-6 was reported in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Reconciliation of our observation of systemic and muscular insulin resistance in mice treated with IL-6 for 48 h with the maturity-onset obesity and insulin-intolerance phenotype developed by IL-6&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>) is not a simple matter. Accordingly, a very recent study describes reduced body weight under chronically elevated IL-6 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). However, these mice also show impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by skeletal muscle, in agreement with our data. Furthermore, a marked inflammation was observed in the liver, an organ whose contribution to the development of insulin resistance by IL-6 cannot be ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanism underlying IL-6&#x02013;mediated insulin resistance could involve activation of proinflammatory kinases, SOCSs, and phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). In this regard, activation of JNK1/2, accumulation of <italic>socs3</italic> mRNA, and increases in <italic>ptp1b</italic> mRNA and activity were detected in murine myotubes. We found that chronic IL-6 treatment produced phosphorylation of IRS-1 at the residue Ser307, in a JNK-dependent manner, in a similar fashion to that described in other insulin-resistant states, such as hyperinsulinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>) and TNF-&#x003b1; treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Accordingly, inhibition of JNK1/2 completely restored insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin signaling in the presence of IL-6. Moreover, IL-6 upregulated SOCS3, which could bind to IR on a key residue for the recognition of IRS-1, inhibiting its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>). Furthermore, we found for the first time that IL-6 increased PTP1B expression and activity, in line with recent observations of overexpression of PTP1B associated with TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). The fact that SP600125 blocked the accumulation of <italic>socs3</italic> and <italic>ptp1b</italic> mRNA by IL-6 seems to indicate that activation of JNK1/2 could be involved in the regulation of these genes, in agreement with the proposed role of JNK in SOCS3 induction by IL-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>). Accordingly, IL-6 impairs insulin signaling at the level of IRS-1 by three mechanisms that involve <italic>1</italic>) serine phosphorylation by JNK, <italic>2</italic>) impairment of tyrosine phosphorylation by SOCS3, and <italic>3</italic>) tyrosine dephosphorylation by PTP1B (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>When a pharmacological approach was used to ameliorate IL-6&#x02013;induced insulin resistance, only the synthetic LXR agonists GW3965 and T0901317 completely restored insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, an effect that was not produced by peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor (PPAR) &#x003b4; agonist, although both PPAR&#x003b4; and LXR&#x003b2; are expressed in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>). This is the first time that the ability of LXR agonists to ameliorate insulin resistance induced by IL-6 is documented, although PPAR&#x003b3; agonists have been reported to overcome such resistance in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). The effect produced by GW3965 on glucose uptake was parallel to a downregulation of <italic>socs3</italic> and <italic>ptp1b</italic> gene expression and to the recovery of insulin phosphorylation of AKT (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). It is worth mentioning that inhibition of PTP1B activity by rosiglitazone and T0901317 was reported in skeletal muscle and brown adipocytes under insulin-resistant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>). The mechanism of this inhibitory action is unknown, and thus far no LXR response elements have been identified on the <italic>ptp1b</italic> promoter, although the expression of other genes such as matrix metalloproteinase-9, induced by cytokines, was repressed by LXR activation in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>). Furthermore, recent observations from our laboratory seem to indicate that LXR agonists could exert anti-inflammatory properties antagonizing JNK activation by TNF-&#x003b1; in adipose tissue (S.F.-V., M.L., unpublished data). Whether this mechanism might operate in the presence of IL-6 remains to be established.</p><p>Finally, this study demonstrates that the deficiency in PTP1B confers protection against IL-6&#x02013;induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle either in vitro or in vivo, in agreement with the protection against systemic insulin resistance observed in mice.</p><p>In conclusion, IL-6 produces a dual effect on insulin sensitivity in myocytes and skeletal muscle: additive at the short term and negative after chronic exposure. The mechanism by which long-term IL-6 treatment causes insulin resistance involves activation of JNK1/2, expression of <italic>socs3</italic>, and activation of PTP1B. Accordingly, a decrease in <italic>ptp1b</italic> gene expression by treatment with LXR agonists or by genetic ablation confers protection against insulin resistance by this cytokine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db07-1062_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db07-1062_db07-1062[1].suppl.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants BFU-2005-03054 from Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia (Spain) and S-SAL-0159-2006 from Comunidad de Madrid.

Results are means &#x000b1; SE of eight animals for each group. &#x0002a;<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 versus corresponding vehicle-treated mice. Mice treated or not for 3 h (<italic>C</italic>) or 48 h (<italic>D</italic>) with IL-6 were subjected to anesthesia, and &#x0223c;200 mg muscle of one hind leg was removed. Insulin was injected intraperitoneally, and a similar amount of muscle of the other hind leg was removed from the mouse 15 min after insulin infusion. Western blot analysis of phosphorylated and/or total AMPK, AKT, AS160, and PTP1B in muscle lysates from wild-type and/or PTP1B-deficient mice were performed. Representative immunoblots of four independent experiments are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zdb0120855210006"></graphic></fig><fig position="float" id="f7"><label>FIG. 7.</label><caption><p>Dual role of IL-6 in modulating insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. IL-6 per se increases GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane by activating the LKB1/AMPK/AS160 pathway. A dual effect on insulin action is observed when myotubes are exposed to this cytokine. Short-term IL-6 treatment has an additive effect with insulin on glucose uptake, mimicking the positive effect of IL-6 on insulin sensitivity when released from muscle after exercise. However, chronic exposure (such as when secreted by obese adipose tissue) produces insulin resistance, with impaired GLUT4 translocation and defects in insulin signaling. Accordingly, IL-6 impairs insulin signaling at the level of IRS-1 by three mechanisms that involve <italic>1</italic>) serine phosphorylation by JNK, <italic>2</italic>) impairment on tyrosine phosphorylation by SOCS3, and <italic>3</italic>) tyrosine dephosphorylation by PTP1B. LXR agonists and SP600125 overcome such resistance by producing downregulation of SOCS3 and PTP1B expression and inhibition of JNK, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zdb0120855210007"></graphic></fig></floats-wrap></article>
