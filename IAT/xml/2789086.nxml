The effect of mating on intraoviductal ESR1 or ESR2 signaling was then explored comparing the expression of E2-target genes c-fos, brain creatine kinase (Ckb) and calbindin 9 kDa (s100g) in rats on C1 or P1 treated with selective agonists for ESR1 (PPT) or ESR2 (DPN).

Mating affected the subcellular distribution of both receptors as well as the response to E2. In C1 and P1 rats, PPT increased Ckb while both agonists increased c-fos.

Mating affected intraoviductal ER-signaling and induced loss of functional involvement of ESR2 on E2-induced accelerated egg transport. These findings reveal a profound influence on the ER signaling pathways exerted by mating in the oviduct.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>It is well recognized that in the female mammal ovarian steroids, embryonic signals or mating-associated signals regulate egg transport through the oviduct (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). In cyclic rats, oocytes reach the uterus approximately 72 h after ovulation, whereas in pregnant rats embryos take 96 h. Oocytes take 96 h to traverse the oviduct in rats made pseudopregnant by mechanical stimulation of the cervix in the evening of proestrus, therefore the above difference is dependent on mating-associated signals rather on whether eggs are fertilized or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Eggs cross the ampullary-isthmic junction 9 h earlier and egg surrogates move at higher speed in the isthmic segment with most of them arriving earlier to the intramural segment in pregnant rats than in cycling rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus, a broad change occurs in oviductal functioning elicited by mating-associated signals.</p><p>A single injection of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) on day 1 of the cycle or pregnancy shortens oviductal transport of eggs from the normal 72-96 h to less 24 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Previously, we demonstrated that inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis block E<sub>2</sub>-induced oviductal embryo transport acceleration in pregnant rats, but fail to do so in cyclic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, in cyclic rats exogenous E<sub>2 </sub>activates protein phosphorylation in the oviduct via a nongenomic pathway, since such activation occurs when mRNA synthesis is completely suppressed by &#x003b1;-Amanitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Estradiol-induced phosphorylation is essential for its effect on oocyte transport in cycling rats since local administration of a broad-spectrum inhibitor of protein kinases totally blocks the effect of E<sub>2 </sub>on egg transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, E<sub>2 </sub>accelerates oviductal egg transport through nongenomic pathways in cyclic rats, while it does it through genomic pathways in pregnant rats. Recently, this change in pathways has been designated "intracellular path shifting" (IPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Further investigation has shown that activity of the enzyme Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) is higher in the oviduct of cyclic than pregnant rats while OR486 a selective inhibitor of COMT blocked the effect of E<sub>2 </sub>on oviductal egg transport only in cyclic rats suggesting that decreased activity of oviductal COMT induced by mating is one of the underlying mechanisms of IPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although the physiological relevance of IPS has not been clearly established it is probable that decrease in the COMT activity induced by mating in the oviduct protects the embryos from the deleterious effect that methoxyestradiols exert during the first stages of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Estrogens induce cellular changes in their target organs through several different mechanisms that involve activation of estrogen receptors (ER). The two main forms of ER, ESR1 and ESR2 (formerly known as ER-&#x003b1; and ER-&#x003b2;), have distinct tissue expression patterns in both humans and rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The antiestrogen ICI 182780 blocks E<sub>2</sub>-induced egg transport acceleration in cyclic and pregnant rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] indicating that ER participates in both the genomic and the nongenomic pathways involved in the kinetic action of E<sub>2 </sub>on the oviduct. However, we have found that levels of ESR1 and ESR2 mRNA and protein in oviducts of pregnant rats were similar to those oviducts of cycling rats, suggesting that IPS is not explained by changes in the expression of ER in the oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Herein, we determined the effect of mating on subcellular distribution and functionality of ESR1 and ESR2 in the rat oviduct. First, we compared immunoreactivity of both ER associated to cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus between epithelial cells of the ampullary and isthmic segments of cyclic and pregnant rats following treatment with E2. We also determined the effect of selective agonists for ESR1 (PPT) or ESR2 (DPN) on mRNA levels of three E2-inducible genes c-fos, brain creatine kinase (Ckb) and calbindin 9 kDa (s100g) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in the oviduct of pregnant and cyclic rats. Additionally, the role of ESR1 and ESR2 on oviductal egg transport was evaluated in cyclic or pregnant rats treated with PPT or DPN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Sprague-Dawley rats (bred in house) weighing 200-260 g were used.

Oviductal RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) and 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA of each sample was treated with Dnase I Amplification grade (Invitrogen). The single-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase First Strand System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol.

The fixed samples were washed three times with phosphate buffer, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and infiltrated with LR Gold (Plano, M&#x000fc;nchen, FRG). Subsequently, the samples were transferred to gelatine capsules filled with 0.8% (w/v) benzoyl peroxide in LR Gold and kept for polymerization at a pressure of 500 mmHg. The blocks were cured for 1-2 days at room temperature before sectioning with a Sorvall-2000 ultramicrotome using a diamond knife. The sections (50-80 nm) were mounted on formvar-coated nickel grids and incubated on droplets of 0.1 M glycine in PBS pH 7.6, and subsequently blocked with 1% bovine foetal serum for 2 h at room temperature. The grids were then incubated for 2 h with a rabbit anti-ESR1 (MC-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-ESR2 (clone 68-4, Chemicon International, Billerica, MA) at 1:50 dilution. After washing with PBS, the preparations were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated to 10 nm gold particles (Kirkegaard &#x00026; Perry Laboratories Inc, Gaithersburg, MD) diluted 1:30.

Receptor immunoreactivity was found associated with the nucleus, cytoplasm and plasma membrane, including cilia, of the epithelial cells. Data for subcellular distribution of ESR1 in ampulla and isthmus are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Mating increased the immunoreactivity of ESR1 in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of the ampullary segment although it did not affect the ESR1 immunoreactivity in the isthmus. In cyclic rats, E<sub>2 </sub>treatment increased the density of ESR1 labeling in all three compartments from both segments, except the nucleus of the isthmic segment, whereas in pregnant rats a major increase in labeling was observed only in the cytoplasm of the isthmic segment. Mating decreased immunoreactivity of ESR2 in the cytoplasm of the ampullary and isthmic segments although it increased labeling of ESR2 in the plasma membrane of the isthmus. In cyclic rats, E<sub>2 </sub>decreased ESR2 density in the cytoplasm in the ampulla and in the nucleus of the isthmus, whereas in pregnant rats, E<sub>2 </sub>increased the density of ESR2 labeling in the cytoplasm in the ampulla and decreased it in the plasma membrane and nucleus in the isthmus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Previous works have reported presence of ESR1 and ESR2 in the epithelium and smooth muscle layers of the ampullary and isthmic segments of the rat oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Here, we show for the first time that ESR1 and ESR2 were found associated to the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus of the epithelial cells of both oviductal segments in the rat. This is in agreement with previous immunoelectron microscopy studies reporting localization of ESR1 in non-nuclear sites in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Other studies have also shown the presence of ESR1 and ESR2 in non-nuclear sites of various cell types using western blot or ligand-blot of subcellular enriched fractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Ligand activation of ER associated to cell membrane and cytoplasm can modulate downstream pathways that induce discrete signaling responses, including stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in breast and vascular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], activation of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>flux in arterial smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or the cascade Src/Ras/ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our findings provide evidence of the presence of multiple pools of ER that could initiate genomic and nongenomic responses to E<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the data reported here show a dynamic behavior of these ER pools in response to mating-associated signals and to an E<sub>2 </sub>pulse.</p><p>Since mating induces IPS we expected that pregnant and cyclic rats would exhibit different ER subcellular distribution, e.g. higher ESR1, ESR2 or both in the nuclear compartment. However, quantitative analyses showed that mating increased the number of both receptors only in the non-nuclear compartments. Furthermore, when E<sub>2 </sub>was administered to pregnant or cyclic rats receptor immunoreactivity also accumulated in the non-nuclear compartments. Thus, IPS occurs independently of the changes in the distribution of ESR1 and ESR2 in the oviductal epithelial cells induced by mating. ESR1 and ESR2 are also expressed in the mucosa and muscle layer of the rat oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] so that it is possible that mating stimulates accumulation of ER in the nuclear compartment of other cell types. The changes described in gold particle density may reflect either change in antibody accessibility to immunoreactive epitopes or true changes in the expression level of ER. The current data does not allow to distinguish between these two possibilities but increases up to ten fold 3 hours after E<sub>2 </sub>administration seem more plausible as a result of ER dissociation from scaffolding proteins than a result of de novo synthesis. In fact, previously we have found that levels of ESR1 and ESR2 mRNA and protein in whole oviducts of pregnant rats were similar to those in oviducts of cycling rats, suggesting that mating does not regulate global expression of ER in the oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>We observed different responses in the subcellular distribution of ER in the epithelial cells of the two oviductal segments. It is known that the relative proportion between ciliated and secretory epithelial cells varies considerably from ampulla to isthmus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] so that is probable that mating-associated signals may have acted differentially on these two cell types. Further analysis that segregates the responses of ciliated from secretory epithelial needs to be done. It has been reported that in the rat, E<sub>2 </sub>acts only in the isthmic segment to accelerate egg transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] while that isthmus-specific apoptosis of epithelial cells and activation of cilia-localized ESR2A induced by clomiphene citrate act in parallel to block egg transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, it is probable that differences in the distribution of ESR1 and ESR2 between ampulla and isthmus could reflect specific contribution of these segments to signals provided by E<sub>2 </sub>to regulate egg transport. Furthermore, we did not discard the possibility that E<sub>2 </sub>acts directly on the smooth muscle cells because it has been found presence of ESR1 and ESR2 in the myosalpinx of the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, ESR1 and ESR2 were also observed associated with the cilia of epithelial cells (see insert in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). Estradiol regulates differentiation and dedifferentiation of ciliated cells of the mammalian oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, follicular fluid of human pre-ovulatory follicles containing high concentrations of estradiol and progesterone increased the ciliary beat frequency of human oviductal ciliated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our findings suggest that E<sub>2 </sub>could regulate ciliary activity directly through a nongenomic mechanism probably involving phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of some proteins (e.g. tubulin or dynein) present in this structure. Recently, it has been shown that ESR2 is colocalized with &#x003b2;-tubulin at stem portion of the cilia of the oviductal epithelial cells in immature rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Additionally, gold particles for ESR1 and ESR2 were found associated to secretory vesicles. This corroborates previous works reporting localization of ESR1 and ER2 in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles of the female rat pituitary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Although, the biological significance of the localization of ESR1 and ESR2 in secretory vesicles remains to be determined it is probable that a Golgi-dependent pathway could exist for translation of ER that could be translocated into the plasma membrane and mediate nongenomic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>In other estrogen-sensitive tissues ER subtype expression is differentially regulated by E<sub>2</sub>. In the human vena cava, E<sub>2 </sub>down-regulates ESR1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] while deprivation of E<sub>2 </sub>in the cerebral microvessels of ovariectomized rats is associated with a decrease in the expression of both isoforms and E<sub>2 </sub>replacement up-regulates ESR1 but does not affect expression of ESR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In ovine endothelial cells, short-term treatment with E<sub>2 </sub>down-regulates ESR1, but not ESR2 while long-term treatment up-regulates ESR1 and down-regulates ESR2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our findings provide the first evidence that E<sub>2 </sub>is able to differentially regulate not just the expression level, but also the subcellular distribution of ESR1 and ESR2 in a target cell. We also observed different responses in the expression of three E<sub>2</sub>-associated signaling genes, <italic>c-fos</italic>, <italic>Ckb </italic>and <italic>s100g</italic>, in the oviduct of pregnant and cyclic rats when ESR1 or ESR2 was activated. Moreover, activation of ESR1 or ESR2 increased expression of <italic>c-fos </italic>although mating only blunted the effect of ESR2. This indicates that mating-associated signals modulate intraoviductal signalling of both ER providing evidence that mating may change the functional role of these receptors in the rat oviduct. On the other hand, the role of <italic>c-fos</italic>, <italic>Ckb </italic>or <italic>s100g </italic>on IPS induction or E<sub>2</sub>-induced egg transport acceleration needs to be disclosed.</p><p>Given that PPT is 400-fold more selective and DPN is only 70-fold more selective for ESR1 an ESR2 respectively, it was not surprisingly that PPT would be more effective to accelerate oviductal egg transport than DPN in cyclic rats. However, mating decreased effectiveness of PPT and blocked the effect of DPN. Probably, the nongenomic pathway by which E<sub>2 </sub>accelerates egg transport operates through activation of either ESR1 and ESR2 while the genomic pathway only operates through ESR1. The fact that IPS is associated with suppression of ESR2 involvement in the kinetic effect of E<sub>2 </sub>in the oviduct indicate that mating exerts a profound influence on the biology of ER in a target organ of E<sub>2 </sub>that merits further investigation.</p><p>Shao et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] have reported that subcutaneous administration of DPN retard egg transport in the rat. In this study, immature animals were treated, prior to DPN administration, with gonatrophins to mimic the endogenous luteneizing hormone surge. Probably, this treatment could have affected the response of the oviduct to DPN. Another factor is that we recorded the number and distribution of eggs in the genital tract within the first 24 h after treatment. In order to detect whether PPT or DPN delay egg transport autopsies should be performed on day 4 or 5 of cycle or pregnancy respectively, but this was not done.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Estrogen receptors ESR1 and ESR2 present a subcellular distribution in oviductal epithelial cells that is compatible with genomic and nongenomic actions of E<sub>2 </sub>in the rat oviduct. Mating is associated with changes in the basal and E<sub>2</sub>-induced subcellular distribution of ESR1 and ESR2 in these cells although it did not clearly explain IPS. Furthermore, mating affected signaling of both ER in the oviduct and induced loss of functional involvement of ESR2 on E<sub>2</sub>-induced accelerated egg transport. These findings reveal a profound influence on the intraoviductal ER signalling pathways exerted by mating.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PAO participated in the design of the study, in directing and completing all experimental analysis and in writing the manuscript.
