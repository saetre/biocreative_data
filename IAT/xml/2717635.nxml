Here, we report the identification of an integral membrane lysophosphatidic acid&#x02013;specific acyltransferase, LPAAT3, which regulates Golgi membrane tubule formation, trafficking, and structure by altering phospholipids and lysophospholipids. Overexpression of LPAAT3 significantly inhibited the formation of Golgi membrane tubules in vivo and in vitro. Anterograde and retrograde protein trafficking was slower in cells overexpressing LPAAT3 and accelerated in cells with reduced expression (by siRNA). Golgi morphology was also dependent on LPAAT3 because its knockdown caused the Golgi to become fragmented. These data are the first to show a direct role for a specific phospholipid acyltransferase in regulating membrane trafficking and organelle structure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The functional organization of the Golgi complex is mediated by a wide array of proteins that interact with specific lipid components to facilitate membrane bending for vesicle formation and tubule fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bard and Malhotra, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Matteis and Luini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson, 2009</xref>).

Lysophospholipids (LPLs), phosphatidic acid (PA), and diacylglycerol (DAG) have intrinsic curvature, which may aid in vesicle or tubule formation by altering membrane morphology and acting as a scaffold for downstream factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kooijman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Meer and Sprong, 2004</xref>). Phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) may produce DAG or PA for Golgi membrane fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bard and Malhotra, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez-Ulibarri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asp et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) activity, which generates LPLs, appears to be involved in endocytic recycling, Golgi retrograde trafficking, and Golgi cisternal structure by altering membrane tubule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Figueiredo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Pharmacological studies have suggested that LPL acyltransferases (LPATs) play a role in membrane trafficking by catalyzing the transfer of a fatty acid from an acyl-CoA donor to LPLs to generate PLs. The drug CI-976, originally identified as a weak cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor, also inhibits a tightly associated Golgi membrane LPAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers and Brown, 2004</xref>), with a consequent stimulation of Golgi membrane tubules and retrograde trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drecktrah et al., 2003</xref>). CI-976 also inhibits COPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2005</xref>) and COPII vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2008</xref>) and endocytic recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chambers et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting the role of multiple LPATs in membrane trafficking.</p><p>A family of nine transmembrane acyltransferases, variously named LPAAT&#x003b1;&#x02013;&#x003b9; and AGPAT 1&#x02013;9 (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate-<italic>O</italic>-acyltransferase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leung, 2001</xref>), but more recently LPAAT 1&#x02013;9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shindou and Shimizu, 2009</xref>), has been identified. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is the preferred acceptor for LPAAT enzymes including ER-localized LPAAT1 and 2, which are involved in de novo PL metabolism; however, little is known about the activity, localization, or function of LPAAT3&#x02013;9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shindou and Shimizu, 2009</xref>). Recently, mouse LPAAT3 was shown to be widely expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2005</xref>), but with an age-dependent elevation of levels in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yuki et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that LPAAT3 (LPAAT-&#x003b3;/AGPAT3) is directly involved in regulating Golgi membrane trafficking events. LPAAT3 prefers LPA as a substrate, but surprisingly the protein itself is located in both the ER and Golgi complex. Overexpression of LPAAT3 increases Golgi levels of PA and inhibits membrane tubule formation and trafficking both in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of LPAAT3 caused changes in Golgi morphology as well as accelerated trafficking. We conclude that by regulating PA levels, LPAAT3 contributes to Golgi structure and trafficking dynamics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>LPAAT3 is an ER and Golgi-localized transmembrane protein</title><p>Annotated in the human genome are nine predicated LPAAT enzymes, all containing multiple putative transmembrane domains and two consensus sequences with similar amino acids that lie within a PLsC, or acyltransferase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>).

One of these, LPAAT3, localized in a diffuse-ER and juxtanuclear Golgi-like pattern and was therefore chosen for further study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Both expressed LPAAT3-GFP (or DsRed) and endogenous LPAAT3 detected by immunofluorescence, colocalized with resident cis, medial, and trans-Golgi and ER proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, b and c</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200904147/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>, a&#x02013;d). HeLa cells and Clone 9 rat hepatocytes stably expressing LPAAT3-GFP were also generated and displayed Golgi localization (Fig. S1 e). The other LPATs we examined were mostly ER-like (LPAAT4 and 6) or mitochondrial (LPAAT5) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200904147/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>LPAAT3 is a lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase</title><p>To determine the enzymatic activity of LPAAT3, post-nuclear supernatants from cells overexpressing LPAAT3 were incubated with <sup>14</sup>C-palmitoyl Co-A and various LPL species to assay for the production of radiolabeled PL products. Post-nuclear supernatants from cells overexpressing LPAAT3 had elevated levels of LPA acyltransferase (LPAAT) activity compared with control supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d</xref>). Other exogenously added LPLs were tested, but there was no significant change in the production of the corresponding PL species. This increase in LPAAT activity was observed in cells stably or transiently transfected with wild-type LPAAT3 (LPAAT3 WT) in both HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 e</xref>) and Clone 9 cells (not depicted). Cells stably expressing the ER-localized LPAAT6 (a known LPAAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2008</xref>) were used as a positive control for LPAAT activity. Furthermore, the acyltransferase activity was not observed when acidic and basic residues in the two conserved regions of the acyltransferase motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>) were changed to alanines in the LPAAT3 mutant (MT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 e</xref>). Despite these changes, the catalytically inactive LPAAT3 MT was still partially localized to the Golgi complex (Fig. S1 d). Finally, subcellular fractions enriched in Golgi membranes from cells stably expressing LPAAT3 also exhibited an increase in LPAAT activity when endogenous LPA was used as an acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 e</xref>). Together, these data show that LPAAT3 has LPA acyltransferase activity and that this activity can increase the amount of PA in Golgi membranes. These results are consistent with reports that other members of this family also exhibit LPA acyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shindou and Shimizu, 2009</xref>). In addition, mouse LPAAT3 was recently shown to have highest activity with LPA, and weaker amounts with lysophosphatidylinositol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yuki et al., 2009</xref>), which was not tested here.</p></sec><sec><title>LPAAT3 mediates Golgi structure</title><p>Cells stably expressing LPAAT3-GFP were used to examine Golgi morphology in siRNA knockdown experiments. Knockdown was verified by Western blot, which showed an average of 85% reduction in LPAAT3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, a and b</xref>). In LPAAT3 knockdown cells, the Golgi complex was fragmented, forming numerous juxta-nuclear puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>). Quantification showed that &#x0223c;90% of LPAAT3 knockdown cells had fragmented Golgi ribbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 d</xref>). Each of the fragments colocalized with cis-Golgi markers (10E6), medial-Golgi markers (mannosidase II), and TGN markers (M6PR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 e</xref>). Golgi fragmentation caused by LPAAT3 knockdown was reversed by transfection with an siRNA-resistant LPAAT3 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 d</xref>). Electron microscopy (EM) revealed that knockdown cells had multiple Golgi stacks throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 f</xref>). The combined fluorescence and EM studies show that knockdown of LPAAT3 results in the formation of Golgi mini-stacks, which did not colocalize with the ER protein PDI, or the ER exit site marker Sec24 (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The Golgi fragments in LPAAT3 knockdown cells.</bold> (a) Cells stably overexpressing LPAAT3-GFP were transfected with a mixture of four siRNA molecules targeting LPAAT3 mRNA and analyzed by Western blot of cell lysates using anti-GFP and mannosidase II antibodies.

Cells were all treated with the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA), which generates numerous membrane tubules that redistribute Golgi membranes to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989</xref>). Cells overexpressing LPAAT3 form Golgi tubules much slower than control and LPAAT3 MT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, a and b</xref>). Moreover, the Golgi tubules that did form in LPAAT3 WT overexpressing cells were far fewer in number and shorter in length than untransfected cells, as shown by Sholl analyses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200904147/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>, a and b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sholl, 1953</xref>). The inhibition of BFA-stimulated tubule formation by LPAAT3 overexpression was not due to ineffective COPI disruption (Fig. S3 c). In contrast to overexpression, LPAAT3 knockdown cells exhibited a very rapid loss of the Golgi in BFA, so the experiment was repeated at 24&#x000b0;C to obtain quantitative data. The results showed that the half-time for loss of the Golgi in siRNA-treated cells was 11 min compared with 25 min for overexpressing cells (17 min in control cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>LPAAT3 overexpression slows BFA and CI-976&#x02013;stimulated Golgi retrograde trafficking to the ER.</bold> (a) HeLa cells and cells transfected with LPAAT3 WT or LPAAT3 MT were treated with 10 &#x000b5;g/ml BFA and analyzed by immunofluorescence with GPP130 as a Golgi marker.

Thus, a prediction is that cells overexpressing or knocked down for LPAAT3 should become, respectively, more resistant or sensitive to CI-976. Indeed, similar to BFA, cells overexpressing LPAAT3 and treated with CI-976 formed tubules slower than controls, whereas tubule formation in LPAAT3 knockdown was much faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, d and e</xref>).

The p58 receptor (hERGIC-53) is a lectin receptor that traffics between the cis-Golgi and the ER. When cells are incubated at 15&#x000b0;C, the p58 receptor accumulates in the cis-Golgi and ERGIC compartments. When the cells are shifted from 15 to 37&#x000b0;C, p58 returns to the ER via membrane tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saraste and Svensson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klumperman et al., 1998</xref>).

When LPAAT3 levels were reduced using siRNA transfection, the Golgi became hyper-sensitive to CI-976 and BFA and rapidly formed Golgi-to-ER retrograde membrane tubules, possibly due to an increase in LPA.</p><p>Membrane tubules also readily form at the TGN for the transport of cargo to the plasma membrane and endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bard and Malhotra, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Matteis and Luini, 2008</xref>), and LPAAT3 similarly affects trafficking kinetics in the TGN. Overexpression of LPAAT3 slowed export of ts045 VSV-G from the TGN and secretion of ssHRP. Conversely, LPAAT3 knockdown accelerated secretion of ssHRP, but curiously not ts045 VSV-G. It is not clear why ssHRP and not ts045 VSV-G was accelerated. TGN cargoes exist by several independent pathways/carriers, and the differential effects of LPAAT3 knockdown on export of VSV-G and secretion of ssHRP may reflect different phospholipid requirements for these carriers. Secretion may also be compromised indirectly through effects on retrograde trafficking, which were also influenced by LPAAT3 levels.</p><p>Results here and elsewhere suggest that LPL/PL has a critical role in generating membrane curvature, which is required for the formation of membrane tubules and vesicles, the latter either from flattened cisternal membranes or from tubular precursors. In addition, however, PA is thought to have important roles in CtBP3/BARS50-mediated vesicle fission and/or fusion by generating negative membrane curvature and forming microdomains for protein docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kooijman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover PLD, which also generates PA, is important for establishing transport carriers at the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bard and Malhotra, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). DAG may be an indirect product of LPAAT3 as increased PA levels may drive DAG levels via PA phosphatase. Importantly, PKD, which binds to DAG, is also required for forming post-TGN trafficking intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baron and Malhotra, 2002</xref>). DAG is also associated with multiple trafficking events from the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez-Ulibarri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asp et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In addition to changes in membrane trafficking, reduced expression of LPAAT3 caused the Golgi ribbon to fragment into mini-stacks. The results suggest that by altering the LPL/PL ratio in Golgi membranes, changes in either positive or negative curve can alter the stability of the compact cisternal morphology. Of course, any significant change in the LPL/PL ratio could have multiple direct and indirect effects.</p><p>Aside from phosphoinositides, the roles of specific PLs in membrane trafficking are still elusive because multiple pathways exist for the metabolism of PLs. PL levels are regulated by cellular needs for de novo PL synthesis via the Kennedy pathway but also by downstream organelle trafficking events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaspar et al., 2008</xref>). Membrane lipids such as LPLs and DAG may also be short-lived and localized to specific domains where cargo is concentrated for tubule or vesicle formation. In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that continual PL remodeling via Lands&#x02019; cycle enzymes such as LPAAT3 and PLA<sub>2</sub> plays important roles in the formation of membrane trafficking intermediates and in the maintenance of the Golgi complex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Antibodies against the following antigens were used: GPP130 (Adam Linstead, Carnegie Mellon University), hManII (Kelly Moreman, University of Georgia), 10E6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wood et al., 1991</xref>), M6PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Farquhar, 1987</xref>), &#x003b2;COP (ABR), p58 (Jaakko Saraste, Bergen University), and FITC/TRITC conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).
