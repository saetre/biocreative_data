In healthy people, air is taken in through the mouth or nose and travels down the windpipe into tubes in the lungs called the airways. Each airway has many small branches that end in alveoli, tiny air sacs with thin walls that are surrounded by small blood vessels called capillaries. When air reaches the alveoli, the oxygen in it passes into the bloodstream and is taken to the organs of the body to keep them working. In IPF, the alveoli and the space around them (the &#x0201c;interstitial&#x0201d; area) gradually become scarred and thickened, which stops oxygen's movement into the bloodstream. When only small areas of the lung are scarred, IPF may cause no symptoms. But, as more of the lung becomes damaged, IPF eventually causes breathlessness, even when resting. There is no effective treatment for IPF, although steroids and drugs that suppress the body's immune system are often tried in an attempt to slow its progression. On average, half of the people with IPF die within three years of diagnosis, often from respiratory or heart failure.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>It can be difficult to diagnose IPF&#x02014;there are many lung diseases with similar symptoms, including numerous other interstitial lung diseases&#x02014;and currently, physicians can only follow the progression of IPF by repeatedly testing their patients' lung function or by doing multiple chest X-rays. If proteins could be identified whose level in blood indicated disease activity (so-called &#x0201c;peripheral blood biomarkers&#x0201d;), it would be easier to diagnose and monitor patients. In addition, the identification of such biomarkers might suggest new drug targets for the treatment of IPF. In this study, the researchers look for peripheral blood biomarkers in IPF by using a &#x0201c;multiplex analysis&#x0201d; system to measure the level of several proteins in patient blood samples simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers measured the levels of 49 plasma proteins (plasma is the fluid part of blood) in 74 patients with IPF and 53 healthy people (controls) and used a technique called &#x0201c;recursive partitioning&#x0201d; to define a five-protein signature that distinguished patients from unaffected study participants (controls). Matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) and MMP1&#x02014;the two plasma proteins whose levels were most increased in patients with IPF compared to controls&#x02014;were key components of this signature. Concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 were higher in bronchoalveolar lavage samples (fluid obtained by washing out the lungs with saline) and in lung tissue samples from patients with IPF than in similar samples taken from healthy individuals. Plasma concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 were significantly higher in patients with IPF than in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an interstitial lung disease that mimics IPF, but not increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sarcoidosis, two other lung diseases. In an independent validation group, patients with IPF and familial pulmonary fibrosis had increased plasma concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 that correlated with the severity of their disease. In addition, MMP7 concentrations were raised in close relatives of people with familial pulmonary fibrosis who had normal lung function tests but some lung scarring.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings provide evidence for a protein signature in the blood for IPF and suggest MMP1 and MMP7 may be useful as biomarkers for IPF. These two matrix metalloproteinases have previously been suggested to be involved in the development of IPF. However, additional work is probably needed to confirm that increased plasma concentrations MMP7 and MMP1 are specific for IPF, since it may be that these markers will not distinguish IPF from other interstitial lung diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050093">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050093</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Read a related <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050098">Perspective</ext-link> article</p></list-item><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus Encyclopedia has a page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000069.htm">idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish) and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pulmonaryfibrosis.html">pulmonary fibrosis</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/ipf/ipf_whatis.html">US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute</ext-link> and the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lunguk.org/you-and-your-lungs/conditions-and-diseases/Idiopathic&#x0002b;pulmonaryfibrosis(fibrosingalveolitis).htm">British Lung Foundation</ext-link> also provide information on IPF for patients and relatives</p></list-item><list-item><p>Some of the researchers involved in this study provide more details about what might go wrong in IPF in a recent <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/archive/1549-1676/5/3/pdf/10.1371_journal.pmed.0050062-S.pdf"><italic>PLoS Medicine</italic> article</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Rosas IO, Richards TJ, Konishi K, Zhang Y, Gibson K, et al.

MMP1, a matrix metalloprotease that primarily degrades fibrillar collagen, is rarely expressed under normal conditions, but is highly overexpressed in reactive alveolar epithelial cells in IPF lungs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. MMP7, a matrix metalloprotease with multiple local inflammatory regulatory roles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, is also highly upregulated in alveolar epithelial cells in IPF &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, MMP7 knockout mice are relatively protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that MMP7 may have a profibrotic effect in IPF. Taken in the above context, our results strongly suggest that activated epithelial cells in IPF lungs are the likely source of elevated peripheral blood concentrations of MMP1 and MMP7, thus supporting their use as biomarkers for disease detection and progression.</p><p>Our data show that neither patients with COPD, a chronic progressive lung disease, nor patients with sarcoidosis, a chronic granulomatous ILD, express significantly increased peripheral blood concentrations of MMP7 or MMP1. Further, elevated peripheral blood MMP1 concentrations, in the presence of elevated MMP7 concentrations, distinguish IPF from HP. A similar trend in gene expression of MMP7 and MMP1 is found in the lungs of patients with IPF and HP, further supporting the notion that the changes in peripheral blood concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 are reflective of the lung gene environment and constitute a disease-specific signal. This finding may be very important clinically, because subacute HP is frequently misdiagnosed as idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and in its chronic advanced form HP can be undistinguishable from IPF &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. In fact, recent studies have demonstrated that histopathologic and HRCT abnormalities observed in chronic HP often overlap with those of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), representing an important challenge to the differential diagnosis of these conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the elevated peripheral blood concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 observed in IPF are not due to a systemic stress response to a chronic lung disease and distinguish COPD, sarcoidosis, and HP from IPF. While we do not advocate at this stage relying solely on peripheral blood concentrations of MMP7 and MMP1 in distinguishing IPF from HP, sarcoidosis, or the less difficult differential diagnosis of COPD, it seems likely that knowing these concentrations will impact clinical decision-making.</p><p>We did not compare IPF to other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias such as NSIP. There is nothing in our data to suggest that we can distinguish IPF from these diseases using MMP7 and MMP1 peripheral blood concentrations. In fact the finding of elevated MMP7 in patients with subclinical ILD may be indicative that this increase may be present in other idiopathic ILDs. Furthermore, gene expression patterns were found to be extremely similar in IPF and NSIP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, and BAL MMP7 levels were also recently found to be similar in patients with IPF and NSIP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. The major limitation in these studies was the small number of cases with NSIP because of the substantial rarity of isolated NSIP. Therefore our results should encourage the establishment of multicenter collections of peripheral blood samples of patients with ILD with sufficient power to determine whether NSIP and IPF differ in their peripheral blood protein expression.</p><p>In comparison to other studies, major attributes of our analysis include the relatively large size of our derivation cohort and the large number of proteins assayed in this cohort of patients with IPF, the comparison of peripheral blood biomarker levels with their gene expression levels in the lungs and BAL, the comparison with multiple relatively large control populations with other chronic lung diseases to establish specificity of our findings, and the verification of our initial results in an independent validation cohort. A unique feature of our validation cohort is that it contains patients with subclinical ILD who are asymptomatic first-degree relatives of patients affected with familial IPF. These individuals have HRCT findings of early ILD, but do not have pulmonary function abnormalities, cough, or dyspnea &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Analysis of samples from this cohort allowed us to demonstrate that MMP7 concentrations are significantly higher in patients with early subclinical lung disease, suggesting that MMP7 may be a marker for early asymptomatic ILD. Peripheral blood concentrations of MMP7 also correlate with pulmonary function tests, which are surrogate measures of disease severity and thus may reflect molecular mechanisms of lung remodeling in IPF &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050093-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Naturally, the use of different platforms and different sample types limits our ability at this stage to set a disease-specific MMP concentration threshold. However, the reproducibility and concordance of our results across different sample types and in multiple cohorts suggest that such a threshold can and should be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study we report for the first time to our knowledge the presence of a peripheral blood protein signature in a disease that is confined to the lung. This signature is composed of MMPs, TNF receptors, and some chemokines. Our data demonstrate that peripheral blood increases in two of these markers (MMP1 and MMP7) are also observed in lung and may be specific to IPF. We provide verification of our observations in an independent validation cohort and show that MMP7 correlates with disease severity and is increased in patients with subclinical ILD. While additional studies will determine the value of this protein signature in clinical practice, our results support a potential value of peripheral blood proteins as biomarkers in an organ-confined disease such as IPF. If validated, these biomarkers have the potential to greatly facilitate the introduction of new therapies in IPF and to profoundly affect the management of these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050093-sd001"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><title>Russian Translation of the Abstract by Anna E.
