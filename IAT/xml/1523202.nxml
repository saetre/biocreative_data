The process of heart formation occurs in a similar way in all vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Heart development in the zebrafish is also rapid, which allows for numerous short-term studies. The primitive heart tube is formed by 22 hours post-fertilization (hpf). The heart is beating and the circulation becomes evident at 24 hpf. By 30 hpf, the heart tube starts to loop to the right side of the embryo. By 36 hpf, chamber boundaries are evident, although molecular markers can distinguish them in the primitive heart tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Looping places both the atrium and the ventricle toward the left of the embryo, however the atrium is further to the left than the ventricle. By 60 hpf, the valves are present and by the fifth day, the heart has assumed its adult configuration, with the atrium sitting dorsally with respect to the ventricle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The fundamental plan of the vascular system as it develops in the zebrafish is similar to that of other vertebrates. The overall form of the zebrafish vasculature is established early, before the initiation of circulation, and the pattern of major vessel tracts is reproducible from embryo to embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Circulation begins at approximately 24&#x02013;26 hpf and initially flows through a simple single circulatory loop. Cells from the dorsal margin of the lateral plate migrate medially to form the intermediate cell mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This mass gives rise to both the endothelia and the major trunk vessels and the first cohort of blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, many early vasculogenic vessels first appear as a network or plexus of smaller vessels, with little apparent pattern or differentiated identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. By 2.5&#x02013;3 days postfertilization (dpf), the trunk and tail intersegmental vessels are fully formed and by 6 dpf, the overall basic pattern of the vaculature is in place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Although vertebrate cardiovascular development has been well described morphologically, the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying these events are only beginning to be understood. Results from gene expression pattern and/or functional studies suggest that a variety of molecules, including transcription factors (e.g. Gata4, Nkx2.5), morphogenetic regulators (e.g. Hand2, Pitx2, Xin), endothelial growth factors (e.g. VEGF-A), cardiac specific proteins (e.g. cmlc1, cmlc2, and vmhc), cell adhesion molecule (e.g. cadherin2 and cadherin5, see below), are involved in the cardiac patterning and morphogenesis of the vertebrate heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The cadherins are a family of Ca<sup>++</sup>-dependent transmembrane molecules that mediate cell adhesion mainly through homophilic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Cadherin2, the first cadherin discovered in the vertebrate nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], has been shown to be of critical importance in the early differentiation of the vertebrate central and peripheral nervous structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Unlike the wide expression of cadherin2, expression of cadherin5 (also called VE-cadherin), is confined to the endothelial cells of both developing and adult vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Despite the importance of cardiovascular tissue itself and cadherin molecules in animal development, there are only a few published reports on cadherins function in vertebrate cardiovascular development. Zebrafish with mutations in <italic>cadherin2 </italic>(<italic>parachute</italic>, or <italic>pac </italic>mutant, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; <italic>glass onion</italic>, or <italic>glo </italic>mutant, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]) have recently been identified, and their phenotypes studied. However, most of the analysis was concentrated on the central nervous system. So far, detailed information on the developmental profile of cadherin2 expression in the vertebrate cardiac tissue has been performed on only the chick and mice. Moreover, functional analysis was limited almost exclusively to descriptions of anatomical defects in the heart of embryos whose cadherin2 function was blocked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We propose to study cardiac differentiation, cardiac performance and formation of the vascular system in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant in order to elucidate the role(s) of cadherin2 plays in the formation and function of the cardiovascular system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cadherin2 expression in developing zebrafish heart</title><p>Cadherin2 expression in the developing zebrafish heart was studied using whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunocytochemical methods on tissue sections. Strong <italic>cadherin2 </italic>message was detected in the developing zebrafish heart of all stages examined (24 hpf to 80 hpf; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Expression levels were higher in the bulbus arteriosus and the ventricle than in the atrium in whole mount hearts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Examination of sections from the whole mount hearts and tissue sections processed for cadherin2 immunostaining showed that the labeling was confined mainly to the myocardial layer at the stages examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). This was confirmed by double labeling experiments using the cadherin2 antibody and an anti-mouse monoclonal antibody Zn-5, which has been shown to recognize differentiating zebfrafish ventricular myocardium (Deborah Yelon, New York University, personal communication; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H&#x02013;J</xref>). The difference in cadherin2 staining between the atrium and ventricle was mainly due to the thickness of these structures with the ventricle having a myocardium consisting 2&#x02013;3 cell layers while the atrium myocardium having a single cell layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cadherin2 expression in developing zebrafish heart</bold>.

We tested this idea by examining several key cardiac performance parameters: heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and contraction time in control and <italic>glo </italic>mutant 30&#x02013;72 hpf embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). By 30 hpf, these parameters can be readily recorded under an inverted dissection microscope. Mean heart rates of <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos were lower than controls at this stage, but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The heart rates increased by almost 60% in both groups over the 42-hour measurement period. However, the trajectory of this increase was significantly different between the control and <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos. Between 30&#x02013;48 hpf, differences between the mean heart rates of these two groups grew more prominent, with the values significantly lower in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos than the controls at 36 and 48 hpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Interestingly, differences in the heart rates between the two groups became smaller between 48&#x02013;72 hpf, due to a faster increase in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant heart rates. Although the mean heart rates were still significantly lower for <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos at 58 hpf, their values were similar to the controls at 72 hpf. Moreover, variations in hearts rate were also significantly higher in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Measurements of cardiac performance in control and <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos</bold>.

In control embryos, stroke volume increased more rapidly during development with the difference showing statistical significance at 72 hpf. This late significance was due, at least partially, to large variations of the stroke volume in both groups. Multiplying stroke volume by heart rate produces cardiac output (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Mean cardiac output increased in both groups during the 42-hour measurement period with the slope of the increase significantly higher in the control group. As with stroke volume, cardiac output was similar between the two groups at 30 hpf, and the control embryos had higher cardiac output than the <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos at the remaining recording time points, although their values were not significantly different until 72 hpf. Again, cardiac output variability was high in both groups.</p><p>For the majority of the developmental window investigated, the contraction time (time from diastole to systole) for <italic>glo </italic>mutant hearts was slower than controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). This difference was statistically significant during the first two measurement times (30 and 36 hpf), but by 72 hpf, the contraction time became similar between the <italic>glo </italic>and control hearts. Moreover, the variation in contraction times was also significantly higher in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant hearts, reflecting the irregular nature of cardiac contractions in this group.</p></sec><sec><title>Gross morphological defects in the heart of the <italic>glo </italic>mutant and <italic>cadherin2</italic> morphants</title><p>The decreased cardiac function in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos was likely caused by morphological changes in the mutant heart.

Intersegmental vessels in the body and tail are well-developed in control embryos at this stage ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>), but poorly formed in the <italic>glo </italic>mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>). By 50 hpf, an elaborate vascular system can be detected using the <italic>cdh5 </italic>staining in zebrafish ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The majority of the blood vessels seen in control embryos, including the lateral dorsal aorta, dorsal aorta, posterior cardinal vein, hyoid and branchial arch vessels, could also be found in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). The intersegmental vessels in the mutant embryos were poorly stained and disorganized compared to those in control embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>). Injection of FITC-Dextran into anesthetized control embryos resulted in a vasculature labeling pattern similar to <italic>cdh5 </italic>staining in the control embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8G</xref>), but there was very little FITC-Dextran labeling in <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8H</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Development of the vasculature system in 28 hpfcontrol and <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos as revealed by <italic>cdh5 </italic>staining</bold>.

There are only a few systems (e.g. visual and cardiac systems) and organisms in which one can readily perform <italic>in vivo </italic>studies of gene function in cell and tissue differentiation together with measurement of organ physiological performance affected by the loss of the gene function. This study further demonstrates the usefulness of zebrafish as a model organism to study gene function in vertebrate cardiac differentiation and function. The reduced cardiac performance in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos likely results from altered atrial and ventricular morphology, which in turn is likely caused by the changes in the myocardiocyte differentiation.</p><sec><title>Pericardial and cardiac gross morphology is greatly altered in <italic>cadherin2</italic> morphants and <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos</title><p>Our finding that the pericardial cavity was greatly enlarged in the vast majority of the <italic>cadherin2 </italic>morphants and in all <italic>glo </italic>mutants suggests that cadherin2 function could be required for developing a normal pericardial cavity. However, it cannot be ruled out that altered kidney function could be causing pericardial enlargement via fluid accumulation. Thus, the actual cause(s) for the formation of such an enlarged pericardial cavity, likely due to an accumulation of fluid in the cavity, in these embryos is unclear. It may have more to do with the much-weakened cardiac function in the mutant embryos than the development of the vascular system. This idea is supported by our finding that most of the major blood vessels were present in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos, but there was little labeling of the blood vessels using the FITC-Dextran injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><p>Enlarged pericardial cavity was reported in <italic>cadherin2 </italic>mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], but not seen in the <italic>pac </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This difference likely results from different degrees of knockdown/knockout of cadherin2 function in these mutants. It is possible that a small amount of functional cadherin2 protein is produced in the <italic>pac </italic>mutants due to alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], therefore defects in the <italic>pac </italic>mutants are not as severe as in the <italic>glo </italic>mutants.</p><p>The gross morphological defects observed in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant hearts are likely caused by changes in the morphology of individual myocardiocytes. Although defects in the myocardiocytes were observed in both <italic>glo </italic>and <italic>pac </italic>mutant embryos, the gross cardiac morphological defects were obvious only in the former. This again, is likely due to differences in the degree of cadherin2 function disruption, with a complete loss of cadherin2 function in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos, while perhaps some cadherin2 function remaining in the <italic>pac </italic>mutant embryos (see above). The enlarged pericardial cavity is unlikely one of the major causes of the atrial and ventricular disorganization, because the gross morphological defects can be detected at 36 hpf, when there is no obvious change in the size of the pericardial cavity.</p></sec><sec><title>Cadherin2 plays an important role in myocardiocyte differentiation, cardiac morphogenesis and performance</title><p>During cardiac development, myocardiocytes express cardiac specific markers such as <italic>nkx2.5</italic>, <italic>cmlc2</italic>, <italic>vmhc </italic>and <italic>cdh5</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Despite greatly altered gross cardiac morphology and myocardiocytes morphology in <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos, expression of <italic>nkx2.5</italic>, <italic>cmlc2 </italic>and <italic>cdh5 </italic>is largely unchanged, suggesting that cadherin2 is not required for normal expression of these genes. However, expression of <italic>vmhc</italic>, a ventricle specific gene, in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant heart is reduced compared to control embryos. Although vmhc role in cardiac formation and function has not being studied in vertebrates, loss of function in an atrium specific myosin heavy chain has been linked to disruption in atrial function and altered ventricular morphogenesis in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], suggesting that vmhc may play a similar role in ventricular myocardiocyte differentiation and function. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that cadherin2 function in vertebrate cardiac development and the function may be mediated, at least partially, by its effect on <italic>vmhc </italic>expression.</p><p>Myocardiocytes undergo extensive morphological changes during cardiac morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. For example, cuboidal shaped chicken myocardiocytes become flattened and tightly associated when the heart begins to contract, and the myocardiocytes become fusiform shaped and arranged in the circumferential direction during looping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], similar to the zebrafish myocardiocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). Many myocardiocytes in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant become round shaped and lack tight association, which may have contributed to poor electrical conduction between cells, thus reducing the contraction rate shown in <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos. This also may have contributed to the gross cardiac morphological defects including the disrupted heart looping observed in both the cadherin2 mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos.</p><p>The loss of cadherin2 function does not affect all aspects of myocardiocyte differentiation because myocardiocytes in the cadherin2 mutant mice and <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos still contract and/or express cardiac specific genes (see above). Other cell adhesion molecules such as N-CAM and other cadherin molecules may still function in these animals. Although most of the blood vessels were present as indicated by <italic>cdh5</italic> labeling, it is unclear whether or not these <italic>cdh5</italic>-positive vessels were normal. As was shown in the heart, <italic>cdh5</italic> staining in the <italic>glo </italic>mutants was similar to controls. It is not surprising that the formation of the major trunk vessels is not greatly affected in the <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos, since the zebrafish vasculature system express <italic>cdh5</italic>, instead of cadherin2. It is possible that there are defects on those blood vessels, but we have no other markers (e.g. <italic>Zn-5</italic>, <italic>vmhc</italic>) to assess their integrity. Additionally, the intersegmental vessels and all other vessels formed via angiogenic remodeling are poorly formed or not present in <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryos. This is likely a proximal effect of the lack of pressure and flow generated by the <italic>glo </italic>mutant embryo heart, and/or due to cadherin2 function on the trunk and tail muscle development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that cadherin2 plays an essential role in zebrafish cardiovascular development. Although the exact mechanisms remain unknown as to the formation of the enlarged pericardium and reduced peripheral blood flow, it is clear that myocardiocyte differentiation and physiological performance is impaired.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Zebrafish</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were maintained at 28.5&#x000b0;C as described in the Zebrafish Book [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Zebrafish embryos homozygous for the <italic>pac </italic>mutation (<italic>pac</italic><sup><italic>tm101B</italic></sup>) were obtained from Max-Planck Institute for Developmental Biology (T&#x000fc;bingen, Germany).

Mutant embryos were identified and separated from wild type embryos using a Leica dissecting microscope, based on morphological differences such as curved spines and tail blisters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The embryos were dechorionated at approximately 24 hpf and were kept in a small plastic compartmentalized container (2.5 ml for each compartment) with tank water at 28.5&#x000b0;C for the duration of the experiment. Immediately before each measurement, the embryos were immobilized using MS-222 (0.02%). At this early stage of development and at this low concentration of MS-222, there are no measurable effects of this anesthesia on the cardiovascular system (unpublished data). The embryos were digitally recorded at 30 hpf, 36 hpf, 48 hpf, 58 hpf, and 72 hpf using a temperature controlled inverted microscope (Leica, DMIRB) equipped with a digital video camera (Redlake MASD, San Diego, CA). For each embryo at each selected period of development, a 10 sec digital video was captured at 0.008 second intervals (125 frames per second). At the completion of each video, the individual fish were returned to their respective compartments and were tracked throughout the experiment.</p><p>Videos were analyzed for heart rate, end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, stroke volume, and cardiac output using ImagePro Plus<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>imaging software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Heart rate was calculated by counting the number of sequential contractions, beginning and ending at end diastole, occurring in the video file and dividing by the exact time interval. End diastolic volume was determined by measuring the perimeter of the ventricle at diastole (obtained by tracing the ventricle in a single frame of the cardiac cycle video stopped where the ventricle was at its largest point) along with the length and width of the ventricle at diastole. End systolic volume was determined by measuring the perimeter of the ventricle at systole (where the ventricle was at its narrowest width following diastole) in addition to the length and width of the ventricle at systole. The resulting ventricular volumes were calculated using the formula (8/3&#x003c0;) <italic>a</italic>/L, where <italic>a </italic>is the area of the traced ventricle and L is the length of the ventricle at either diastole or systole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The stroke volume was calculated by subtracting the end systolic volume from the end diastolic volume and the cardiac output was calculated by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate. Data were analyzed for differences between the <italic>glo </italic>and control embryos and over development time by using a two-way repeated measure ANOVA.
