To further dissect the Itk-TSAd interaction, we thus performed glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments using GST-Itk-SH2 and GST-Itk-SH3 fusion proteins in cell lysates from 293T cells transiently expressing TSAd. GST-Itk-SH3 mutated for tryptophan 208 (GST-Itk-SH3-W208A), which is crucial for binding of polyproline motives, was included as a negative control. TSAd was pulled down with GST-Itk-SH3, but not with GST-Itk-SH3-W208A, GST-Itk-SH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009761-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) or GST (data not shown and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-SundvoldGjerstad1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>).

In transfected 293T and Jurkat T cells the interaction between TSAd and Itk, and phosphorylation of Itk was observed in the absence of exogenous stimuli, whereas in primary cells the TSAd-Itk-Lck complex formation and Itk phosphorylation was only observed upon CXCL12 stimulation. This apparent discrepancy could be due to high expression levels of the interacting proteins in transfected cell lines, which may overcome the requirement for exogenous stimuli to induce the formation of protein complexes.

In primary cells with endogenous expression of Lck, Itk and TSAd, TSAd-Itk-Lck complex formation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk required CXCL12 stimulation. Similarly, although Itk was phosphorylated to some extent in resting Jurkat T cells over-expressing TSAd and Itk, CXCL12 stimulation led to a further increase in Itk phosphorylation. Thus, our data indicate that CXCL12 induced phosphorylation of Itk is promoted by TSAd, at least in primary cells.</p><p>Our data from transfected 293T cells shows that Lck is required for phosphorylation of Itk Y511. Whether Lck phosphorylates Itk directly or whether Lck promotes Itk phosphorylation indirectly via activation of other kinases has not been addressed here. Heyeck and colleagues previously showed that Lck is required for phosphorylation of Itk in Sf9 insect cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Heyeck1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and here we show that TSAd strongly promotes the phosphorylation of Itk in the presence of Lck. Since both Lck and Itk may bind to TSAd, we find it likely that Lck directly phosphorylates Itk, instead of indirectly via another, as yet unidentified kinase.</p><p>The Itk Y511 phosphorylation site was essential for the increased migratory response in Jurkat T cells upon co-expression of TSAd with Itk. Whether it is phosphorylation of Itk Y511 <italic>per se</italic> or also the subsequent phosphorylation of Y180 in the Itk SH3 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Nore1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> that is important for cellular migration has not been dissected here. Phosphorylation of Y180 may also alter the ligand binding properties of Itk-SH3 as has been shown for phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated SH3 domain of another Tec family kinase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Morrogh1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the outcome of the enhanced Itk tyrosine phosphorylation could be increased catalytic activity, altered ligand specificity of the Itk-SH3 domain, or both.</p><p>Mice deficient in either CXCL12 or CXCR4 show developmental defects of the vasculature, heart, brain and hematopoietic system, indicating an important role for CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in multiple cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Murdoch1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. One way to coordinate the effects of CXCL12 signaling in the various CXCR4-expressing cell types is to exploit tissue-specific intracellular signaling pathways. Cell specific factors, e.g. Itk, Lck, Zap-70 and SLP76, function to direct CXCR4 signaling in T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Fischer1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Takesono1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Inngjerdingen1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Kremer1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The observation that TSAd promotes CXCL12 signaling in T cells lends further support to this notion, since TSAd is not ubiquitously expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-SundvoldGjerstad2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>There appears to be extensive cross-talk between the TCR and CXCR4 pathways. However the literature is not consistent as to how molecular crosstalk between TCR and CXCR4 affects the overall cellular response when both receptors are triggered simultaneously or consecutively. While CXCR4 signaling exploits the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs of the TCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Kumar1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, triggering of the TCR prior to CXCR4 stimulation, inhibits T cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Peacock1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Abbal1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors are sequestered to the immunological synapse following TCR stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Molon1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> where they physically interact and co-operate to provide co-stimulatory signals after CXCL12 stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Contento1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Obviously, crosstalk between the TCR and CXCR4 pathways may operate through the use of several of the same signaling molecules, such as Itk, Lck, Zap-70 and SLP-76. Interestingly, and in accordance with the findings of Park <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Park1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that both Zap-70 and Lck were recruited to the TSAd containing Itk complex upon CXCL12 stimulation. Moreover, we have found that Zap-70 phosphorylation upon CXCL12 stimulation is affected by the presence of TSAd (Berge, unpublished data). Since TSAd is also involved in the TCR pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Rajagopal1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Sundvold1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that this molecule contributes to the crosstalk between CXCR4 and TCR, by providing spatial and temporal control of Lck and Itk. However, the net effect of TSAd on cellular function when both CXCR4 and TCR pathways are stimulated simultaneously or consecutively remains to be determined.</p><p>Most biological systems display a certain level of redundancy, in the sense that several molecules may fulfil overlapping functions. Our data clearly show that TSAd is not strictly required for CXCL12 induced actin polymerization and migration in T cells, as polymerized actin and migration can be detected also in TSAd-deficient T cells. Adapter proteins essentially function as catalysts for molecular interactions. During chemokine signalling in the absence of TSAd, other adapter proteins may take the role of TSAd. Alternatively, the interacting molecules using TSAd as an intermediary may to some extent interact also in its absence. We thus hypothesize that the physiological relevance of the TSAd-Lck-Itk complex is to enhance the signal from the ligand bound CXCR4, thus lowering the threshold for CXCL12 induced signaling. This notion is supported by our observation that at low CXCL12 doses, actin polymerization in TSAd deficient cells (lacking the TSAd-Lck-Itk complex) is attenuated, however, upon addition of higher CXCL12 doses, the requirement for TSAd and TSAd containing complexes seems to be overcome leading to F-actin levels comparable to that of TSAd containing T cells. Similarly, Zap-70 promotes CXCR4 signaling at low CXCL12 concentrations, whereas at higher doses, CXCL12 responsiveness is independent of Zap70 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Soede1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In our study, we focused on the CXCL12 chemokine since previous reports had indicated that the TSAd interaction partner Itk regulates CXCL12 signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Fischer1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Takesono1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as TSAd interacts with G&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Park1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, which is found associated to a number of GPCRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Oldham1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, it is likely that TSAd may be a regulator of several other chemokine receptors. In support of this, our data show reduced CCL19 responsiveness in <italic>SH2D2A</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes and Park <italic>et. al.</italic> reported that TSAd also regulates the responsiveness to RANTES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Park1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, very recently it was reported that TSAd may also be involved in integrin mediated migration of activated Jurkat T cells through interaction with the 67 kDa laminin binding protein (LAMR1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009761-Park2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, to what extent TSAd functions as a general adapter protein in regulating cellular migration through various signalling pathways remains to be established.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that CXCL12 signalling is regulated by a novel molecular mechanism, which involves the interaction of TSAd with Itk. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009761-g006">Fig. 6</xref> depicts our current model for how TSAd contributes to CXCL12 mediated signalling. We suggest that TSAd acts as a scaffold that brings Lck and Itk in proximity to each other and to G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; of the activated chemokine receptor. Through its ability to interact with these kinases, TSAd primes Itk for Lck mediated phosphorylation upon CXCL12 stimulation, promoting actin polymerization and T cell migration.</p><fig id="pone-0009761-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009761.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Model for TSAd regulation of CXCL12 signaling.</title><p>Upon binding of CXCL12 to its G protein coupled receptor, the heterotrimeric G protein complex (A) is separated into a receptor bound G&#x003b1; and a membrane bound G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunit.
