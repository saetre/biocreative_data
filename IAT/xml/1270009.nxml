Genetic studies indicate that IFT proteins are required for Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling downstream of the Smoothened and Patched membrane proteins but upstream of the Glioma (Gli) transcription factors. However, the role that IFT proteins play in transduction of Shh signaling and the importance of cilia in this process remain unknown. Here we provide insights into the mechanism by which defects in an IFT protein, Tg737/Polaris, affect Shh signaling in the murine limb bud. Our data show that loss of <italic>Tg737</italic> results in altered Gli3 processing that abrogates Gli3-mediated repression of Gli1 transcriptional activity. In contrast to the conclusions drawn from genetic analysis, the activity of Gli1 and truncated forms of Gli3 (Gli3R) are unaffected in <italic>Tg737</italic> mutants at the molecular level, indicating that Tg737/Polaris is differentially involved in specific activities of the Gli proteins. Most important, a negative regulator of Shh signaling, Suppressor of fused, and the three full-length Gli transcription factors localize to the distal tip of cilia in addition to the nucleus. Thus, our data support a model where cilia have a direct role in Gli processing and Shh signal transduction.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Cilia are small projections extending from the surface of most cells. Research has shown that they are important in diseases such as cystic kidney diseases as well as during the development of many tissues including the limb. More recently, proteins such as Polaris, which is required to build cilia, have been demonstrated to be essential for the regulation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, although the mechanism has remained elusive. Precise regulation of Shh signal transduction is important for the proper development of many tissues. Excessive activation of the Shh pathway results in severe developmental defects and has been implicated in certain types of cancer. In the limb, Shh signaling is involved in digit development, and excess signaling leads to the formation of extra digits. The main targets of Shh signaling are the Glioma (Gli) family of transcription factors, and Gli3 has been shown to be processed to a shortened repressor form when Shh signaling is repressed. The localization of the Gli transcription factors and Suppressor of fused, a protein involved in the regulation of Gli protein function, to cilia suggests that the cilia may be an important site for regulation of Shh signal transduction by modulating Gli protein function.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Haycraft CJ, Banizs B, Aydin-Son Y, Zhang Q, Michaud EJ, et al.

The apical ectodermal ridge is necessary for proper limb outgrowth and proximal&#x02013;distal length while the surface ectoderm regulates dorsal&#x02013;ventral patterning. The zone of polarizing activity, located in the posterior mesenchyme, is involved in anterior&#x02013;posterior patterning including the formation of five digits per limb. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is secreted by cells in the zone of polarizing activity, and many polydactyl mutants in the mouse have been shown to have ectopic expression of either Shh or genes activated by Shh.

Recent evidence from the labs of Anderson and Niswander has shown that IFT proteins, including <italic>Tg737/</italic>Polaris, are essential for Shh signaling in both neural tube and limb patterning at the level of Gli3 processing, although the connection between IFT and this signaling pathway remains enigmatic &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Previous models have speculated that there is a cytosolic role for the IFT proteins or that the cilia generate a signal affecting the activity of the Gli transcription factors. However, in this report we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that there is a direct role for cilia in Shh signal transduction. Despite normal <italic>Shh</italic> expression in homozygous <italic>Tg737</italic><sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;3&#x003b2;-gal</sup> mutant limbs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;, expression of the Shh downstream targets such as <italic>Ptch1</italic> and <italic>Gli1</italic> is lost. Furthermore, cells isolated from mutant limb buds are unable to respond to ShhN conditioned medium (ShhN-CM) in vitro. Even though mutant cells are unable to respond to ShhN-CM, the pathway can be activated by exogenously expressed Gli1; however, Gli2 and full-length Gli3 were found to be inactive in the absence of Polaris. Although full-length Gli3 was nonfunctional in <italic>Tg737</italic><sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;3&#x003b2;-gal</sup> mutant cells, expression of a processed form of Gli3 (Gli3R) acts as a potent repressor of Gli1-mediated induction of <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression. Additionally, the amount of full-length Gli3 was markedly increased in <italic>Tg737</italic><sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;3&#x003b2;-gal</sup> mutant embryos relative to wild-type controls, suggesting that loss of Polaris results in inefficient Gli3 processing. Most importantly, the data indicate that all three full-length Gli proteins along with Sufu colocalize to the distal tips of cilia in primary limb bud cells. Together our data support a direct role for cilia in the mammalian hedgehog signaling pathway and raise the intriguing possibility that the tip of the cilium is a specialized domain in which proteolytic machinery is concentrated for processing and regulating the activity of Shh signal transduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cilia Are Present on Both Ectoderm and Mesenchyme Cells of the Limb Bud</title><p>To determine whether cilia are present on the developing mouse limb bud, we conducted electron microscopic analysis of embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) limb buds.

To begin distinguishing between these possibilities, we evaluated the subcellular localization of several key proteins involved in the Shh signaling pathway, including Gli1, Gli2, Gli3, Gli3R, and Sufu relative to cilia and the IFT protein Polaris.</p><p>In the case of the Gli1, Gli2, Gli3, and Gli3R proteins, localization was determined by infection of primary <italic>Tg737</italic><sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;3&#x003b2;-gal</sup> mutant and wild-type limb bud cells with adenoviral vectors that express the full-length Gli proteins or the truncated Gli3R fused to GFP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Infections were performed such that greater than 75&#x00025; of the cells expressed GFP. For these studies, we focused on cells that had low levels of exogenous expression to minimize any effects that overexpression may have on protein localization. For all three full-length Gli proteins, expression was detected in the nucleus in cells that expressed high levels of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010053-g005">Figure 5</xref>; data not shown), as reported previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

The GFP signals failed to colocalize with &#x003b3;-tubulin (basal body marker), indicating that the Gli::GFP proteins do not localize to the basal body at the base of the cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010053-g005">Figure 5</xref>E; data not shown). Rather, the GFP signal was found to colocalize with a subdomain of Polaris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010053-g005">Figure 5</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010053-g005">5</xref>G; data not shown)<italic>.</italic> The colocalization of Gli::GFP with a domain of Polaris, but not with &#x003b3;-tubulin, indicates that the full-length Gli proteins concentrate at the tip of the cilium but not at the base. Treatment of infected cells with ShhN-CM did not alter the distribution of Gli1, Gli2, or Gli3 at the distal tips of cilia (data not shown). However, it may be difficult to assess any changes in localization since GFP is fused to the C-terminus of the Gli proteins. Thus, processing that occurs in the case of full-length Gli3 would remove the GFP tag and prevent visualization of the truncated N-terminal form of the protein that traffics to the nucleus.</p><p>In contrast to the localization observed for the three full-length Gli proteins, Gli3R::GFP was detected predominantly in the nucleus. We could detect no GFP signal at the distal tip of cilia, suggesting that after processing, Gli3R is released from the cilia or that the cilia targeting domain is located in the C-terminus of Gli3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010053-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). These possibilities are currently being explored.</p><p>In <italic>Tg737</italic><sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;3&#x003b2;-gal</sup> mutant cells that lack cilia, the Gli::GFP fusion proteins were seen in the nucleus, as observed in wild-type samples.

While testing these models is hindered by our inability to specifically disrupt cilia formation without also perturbing IFT, the data presented here support a direct role for cilia in Shh pathway regulation. This is based on the localization of multiple components of the Shh pathway in the cilia of wild-type cells, and on altered Gli3 processing and impaired Gli2 function detected in cells lacking this organelle. While we cannot conclusively rule out a non-ciliary function of IFT, we propose that IFT functions to direct and concentrate the Gli proteins, Sufu, and possibly the proteolytic machinery needed for efficient processing of the Gli proteins to a domain located at the distal tips of cilia. In the absence of the cilium, the Gli proteins localize diffusely around the basal body region and fail to undergo normal processing, resulting in their impaired activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse strains and methods.</title><p><italic>Tg737</italic><sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;3&#x003b2;-gal</sup>, <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup>,</italic> and <italic>Gli3<sup>Xt-J</sup></italic> mice have been previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Tg737</italic><sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;3&#x003b2;-gal</sup> mice were maintained on a mixed FVB &#x000d7; BALB/c background and genotyped as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Tg737<sup>orpk</sup></italic> mice were maintained on an FVB background and genotyped as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Gli3<sup>Xt-J</sup></italic> mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background and were genotyped as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b25">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

The antiserum recognized a single band of the correct size in wild-type samples by Western blot analysis; this band was absent in <italic>Tg737</italic><sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;3&#x003b2;-gal</sup> samples. Only faint nuclear staining was observed in <italic>Tg737</italic><sup>&#x00394;2&#x02013;3&#x003b2;-gal</sup> primary cells by immunofluorescence, whereas localization to cilia was additionally observed in wild-type samples. Sufu antibody and blocking peptide were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, California, United States). Identical staining with the Sufu antibody was seen in the IMCD mouse kidney cell line. Affinity-purified anti-Gli3 antiserum was provided by B. Wang and used as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010053-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin and &#x003b3;-tubulin antibodies were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri, United States). Gli::GFP fusion proteins were visualized using the GFP tag encoded by the adenovirus constructs. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma).</p><p>All fluorescence imaging was performed on a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) TE200 Eclipse inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CoolSnap HQ cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, New Jersey, United States) and MetaMorph imaging software (Molecular Devices, Downington, Pennsylvania, United States). All filters and shutters were computer driven.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Electron microscopy.</title><p>Wild-type E11.5 embryos were isolated in PBS and fixed in 2.5&#x00025; gluteraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 90 min at room temperature. Samples were washed in three changes of 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, fixed in 1&#x00025; OsO<sub>4</sub> for 60 min at room temperature, washed in thee changes of 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series. Samples were processed for scanning or transmission electron microscopy by the University of Alabama at Birmingham High Resolution Imaging Facility using standard procedures. Scanning electron microscopy samples were imaged on an ISI SX-40 scanning electron microscope (Topcon Technologies, Paramus, New Jersey, United States). Transmission electron microscopy sections were imaged on a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) EM 10C transmission electron microscope.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank C. Chang, G.
