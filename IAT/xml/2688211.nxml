Treatment of rabbit osteoclasts with RANKL was associated with an increase in the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2. A role for Mcl-1 in osteoclast survival was suggested using osteoclasts generated from mouse bone marrow macrophages in the presence of RANKL + macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) since cytokine deprivation of mouse osteoclasts caused a rapid loss of Mcl-1 (but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>), which preceded the biochemical and morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Loss of Mcl-1 from mouse osteoclasts could be prevented by factors known to promote osteoclast survival (RANKL, M-CSF, tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-&#x003b1;], or lipopolysaccharide [LPS]).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>RANKL protects osteoclasts from the apoptosis-inducing and anti-resorptive effects of bisphosphonates <italic>in vitro</italic>. The ability of RANKL (and other pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-&#x003b1; and LPS) to increase the level of Mcl-1 in osteoclasts may explain the lack of effectiveness of some bisphosphonates in preventing inflammation-induced bone loss.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The molecular mechanisms by which bisphosphonate (BP) drugs inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption have been clarified in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. After targeting bone mineral and internalisation by osteoclasts, simple BPs such as clodronate are metabolised intracellularly by osteoclasts to form non-hydrolysable analogues of ATP which induce osteoclast apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. By contrast, the nitrogen-containing BPs such as alendronate and zoledronate do not appear to be metabolised but are potent inhibitors of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase, thereby preventing the post-translational prenylation of small GTPases that are necessary for osteoclast polarisation, bone resorption, and cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Both simple BPs and nitrogen-containing BPs are therefore capable of causing osteoclast apoptosis, <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but by different molecular mechanisms. The regulation of osteoclast apoptosis appears to be an important mechanism of physiological bone homeostasis since a variety of growth factors and cytokines that stimulate bone resorption (such as receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand [RANKL], interleukin-1, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-&#x003b1;]) also prevent osteoclast apoptosis (reviewed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). In this study, we examined the extent to which RANKL might antagonise the anti-resorptive activity of clodronate and alendronate <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is of particular relevance in the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in which high levels of RANKL expressed by synovial fibroblasts and T lymphocytes contribute to osteoclast-mediated joint destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Some BPs have been shown to prevent local and systemic bone loss in some animal models of inflammation-induced arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and to preserve joint architecture in a recent clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of BPs at preventing joint destruction in other clinical studies in patients with RA has been disappointing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The reasons for this are not completely clear but could involve factors in the local environment of the inflamed joint, such as RANKL, that might antagonise the anti-resorptive action of BPs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Clodronate (dichloromethylene-1,1-bisphosphonate) (CLO) and alendronate (4-amino-1-hydroxy-butylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate) (ALN) were kindly provided by Procter &#x00026; Gamble Pharmaceuticals (Cincinnati, OH, USA).

However, RANKL alone consistently caused a threefold increase in the level of Mcl-1 protein in osteoclasts. Treatment with ALN caused a decrease of approximately 90% in Mcl-1, although co-treatment with RANKL almost completely prevented this effect and maintained the level of Mcl-1 similar to that in control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of Mcl-1 precedes apoptosis during cytokine deprivation of mouse osteoclasts but is prevented by pro-survival factors</title><p>To further examine the importance of Mcl-1 in osteoclast survival, multinucleated osteoclasts were generated from M-CSF-dependent mouse bone marrow macrophages by culturing the latter cells for 5 days with M-CSF + RANKL. When the osteoclasts were starved of these cytokines, morphological changes indicative of apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) were apparent after 6 to 8 hours, consistent with the appearance in Western blots of the cleaved form of caspase-3 after 6 hours of cytokine starvation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). The appearance of apoptotic osteoclasts and cleaved caspase-3 was preceded by a decrease in the level of Mcl-1 (noticeable after 4 hours).

However, apart from a recent clinical study using the highly potent BP zoledronic acid in patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and two studies of zoledronic acid in animal models of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the effectiveness of BPs at preventing focal bone loss has been less convincing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It has recently been suggested that the reason for this relative lack of effect on local, inflammatory bone loss is due to factors in the inflamed joint, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, that antagonise the ability of BPs to inhibit osteoclasts. Zhang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], using TNF-&#x003b1; transgenic mice, showed that Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>levels were markedly higher in osteoclasts, an effect that appeared to be caused by TNF-&#x003b1;-induced expression of Ets-2. Furthermore, overexpression of Ets-2 or Bcl-x<sub>L </sub>protected osteoclasts from ALN-induced apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic>. RANKL is also abundant in the rheumatoid microenvironment and drives the enhanced osteoclastogenesis and hence excessive osteoclast-mediated destruction of bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In our study, we demonstrate that RANKL also protects osteoclasts from the apoptosis-inducing and anti-resorptive effects of ALN or CLO <italic>in vitro</italic>. The number of apoptotic rabbit osteoclasts was significantly lower in cultures treated for 48 hours with ALN or CLO in the presence of RANKL than in cultures treated with the BPs alone. Consistent with this, RANKL preserved the total number of osteoclasts in cultures treated with the BPs and also significantly overcame the anti-resorptive effect of the BPs when osteoclasts were cultured on dentine discs. This ability of RANKL to rescue osteoclasts from the effects of BPs was also observed morphologically by using scanning EM. Treatment of osteoclasts with CLO for 24 hours caused morphological changes associated with apoptotic cell death, consistent with the ability of CLO to induce osteoclast apoptosis via the formation and rapid accumulation of a cytotoxic metabolite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The morphological changes associated with ALN treatment for 24 hours (cell retraction and alterations in plasma membrane morphology) are consistent with the inhibition of FPP synthase. This leads to the inhibition of protein prenylation and the slow accumulation of unprenylated small GTPases such as Rap1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The morphological appearance of osteoclasts after 24 hours of treatment with ALN therefore probably indicates cells with altered cytoskeletal arrangement and vesicular trafficking, as well as cells in the very early stages of apoptosis, as a result of abnormal small GTPase signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the presence of RANKL, these effects of ALN and CLO on osteoclast morphology were largely overcome, at least over a 24-hour culture period. In the case of ALN, this was not due to any ability of RANKL to prevent inhibition of FPP synthase, since RANKL treatment did not prevent the accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A in osteoclasts.</p><p>We have previously shown that BP-induced osteoclast apoptosis involves loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, leading (presumably as a result of subsequent release of cytochrome C from mitochondria and activation of procaspase-9) to the cleavage and activation of procaspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To identify a potential mechanism by which RANKL prevents BP-induced apoptosis, we examined in more detail the events involved in ALN-induced apoptosis. Co-treatment with RANKL prevented the increase in the proportion of osteoclasts with active caspase-9 seen after ALN treatment, suggesting that RANKL either prevents the mitochondrial changes that lead to activation of procaspase-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] or prevents procaspase-9 activation subsequent to the release of cytochrome C (for example, by increasing the expression of XIAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). Although expression of XIAP and cIAP1/2 can be stimulated via nuclear factor-kappa-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which is a major signalling pathway activated by RANKL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we did not observe any effect of RANKL on the level of XIAP, cIAP1, or cIAP2 in rabbit osteoclasts by Western blotting (data not shown), consistent with earlier studies on murine osteoclasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This suggests that RANKL probably prevents apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial changes prior to caspase activation, perhaps via members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that regulate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>RANKL did not alter the level of Bcl-2 in rabbit osteoclasts but caused a marked increase in the level of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that is expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage such as macrophages and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and is also known to be increased in synovial macrophages and fibroblasts in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] as well as in synovial fluid lymphocytes in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In myeloid cells, Mcl-1 prevents apoptosis and its expression is highly regulated by survival-promoting factors via the PI3K/Akt/mammlian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 kinase as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The latter are also known to be activated by M-CSF, TNF-&#x003b1;, and RANKL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], which promote osteoclast survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Whilst our work was in progress, Bradley and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] showed that Mcl-1 mRNA and protein are upregulated in osteoclasts by M-CSF via activation of MEK/ERK (MAPK kinase/extracellular regulated kinase) and increased expression of Egr2. Hence, although the exact mechanism by which RANKL upregulates Mcl-1 in osteoclasts remains to be proven, it is highly likely that this also involves MAPK and/or mTOR signalling pathways. ALN treatment alone caused a decrease in Mcl-1 levels, perhaps since the activation of mTOR/S6 kinase in osteoclasts appears to involve geranylgeranylated proteins such as Rac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and ALN is known to effectively prevent protein geranylgeranylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. With myeloma cells, others have also shown that the inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation causes the loss of Mcl-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In our study, RANKL restored the level of Mcl-1 to that in control osteoclasts, but this was still less than the level of Mcl-1 in the presence of RANKL alone. Hence, ALN and RANKL may have opposing effects on the same signalling pathways (perhaps involving mTOR) that are required for Mcl-1 expression in osteoclasts.</p><p>In further support of an important role for Mcl-1 in osteoclast survival, we found that the level of Mcl-1 rapidly decreased following the removal of M-CSF and RANKL from cultures of mouse osteoclasts, which are highly dependent on the presence of such survival factors. In this model, the loss of Mcl-1 preceded the appearance of morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis and occurred in the absence of changes in the level of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>. In addition, the loss of Mcl-1 in mouse osteoclasts could be prevented by the addition of factors (LPS, TNF-&#x003b1;, M-CSF, and RANKL) that are known to promote osteoclast survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The loss of Mcl-1 in osteoclasts probably occurred by proteasomal degradation since we also found that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 caused an increase in the level of Mcl-1 in mouse osteoclasts (data not shown). This is consistent with a requirement in osteoclasts for continual protein synthesis to prevent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Together, these observations indicate that Mcl-1 plays an important role in maintaining osteoclast survival.</p><p>Mcl-1 inhibits activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by interacting with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bak and Bim, thereby preventing the increased mitochondrial permeability that leads to caspase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Lack of Bim leads to enhanced osteoclast survival and the pro-survival factor M-CSF decreases Bim levels in osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], probably by increasing ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Bim via upregulation of cCbl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The role of Bim in BP-induced osteoclast apoptosis is not known, although a recent study showed that apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells induced by the BP risedronate involved increased levels of Bim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Upregulation of Mcl-1 (and therefore antagonism of Bim) by RANKL is therefore a likely mechanism by which RANKL prevents BP-induced apoptosis of osteoclasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that RANKL protects osteoclasts from the pro-apoptotic and hence anti-resorptive effects of the BPs CLO and ALN <italic>in vitro</italic>. This protective effect of RANKL is likely to be mediated at least in part by an increase in the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. The ability of RANKL, together with other factors such as TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], to rescue osteoclasts from the pro-apoptotic effects of BPs may account for the apparent lack of effectiveness of BPs (particularly the less potent BPs such as CLO and ALN) in preventing local, inflammation-induced bone loss in RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>&#x003b1;-MEM: alpha-minimum essential medium; ALN: 4-amino-1-hydroxy-butylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (alendronate); BP: bisphosphonate; CLO: dichloromethylene-1,1-bisphosphonate (clodronate); DAPI: 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EM: electron microscopy; FCS: fetal calf serum; FPP: farnesyl diphosphate; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; M-CSF: macrophage colony-stimulating factor; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; RANKL: receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa-B ligand; TNF-&#x003b1;: tumour necrosis factor-alpha; TRAP: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>MJR has received research funding from Procter &#x00026; Gamble (Cincinnati, OH, USA), Novartis (Basel, Switzerland), and Roche (Basel, Switzerland) and acts as a consultant for Novartis and Procter &#x00026; Gamble.
