Significantly greater postcraniotomy S100&#x003b2; levels were observed with prolonged surgery (<italic>p </italic>= 0.039), deterioration in the mini-mental state examination (<italic>p </italic>= 0.005, 0.011, and 0.036 for pre versus immediate, 24 hours, and 48 hours postsurgery, respectively), and with postoperative brain computed tomography evidence of brain injury; bleeding was associated with higher serum S100&#x003b2; levels at 24 and 48 hours after surgery (<italic>p </italic>= 0.046, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.095 to -0.001 and <italic>p </italic>= 0.034, 95% CI -0.142 to -0.006, respectively) as was the presence of midline shift (<italic>p </italic>= 0.005, 95% CI -0.136 to -0.025 and <italic>p </italic>= 0.006, 95% CI -0.186 to -0.032, respectively).

Its biological half-life is approximately 30 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]; hence, persistently increased levels of S100&#x003b2; indicate continuous release of this protein from damaged tissue. Elevated serum levels of S100&#x003b2; have been reported to correlate with neurological deterioration after cardiac surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and with poor likelihood of survival after hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Serum protein S100&#x003b2; is also a recognised marker of traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and blood-brain barrier dysfunction in the absence of apparent brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Few studies have evaluated S100&#x003b2; after surgical insult to the central nervous system (CNS); after aneurysm surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and operative decompression of cord metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], increased serum S100&#x003b2; values were reported to correlate with poor neurological outcome.</p><p>Slow-growing supratentorial brain tumours such as meningiomas may cause damage to adjacent neural tissue despite their non-neural origin. Surgical access and excision of these extra-axial tumours are generally less traumatic than in less-accessible brain tumours or tumours of neural origin. Nevertheless, due to brain retraction and dissection, cerebral insult may occur during surgery. A recent study of patients who underwent meningioma resection demonstrated that pathologically increased serum S100&#x003b2; concentrations in the early postcraniotomy period correlated with neurological deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this study, however, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters were not reported, tumours were not assessed volumetrically, and a very high rate of postoperative gross neurological deterioration occurred.</p><p>The current study was therefore conducted to examine the correlation between serial serum S100&#x003b2; protein levels and pre- and postcraniotomy MRI/computed tomography (CT) findings and neurological deterioration in patients undergoing meningioma resection. Revealing such associations would potentially promote the use of preoperative S100&#x003b2; level as a marker of tumour effect on brain tissue and postoperative S100&#x003b2; level as a marker for early detection of ongoing postcraniotomy brain damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>After institutional review board approval, all consecutive patients aged 18 to 80 years who were admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery for supratentorial meningioma surgery (Jan. 1 to Oct. 31, 2004) were prospectively screened for inclusion and informed consent was obtained. Excluded were patients who refused to participate or who had a history of chemotherapy/convulsions two weeks prior to admission, stroke/cardiopulmonary resuscitation/head trauma three months prior to admission, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, prior melanoma, or brain neoplasm other than meningioma. Patients with chronic renal failure (creatinine &#x0003e;200 mmol/l) were also excluded due to potential interference with S100&#x003b2; clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Patients were to be withdrawn from the study if they suffered an episode of hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure &#x0003c;60 mm Hg) which lasted more than 15 minutes and was non-responsive to fluid or vasopressor therapy at any time during the study period, regardless of cause. Occurrence of postoperative cerebral ischemia/hemorrhage was documented, but neither complication constituted a criterion for withdrawal.</p></sec><sec><title>Perioperative management</title><p>Patients were enrolled upon admission on the day before surgery. Dexamethasone (&#x02264;16 mg/day) and phenytoin/valproic acid were prescribed individually. Anaesthesia was induced using thiopental or propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium and was maintained with a balanced technique involving isoflurane, nitrous oxide, and oxygen. Additional doses of fentanyl were given at the anaesthesiologist's discretion. Ventilation was adjusted to maintain a PaCO<sub>2 </sub>(partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide) of 30 to 35 mm Hg. Perioperative patient monitoring included intra-arterial blood-pressure monitoring. Surgery was performed by five neurosurgeons using standard techniques to minimise neural tissue damage. A neuronavigation system was used in convexity tumours to decrease the size of the craniotomy. In lesions in the base of skull, an extradural approach was opted for to reduce brain retraction. Extubation was performed in the operating room.</p><p>All patients were transferred postoperatively to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) for continued overnight monitoring. Further monitoring and treatment in the unit were provided at the discretion of the attending surgical ICU team, based on individual patient needs.</p></sec><sec><title>Neurological evaluation</title><p>Cranial nerve function and motor, sensory, language, and cerebellar function and a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] were conducted preoperatively and 48 hours after surgery. All patients underwent MRI (T1, T2, T1 plus GAD [gadolinium] and FLAIR [fluid-attenuated inversion recovery] protocol) as part of their preoperative evaluation. CT scanning of the brain with and without contrast material was performed at 36 to 48 hours after surgery and repeated at the discretion of the treating physicians. All of the images were analysed by an independent team comprised of a neurosurgeon, radiologist, and physicist who were blinded to S100&#x003b2; levels and the study results. Tumour volume and brain edema were calculated using BrainSCAN&#x02122; software (ExacTrac<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>computer technology; BrainLAB AG, Heimstetten, Germany), which is often used to plan radiosurgery treatment. For the purpose of the current study, the borders of the tumour and blood and/or edema were marked on each slice of the CT or MRI. This enables the program to construct a 3D model of the lesion area and measure its volume (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>S100&#x003b2; testing</title><p>Peripheral blood was sampled for S100&#x003b2; levels upon admission, immediately after surgery, and at 24 and 48 hours after surgery. All samples were centrifuged and stored (-70&#x000b0;C). Testing was performed using the Roche Elecsys<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>S100 reagent kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany) (assay duration 18 minutes, measuring range 0.005 to 39 pg/l, cross-reactivity against S100&#x003b1;&#x003b1; &#x0003c;1%). Less than 24 hours prior to testing, calibration was performed per reagent kit and control values were determined to be within the limits required for calibration (0.206 and 2.54 &#x003bc;g/l). The treating physicians were blinded to the results of the serum S100&#x003b2; tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Study data and medical records were collected prospectively, including patient demographics (for example, age, gender, and past medical history), neurological examination, intraoperative variables possibly related to surgical complexity (for example, duration of surgery and anaesthesia, surgical plane, resection grade, and blood loss), S100&#x003b2; levels, and relevant neurological tests.</p><p>No standard criteria were found in the literature for intraoperative definitions of the quality of the neurosurgical plane afforded by the tumour or its vascularity. A tumour presenting with a pial plane was therefore defined as a 'good' plane, and gross tumour invasion of the pia mater and the brain was defined as 'difficult' plane. It was assumed that dissection of the tumour from the brain would cause greater CNS tissue damage in the latter cases. The criteria for classification of the degree of tumour vascularity were arbitrary and based solely upon the senior neurosurgeon's assessment of the degree to which bleeding interfered with resection of the tumour.</p></sec><sec><title>Endpoints</title><p>The study endpoints were determination of the relationship between preoperative serum S100&#x003b2; levels and MRI evidence of CNS damage and postoperative S100&#x003b2; levels and surgical complexity and postoperative clinical/radiological evidence of neural tissue injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The study cohort included all patients who were enrolled into the study and who followed protocol procedures. First, the univariate results of all the research variables &#x02013; predictors (independent variables) and outcome (the dependent variable) &#x02013; were examined. Categorical variables (for example, patient gender, prior radiation/hormonal therapy, primary/recurrent disease, and medical history) are presented with their categories and the associated percentages. Numerical variables (for example, patient age and score in the MMSE) are presented with their means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges.</p><p>In the second step, the relationship between the outcome variables (serum S100&#x003b2; levels at each time point) and independent variables (variables potentially affecting these levels) was examined and their significance (<italic>p </italic>value) is presented. The Student <italic>t </italic>test, the Mann-Whitney test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to examine the relationship between categorical variables (dichotomous and multiple categories, respectively,) and S100&#x003b2; levels. Pearson and Kendall's tau-b correlations were used for the relationship between continuous variables and S100&#x003b2; levels measured in the various study time points (for example, preoperative tumour volume and baseline S100&#x003b2; levels, duration of surgery, and postoperative S100&#x003b2; levels). The results of the MMSE were analysed relative to the level of S100&#x003b2; as both a continuous variable and a dichotomous variable (deterioration versus non-deterioration) as was the presence/degree of midline shift on the postoperative CT scan. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 12 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients, tumour pathology, and preoperative imaging</title><p>Fifty-six patients fulfilled entry criteria and were enrolled in the study. Three patients were excluded because they refused participation, and one was excluded because pathology disclosed hemangiopericytoma. Mean age was 58.5 &#x000b1; 13 years, and 77% were female. Patient disease characteristics are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. All but one patient had a preoperative Glasgow Coma Score of 15. One patient had a score of 14 due to verbal deficit. Half of the patients scored maximal points in the preoperative MMSE. In the majority of patients (<italic>n </italic>= 34, 65%), pathological examination revealed transitional/meningothelial tumour, and in 48 patients (92%), the World Health Organization grading was 1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The average time from performance of the last preoperative MRI to surgery was 26.6 days.

The majority of surgical procedures (<italic>n </italic>= 45, 86%) were performed via pterional or frontal approaches. A neuronavigation system was used in 66% (21/32) of the operations that were not performed at the base of skull and in none (0/20) of the operations that were performed at the base of skull. The duration of surgery averaged 295 &#x000b1; 154 minutes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><p>Postoperative (48 hours after surgery) Glasgow Coma Scores remained 15 for all but three patients, who scored 14 (<italic>n </italic>= 2) and 10 (<italic>n </italic>= 1). Deterioration in motor performance, sensorium, and language skills occurred in 10, one, and two patients, respectively. MMSE scores decreased slightly from a mean preoperative score of 26.6 &#x000b1; 6.8 to 26.0 &#x000b1; 7.1 at the second postoperative day (<italic>p </italic>= not significant). Sixteen patients (31%) scored fewer points in the postoperative MMSE than in the preoperative MMSE.</p><p>Postoperative CT scan (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) revealed evidence of blood in the surgical bed in 22 patients (42.3%) and brain edema in 35 patients (67%). The volume of bleeding was less than 1 cm<sup>3 </sup>in 12 patients, 1 to 4 cm<sup>3 </sup>in eight patients, and more than 4 cm<sup>3 </sup>in two patients. The average edema volume was 19.28 &#x000b1; 23.53 cm<sup>3</sup>. In one patient, brain infarction was found. Twelve patients (23%) had postoperative CT scan evidence of midline shift.</p></sec><sec><title>Relationship between preoperative serum S100&#x003b2; levels and MRI evidence of CNS damage</title><p>Preoperative S100&#x003b2; levels did not correlate with tumour volume (<italic>p </italic>= 0.32), edema volume (<italic>p </italic>= 0.72), or tumour and edema volume together (<italic>p </italic>= 0.81) as measured by MRI.

It is also the first investigation of the link among postcraniotomy serum S100&#x003b2; levels, MMSE performance, and volumetric CT scan evidence of CNS compromise.</p><p>The data confirm that this marker performs poorly for characterisation and follow-up of this type of tumour. A correlation was found, however, between immediate postcraniotomy serum S100&#x003b2; levels and deterioration in performance of the MMSE. Persistently elevated early postoperative levels of serum S100&#x003b2; were also associated with postoperative CT scan evidence of bleeding, edema, or midline shift, suggesting a component of ongoing active release of S100&#x003b2; from glia accompanying secondary brain insult. This finding is of particular importance because the rise of this biomarker precedes clinical findings; patients are often incapable of undergoing complex clinical neurological testing at this stage.</p><p>Preoperative S100&#x003b2; levels did not correlate with either tumour and/or edema volume. It would be expected that a mass pressing the surrounding brain could have resulted in some S100&#x003b2; release. Plausible explanations for this finding include the slow lesion dynamics of this type of tumour; slow-growing tumours may cause less blood-brain barrier disruption, and the damage to the structural network supporting the neurons may be so gradual that even if S100&#x003b2; were released, current techniques would not be sensitive enough to distinguish the level between persons with no CNS lesion and those with a lesion causing a gradual mass effect. Molecular mechanisms for neuronal reorganisation (that is, plasticity) may also involve signaling cascades that affect astrocytes. Finally, S100&#x003b2; may have a role in processes occurring during acute but not chronic injury; it was recently demonstrated that S100&#x003b2; mRNA expression is potently downregulated after 12 and 24 hours of oxygen, serum, and glucose deprivation. Moreover, prolonged oxygen, serum, and glucose deprivation (for 48 hours)isassociated with a significant reduction of S100&#x003b2; release at later time intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>S100&#x003b2; levels were affected by the quality of surgical plane but not by the need to resect at a less-accessible tumour location (convexity located versus deep-seated). This may stem from the use of complex neurosurgical techniques intended to minimise retraction over the parenchyma of the brain (that is, extensive bone work, large craniotomies, extensive drilling of the skull base, and opening of the basal cisterns).</p><p>Our results are in agreement with previous work by Stranjalis <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], who demonstrated in patients undergoing meningioma resection that the increased S100&#x003b2; level area under the curve up to seven days postcraniotomy was the most significant predictor for postoperative neurological deterioration and that those patients with increased postoperative S100&#x003b2; values had greater risk of poor outcome up to six months after surgery. In their study, however, preoperative MRI was not used, tumours were not assessed volumetrically, and a relatively high rate of gross neurological deterioration occurred postoperatively (immediate 50%, 6 months 30%).</p><p>In a study of operative decompression in patients suffering paresis due to metastatic spinal cord compression, functional outcome also correlated with S100&#x003b2; levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Patients with favourable outcomes had serum levels of S100&#x003b2; which were either normal all the time or increased initially but normalised within two to three days, whereas patients who had an unfavourable outcome also had continuously elevated levels (that is, levels either increased further or decreased slowly during 14 days). Elevated 10-day S100&#x003b2; levels were also predictive of the appearance of a new neurological deficit after surgery for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The results from this study, in agreement with our study, confirmed that elevated serum S100&#x003b2; values after subarachnoid aneurismal hemorrhage correlate with postoperative CT scan findings such as infarction and vasospasm. Finally, serum S100&#x003b2; levels correlated with the size of the tumour-brain contact surface, which was closely related to the dimension of the surgical trauma, and with postoperative CNS damage caused by neurosurgical manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the current study, use of neuronavigation did not moderate the increase observed in serum S100&#x003b2; levels but this finding may be related to surgical technique.</p><p>Correlations between deterioration in performance of the MMSE and elevations in S100&#x003b2; levels, similar to those found in the present study, have been reported after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This has not been demonstrated after cardiac arrest and resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], possibly due to the length of time that had elapsed between the event and MMSE testing or the small number of survivors available for testing.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. Long-term follow-up to correlate serum S100&#x003b2; values with late outcome was not performed. One should also exercise caution in using serum S100&#x003b2; as the sole marker of brain damage; this protein may be released from injured tissues outside the brain, particularly from the heart, or mediastinum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Experimental data in rat tissue found S100&#x003b2; in adipose, skin, and testicular tissue, albeit in significantly lower concentrations than in brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Immunocytochemical approaches also demonstrated S100&#x003b2; in damaged skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and S100&#x003b2; protein has also been demonstrated in villous and intermediate trophoblast cells of the normal human placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Rasmussen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] noted an increase in S100&#x003b2; 24 and 48 hours even after elective abdominal surgery and observed that this rise may be related to the appearance of postoperative delirium. S100&#x003b2; increases in the postoperative period may thus indicate more than one type of CNS derangement. S100&#x003b2; may also be involved in reparative processes after brain damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Sampling was limited to 48 hours after surgery although previous studies indicated ongoing damage for more than five days. Further sampling may have yielded additional information. Finally, in the current study, the S100&#x003b2; levels of patients who had postoperative CT scan evidence of bleeding overlapped with the levels of those who had none and postoperative edema was not consistently associated with elevated levels of S100&#x003b2;. Studies including larger sample populations are required to substantiate or disprove the relationship between these CNS pathologies and elevations in serum S100&#x003b2; levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In patients with meningioma, serum S100&#x003b2; levels perform poorly as an indicator of tumour characteristics but may provide an early sign of postcraniotomy injury. Although the relevance of extracranial sources of S100&#x003b2; and the possible implications of participation of S100&#x003b2; in reparative processes after brain damage demand further investigation, the data suggesting that S100&#x003b2; protein does have potential as a prognostic clinical tool are increasing. The current study provides further substantiation to the mounting pool of data that serum S100&#x003b2; may be used as an early biomarker of acute neural tissue injury in the postoperative setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; Serum S100&#x003b2; levels perform poorly as an indicator of tumour characteristics for patients with meningiomas.</p><p>&#x02022; Significant increases in serum S100&#x003b2; levels occur after neurosurgery prior to patient capability to undergo complex clinical neurological testing.</p><p>&#x02022; Higher immediate postcraniotomy serum S100&#x003b2; levels correlate with eventual postoperative deterioration in performance of the MMSE.</p><p>&#x02022; Persistently elevated postoperative levels of serum S100&#x003b2; (24 to 48 hours after craniotomy) are associated with postoperative CT scan evidence of bleeding, edema, and midline shift.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA = analysis of variance; CNS = central nervous system; CT = computed tomography; ICU = intensive care unit; MMSE = mini-mental state examination; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SE conceived, designed, and coordinated the study, analysed and interpreted the data, and drafted the manuscript.
