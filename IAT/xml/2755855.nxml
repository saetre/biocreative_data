In addition to various domains corresponding to other P-type ATPases, ATP7B includes an N terminus extension (NMBD) with six copper binding sites. We obtained high yield expression of WT and mutant ATP7B in COS1 cells infected with adenovirus vector. ATP7B, isolated with the microsomal fraction of cell homogenates, accounts for 10&#x02013;20% of the total protein. Copper-dependent, steady-state ATPase yields 30 nmol of P<sub>i</sub>/mg of protein/min at 37 &#x000b0;C, pH 6.0. ATP7B phosphorylation with ATP occurs with diphasic kinetics and is totally copper-dependent. Alkali labile phosphoenzyme (catalytic intermediate of P-ATPases) accounts for a small fraction of the total phosphoprotein and is prevented by D1027N (P domain) or C983A/C985A (C<italic>X</italic>C copper binding motif in TM6) mutations. Decay of [<sup>32</sup>P]phosphoenzyme following chase with non-radioactive ATP occurs with an initial burst involving alkali labile phosphoenzyme (absent in D1027N and C983A/C985A mutants) and continues at a slow rate involving alkali-resistant phosphoenzyme. If a copper chelator is added with the ATP chase, the initial burst is smaller, and further cleavage is totally inhibited. Analysis by proteolysis and mass spectrometry demonstrates that the alkali stable phosphoenzyme involves Ser<sup>478</sup> and Ser<sup>481</sup> (NMBD), Ser<sup>1121</sup> (&#x0201c;N&#x0201d; domain) and Ser<sup>1453</sup> (C terminus), and occurs with the same pattern <italic>ex vivo</italic> (COS-1) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (microsomes). The overall copper dependence of phosphorylation and hydrolytic cleavage suggests long range conformational effects, including interactions of NMBD and headpiece domains, with strong influence on catalytic turnover.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">RO301-69830</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>ATP7A and ATP7B are two P-type ATPases involved in copper homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), and their mutational defects in humans are responsible for Menkes or Wilson disease, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In principle, the P-type denomination applies to enzymes that sustain hydrolytic cleavage of phosphorylated substrates, with a catalytic mechanism including intermediate phosphorylation of the Asp residue within an invariant DKTG motif. Although this mechanism extends to the large family of halogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), &#x0201c;P-type ATPase&#x0201d; refers to membrane-bound enzymes that couple ATP utilization to cation transport, and are divided into five subfamilies depending on cation specificity and other features of structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The ATP7A and ATP7B copper ATPases are included in the P<sub>1</sub>-subfamily, which is selective for soft and transition metals. In addition to a putative transmembrane metal binding motif (TMBS),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> corresponding to the cation binding/transport sites of other P-ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B possess a specific N terminus extension (NMBD) that includes six (C<italic>XX</italic>C) metal binding sites that may be involved in enzyme activation. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the ATP7A and ATP7B proteins may modulate the functional behavior of the enzyme, in addition to forming a catalytic intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These specific structural features, as well as various interactions with chaperones and targeting sites, render characterization of ATP7A and ATP7B rather complex. It is useful to obtain ATP7B protein by heterologous expression in cell cultures, to perform functional characterization of the enzyme in its native form, and subsequent analysis by site-directed mutagenesis. In fact, heterologous expression in insect cells, and initial characterization, were obtained by Tsivkoskii <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and Hung <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). We report here high yield expression of WT and mutant ATP7B in COS1 cells infected with adenovirus vector, and functional characterization of membrane-bound ATPase obtained with the microsomal fraction of infected cells. The microsomal protein sustains a copper-dependent steady-state ATPase rate of 30 nmol/per mg of protein per minute at pH 6 and 37 &#x000b0;C, in the presence of 1 m<sc>m</sc> ATP. We demonstrate by proteolysis and mass spectrometry that, in addition to the invariant DKTG motif undergoing phosphorylation as a catalytic cycle intermediate in other P-type ATPases, the recombinant enzyme undergoes copper-dependent phosphorylation of four serine residues.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Construction of rAdATP7Bmyc</title><p>Recombinant adenovirus vector containing CMV promoter-driven ATP7B cDNA fused with 3&#x02032; c-<italic>myc</italic> tag was constructed as detailed below. pCMV vector containing ATP7B cDNA purchased from Origene was digested with Not1 to release the cDNA and subcloned into pShuttleCMV vector to generate pShuttleCMV-ATP7B. pShuttleCMV-ATP7B plasmid DNA was subjected to PCR amplification at an annealing temperature of 40 &#x000b0;C using the following primers: forward primer, 5&#x02032;-GGATATTTTGTCCCATTTAT-3&#x02032;; reverse primer, 5&#x02032;-ATGCAATCTAGATCACAGGTCCTCCTCTGAGATCAGCTTCTGCTCGATGTACTGCTCCTCATCCC-3&#x02032;.</p><p>The PCR product was digested with Cla1/Xba1 and ligated into pShuttleCMV-ATP7B to generate pShuttleCMV-ATP7Bmyc plasmid construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>).

In line with our observation of phosphorylation rates far higher than seen without copper induction, is the fact that phosphopeptide identification was done without the need for phosphopeptide enrichment. This experimental protocol is only viable when the phosphorylation events occur at extremely high stoichiometry.

Therefore, it is tempting to assume that the catalytic and transport mechanism is analogous to that of well characterized cation transport ATPases, such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In fact, copper-dependent phosphorylation of recombinant ATP7B protein by utilization of ATP has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and attributed in part to formation of phosphorylated enzyme intermediate and in part to additional phosphorylation of serine residues. Here we confirm occurrence of phosphorylation, and, taking advantage of the high yield expression, we demonstrate the copper dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) and define the time course of phosphoenzyme formation as well as its decay following a chase with non-radioactive ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The kinetics of phosphoenzyme formation is diphasic, with an alkali-labile fraction formed within the first 2 min of reaction. The alkali-labile phosphoenzyme is not obtained with the D1027N (putative catalytic phosphorylation site) mutant or C983A/C985A (putative transmembrane copper site at TM6) mutant. This demonstrates its identity as a phosphorylated intermediate analogous to that found in other P-type ATPases, which involves phosphorylation of an aspartyl residue within a conserved sequence of the P domain, and requires activation by copper bound to the transmembrane site. In addition, the phosphoenzyme undergoes diphasic decay, and the alkali-labile fraction decays in the early phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). This early decays is not observed when the D1027N or C983A/C985A mutant is used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). Finally, we find that the P<sub>i</sub> release obtained following addition of [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP to ATP7B begins in concomitance with the fast phase of phosphoenzyme formation and continues at a linear rate thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). This indicates that the phosphoenzyme formed within the fast phase is the catalytic intermediate. In fact, if the high level of [<sup>32</sup>P]phosphoenzyme formed in the slower phase were a catalytic intermediate, P<sub>i</sub> release would occur with a lag period, acquiring high rate only after maximal levels of phosphoenzyme are reached. It is noteworthy that the phosphorylated ATP7B protein is only partially degraded by alkaline pH, whereas the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase phosphoenzyme is totally degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Finally, consider that the phosphorylation levels exceed the stoichiometry of the ATP7B protein present in the microsomal preparation (see &#x0201c;Results&#x0201d;), indicating phosphorylation in excess of one residue per ATP7B molecule and heterogeneity of the phosphorylation sites.</p><p>Both transient and steady-state measurements indicate a very low rate of hydrolytic cleavage, which is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained in comparable experiments performed with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA1) under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, it should be pointed out that hydrolytic cleavage of the SERCA phosphoenzyme is strongly reduced when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is raised above the millimolar concentration. This phenomenon, referred to as &#x0201c;back inhibition,&#x0201d; is due to interference with net dissociation of bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the transport sites, whereby the phosphoenzyme is restricted from shifting to the calcium free state, which is the state undergoing hydrolytic cleavage. In the case of ATP7B, we consider unlikely that strongly bound copper is easily released as free Cu<sup>+</sup> from the phosphoenzyme into the medium creating a concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), but may be rather released to a specific acceptor for copper dissociation from the TMBS under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Therefore, cleavage of ATP7B phosphoenzyme in our conditions may be &#x0201c;back-inhibited&#x0201d; by the prolonged <italic>on time</italic> of copper bound to the TMBS. On the other hand, when we add a copper chelator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>), phosphoenzyme decay is totally inhibited, because copper is dissociated not only from the TMBS but also from the NMBD. In fact, it was shown that in bacterial CopA dissociation of copper allows interaction of empty NMBD with the A domain, with consequent inhibition of phosphoenzyme decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). A most important conclusion is that activation of ATP7B depends on copper binding to the TMBS as well as to the NMBD.</p><p>Another aspect of our experiments is related to identification of residues undergoing phosphorylation at rates lower than the phosphoenzyme intermediate, and reaching levels higher than the enzyme stoichiometry in the microsomal preparation. In fact, evidence for a phosphorylation site between Met<sup>796</sup> and Ser<sup>1384</sup> of ATP7B within liver cells <italic>in situ</italic> was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and the possible phosphorylation of several residues in recombinant ATP7B was indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Taking advantage of the high yield expression of ATP7B in COS-1 cells infected with rAdATP7Bmyc, we proceeded to identify by phosphoproteomic analysis and mass spectrometry the specific residues undergoing copper-dependent phosphorylation upon addition of ATP to our microsomal preparations. We found that Ser<sup>478</sup> and Ser<sup>481</sup> were phosphorylated within the NMBD, Ser<sup>1121</sup> within the N domain, and Ser<sup>1453</sup> within the C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>). Reliable phosphorylation signal on Asp<sup>1027</sup>, the putative residue undergoing phosphorylation as an intermediate in the catalytic cycle, was not detected. This is possibly due to hydrolytic cleavage during the long procedure of proteolysis, peptide separation, and mass spectrometry. It is noteworthy that a fairly high phosphorylation level of the serine residues was already found even before incubation of the microsomes with ATP <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating occurrence of phosphorylation within the cultured cells <italic>in situ</italic>. Therefore, the slow phosphorylation of serine residues with [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP <italic>in vitro</italic> reflects a requirement for dephosphorylation before exchange with [<sup>32</sup>P]PO<sub>4</sub> can take place. In fact, incubation of microsomes with phosphatase previous to exposure to [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP increases early formation of [<sup>32</sup>P]phosphoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>).</p><fig id="F11" position="float"><label>FIGURE 11.</label><caption><p><bold>Two-dimensional folding model of the ATP7B sequence, showing serine residues undergoing phosphorylation.</bold> The position of phosphorylated serine residues, demonstrated by phosphopeptide analysis using MS, is shown in the ATP7B sequence modeled as proposed by Lutsenko <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0360984720011"/></fig><p>It has been proposed that phosphorylation of serine residues plays an important role in copper homeostasis, promoting functional interactions of cuproenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). It is noteworthy that phosphorylation of ATP7B in human cells is copper-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and this phosphorylation appears to play an important role in copper homeostasis and ATP7B trafficking within the cell. In agreement with these findings, we find that phosphorylation of recombinant ATP7B in our microsomal preparation is totally copper-dependent. It is possible that ATP7B phosphorylation sites become exposed as a consequence of copper-induced conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). It is also apparent that serine phosphorylation plays a role in regulation of the copper ATPase catalytic cycle. In fact, it was reported that the activity of yeast copper ATPase Ccc2p is regulated by Ser<sup>258</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Our finding of two phosphorylated serines (Ser<sup>478</sup> and Ser<sup>481</sup>) within the NMBD is intriguing, because the NMBD of ATP7B undergoes copper-dependent conformational changes and interaction with chaperone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grant RO301-69830 from the NHBLI.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN3"><label>2</label><p>The abbreviations used are: <def-list><def-item><term id="G1">TMBS</term><def><p>transmembrane metal binding site</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">SERCA1</term><def><p>sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">NMBD</term><def><p>N-terminal metal binding domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">MOPS</term><def><p>3-(<italic>N</italic>-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">BCS</term><def><p>bathocuproine disulfonate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">BCA</term><def><p>bicinchoninic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">MS</term><def><p>mass spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">MS/MS</term><def><p>tandem MS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">TM6</term><def><p>transmembrane 6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">CMV</term><def><p>cytomegalovirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G11">PBS</term><def><p>phosphate-buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G12">MES</term><def><p>4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G13">DTT</term><def><p>dithiothreitol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G14">GFP</term><def><p>green fluorescent protein.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lutsenko</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Barnes</surname><given-names>N.
