Previous structural studies of membrane fusion proteins have largely used crystallography of static molecular fragments, in isolation of their transmembrane domains. In this study we have produced purified, irradiated SARS-CoV virions that retain their morphology, and are fusogenic in cell culture. We used cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to investigate conformational changes that occur in the entire spike of intact virions when they bind to the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We have shown that ACE2 binding results in structural changes that appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion, and precisely localized the receptor-binding and fusion core domains within the entire spike. Furthermore, our results show that receptor binding and subsequent membrane fusion are distinct steps, and that each spike can bind up to three ACE2 molecules. The SARS-CoV spike provides an ideal model system to study receptor binding and membrane fusion in the native state, employing cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viral membrane fusion proteins are responsible both for binding to cellular receptors, and the subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes.

Class I viral fusion proteins can also be divided into two sub-types; those whose fusion mechanism is low pH-dependent such as influenza HA, and those that are pH-independent like the retroviral fusion proteins. In retroviruses, receptor binding itself can trigger fusion, with temperature and redox conditions also influencing the fusion mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Hernandez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Damico1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although the factors which trigger fusion (endocytosis, pH sensitivity, single receptor vs. primary and co-receptor binding, redox change) differ amongst diverse virus families, all viral fusion proteins are thought to share the same basic fusion mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Dutch1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Skehel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Baker1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Hofmann1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A notable feature of the SARS spike is its large mass (&#x0223c;500 kD per trimer) and striking, club-shaped appearance, from the end-on, this appears like a three-bladed propeller with a radius of 90 &#x000c5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Beniac1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the structural differences, the SARS spike performs the same fundamental task in viral entry to the host cell as other class I viral fusion proteins, such as the influenza HA (&#x0223c;220 kD per trimer). The SARS spike can be subdivided into four structural domains (from N to C terminus); the two large external domains S1 and S2 are largely responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. In many class I viral fusion proteins the analogous peptides are generated by proteolysis of the spike precursor during the maturation process in the host cell, resulting in two peptides with the fusion peptide on the N-terminus of S2. In SARS-CoV the S1/S2 assignment is given based on sequence homology to other viral fusion proteins, however there is no peptide cleavage during maturation. The final two small domains are comprised of a transmembrane domain, and a carboxyterminal cytoplasmic domain, which principally anchor the spike to the viral envelope. The cell-surface molecule ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS spike protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Li1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and is a relatively large macromolecule with a diameter of 70 &#x000c5;. In comparison, the receptor for influenza HA, sialic acid, is much smaller with a 10 &#x000c5; diameter. The precise mechanisms by which class I viral fusion proteins gain access to the host cell remain unknown. The hypothetical entry process includes several steps that take place in sequence: receptor binding, fusion core re-arrangement, fusion peptide insertion in host cell membrane, refolding of heptad repeats, membrane fusion, and finally viral nucleocapsid transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Earp1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The structures of ACE2 bound to a fragment of the SARS spike containing the receptor-binding domain and the pre- and post-fusion configurations of the fusion core heptad repeats of the spike have been solved to atomic resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-HakanssonMcReynolds1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Xu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Li2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Duquerroy1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

The aim of the present study was to delineate any possible structural changes in the SARS spike that accompanied receptor-binding, and to precisely localize the receptor binding domains (which are only 14&#x00025; of the total mass of the spike) within the overall structure, employing cryo-EM and image processing of intact virions bound to soluble ACE2. We demonstrate the structural dynamics which accompany spike-receptor binding, which may be involved in triggering membrane fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To study the structure of the spike-ACE2 complex, we infected Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV and purified supernatant virus by iodoxanol density gradient centrifugation.

Although SARS-CoV is approximately spherical when observed by cryo-EM, both its size and shape vary slightly, and thus it is not amenable to single-particle averaging techniques. However, individual spikes on the surface envelope of the virus do provide a repetitive structure that is ideal for single particle techniques. Spikes on the surface of virus particles are readily imaged by cryo-EM in the frozen-hydrated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001082-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

In both cases the spike portion of the 3D structure is fairly similar, indicating that ACE2 binding does not result in a fundamental structural unfolding of the spike. However, the overall height of the spike was reduced from 160 &#x000c5; to 150 &#x000c5; following ACE2 binding. When viewed from the end-on perspective and the spike undergoes a rotation of &#x0223c;5&#x000b0; following binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001082.s002">Movie S2</xref>), and the mass at the center of the axis of symmetry on the distal end of the spike redistributes itself from one small central blob to three blobs or nubs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001082-g003">Figure 3 F,J</xref>).

As expected the receptor-binding domain docked to the distal end of the spike with ACE2 filling the extra mass on the spike (shown by the color violet in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001082-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The empty upper region of the mass is likely composed of the Fc component of the chimeric protein. Although this chimeric molecule is dimeric, only one leg of the ACE-2 is able to bind to each of the three receptor binding domains of the trimer. We anticipate the mass distal to the hinge region to be flexible, and therefore components were blurred out in the averaging process, leaving only a portion of the additional mass in the 3-D map. The C-terminus of the docked ACE2 is in a location consistent with this interpretation. Previously we modeled the putative location of the receptor-binding domain and ACE2 in the cryo-EM structure of the unbound spike using solely the receptor-binding domain atomic resolution data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Beniac1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we have shown that our previous prediction of the location of the receptor-binding domain was only partially correct. The actual location of the receptor binding domain and ACE2 are in fact shifted 29 &#x000c5; towards the 3-fold axis, corresponding to about 40&#x00025; of the diameter of ACE2. The results from the present study will aid in the precise location of future atomic resolution structure fragments of the SARS spike, as well as in the structural mapping of neutralizing antibody-binding epitopes (which are in progress).

Similar observations on the induction of &#x0201c;fusion-from-without&#x0201d; were made when cells surface-expressing the spike protein were mixed with cells expressing ACE-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Frank1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The trigger that initiates membrane fusion varies amongst class I fusion proteins, with some activated by receptor binding, others by pH, and others by redox conditions. In most proposed models of membrane fusion it is postulated that the S1 domain or analogous receptor binding domains dissociate from the spike during the membrane fusion process. This dynamic process was demonstrated for influenza HA by Kemble <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Kemble1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> in their investigation where they engineered intermonomer disulfide bonds between the HA S1 subunits. The result of this was that fusion activity was impaired; however it could be restored under reducing conditions. It is likely that the SARS spike shares a similar mechanism, and the structural changes that we have detected represent the initial step in this process.</p><p>By analogy with other class I viral fusion proteins, we anticipate that the fusion core of the SARS spike must undergo similar structural re-arrangements during fusion. The receptor-binding domain is localized in a position on the distal end of the molecule, closer to the 3-fold axis than anticipated, yet still in a position that would not impede these structural re-arrangements. Putative mechanisms by which class I viral fusion proteins achieve membrane fusion have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Dutch1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Skehel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Baker1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Dimitrov1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, but complete structural evidence for the role of intermediate structures in these mechanisms has yet to be obtained. The structural biology of this process has been best characterized for the influenza hemagglutinin, and paramyxovirus fusion (F) protein, for which the pre-fusion and membrane fusion pH structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Skehel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Yin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Yin2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Sauter1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Bullough1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. All of the subsequent models for class I viral fusion proteins are based on the structural data of these two fusion proteins. A drawback in all of these models is that they are based on recombinant ectodomains that are not proven to exist as a component in the complete molecule, and they lack both membrane-interacting residues, and lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Skehel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The cryo-EM structures presented in this investigation are of intact SARS spike bound to native virion lipid envelopes. The cryo-EM data are very instructive when atomic resolution fragments are docked within the overall molecule, especially as the entire SARS spike has proven to be a difficult subject for X-ray crystallography, and atomic resolution data exist for only a few fragments of the SARS spike. Our cryo-EM results show that it is possible for the spike to attach to three ACE2 receptors at once; this may serve to hold on to the host membrane like a tripod so as to accurately orientate the fusion core. In addition the 30 &#x000c5; gap between the axis of symmetry and ACE2 provides sufficient space for fusion core rearrangement. Damico et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Damico1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that the kinetics of binding of the Rous sarcoma virus envelope protein to its receptor suggested that binding of each spike molecule to multiple receptor monomers occurred. It may therefore be possible that other structurally homologous viral envelope proteins can also bind multiple receptors, and this may be a general adaptation that provides the correct temporal and spatial arrangement to bring about membrane fusion. The observation that the SARS spike could bind three soluble ACE2 receptors provides three possible binding states with one, two or three membrane-bound receptors attached to the spike. With one or two receptors bound, the spike and virus have a wide range of movement possible. Whereas, in the case of three bound receptors the spike and its fusion core will be arranged perpendicular to the cell surface with minimal movement possible. It is interesting to note that binding three receptors is the minimum number of binding events required to achieve this perpendicular orientation in three dimensional space. This observation matches up with the conserved trimeric structures of class I fusion proteins which are common amongst enveloped viruses, thus indicating a possible conserved structural-functional relationship may exist. Another line of reasoning is that oligomerisation favors a better &#x0201c;chance&#x0201d; of successful receptor binding and subsequent insertion of the fusion peptide into the host membrane. According to this model, oligomeric multiples higher then three would be favored, whereas the &#x0201c;tripod&#x0201d; model of receptor binding favors the conserved trimeric structures of class I viral fusion proteins.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001082-g003">Figure 3</xref> we have we have presented the ACE2&#x02013;SARS structures as they were solved in this cryo-EM investigation. For other fusion proteins like influenza HA1 and HIV GP120 it has been modeled that the re-arrangements upon membrane fusion are dramatic involving a shedding of the above mentioned domains. In this investigation we have detected structural movement of S1 upon ACE2 binding. This could represent the initial phase of this dramatic process that is followed by fusion core re-arrangement, fusion peptide insertion in the host cell membrane, refolding of heptad repeats, and finally membrane fusion.</p><p>Analyzing the structure of the spike-receptor complex is essential to understanding how viruses can adapt to utilize receptors from different species and how they may evolve to gain specificity for new receptor types. RNA viruses have a high rate of mutation and recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Moya1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. In SARS coronaviruses, the spike is able to retain specific binding affinity for the ACE2 of more than one host species, and rapid evolution to gain specificity for novel ACE2 species has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Li3">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Li4">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The structure and large size of the spike of coronaviruses appears to be an adaptation related to utilization of large host cell-surface molecules such as ACE2 as specific receptors. Amongst the Coronavirus family, specific cell surface receptors for the spike protein are all in the range of 60&#x02013;110 kD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001082-Wentworth1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. These large host receptor molecules are in turn functionally constrained and thus conserved across species barriers. In utilizing binding to a large receptor molecule, it may be important that the spike S1 domain also acts as a &#x0201c;spacer arm&#x0201d; holding the receptor far enough away from the three-fold axis of symmetry of the spike S2 domain to permit fusion core re-arrangement and subsequent membrane fusion. Such a property necessitates having a large spike molecule. Moreover, multiple receptor binding may have functional significance, enhancing the binding and entry of viruses. Cross-linking of adjacent host receptor molecules could increase the affinity of the virus for its target cell, as well as improving the kinetics of fusion. The SARS spike-ACE2 complex is an ideal model system for the investigation of class I viral fusion protein dynamics, utilizing cryo-EM to investigate fusion protein binding and structural changes in the native state, within virion membranes that are fusogenic. The presence of a common cell fusion mechanism shared by diverse virus families holds the prospect of developing broad-spectrum anti-virals that target these conserved mechanisms, as well as the potential use of these fusogenic proteins in drug delivery systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>SARS-CoV (Tor3 strain) was inoculated onto Vero E6 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; foetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin, and 0.22 mg/ml l-glutamine at 37&#x000b0;C with 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.
