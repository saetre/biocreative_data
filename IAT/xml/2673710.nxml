Here, we present a global survey of protein expression during mouse lung organogenesis from embryonic day E13.5 until adulthood using gel-free two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to shotgun tandem mass spectrometry (MudPIT). Mathematical modeling of the proteomic profiles with parallel DNA microarray data identified large groups of gene products with statistically significant correlation or divergence in coregulation of protein and transcript levels during lung development. We also present an integrative analysis of mRNA and protein expression in <italic>Nmyc</italic> loss- and gain-of-function mutants. This revealed a set of 90 positively and negatively regulated putative target genes. These targets are evidence that Nmyc is a regulator of genes involved in mRNA processing and a repressor of the imprinted gene Igf2r in the developing lung.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>microarray</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>Nmyc</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mouse lung primordia are specified from the ventral foregut endoderm at the 7&#x02013;8 somite stage of the early embryo. Specification occurs in responses to Fgf signals arising from the cardiac mesoderm via Fgfr1 and 2 in the underlying definitive endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Serls <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). At E9.5, two buds of lung epithelium protrude into the surrounding splanchnic mesoderm in response to Fgf10 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bellusci <italic>et al</italic>, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arman <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Sekine <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Desai <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The pseudoglandular stage follows, during which the trachea, mainstem bronchi and five major lung lobes are established. The majority of stereo-specific branching of lung bronchi occurs up to day 16.5. The branching process is thought to be developmentally hard-wired, wherein multiple signaling factors coordinately establish morphogenic signaling centers where branching occurs. This process involves interplay of morphogenic signals from the mesenchyme (Fgf10, Bmp4) and the epithelium (Shh, Bmp4) as well as contributions from Tgf-beta family members (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Cardoso and Lu, 2006</xref>). Vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf), a potent inducer of vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Kalinichenko <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Ng <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), is expressed in the epithelium and promotes development of the vasculature in synchrony with the bronchi and bronchiole branching, such that major veins and arteries follow the branching pattern of the bronchi. Terminal bronchi develop over 24 h during the canalicular stage beginning at E16.5. This process involves the terminal budding of the epithelium into sacs, which are in tight apposition with the mesoderm-derived vasculature. The period from E 17.5 until postnatal day 5 is the terminal sac stage, which is characterized by an increase in the number of terminal sacs and capillaries. The increase in capillary plexus appears to take place by &#x02018;intussusceptive angiogenesis', a process by which slender transcapillary tissue pillars extend at regular intervals between adjacent capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Burri and Tarek, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Patan <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>).</p><p>The cells forming the terminal sacs next differentiate into Type I and Type II alveolar cells. The majority of gas exchange is mediated by Type I cells, whereas the Type II cells secrete lung surfactant proteins. A subset of the Type II cells appear to be stem cells for the generation of more alveolar Type I and Type II cells. Despite this detailed knowledge of the main signaling processes involved in mediating branching (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Chuang and McMahon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Warburton <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bartram and Speer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Cardoso and Lu, 2006</xref>) and morphology of lung development, little is known about the gene products that are downstream of these developmental signals.</p><p>Genetically engineered mouse mutant models using gene knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Kimura <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Sekine <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>), conditional alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Eblaghie <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), hypomorphic alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Moens <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">1993</xref>) or transgene misexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bellusci <italic>et al</italic>, 1997a</xref>) have all been used to gain insight into the genetic pathways controlling lung morphogenesis. However, the majority of these analyses used a small number of cell-specific markers that provided limited information regarding the full complement of molecular components underlying individual phenotypes, and did not reveal the full complexity of the developmental synthesis. To circumvent these limitations, three groups have published global microarray expression analyses of normal lung development, examining expression over time and comparing the proximal and distal parts of the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Mariani <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bonner <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004a</xref>). However, the expression levels and localization of the corresponding cognate proteins are still largely unknown.</p><p>Large-scale analysis of the proteome in an unbiased manner is increasingly possible through developments in the application of tandem mass spectrometry (MS) for highly sensitive protein characterization. The advent of gel-free proteomic profiling in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Wolters <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) has facilitated large-scale, high-throughput shotgun peptide sequencing to systematically investigate the proteome of mammalian cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Washburn <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Florens <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Koller <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The accurate determination of protein relative abundance by replicate analysis, in combination with spectral counting methods, has made proteomic datasets amenable to comparative analysis using many of the same tools and techniques developed for microarray studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Zybailov <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our group has previously reported the development of a proteomics investigation strategy for mouse (PRISM) based on MudPIT, which markedly increases the depth of coverage via sample prefractionation into organellar compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Unlike other proteomic screening methods, our fractionation procedure has the advantage that both tissue and subcellular specificity can be assayed from the same sample preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2006</xref>). We have reported the application of PRISM to exhaustively assess the molecular composition of adult mouse tissues (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung and placenta) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). We have also developed a principled mathematical model to compare protein and microarray expression profiles recorded in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the application of these techniques to a time-course study of lung organogenesis at well-defined stages of development. Comparison of the proteomic data with mRNA expression profiles revealed a large number of gene products with coordinately regulated expression. There was also a smaller group of gene products with expression profiles suggestive of post-translational or post-transcriptional control. Having established a baseline of protein profiles during normal lung development, we analyzed the proteome and transcriptome of lungs from mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of <italic>Nmyc</italic>, which encodes a basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix leucine-zipper protein shown to be critical for lung development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Moens <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Okubo <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). We compared the resulting proteomic and transcriptomic patterns with an <italic>Nmyc</italic> gain-of-function microarray data set published recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Okubo <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Mining of the cognate expression profiles identified plausible direct targets of Nmyc regulation, including factors involved in mRNA splicing, nuclear export and localization, which had not previously been linked to Nmyc. Taken together, our findings support the view that Nmyc is a key regulator of the transcriptional processing environment of the undifferentiated lung epithelium.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Efficient identification of proteins with restricted spatial and temporal expression</title><p>We collected lung samples at six time points (E13.5, E16.5, E18.5, P2, P14 and P56) from timed mating of ICR mice. These time points cover many of the major phases of lung development including pseudoglandular, canalicular, terminal sac, alveologenesis and septation and growth towards fully developed adult lungs. Sufficient tissues were collected at all times to fractionate and analyze in duplicate (see Materials and methods). Although we and others have shown that this level of replicate sampling by shotgun LC-MS does not achieve saturation of detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Durr <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), the quantity of tissues at the earliest time point (E13.5) was limiting, with over 200 lungs required for two replicates of all three fractions; nevertheless, coverage is estimated to be between 75 and 80&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). A total of 36 MudPIT analyses were performed, generating over 1.5 million MS/MS spectra. These were sequence mapped against a combined mouse and human protein database obtained from SwissProt/Trembl (EBI release 40) using SEQUEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Eng <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>). Combined data sets have been used by us and others to increase the protein identification rate of species with incomplete sequence coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Schirmer <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Redundant cross species hits were removed by reciprocal BLAST, ensuring only unique proteins are reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Schirmer <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). High-scoring peptide matches were then collated into candidate parent proteins.</p><p>The data set was then stringently filtered by accepting only those proteins with two or more independently collected MS/MS spectra, each with a predicted &#x02a7e;95&#x00025; confidence likelihood as determined using the STATQUEST probability model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2006</xref>). This resulted in the identification of 3330 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table I</xref>). As our search database contained an equal number of reversed decoy sequences, we were able to estimate the false discovery rate on average to be &#x0223c;2.5&#x00025; (ranging from 4.6 to 0.7&#x00025; per fraction), similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2006</xref>). The entire proteomic data set has been deposited in the public GEO database at NCBI under the series GSE6108.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantification of protein levels</title><p>Protein relative abundance was estimated using the spectral count method, which reflects the ratio of all matching MS/MS spectra above the specified statistical filter for any given protein per fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). This technique was shown to be linear over at least two orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, Washburn and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Zybailov <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) have shown that the spectral counts quantitative method performed as well or better than stable isotope labeling-based quantitation methods when determining relative change calls. This method, however, was not useful for the calculation of absolute protein abundance. As we wished to detect the relative changes of protein expression as a function of developmental time, absolute protein abundance is not necessary and the spectral counting method is sufficient.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cluster analysis of protein expression data</title><p>Two-dimensional hierarchical clustering of the entire data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) resolved the proteins back to their organelle(s) of origin. There was a statistically higher overlap of identified proteins in adjacent chronological time points (data not shown). This was observed strongest in the cytosolic fraction, where the embryonic fractions grouped away from the postnatal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The nuclear and mitochondrial fractions also show some separation of the early embryonic from later embryonic and postnatal time points, although to a lesser degree. These trends imply that the protein data have captured cell biological and developmental relationships. Consistent with this, we also observed statistically significant enrichment of proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) functional and cellular location terms specific to each of the three subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table II</xref>).</p><p>The lung contains many specialized cellular structures such as microvilli and cilia, as well as several subcellular structures such as lamellar bodies and secretory vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Ten Have-Opbroek, 1991</xref>). The fractionation conditions utilized here will not separate these structures specifically and the detection of their component proteins will be suboptimal. Nevertheless, we do detect proteins such as ciliary dynein heavy chain 5 and 7 and subunits of vaculolar ATP synthase (subunits A, B, D and G), the retromer complex (Vps29 and Vps35) and the ESCRT-II complex (Vps36). This suggests that protein components of these specialized structures should be detectable if more optimized fractionation protocols are used.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Proteomics as a predictor of cellular location by KNN</title><p>Large-scale proteomics experiments that employ cellular fractionation can be used to annotate proteins to cellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Foster <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Similar to our previous work, nearly two-thirds (2100/3336) of the proteins were uniquely identified to single subcellular fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). We next employed machine learning to assign a probability score that a protein's observed subcellular location was the correct location.</p><p>We have previously shown the utility of <italic>K</italic>-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine learning as a method for refined prediction of protein subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In our current study, we used a Dense KNN derivative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) since it exhibited better performance (data not shown). The following three sets of data were required for this analysis: a training set with positive and negative examples of the desired outcome (e.g. known nuclear localized proteins), a test set with positive and negative examples that had not been used for training and the prediction set of the unknowns to be determined. For each subcellular fraction, independent training (total set size was 860 proteins, with 358 cytosolic positives, 187 mitochondrion positives and 315 nuclear positives) and test data sets were generated using SwissProt/TREMBL (SP) annotation current as of Uniprot release 7.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table III</xref>). A summary of set sizes is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table II</xref>. As these sets are not balanced, having more negative than positive examples, we used a 10-fold cross-validation procedure to ensure there was no bias during training. We used area under the curve (AUC) to derive the optimal value of <italic>K</italic>, which proved to be 15 for the KNN learner in all training sets (data not shown).</p><p>Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for the training sets showed a high degree of specificity and sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The specificity, sensitivity and precision were calculated by a confusion matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004b</xref>). Across all compartments, the mean sensitivity was 0.82 (varying from 0.75 to 0.91), precision was 0.84 (0.83&#x02013;0.86) and specificity was 0.94 (0.92&#x02013;0.95). To gauge the robustness of these predictions, we used a set of proteins with GO cellular location terms for cytosol, mitochondria and nucleus that did not have established SP localization terms as the test set. The ROC curves for the test data set are displayed along with the training ROC curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>) and were largely comparable, even considering the different annotation sources of the training and test data sets. The entire data set, along with spectral counts, predicted localizations and SP and GO annotations is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table IV</xref>, whereas a summary is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table II</xref>.</p><p>Of the 2230 proteins in the prediction set, nearly 60&#x00025; (1288) had predictions with &#x0003e;75&#x00025; confidence; among these, nearly 80&#x00025; (1001) represented novel localizations as they lacked relevant GO and SP annotations. Setting the prediction at a threshold of 75&#x00025;, we then clustered the complete set of protein fractions along with the putative SP and GO annotations and our predictions for visual inspection. Good overall agreement was apparent in the resulting clustergram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Interesting patterns were also observed after clustering even with those proteins with lower confidence predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>), such as a large group of mitochondria-localized proteins. Closer inspection of this cluster indicated that the majority of these proteins occurred at a single time point of the mitochondrial fractions and that they were likewise coenriched with plasma membrane, ER, Golgi, as well as many extracellular/secreted proteins.</p><p>As a further test of these predictions, we constructed and sequence confirmed 12 expression plasmids with C-terminal fusions to GFP, consisting of five nuclear, five mitochondrial and two cytosolic predicted localized proteins. Each of these proteins had a prediction greater than 75&#x00025; and had no literature confirmation of their cellular location by direct <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis. The plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (293T) cells and imaged 24 h post infection by spinning disk confocal microscopy. Hoechst and Mito Tracker dye were used as a counter stain and to assess colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Three of five nuclear, three of five of mitochondrial and both cytosolic proteins localized to the predicted organelle. Interestingly, each of the three nuclear proteins clearly labeled different regions of the nucleus indicating that we have sampled a range of sub-organellar compartments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Integration with public genome-scale data sets</title><p>The integration of multiple large-scale data sets could be used to mine information for hypothesis building.

We cross-referenced our protein data to the list of mutant lines and annotated a number of genes with known lung mutant phenotypes. The phenotypes did not generally correlate with the putative organellar localization of the detected proteins (data not shown, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table V</xref>). For example, broad terms such as &#x02018;abnormal lung morphology' were found to span proteins from all three subcellular factions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table V</xref>). Similarly, there was little correlation for time and phenotype as many genes expressed throughout development of the lung are critical to development at different stages. Therefore, by assessing the coexpression of known interacting partners of these proteins with known mutant phenotypes, we thought it possible to uncover connections between these seemingly unrelated proteins.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Protein interaction networks</title><p>Examination of protein interaction networks may make it possible to predict the participation of other physically interacting proteins in developmental pathways based on spatial-temporal coexpression. To investigate this, we examined a set of 10 proteins identified in this study known to have the phenotype &#x02018;abnormal alveolar morphology': ADA&#x0005f;MOUSE, CD81&#x0005f;MOUSE, DHI1&#x0005f;MOUSE, G3BP&#x0005f;MOUSE, PRDX6&#x0005f;MOUSE, FBLN5&#x0005f;MOUSE, PSPC&#x0005f;MOUSE, MO4L1&#x0005f;MOUSE, CO2A1&#x0005f;MOUSE and EGFR&#x0005f;MOUSE. An interaction map based on the human homologues of these 10 proteins in the OPHID database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://ophid.utoronto.ca">http://ophid.utoronto.ca</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Brown and Jurisica, 2005</xref>) (see Materials and methods) returned a list of 161 known interactions for ADA&#x0005f;MOUSE, CD81&#x0005f;MOUSE, G3BP&#x0005f;MOUSE and EGFR&#x0005f;MOUSE, whereas the remaining proteins had no known interactions in the database. The interactions were then filtered for those proteins likewise detected in our proteomic screening, revealing a highly interconnected map of 46 proteins linking three of the alveoli phenotype gene products (CD81&#x0005f;MOUSE, G3BP&#x0005f;MOUSE and EGFR&#x0005f;MOUSE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with the biological significance of this network, both EGFR and G3BP mutants have similar strain-dependent alveolar phenotypes, supporting the functionality of the inferred link between them through their interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Threadgill <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Zekri <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).

A set of 1383 protein probe pairs were generated, with protein levels monitored by spectral counts across each time point and organelle, while mRNA levels were likewise estimated based on probe intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table VI</xref>). The combined data set was then clustered based on the gene expression patterns so as to reveal the overall degree of correlation as well as clusters of discordance in the global expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Previous correlation analyses of protein and mRNA, represented by either microarray or SAGE data, utilized simple Pearson or Spearman correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Gygi <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Griffin <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Although these simpler methods revealed correlated gene product relationships, they lacked a robust noise model or method for determination of confidence of the correlation. We opted, instead, for a probabilistic approach to model the relationship between protein and mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kislinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). This has the advantage of treating the microarray data with a Gaussian noise model and the protein data as a Poisson distribution. As equivalent data points are required for the correlation analysis, we created a table of protein data with all cell fraction data summed for each time point and paired this with microarray data that matched these time points. The strength of the relationship between microarray and protein data was determined and assigned a correlation score, while a confidence score (<italic>P</italic>-value) was assigned by permutation testing of randomized data. This allowed division of the data into significantly (or insignificantly) correlating (&#x02018;inliers') and non-correlating (&#x02018;outliers') gene product pairs.</p><p>Of the 1383 protein microarray data pairs, 643 were deemed to be significant inliers, 30 were called significant outliers, 699 as insignificant inliers and 11 as insignificant outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figures 5A&#x02013;D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table VI</xref>).

We next examined these clusters for evidence of functional coherence based on enrichment for common GO functional terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). For example, a cluster of protein/mRNA pairs with correlated decreasing expression, Cluster 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>), was enriched in genes associated with DNA replication, chromosome organization, and biogenesis (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 in all cases), genes that are critical to tissue and cellular development and differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table VII</xref>).

However, by combining resources, one is able to ask focused questions of the data sets and select promising candidate genes for mechanistic studies. We have presented several examples throughout this work, including comparison of protein and mRNA profiles and protein interaction databases.</p><p>Machine learning was able to learn the profiles of known nuclear, mitochondrial and cytosolic localized proteins and calculate probabilities for proteins with no cellular location annotation. Expression of GFP fusions of proteins with novel cellular location prediction held up in the majority of cases (eight of 12 fusion proteins expressed) when expressed in 293T cells. Aside from failure of the KNN algorithm prediction, failure of the protein to localize as predicted could be due to the differences in the <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular environment of lungs versus <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture. As well, the presence of GFP on the C-terminus may affect the ability of the proteins to be properly localized.</p><p>In an examination of the interaction partners of lung proteins with known alveolar developmental phenotypes, we were able to link three into an interaction cluster. In this analysis, G3bp was found to be linked to Paxi (paxillin) and Tln1 (talin-1), both of which are involved in focal adhesion complex linking the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane as well as responding to signaling environments. Paxi and Tln1 interact with integrin alpha 5 (Ita5) and Tenascin (Tena) linking them to Egfr. Null mutations of either <italic>paxillin</italic> or <italic>talin-1</italic> result in early embryonic lethality: <italic>talin-1</italic>-null embryos have an earlier phenotype at gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Monkley <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), whereas <italic>paxillin</italic>-null embryos exhibit a later phenotype with absent hearts and abnormal somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Hagel <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). For this reason, the role of talin-1 or paxillin in alveologenesis is as yet unexplored, but perhaps by use of conditional alleles of <italic>paxillin</italic> or <italic>talin-1</italic> their function in alveologenesis may be uncovered. Nevertheless, our data suggest a possible role for G3bp regulation of the focal adhesion complex in the development of the alveolar structures. The focal adhesion complex is also involved in vascular development and it is possible that the observed protein expression is derived from the lung vascular tissue; however, there is a tight association with vascular and alveolar development and a defect in either can affect the other.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dynamic gene regulation during development</title><p>With so much expression data at hand, we could examine the relationship between the mRNA and corresponding protein levels.

There are several caveats to this analysis. First, mammalian genes are often differentially spliced to produce specific variants, which can confound attempts to map to the cognate protein product. It is also possible that differences are a reflection of variables in the genetic background of the mice used for this study and those for the microarray. Despite these caveats, there were still over 1300 pairs of gene products with sufficient information for correlative analysis.</p><p>After taking into account the reliability of the experimental measurements, we were able to cross-compare the protein and microarray patterns using a more robust statistical modeling method. The high-confidence correlated gene product group (significant inliers) revealed subgroups exhibiting either dynamic or stable expression profiles during lung organogenesis enriched with anticipated gene products. The more interesting groups of gene products were the non-correlating groups as these may be enriched for genes that undergo post-transcriptional or post-translational control. We note several data pairs that appear to have a delayed translation; however, it is not possible without further experimental evidence to conclude if this is a post-translational or post-transcriptional mechanism.</p><p>In the list of insignificant correlating pairs, we note many groups of proteins enrich to general terms such as localization, metabolism and mitochondria.

It is therefore of great value to have the ability to measure the molecular changes in protein and transcript expression to more fully characterize the biochemical function of a gene in development. We used the available gain- and loss-of-function alleles of the transcription factor Nmyc to study its role in lung development in great molecular detail. Nmyc is a basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix leucine-zipper transcription factor known to function as a transcriptional activator and a repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Cole and McMahon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Patel <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).

This data set included several known direct targets of Nmyc regulation and is now a great source for future studies involving transcription factor motif identification and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Of the potential positive targets of Nmyc, we noted some correspondence to previously described target proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Boon <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Patel <italic>et al</italic> (2004)</xref>, including Nucleolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Murakami <italic>et al</italic>, 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">1991b</xref>).

These gene products were enriched in mRNA processing factors that spanned a wide range of activities. For example, there were two ATP-dependent helicases, four factors annotated as involved in mRNA splicing, one suggested to be involved in the regulation of the U4/U6 &#x000d7; U5 tri-snRNP complex, one potential translation elongation factor and two potential mRNA nuclear export factors. The exact role of these factors cannot be discerned as many have only electronic annotation based on the presence of protein domains with associated functions, such as RNA binding motifs. These novel mRNA processing factors may regulate a specific subset of mRNAs and may not be part of the general splicing/translation machinery. It will be of great interest to further characterize and identify the targets of these mRNA processing factors.</p><p>Our data suggest that Nmyc maintains the undifferentiated state of the distal epithelial cells of the lung not by directly regulating other multipotentcy genes but largely through the positive regulation of the mRNA processing factors that may maintain the active translation and splicing of multipotentcy genes. This is partially supported by our observation that proteins with an increased expression in <italic>Nmyc9a</italic> were enriched for structural and cell adhesion functions that are typically more robustly expressed at later stages in development or in association with mature differentiated cell types.</p><p>We also identified a small number of potential negative targets of Nmyc regulation with a variety of functions. One target was Stat3, a TF often activated in a variety of human cancers, including lung (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Bromberg, 2002</xref>), although previous specific deletion of Stat3 in the lung epithelium resulted in no obvious developmental defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Hokuto <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Igf2r also appeared to be negatively regulated. Igf2r is a negative regulator of Igf2 signaling and embryos with a null mutation in Igf2r are 30&#x00025; larger and present defects in alveologenesis, a process which generates terminally differentiated epithelial cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>). Igf2r is an imprinted gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Barlow <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>), regulated by the expression of the non-coding transcript Air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Sleutels <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The question of whether Nmyc has a role on the imprinting status of Igf2r may be interesting to investigate in future work. Mrc2, which also appears negatively regulated, is involved in regulation of extracellular matrix, specifically collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">East <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and matrix metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Engelholm <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). ECM remodeling is a process that is dynamically regulated during lung development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Suki <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and is correlated with regulation of cell signaling environments and cell differentiation.</p><p>In conclusion, Nmyc appears to play a role in regulating the environment of the undifferentiated epithelium. Internally Nmyc may positively regulate many novel mRNA processing factors, ranging from splicing, nuclear export and translation elongation factors. Nmyc may also negatively regulate a suppressor of Igf2 signaling and the deposition of collagen and secretion of MMP involved in ECM remodeling.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Improvements to detection limits and sample preparation enable analysis of embryonic tissues</title><p>Although the basic MudPIT procedure has undergone substantive improvements in terms of instrumentation, analytical methodologies and analysis algorithms, the procedure still does not achieve the apparent detection sensitivity or coverage reported for DNA microarray technologies. Nevertheless, it has still afforded an in-depth probing of the proteome of mammalian tissue systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Washburn <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Florens <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Koller <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Using high-throughput screening techniques such as tandem MS, a biological system like lung can potentially be interrogated to identify its core components and their respective interactions and modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Washburn <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Wolters <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Ballif <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The application of proteomics to developmental biology presents several critical challenges, however. The first issue pertains to the often limiting amounts of material that can be gathered for proteomic analysis. In our case, this limited our MudPIT analysis to only two technical replicates, which, although below the theoretical saturation of detection, putatively achieve &#x0003e;75&#x00025; coverage of the detectable proteome. This imposes constraints on the analysis of the data. Reassuringly, the majority of the protein profiles were not deemed to be statistically uncorrelated with the corresponding mRNA transcript levels as measured by microarray.</p><p>Another challenge is the accurate assessment of changes in protein abundance over time. The use of spectral counting as a means to measure relative protein levels between samples appears to have worked well in this study. With the development of more sensitive techniques and instrumentation, it should be possible to increase our sampling efficiency and overall confidence in protein quantitation for small sample sizes.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mouse tissues</title><p>Mouse tissues were derived from ICR timed mated mice.

Protein fusions with GFP expressed in 293T cells imaged with spinning disk confocal microscopy. Left column is the GFP channel (green), center column is the merge of Hoechst (blue) and MitoTracker CMXRos dye (red), with the nuclei and mitochondria labeled respectively, and the right panel is the merged image. In all cases, clear colocalization of predicted compartment is observed. Note the variety of localization patterns in the nucleus, indicating that a range of nuclear proteins were identified and tested.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb4100151-f3"/></fig><fig id="f4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Proteins with similar phenotypes when deleted <italic>in vivo</italic> form a highly interconnected protein interaction network.

Only proteins identified in this study are shown in the interaction network. The four nucleating proteins are all ovals, whereas interactions are shown as circles. Lines connect proteins with annotated interactions based on data deposited at OPHID.

Math modeling identified four subsets in the data sets: (<bold>A</bold>) significant inliers, (<bold>B</bold>) insignificant inliers, (<bold>C</bold>) insignificant outliers and (<bold>D</bold>) significant outliers. Whereas inlier denotes a positive correlation score, outliers denote a negative correlation score and significant indicates that the correlation is statistically different from the background (noise) model, whereas insignificant is not. Each subset was then either clustered by K-means (A, B) or simply visualized due to the lower information content. Note that the significant inliers contains many clear patterns of dynamic gene expression and those with static expression throughout development. The significant outliers shows several genes with off set protein and mRNA expression, where the mRNA increases before the protein.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb4100151-f5"/></fig><fig id="f6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>mRNA and protein regulation in Nmyc loss- and gain-of-function mutant E18.5 lungs. Combined protein and microarray that tested as being significantly regulated was separated into direct and indirect classes based on the expected profiles of positive, where both transcript and protein are reduced in the loss of function mutant and the transcript is increased in the gain of function mutant and negative, with the opposite profile to positive. Based on these profiles, 90 protein microarray pairs were extracted and are organized with the potential positive targets followed by the four negative targets at the bottom of the
