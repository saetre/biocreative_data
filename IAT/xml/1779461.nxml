In doing so, TGF-&#x003b2; initiates transmembrane signaling by activating its type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors (TGF-&#x003b2; receptor T&#x003b2;R-I and T&#x003b2;R-II, respectively). Following its transphosphorylation and stimulation by T&#x003b2;R-II, T&#x003b2;R-I then binds, phosphorylates, and activates the intracellular effectors Smad2 and Smad3, which subsequently complex with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus to regulate target gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although the Smad pathway is by far the most characterized TGF-&#x003b2; activated pathway, TGF-&#x003b2; also governs cell physiology through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs; including extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]1/2, p38, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase) and of phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Aberrant activation of MAPKs and PI3K often is associated with cancer development in humans. Precisely how TGF-&#x003b2; activates these alternative pathways and how these signals are integrated into the biology and pathology of TGF-&#x003b2; remain to be elucidated fully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; plays a dual role during mammary tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For instance, TGF-&#x003b2; normally prohibits mammary epithelial cell (MEC) cell cycle progression, and consequently suppresses MEC tumorigenesis. However, during the course of mammary tumorigenesis, TGF-&#x003b2; signaling becomes dysregulated and uncoupled from regulation of cell cycle progression. More importantly, altered TGF-&#x003b2; signaling actively contributes to the acquisition and development of metastatic phenotypes, in part through its ability to stimulate epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) in cancerous MECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that TGF-&#x003b2; suppresses tumorigenesis largely via Smad2/3-mediated growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], whereas its ability to promote tumorigenesis and EMT occurs via the integration of Smad2/3 signals with those arising in response to activation of RhoA, MAPKs (e.g. ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK), and PI3K pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, breast cancer cells have developed effective strategies for circumventing the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-&#x003b2;, while simultaneously selecting for, or even enhancing, its tumor promoting activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Apart from playing a prominent role in preventing cell cycle progression, TGF-&#x003b2; also is a major regulator of cell microenvironments and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. TGF-&#x003b2; alters cell microenvironments in part through its ability to induce the expression of unique subsets of integrins as well as that of their ECM ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In doing so, TGF-&#x003b2; enables malignant cells to undergo EMT and, consequently, to escape their tissue of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that bind ECM ligands and couple cells to their microenvironments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Most integrins initiate transmembrane signaling by activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src family kinases at adhesive sites. FAK and Src further recruit and activate various downstream effectors, such as PI3K and members of the Ras and Rho families of small GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Integrins also interact with and couple to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to promote cell survival, proliferation, and migration in response to soluble growth factors and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. One such integrin, namely &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>, binds to arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) amino acid containing components of the ECM, such as vitronectin, fibronectin, and osteopontin, and mediates RTK activation of MAPKs and cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Similar to the effects of tumorigenesis on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, integrin expression is altered during tumorigenesis, including developing tumors of the breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In particular, altered &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression correlates with mammary tumorigenesis, particularly the processes of breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], raising the possibility that differential integrin expression may contribute to the tumor promoting activities of TGF-&#x003b2;. Indeed, TGF-&#x003b2; stimulated EMT is abrogated by treatments that inhibit MEC integrin adhesion, suggesting a need for integrins in mediating TGF-&#x003b2; signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>To further investigate the role of altered integrin expression in regulating the MEC response to TGF-&#x003b2;, we determined the effects of &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression on the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to regulate NMuMG (normal murine mammary gland) cell proliferation, invasion, and EMT. We found that treatment of NMuMG cells with TGF-&#x003b2; induced their expression of &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin, an event that coincided with TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation of EMT. Accordingly, &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin deficiency abolished the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to induce EMT in MECs. Moreover, we found that &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin interacted physically with T&#x003b2;R-II at the cell surface, leading to conversion of TGF-&#x003b2; from a suppressor of NMuMG cell growth to a promoter of their invasiveness and EMT. Mechanistically, activated &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin recruited Src to &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin:T&#x003b2;R-II complexes, where it tyrosine phosphorylated T&#x003b2;R-II, leading to enhanced activation of MAPKs and induction of EMT stimulated by TGF-&#x003b2;. Importantly, abolishing Src activity or expression in NMuMG cells prevented &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of T&#x003b2;R-II and, consequently, EMT stimulated by TGF-&#x003b2;. Finally, we found that the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype in MCF10A derivatives, which serve as a model of human breast cancer progression regulated by TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], coincided with upregulated &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin and FAK expression. Similar to its effects in NMuMG cells, &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression significantly enhanced TGF-&#x003b2; mediated stimulation of cell invasion in benign MCF10A cells as well as in their highly metastatic counterparts MCF10CA1a cells. Importantly, the expression of D119A &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin in these metastatic cells completely abolished the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to induce MCF10CA1a cell invasion.</p><p>Taken together, our findings identify a novel convergence point in MECs that enables &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrins to override the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-&#x003b2;, suggesting that integrin interdiction strategies may one day represent an innovative approach to re-establishing TGF-&#x003b2; mediated tumor suppression in progressing human breast cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Retroviral plasmids and expression</title><p>The cDNAs encoding wild-type (WT) human &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin, as well as its inactive mutant D119A (D&#x02192;A point mutation at position 119), were generously provided by Dr Mark H Ginsberg (University of California at San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]).

To further explore the consequences of &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin:T&#x003b2;R-II complex formation, GFP expressing NMuMG cells were incubated in the absence or presence of TGF-&#x003b2; for 36 hours, and subsequently were held in suspension before re-plating onto plastic or vitronectin-coated wells in the absence or presence of TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>for 5 min. Afterward, the phosphorylation status of T&#x003b2;R-II and its ability to form complexes with &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin were monitored by co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref> shows that following TGF-&#x003b2; induced EMT, T&#x003b2;R-II was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin. Because chronic TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation of NMuMG cells induces &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and complex formation with T&#x003b2;R-II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), it was difficult to assess the role of TGF-&#x003b2; receptor and integrin stimulation in the formation of &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin:T&#x003b2;R-II complexes in NMuMG cells. To circumvent this difficulty, resting WT &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expressing NMuMG cells were dissociated and subsequently replated and stimulated for 5 min, as above. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref> shows that T&#x003b2;R-II only interacted with &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrins upon TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>stimulation and, more importantly, that this response was enhanced significantly upon &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin adhesion. In addition, only upon dual receptor activation (i.e. &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin and T&#x003b2;Rs) was T&#x003b2;R-II phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). Thus, &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin regulates TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by targeting T&#x003b2;R-II for tyrosine phosphorylation in a manner reminiscent of integrin actions on RTK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Although integrins lack intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity, they facilitate tyrosine phosphorylation of target proteins via their recruitment of FAK and Src PTKs to focal adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that FAK or Src are potential PTKs responsible for phosphorylating T&#x003b2;R-II on tyrosine residues in NMuMG cells. We tested this hypothesis by utilizing an <italic>in vitro </italic>PTK assay that measured the ability of purified, active FAK or Src to phosphorylate GST fusion proteins containing catalytically active or inactive (i.e. K277R) versions of the cytoplasmic domain of T&#x003b2;R-II. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>, Src phosphorylated the cytoplasmic domain of T&#x003b2;R-II on tyrosine residues. Although active and capable of undergoing autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>), FAK was unable to phosphorylate T&#x003b2;R-II <italic>in vitro </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>), suggesting that Src phosphorylates T&#x003b2;R-II in response to &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression.</p><p>To further examine the functional link between Src and T&#x003b2;R-II, we attempted to inhibit Src activity or function in NMuMG cells and subsequently monitor the consequences of these manipulations on T&#x003b2;R-II tyrosine phosphorylation. Recent work conducted by Maeda and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] showed that the broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor PP1 antagonizes TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by inhibiting T&#x003b2;R-I and T&#x003b2;R-II protein kinase activity. As such, we monitored the effects of two Src inhibitors, PP2 and SU6656, on the ability of immunoprecipitated TGF-&#x003b2; receptor complexes to phosphorylate recombinant GST-Smad3 <italic>in vitro</italic>. As expected, TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation greatly enhanced the phosphorylation of recombinant Smad3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>), a reaction that was reduced markedly by SU6656 administration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). In contrast, PP2 treatment failed to inhibit T&#x003b2;R activity and instead appeared to elicit agonist independent receptor activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). Based on its inactivity against T&#x003b2;Rs, PP2 appeared to be a suitable pharmacological agent to inhibit Src activity in MECs. Accordingly, &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin-expressing NMuMG cells treated with PP2 abrogated the tyrosine phosphorylation of T&#x003b2;R-II in TGF-&#x003b2; stimulated NMuMG cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>), indicating that Src activity does indeed mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of T&#x003b2;R-II in &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expressing NMuMG cells. Along these lines, transient expression of constitutively active Src in &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expressing NMuMG cells resulted in significantly elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of T&#x003b2;R-II, an event that was not recapitulated by expression of dominant negative Src (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7c</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin-mediated recruitment of Src facilitates the tyrosine phosphorylation of T&#x003b2;R-II in MECs, and that this phosphorylation event may act to enhance their proliferation, invasion, and EMT by augmenting the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to activate MAPKs.</p></sec><sec><title>Src inhibition blocks &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin and TGF-&#x003b2; mediated MAPK activation, EMT, and invasion in NMuMG cells</title><p>We next explored the functional importance of Src in regulating various MEC responses to TGF-&#x003b2;. To do so, NMuMG cells were pretreated with either PP2 or its inactive counterpart PP3 and subsequently stimulated with TGF-&#x003b2; to activate ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. As expected, &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression significantly increased ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation following TGF-&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>). This response to TGF-&#x003b2; was unaffected by PP3 administration, but it was reduced significantly by PP2 treatment of NMuMG cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>). More importantly, PP2 administration completely reverted the EMT phenotype induced by expression of &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin in NMuMG cells, and nearly abolished the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to stimulate EMT in NMuMG cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>). We also engineered NMuMG cells to stably express dominant negative Src and subsequently measured its effect on the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to induce EMT and invasion in MECs. As expected, GFP expressing NMuMG cells readily underwent EMT when stimulated by TGF-&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8c</xref>). In stark contrast, NMuMG cells expressing dominant negative Src were stunted in their ability to undergo EMT in response to TGF-&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8c</xref>), and instead formed small, disorganized stress fibers that contrasted sharply with those produced in their GFP expressing counterparts.</p><p>Proper organization of cell polarity is essential for cancer cell invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Based on the aberrant EMT response observed in dominant negative Src expressing NMuMG cells, we suspected that their invasion through synthetic basement membranes would also be impaired. Accordingly, dominant negative Src expression significantly inhibited the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to induce NMuMG cell invasion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8d</xref>). Interestingly, singular expression of either constitutively active Src or &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin in NMuMG cells significantly enhanced tonic and TGF-&#x003b2; stimulated cell invasion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8d</xref>). More importantly, introducing dominant negative Src into &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expressing NMuMG cells completely abolished the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to stimulate cell invasion in MECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8d</xref>).

We tested this hypothesis by transiently transfecting NMuMG cells with siRNAs directed against Src and subsequently monitored their ability to undergo EMT in response to TGF-&#x003b2;. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8e</xref> shows that Src deficiency did indeed abolish the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to stimulate EMT in NMuMG cells, a response reminiscent of that observed in NMuMG cells deficient in &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that Src expression and activity are essential for the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to stimulate MAPKs, and to induce EMT and cell invasion in MECs.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>Integrin expression increases in malignant human MECs and regulates invasion stimulated by TGF-&#x003b2;</title><p>Our findings have thus far solely investigated the relationship between &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrins and TGF-&#x003b2; in normal MECs. It should be noted that cells undergoing neoplastic transformation, including those of the breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], exhibit altered integrin expression profiles during tumorigenesis, suggesting that integrins could play a key role in the acquisition of neoplastic phenotypes. The human MCF10A system consists of a series MEC cell lines that share a common ancestry and represent distinct stages of breast cancer development, ranging from normal to highly invasive and metastatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]; they also represent a model system for studying the conversion of TGF-&#x003b2; from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, breast cancer progression was associated with elevated expression of &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin and its effector, FAK, which correlated with the conversion of TGF-&#x003b2; from a suppressor to a promoter of breast cancer progression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a</xref>). Moreover, exogenous &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression in normal, poorly invasive MCF10A cells significantly enhanced their invasion through synthetic basement membranes in response to TGF-&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9b</xref>). In contrast, the malignant, metastatic MCF10CA1a cells readily invaded Matrigel matrices when stimulated with TGF-&#x003b2;, a response that was augmented significantly by WT &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9c</xref>).

Collectively, our findings suggest that mammary tumorigenesis alters &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression in neoplastic MECs, and that &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrins may play a crucial role in translating TGF-&#x003b2; from a suppressor to a promoter of breast cancer growth and invasion.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The process of EMT recently has been subject to intense research investigation because of its importance in mediating cancer cell motility, invasion, and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; is a major regulator of both developmental and pathological EMT, particularly that in diseased MECs, which frequently exhibit decreased cytostasis and increased invasiveness in response to TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying the conversion of TGF-&#x003b2; from an inhibitor of MEC proliferation to an inducer of their EMT are poorly understood. Because cell microenvironmental changes regulate cancer development and progression, including the acquisition of EMT, and because integrins and TGF-&#x003b2; are major regulators of cell microenvironments, we hypothesized that differential integrin expression induced by TGF-&#x003b2; would contribute to its regulation of MEC proliferation and EMT.</p><p>To this end, we now show that &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression alters the response of MECs to TGF-&#x003b2;, particularly its ability to regulate cell proliferation, invasion, and EMT. Indeed, &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression appears essential for TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation of EMT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrate that &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin directly couples to the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling system by interacting physically with T&#x003b2;R-II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), resulting in enhanced MEC proliferation, invasion, and EMT when stimulated with TGF-&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). More importantly, &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin promotes Src mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of T&#x003b2;R-II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), which we show to be essential for the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to activate MAPKs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) and, consequently, to induce EMT in MECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). More importantly, we show for the first time that induction of &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression during mammary tumorigenesis correlates with metastasis development, and that antagonizing &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin signaling abolishes TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation of breast cancer cell invasion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Collectively, we identified a potentially important mechanism whereby &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression selectively facilitates TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation of MEC invasion and EMT.</p><p>The joint activation of integrin and RTK signaling systems is essential for the positional control of cells. More importantly, cell attachment to the ECM also determines the nature and context of how cells interpret and respond to cytokine and growth factor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. For instance, the ability of EGF and platelet-derived growth factor receptors to stimulate fibroblast migration requires RTK receptor association with integrins and FAK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Similarly, Scaffidi and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] showed that &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin bound T&#x003b2;R-II in lung fibroblasts, thereby enhancing fibroblast proliferation stimulated by TGF-&#x003b2;. Those authors further speculated that the formation of &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin:T&#x003b2;R-II complexes may exacerbate TGF-&#x003b2; mediated wound healing and fibrotic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], processes reminiscent of the ability of &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin:T&#x003b2;R-II complexes to drive TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation of EMT in MECs. Most recently, the adapter protein Dab2, which mediates Smad2/3 activation by T&#x003b2;Rs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], was shown to participate in TGF-&#x003b2; stimulated EMT by interacting with integrins and preventing MEC apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. These findings, together with those presented herein, indicate an important and underappreciated role for integrins in regulating cellular response to TGF-&#x003b2;. Future studies in MECs must determine the relationship between TGF-&#x003b2; stimulated expression of &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin and Dab2, as well as &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin stimulated T&#x003b2;R-II expression in MECs; whether Dab2 links &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin to T&#x003b2;R-II during EMT; and the ability of additional integrins to influence, either positively or negatively, MEC response to TGF-&#x003b2;.</p><p>A particularly novel finding of our study was the demonstration that &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin induced T&#x003b2;R-II tyrosine phosphorylation via Src kinase. Indeed, we show for the first time that Src activity mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of T&#x003b2;R-II in MECs, leading to TGF-&#x003b2; mediated MAPK activation, and to MEC invasion and EMT. Previous studies established that T&#x003b2;R-II is phosphorylated predominantly on Ser and Thr residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], which, depending on the site of phosphorylation, either augments or attenuates T&#x003b2;R-II protein kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of T&#x003b2;R-II is not without precedent. Indeed, Lawler and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] showed that T&#x003b2;R-II is a dual-specificity protein kinase that autophosphorylates not only on Ser/Thr residues but also on tyrosine 259, 336, and 424. Moreover, although Phe substitution at these positions significantly reduced T&#x003b2;R-II protein kinase activity, these mutations had little affect on the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to induce gene expression in lung epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], and as such the role of tyrosines 259, 336, and 424 in mediating TGF-&#x003b2; action remain to be clarified. We too have converted tyrosines 259, 336, and 424 to phenylalanine in all possible combinations (i.e. single, double, and triple mutations), all of which failed to alter Src mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-T&#x003b2;R-II (K277R) <italic>in vitro </italic>(Galliher AJ, Schiemann WP, unpublished data). Sequence analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of T&#x003b2;R-II revealed two possible Src phosphorylation consensus motifs at tyrosines 284 and 470. These two sites were individually mutated to phenylalanines, and preliminary data suggest that Src phosphorylates T&#x003b2;R-II at tyrosine 284 (Galliher AJ, Schiemann WP, unpublished data). Further analysis of this site in mediating TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation of EMT in MECs is currently under investigation.</p><p>Activation of MAPKs, particularly that of ERK1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and p38 MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], are necessary for TGF-&#x003b2; to stimulate EMT. We also found that TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK are necessary for induction of EMT in MECs. More importantly, we show for the first time that Src activity is essential for activation of MAPKs by TGF-&#x003b2; and for its stimulation of EMT. Indeed, our results indicate that &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expression and Src activity are sufficient in overcoming TGF-&#x003b2; mediated cytostasis in MECs. Src activity also has been associated with protecting hepatocytes from apoptosis induced by TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and with the ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to stimulate ovarian cancer cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. More recently, TGF-&#x003b2; treatment of MECs was shown to induce their expression of RPTP&#x003ba;, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that activates Src and mediates the antiproliferative and the promigratory effects of TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. These findings, together with those presented herein, implicate Src as an important player operant in dictating the MEC response to TGF-&#x003b2;; they also suggest that Src inhibition, similar to integrin interdiction, may one day be used to enhance the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-&#x003b2; in breast cancer cells.</p><p>Finally, based on the fact that phosphotyrosine residues often create binding motifs that couple receptors to various signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], including the MAPK cascade, it is tempting to speculate that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of T&#x003b2;R-II functions similarly as a receptor docking site to recruit SH2 and/or PTB containing signaling molecules to &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin:T&#x003b2;R-II complexes. If correct, then such a mechanism could account for the augmented ability of TGF-&#x003b2; to activate MAPKs in &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin expressing MECs, and for the shift in MAPK and Smad2/3 signaling that favored EMT over cytostasis in response to TGF-&#x003b2;. Indeed, the ability of &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin to increase Smad2/3 transcriptional activity without altering Smad2/3 phosphorylation suggests that other integrin or MAPK stimulated nuclear factors converge on TGF-&#x003b2; targeted promoters and synergize with Smad2/3 in coordinating gene expression regulated by TGF-&#x003b2;. This notion is wholly consistent with previous work demonstrating the ability of Smad2/3 to synergize with activated T&#x003b2;R complexes in mediating EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we present evidence that the differential expression of &#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>integrin induced by TGF-&#x003b2; functions to convert this cytokine from an inhibitor of MEC proliferation to a stimulator of their EMT and invasion.

The net effect of these events results in enhanced TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation of MAPKs and, consequently, induction of EMT and invasion in MECs. Indeed, our findings suggest that integrin interdiction may prevent tumor development and progression by maintaining, reinforcing, or re-establishing the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ECM = extracellular matrix; EGF = epidermal growth factor; EMT = epithelial-mesenchymal transitions; ERK = extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FACS = fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FAK = focal adhesion kinase; FBS = fetal bovine serum; GFP = green fluorescent protein; GST = glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase; IRES = internal ribosomal entry site; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEC = mammary epithelial cell; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PI3K = phosphoinositol-3 kinase; PMA = 4&#x003b1;-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; pMSCV = plasmid murine stem cell virus; PTK = protein tyrosine kinase; RGD = arginine-glycine-aspartic acid; RTK = receptor tyrosine kinase; siRNA = small interfering RNA; T&#x003b2;R = TGF-&#x003b2; receptor; TGF = transforming growth factor; WT = wild type; YFP = yellow fluorescent protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AJG participated in designing the study, acquiring data, interpreting data, analyzing data, and preparing the manuscript.

Afterward, alterations in actin cytoskeletal architecture were visualized by direct rhodamine-phalloidin immunofluorescence. Total Src expression was monitored by probing detergent-solubilized whole cell extracts (50 &#x003bc;g/lane) with anti-Src antibodies, whereas exogenous Src expression was visualized using anti-Myc antibodies. Immunoblotting stripped membranes with anti-&#x003b2;-actin antibodies served to monitor differences in protein loading.
