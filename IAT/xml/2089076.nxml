Its effects are mediated via interaction with cell surface receptors. Several studies have demonstrated the expression of IL-3 in neurons and astrocytes of the hippocampus and cortices in normal mouse brain, suggesting a physiological role of IL-3 in the central nervous system. Although there is evidence indicating that IL-3 is expressed in some neuronal populations, its physiological role in these cells is poorly known.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated the expression of IL-3 receptor in cortical neurons, and analyzed its influence on amyloid &#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;)-treated cells. In these cells, IL-3 can activate at least three classical signalling pathways, Jak/STAT, Ras/MAP kinase and the PI 3-kinase. Viability assays indicated that IL-3 might play a neuroprotective role in cells treated with A&#x003b2; fibrils. It is of interest to note that our results suggest that cell survival induced by IL-3 required PI 3-kinase and Jak/STAT pathway activation, but not MAP kinase. In addition, IL-3 induced an increase of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Altogether these data strongly suggest that IL-3 neuroprotects neuronal cells against neurodegenerative agents like A&#x003b2;.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The cytokine, Interleukin (IL)-3 is an important regulator which exhibits pleiotropic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is expressed in hematopoietic cells as well in several non-hematopoietic cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The biological activity of IL-3 is mediated through specific cell surface receptors which are composed of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits. The &#x003b1; subunit is responsible for the binding of IL-3. The ligand-activated &#x003b1; subunit is associated with the &#x003b2; subunit, which transmits signals across the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. IL-3 is known to activate at least three signaling pathways: The Jak/STAT, the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway. An important PI 3-kinase target is the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB, which, mediated by many growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (Dudek et al., 1997), is involved in cell survival.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated the presence of IL-3 in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although there is evidence indicating that IL-3 is expressed in some neuronal populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], its physiological role in these cells is unknown. Some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] demonstrated that IL-3 significantly facilitates sensory neuron survival and stimulates the formation of the neural network <italic>in vitro</italic>, promotes the process extension of cultured cholinergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and that IL-3 exerts a trophic action on hippocampal neurons, rescuing hippocampal CA1 neurons from lethal ischemic damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which IL-3 supports neurons has not yet been determined.</p><p>In the nervous system and particularly during development, apoptosis appears to be triggered by trophic factor deprivation. Neuronal apoptosis is likely to occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a widespread neurodegenerative disorder that results in progressive dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Histopathologically, AD is characterized by the presence of extracellular senile plaques that consist of &#x003b2;-amyloid protein (A&#x003b2;) in its fibrillary form, and neurofibrillary tangles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A&#x003b2; causes hippocampal and cortical neuronal death <italic>in vitro and in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It has been suggested that A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40 </sub>and A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>downregulate Bcl-2, and that this effect may lead to increased neuronal degeneration during age-dependent stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we provide direct evidence for the functional expression of IL-3 receptors on neurons. We also demonstrated their involvement in the neuroprotective action of IL-3 upon A&#x003b2;-neurotoxicity. We demonstrated that receptor activation signals cell survival in the presence of A&#x003b2;. Our results suggest that the effect of IL-3 on cortical neurons is mediated by activation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt and kinase Jak, both important components of anti-apoptotic mechanisms in neurons and other cell types. And worthy of note, IL-3 was able to induce an increase in Bcl-2 protein in these cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of functional IL-3 receptors in cortical neurons</title><p>The expression of both &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits of IL-3 receptor in primary cortical neurons was confirmed using specific antibodies. Immunofluorescence analysis using anti-IL-3r&#x003b1; and anti-IL-3r&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) antibodies showed clear positive immunostaining in primary cortical neurons. These results suggest that this receptor is expressed in these cells. It is therefore reasonable to assume that these receptors are functional and able to transduce downstream signals. To investigate the possibility that IL-3 treatment produced activation of Jak2, ERK and Akt, lysates from cells treated with IL-3 for various times were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Jak2, -ERK, and -Akt antibodies to detect activated Jak2, ERK and Akt, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Duplicate blots were probed with antibodies recognizing total Jak2, ERK or Akt to verify equal protein loading in the samples. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, treatment with 5 nM IL-3 led to increased phosphorylation of Jak2 within 10 minutes and this phosphorylation remained elevated for 60 minutes. Treatment with 5 nM IL-3 also weakly activated Akt, an activation which was sustained for 20 minutes. Akt phosphorylation was fast for the first 30 minutes and after 2 h there is an increase that was sustained over 24 h in primary cortical neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression and activation of IL-3 receptors in cortical neurons</bold>.

In this study, phosphorylation of Ser-473 was used to evaluate the activation of Akt. In order to determine whether Akt activation participates in IL-3-induced neuroprotection we used a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, LY2940002, which is highly selective for PI 3-kinase inhibition. Cortical neurons were pre-treated with 50 &#x003bc;M LY2940002 for 30 min prior to addition of 5 nM IL-3. Cells were then exposed to 10 &#x003bc;M A&#x003b2; and incubated for an additional 24 h. These cells were used for Western blot, Tripan blue exclusion and MTT analysis. As shown by Western blot analysis (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), pre-treatment with LY2940002 blocked the IL-3-evoked Akt activation. Also, LY2940002 blocked the BAD phosphorylation, a downstream effector of Akt, but had no effect on Jak 2 phosphorylation, which is a receptor-associated kinase upstream to Akt. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, pre-treatment of cells with LY2940002, totally abolished the protective effect of IL-3. The same results were obtained using 100 nM Wortmannin (data not shown).

Upon binding of the specific ligand to its receptor, Jak kinases are rapidly activated, and their kinase activities are induced to regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of various effectors and to initiate activation of downstream signaling pathways. These pathways include PI3K, MAPK, and NF-&#x003ba;B (nuclear factor-kappa B), leading to cell differentiation, survival and proliferation. To determine whether Jak2 kinase is implicated in IL-3-induced neuroprotection, we used AG490, a highly selective specific inhibitor of Jak2. Cortical neurons were pre-treated for 30 min with 20 &#x003bc;M AG490 before addition of IL-3 and A&#x003b2; peptide. AG490 induced a decrease in Jak2 and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Pre-treatment with AG490 totally abolished the protective effect of IL-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

To investigate ERK involvement, we tested the effect of PD98059 on IL-3-induced neuroprotection. PD98059 is a selective inhibitor of the MEK kinase pathway, kinase upstream of ERK. Cells were pre-treated with 20 &#x003bc;M PD98059 for 30 min prior to addition of IL-3. After addition of IL-3, cells were exposed to 10 &#x003bc;M A&#x003b2; and incubated for an additional 24 h.

Results are consistent with the notion that Jak2 is a kinase upstream of ERK, and these results therefore suggest that IL-3-evoked Akt activation is not dependent on ERK phosphorylation.

The initial signaling involved in this protection has been shown to involve both ERK and PI 3-kinase-dependent pathways. All these results strongly suggest that A&#x003b2; downregulates the natural protective mechanism in neurons, and the activation of some growth factor receptor can protect neurons from A&#x003b2;-induced cell death by anti-apoptotic pathways activation.</p><p>Previous studies of IL-3 in the central nervous system demonstrated the expression of IL-3 mRNA in neurons of the habenula, hippocampus, cerebral and enthorhinal cortices, and subiculum in normal mouse brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and suggested endogenous IL-3 might be produced by certain neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Functional IL-3 receptors are expressed in the central cholinergic neurons and contribute to some physiological roles such as the differentiation and maintenance of these neurons. Also, both hippocampus and cerebral cortex express IL-3r&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>We demonstrated that primary cortical neurons express IL-3r&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits. Biological response analyses confirmed the presence of functionally active IL-3 receptors, responsive to mouse IL-3 in cortical neurons. Binding of this cytokine to its receptor leads to the stimulation of classical signal transduction pathways, specifically the Jak/STAT pathway, the Ras/MAPK pathway, and the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The data showed that IL-3 induced activation of these pathways in this cell type. In general there was a fast and transient increase of the phosphorylation of p-Jak2 and p-ERK. However, Akt phosphorylation was fast for the first 30 minutes and after 2 h there is an increase that was sustained over 24 h in primary cortical neurons.</p><p>The neuroprotective effect of IL-3 against the amyloid was studied by fragmented DNA using TUNEL staining, MTT and Tripan blue exclusion analysis. We demonstrated that IL-3 prevents A&#x003b2;-neurotoxicity. IL-3 induces an increase in cell viability of more than 75% in cells treated with A&#x003b2;. Our results are consistent with other groups, which have reported that IL-3 has a functional role in some neurons. Some authors have demonstrated that the survival of sensory neurons was significantly supported by IL-3, which also stimulates their morphological differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. IL-3 also attenuated neuronal damage caused by free radicals, which are known to be overproduced during and after brain ischemia. Furthermore, IL-3 was able to protect NGF-differentiated neurons from apoptotic cell death caused by NGF withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We showed that this neuroprotective effect on A&#x003b2;-neurotoxicity is similar to that found with insulin treatment. Direct actions of insulin on neurons and neuron-like cells have suggested it may offer trophic or growth factor support to these structures. In some <italic>in vitro </italic>systems, and in some <italic>in vivo </italic>models, a role for direct insulin support for regeneration has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>It has been proposed that IL-3 has a neuroprotective role, but no underlying biological mechanism has been identified. We showed that IL-3 protected against A&#x003b2;-induced cell death and activated Akt. A specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase blocked this activation and abolished protection of A&#x003b2;-induced cell death, indicating that activation of Akt was important for IL-3 protection. Activation of Akt protects cells from apoptotic signals such as growth factor withdrawal, cell cycle disruption, and cell detachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. PI 3-kinase has been implicated in the regulation of cell survival in several cell types. In particular, PI 3-kinase is thought to be involved in IL-3-dependent survival, and that a region on the &#x003b2;c receptor important for IL-3-dependent survival is necessary for PI 3-kinase activation. Akt is activated by factors that stimulate PI 3-kinase activity in cells, such as thrombin, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Active Akt can promote cell survival in response to various death stimuli, including withdrawal from growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Here we demonstrated that Akt activity is induced rapidly by the cytokine IL-3 in cortical neurons and that activation of Akt by IL-3 is dependent on the PI 3-kinase activity.</p><p>Akt was activated downstream from PI 3-kinase, resulting in the phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD, a principal inducer of cell apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that activated Akt phosphorylates BAD, resulting in its sequestration by cytosolic 14-3-3 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] Because BAD binds to and inhibits the anti-apoptotic actions of Bcl-<sub>XL</sub>, the sequestration of BAD in the cytosol by 14-3-3 proteins results in enhanced survival. This signalling pathway has been shown to play an important role in neuronal development and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>We also provide evidence that A&#x003b2;-induced apoptosis is prevented through the IL-3 induced activation of Jak2. Our findings indicate that IL-3r activation induces Jak2 activation via tyrosine phosphorylation and that this initial event is followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase and Akt serine phosphorylation as suggested by the inhibitory effect of AG-490 on the phosphorylation of both proteins. These results are consistent with those reported for hematopoietic cells, in which the kinase domain of Jak2 inhibits cell death and treatment with the Jak2 inhibitor AG-490 reduces phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase, resulting in increased caspase 3 activity and Bax protein in acute myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, activation of neuronal erythropoietin receptors prevents apoptosis by triggering cross-talk between the signaling pathways of Jak2 and the nuclear factor- &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Activation of ERK and Akt pathways have been shown to promote cell proliferation/survival after growth factor stimulation and to play a protective role. Activation of both ERK and Akt are important steps in cellular responses to a variety of extracellular stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, we demonstrated that inactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by PD98059, a selective inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase, did not affect IL-3-mediated survival, meaning that the Akt pathway is primarily involved and rendering ERK activation unnecessary for the IL-3-induced survival function. In contrast to our findings, in other cell systems, the inhibition of ERK activation with a dominant-negative MAPKK, suppresses IL-3-dependent survival, in, for example, BaF3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The IL-3-induced targets important for cell survival, seem to be proteins of the anti-apoptotic <italic>bcl-2 </italic>gene family. Expression of <italic>bcl-2 </italic>and <italic>bcl</italic><sub><italic>XL </italic></sub>is rapidly induced by IL-3 or activated Ras in multiple cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We showed that cells treated with A&#x003b2; had decreased Bcl-2 protein levels, consistent with some reports which suggested that A&#x003b2; is able to downregulate Bcl-2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, IL-3 is able to support Bcl-2 protein levels in the presence of A&#x003b2; peptide.

Bcl-2 can avert survival factor deprivation-induced neuronal apoptosis in sympathetic cervical ganglia, in sensory primary neurons, and in continuous cell lines such as PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our data constitute the first experimental evidence of the role of IL-3 in neurodegeneration Alzheimer's type. We show that IL-3 prevents neuronal death induced by A&#x003b2; peptide and suggest that the specific pathways responsible include activation of PI 3-kinase and Jak2. IL-3 was also able to induce an increase of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Cultures</title><p>Cortical neurons obtained from 16-day-old mice embryos were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].
