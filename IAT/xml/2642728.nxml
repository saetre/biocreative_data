TLR3 levels are increased in pathological conditions such as brain virus infection. Here, we further investigated the production, cellular localisation, and function of neuronal TLR3 during neuronotropic rabies virus (RABV) infection in human neuronal cells. Following RABV infection, TLR3 is not only present in endosomes, as observed in the absence of infection, but also in detergent-resistant perinuclear inclusion bodies. As well as TLR3, these inclusion bodies contain the viral genome and viral proteins (N and P, but not G). The size and composition of inclusion bodies and the absence of a surrounding membrane, as shown by electron microscopy, suggest they correspond to the previously described Negri Bodies (NBs). NBs are not formed in the absence of TLR3, and TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice&#x02014;in which brain tissue was less severely infected&#x02014;had a better survival rate than WT mice. These observations demonstrate that TLR3 is a major molecule involved in the spatial arrangement of RABV&#x02013;induced NBs and viral replication. This study shows how viruses can exploit cellular proteins and compartmentalisation for their own benefit.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Viruses are obligate parasites. The progression of their life cycle depends on their hijacking the cellular metabolism and machinery. Human neurons produce TLR3, a protein involved in early host defence mechanisms and the modulation of neuronal survival. Rabies virus is a neurotropic virus, infecting mainly neurons. In this study, we showed that rabies virus exploits TLR3 function to store viral proteins and viral genomic material in particular areas of the cell where virus multiplication occurs. We found that, during the course of infection, large (1&#x02013;3 &#x000b5;m) spherical inclusions were formed within the region around the nucleus. These inclusions were composed of an inner core of aggregated TLR3 surrounded by a coat of viral proteins and genomic material. These inclusions were revealed to be the previously described Negri Bodies (NBs). In absence of TLR3, NBs were no longer formed and virus multiplication rate decreased. Mice deficient in TLR3 were more resistant to rabies and had lower levels of infection in their brains. This study shows how neurotropic viruses, such as rabies virus, hijack normal functions of neuronal proteins and use cell compartmentalisation to promote viral multiplication.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Toll-like receptors (TLR) are innate immune receptors that recognise and respond to the presence of PAMPS (pathogen associated molecular patterns) encoded by pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Rock1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cells were immunostained with anti-TLR3 (red) and anti-N-RABV mAb (blue) showing that the miTLR3 population of cells exhibits some TLR3-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000315-g008">Figure 8C, lower panel</xref>) in contrast to the miNEG population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000315-g008">Figure 8C, upper panel</xref>). In the TLR3-negative cells, NB formation is abolished. Immunocytochemistry analysis of individual cells (such as the green GFP cell on the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000315-g008">Figure 8D</xref>) revealed that NBs &#x02014; stained red for TLR3 and blue for RABV N protein &#x02014; were not present in miTLR3 cells. These observations strongly suggest that TLR3 is required for NB formation and RABV N expression. To determine whether the cytoplasmic domain of the TLR3 protein encompassing the signalling TIR domain was involved in NB formation, we stable transfected HEK cells with a plasmid encoding a TLR3 gene with a deleted cytoplasmic domain (pZero-hTLR3-HA). Cells transfected with the pZERO-hTLR3 plasmid are therefore unable to signal via TLR3 because the absence of the TIR domain does not allow binding of TRIF to TLR3. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000315.s004">Figure S4B</xref>, NBs were still formed and viral transcription was not modified in pZERO-hTLR3-expressing cells (transitory experiments).

Furthermore, the adaptor TRIF could not be detected in NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000315-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that activated TLR3 molecules were not present in NBs.</p><p>Thus, the ectodomain of TLR3 appears to be crucial for the formation of NBs.

TLR3 subcellular localisation is notably altered by RABV infection, with TLR3 found within viral-induced inclusions identified as RABV-induced Negri Bodies (NBs). The presence of TLR3 in the core of viral NBs, surrounded by a ring of viral N and P proteins, appears to be crucial for NB formation. This finding demonstrates a novel function of TLR3, a molecule mostly known for its immune functions.</p><p>In the absence of infection, reactivity with anti-CD63 antibody and weak signal from EEIA-expressing early endosomal structures showed neuronal TLR3 to be confined to the endosomal compartment, associated mainly to the late endosomes and multivesicular bodies. TLR3 is rarely detectable within the Golgi apparatus or at the endoplasmic reticulum. Indeed, we observed the canonical distribution pattern of TLR3 in human non-infected neuronal cells, as previously described for human DCs or fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Funami1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The subcellular distribution of TLR3 is markedly altered in RABV-infected cells, being localised in perinuclear inclusion bodies, the NBs. These NBs contain viral NC but do not include the envelope viral proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Ni1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Relocation of TLR3 during viral infection has only previously been described for respiratory syncitial virus (RSV). In epithelial cells, RSV infection increases the TLR3 levels and targets TLR3 to the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Groskreutz1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. In neuronal cells, RABV infection did not increase TLR3 protein levels, or target TLR3 to the membrane. Given that RABV infection did not increase the total pool of TLR3 protein, it is possible that the TLR3 is recruited from pre-existing cytoplasmic-, ER- or endosome-associated TLR3 by NBs. However, NBs were not stained by endosomal or ER markers, suggesting that endosome- or ER-associated TLR3 is not involved in NB formation.</p><p>NBs observed by electron microscopy did not reveal the presence of any membrane surrounding the NBs. Thus, it is unlikely NBs are autophagolysomes or lysosomes. Confocal microscopy and 3-D imaging revealed that NBs have a highly organised structure, with a TLR3-containing core surrounded by a halo of viral N and P proteins. The central position of TLR3 suggests that NB formation may be initiated by the aggregation of TLR3 molecules. A primordial role of TLR3 in NB formation is consistent with the absence of NBs from cells in which <italic>TLR3</italic> had been silenced. TLR3 is a horseshoe-shaped solenoid with 23 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) located in the ectodomain of the molecule. Similarly to other solenoid proteins including polyQ, TLR3 may have an intrinsic capacity to form aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Hennetin1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. NBs formed even in the absence of the cytoplasmic domain of TLR3, suggesting a major role for the TLR3 ectodomain in NB formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000315.s004">Figure S4</xref>). PolyQ proteins such as mutant huntingtin protein form inclusions consisting of an inner dense core of aggregated huntingtin surrounded by a ring structure composed of sequestered cellular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Matsumoto2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Suhr1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Experiments involving the sequential expression of polyQ followed by expression of these cellular proteins led to the conclusion that the ring structure results from the subsequent recruitment of cellular proteins at the exterior surface of an initial polyQ core aggregate. The organisation of NBs may follow a similar pattern. In this case, NBs would result from the initial association of TLR3 molecules followed, in a second step, by the accumulation of viral proteins, forming a ring into which cellular proteins could also be inserted. This would be consistent with the concentric organisation of NB structure and observation of the cellular protein eNos is recruited in NBs in RABV-infected brain. However, the NB structure is distinct from polyQ-initiated aggregates. In particular, TLR3 in NBs is still accessible to Ab. This has not been observed for huntingtin. These observations suggest that the viral ring of protein in NBs is more porous than the ring surrounding the ordered huntingtin aggregate structure. Consequently, NB and polyQ aggregates may have distinct properties. The recruitment and sequestration of cellular proteins in polyQ aggregates may lead to the functional depletion of cellular functional proteins, possibly underlying toxic properties of these aggregates in the cell. This is not necessarily the case for NBs.</p><p>The nature of the interaction between TLR3 and viral proteins in NBs remains unclear, since attempts to coimmunoprecipitate TLR3 and NC have failed.</p><p>NBs mimic aggresomes but do not exhibit the full set of characteristics of these stress-induced cellular processes. NBs are associated to the chaperone Hsp70 and to the microtubule network, reminiscent of the two principle features of aggresomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Opazo1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the marked redistribution of vimentin fibres observed for example in GFP-250-induced aggresomes, and in Theiler's or reovirus-induced aggresome-like inclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Nedellec1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Sharpe1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> was not observed in RABV-infected neuronal cells. In contrast to most aggresomes, such as those formed in HSV2 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Nozawa1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, NBs were not associated with the microtubule organising centre (MTOC).</p><p>The effect of inhibition of microtubule depolymerisation, by addition of colcemid, on the distribution and size range of NB may indicate that microtubules are required for NB outcome. The finding that NBs do not display all the characteristics of aggresomes has also been observed for inclusions formed in African swine fever virus (ASFV), which have been described to function as &#x0201c;viral factories&#x0201d;. Viral factories are areas of cytoplasm where viral components and cellular components supporting viral replication are concentrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Nozawa1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Novoa1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The possibility that NBs function as dynamic structures involved in viral multiplication, as proposed by Lahaye <italic>et al</italic>. (submitted), is supported by electron microscopy pictures showing that NBs are found closely associated with newly synthesised viral particles. TLR3 would thus be an essential component for virus multiplication. Consistent with this notion, we showed that NBs were absent from cells with <italic>TLR3</italic> silencing and that TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were less severely infected by RABV than WT mice. Further studies are now required to show whether RABV production is promoted by TLR3.</p><p>A major function of TLR3 is to sense and respond to viral infection. The presence of TLR3 in the core of NBs can be seen as an attempt to inactivate TLR3 function. Sequestration of TLR3 into NBs could reduce the cellular innate immune response. The absence of TRIF &#x02013;adaptor of TLR3- in NB could support the hypothesis that TLR3 molecules in NB are inactive-. The presence of viral RNA in NBs may reflect an interaction of TLR3 with viral components at an early stage of infection, when the virus enters the cell through the TLR3 decorated endosomal compartment. TLR3 could thus be involved in recruitment of viral NC from the endosomal compartment, before aggregation in NBs. However, the absence of endosomal markers within the NBs remains unexplained. In addition, the presence of dsRNAs in NBs may suggest that NBs can also sequester dsRNAs and thus may play a role in the innate immune response to RABV infection.</p><p>Alternatively, given that TLR3 can trigger neuronal apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Salaun1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, the sequestration of TLR3 could be seen as an attempt of RABV-infected neuronal cells to escape TLR3-induced apoptosis. Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2004 showed an uncoupling of &#x003b1;-synuclein-/synphilin-1-positive aggregate formation and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000315-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. They showed that aggregation of &#x003b1;-synuclein-/synphilin-1 seemed to promote cell survival rather than cell death. In our model, sequestration of TLR3 could be a way for the virus to prevent a TLR3-mediated pro-apoptotic response to infection, as neuronal integrity is required for RABV propagation though the CNS. Promotion of neuronal survival and virus replication are not exclusive and could be complementary strategies. Preliminary results indicate that RABV strains promoting either neuronal survival or death display different effects on NB size. Further experiments will be required to understand the role of NBs in the control of neuronal death.</p><p>In conclusion, these findings describe a novel role for TLR3 and describe how viruses &#x02014; in our case, RABV &#x02014; hijack normal functions of neuronal proteins and exploit cell compartmentalisation to favour the progression of their life cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and virus</title><p>Human Ntera-2clD/1 cells (ATCC CRL, 1973), human SK-N-SH cells (ATCC HTB11) and Hek293A (QBiogene) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with Glutamax-I, high glucose and sodium pyruvate 100 mM (Invitrogen, UK), supplemented with 10&#x00025; FCS-N (foetal calf serum for neuronal cultures, Invitrogen, U.K.), 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin (Invitrogen).

Acapella software (PerkinElmer Acapella 2.0 (TM)) was used to delineate inclusions and measure of size of viral inclusions (area determined by number of pixels). The attribution of NB in each cell was computed by defining a region of interest around each nucleus. A set of negative controls has been used to fix the Acapella parameters (i.e. threshold or contrast adjustment). The different characteristics (area, position and number of NB for each cell) were saved and exported to Excel (Microsoft).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>RABV- and mock-infected cells were washed once with PBS Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, fixed with 4&#x00025; PFA for 30 min at room temperature (rT), washed again, and treated with gelatin (1&#x00025; in water) for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The samples were then incubated for 20 min at rT in 0.3&#x00025; Triton X-100-PBS and surface IgG receptors were blocked with a saturating buffer (ST) (2&#x00025; bovine serum albumin and 5&#x00025; FCS in PBS) for 30 min at rT followed by a 10 min incubation at 4&#x000b0;C with Fc-block (1/50). Viral NC were detected by incubation with a FITC-conjugated rabbit Ab for 2 h at rT. Primary and secondary Abs were diluted in ST. For immunostaining, cells were incubated with secondary Ab, biotin/ streptavidin, followed by incubation with DAB, resulting in a brown coloration. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 for immunofluorescence analysis or haematoxylin for transmitted light acquisition. Slides were washed with PBS Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, using water for the last wash. Coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount-G&#x02122; or ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (&#x0002b;/&#x02212; DAPI if Hoechst previously used). Widefield observation was performed on a Leica DM 5000B UV microscope equipped with a DC 300FX camera (&#x000d7;40 and &#x000d7;63 objectives). Leica FW 4000 software was used for image acquisition and processing. Confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 META (version 3.2) on Axiovert 200 M with a Plan Apochromat 63&#x000d7; and N.A. 1.4 objective. Confocal stacks were deconvoluted on Huygens&#x000ae; (Scientific Volume, Imaging, Netherlands) and 3D rendering was carried out using Imaris&#x000ae; (Bitplane AG, Switzerland) software. Confocal images were compiled using serial Z-stacks 0.3 &#x000b5;m apart, representing at least two experiments. Co-localisation of TLR3 and organelle markers was analysed using the colocalisation finder and threshold plugins of WCIF Image J.
