With these reagents we stained 11 tumor cell lines of different origin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001339-t001">Table 1</xref>). We obtained specific staining of intracellular structures in all cell lines tested. As representative examples, HT-29, CHO, Jurkat and HeLa cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. Interestingly, the staining pattern of the three different NCR-Ig fusion proteins was specific and reproducible in the different cell lines tested. The comparison with parallel cytospin stainings using antibodies against the ER marker calnexin, the Golgi marker GM130, the endosomal marker EEA-1, and the late endosomal marker LAMP-1, respectively, revealed i) that NKp46-Ig labels the ER and a subset of early endosomes of HeLa cells, ii) that NKp44-Ig appeared to label late endosomes in a very homogenous fashion, and iii) that NKp30-Ig weakly stained the ER and strongly labeled a heterogenous population of large peripheral vesicles which probably represent early endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). These findings suggest that recognition structures for the three NCR are readily detectable in all cells tested.</p><fig id="pone-0001339-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001339.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Immunoperoxidase stainings of acetone-fixed tumor cells on cytospins.</title><p>Intracellular compartments of HT-29, 1106mel, Jurkat (A&#x02013;C) and HeLa cells (D) were stained with NKp46-Ig, NKp44-Ig and NKp30-Ig fusion proteins as indicated.

In contrast to Ig fusion proteins, the ILZ fusion proteins show higher avidity for surface staining and do not bind to Fc receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Stark1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The NCR-ILZ fusion proteins were produced in the human cell line 293T, purified and used for the staining of 30 cell lines of different origin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001339-t002">Table 2</xref>). Binding of the NCR-ILZ was detected by a monoclonal anti-ILZ antibody and analyzed by FACS. As a control, we used a CS1-ILZ fusion protein, which only showed background staining on the cells tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and data not shown). An example for the surface staining of NKp30-ILZ and NKp44-ILZ is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g002">Fig. 2</xref>. We did not observe any significant staining of NKp46-ILZ. A possible explanation for this lack of activity could be that the ILZ part obscures the D2 domain of NKp46, which is important for ligand binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Arnon4">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore analyzed the expression of NKp30L and NKp44L on the different cell lines. To make the results between the different experiments comparable, we normalized all FACS results to the CS1-ILZ background staining. Most cell lines were tested between four and six times for the expression of NKp30L and NKp44L in independent experiments. First we analyzed seven tumor cell lines derived from pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The expression of NKp30L and NKp44L was very variable, ranging from no detectable expression to significant surface expression. NKp44L staining was consistently higher than NKp30L. This could indicate, that the expression of NKp44L is higher than that of NKp30L. However, this could also be caused by better staining efficiency or higher affinity binding of the NKp44-ILZ. Interestingly, the staining intensities for NKp30L and NKp44L seemed to be linked with cells expressing high amounts of NKp30L also expressing high amounts of NKp44L. This variable but linked expression was also observed in four different breast carcinoma cell lines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001339-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001339.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Detection of NKp30L and NKp44L on the surface of cells by FACS analysis.</title><p>(A) 293T cells were analyzed without treatment (none) or after incubation with medium or CS1-ILZ, followed by anti-ILZ mAb (ILZ-11) and PE-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (GaM-PE) staining.

When comparing the lysis of these two cell lines by IL-2-activated primary NK cells from two different donors we detected good lysis of EM-3 but weak lysis of SD-1 target cells, correlating with the NCR ligand expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). More importantly, the lysis of EM-3 cells could be reduced to the level of SD-1 killing by using a blocking anti-NKp30 antibody, while this antibody did not reduce the lysis of SD-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). This again correlates with the staining data for the expression of NKp30L on these two cell lines. To check if the expression level of NKp30L correlates with the NKp30-dependent lysis of tumor cells we tested K562 cells, which showed detectable, but lower NKp30L expression compared to EM-3 cells. Lysis of K562 cells could not be blocked by anti-NKp30 nor by anti-NKp44 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). This demonstrates that a certain threshold of NKp30L expression is necessary to induce significant NKp30-dependent lysis. To check if the higher staining intensity for NKp44L on HeLa and Shep also correlates with NKp44-mediated lysis we tested the NK cell-mediated killing of these cells. Lysis of both cells could be blocked by anti-NKp30 and anti-NKp44 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g006">Fig. 6D, E</xref>).

Recent publications point towards an involvement of heparan sulfate structures in the binding of NKp30 and NKp44. However, we found that also protein structures are important for the binding of NCR, as trypsin abolished the binding of NKp30-ILZ and NKp44-ILZ to the surface of treated EM-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). This reduction in surface expression of NKp30L and NKp44L after trypsin treatment also had functional consequences. Removal of NKp30L from the surface of EM-3 cells significantly reduced the lysis of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), which is largely dependent on the engagement of NKp30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001339-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001339.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Surface expression of NKp30L and NKp44L is sensitive to Trypsin treatment.</title><p>EM-3 cells were left untreated (control) or treated with trypsin.

However, only limited information exists about the nature of the NCR ligands. Direct analysis of the expression of NCR ligands has only been performed on a limited number of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Arnon4">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Nowbakht1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we provided a more comprehensive analysis of the expression of NKp30L and NKp44L. The surface expression of NKp46L could not be analyzed, as our NKp46-ILZ fusion protein did not give any significant surface staining on several cells reported to express NKp46L. The second Ig domain (D2) of NKp46 is essential for ligand recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Arnon4">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. This domain is directly adjacent to the ILZ sequence in our fusion protein. One reason for the lack of NKp46-ILZ activity could be the steric hindrance of the D2 domain by the ILZ sequence.</p><p>For NKp30L and NKp44L we found intracellular and extracellular expression on almost all cell lines tested. Expression of these ligands was not restricted to cell lines of any specific origin. Instead, we found wide variations in NKp30L and NKp44L surface expression among cell lines of the same histogenetic origin. This is in agreement with an earlier study, which found variable expression of NCR ligands in melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Pessino1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, we detected linked expression of NKp30L and NKp44L on many cell lines derived from solid tumors. This is unlikely to be an artifact or a cross-reactivity of our staining reagents as we did not find such linked expression on cells of hematopoietic origin. The different staining intensities of NKp30-ILZ and NKp44-ILZ could either reflect a different expression of NKp30L and NKp44L, or be simply the result of a higher affinity between NKp44L and the NKp44 receptor. However, in the absence of an identified cellular ligand for these receptors this questions cannot be answered. Functionally, the higher staining intensity foe NKp44L does not translate in higher NKp44-dependent lysis. To the contrary, NKp30-dependent lysis was even higher than NKp44-dependent lysis in the Shep and HeLa cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001339-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). However, the staining intensity for each ligand is indicative for the lysis. EM3 and K562 cells, showing low staining intensity for NKp44L were not lysed in an NKp44-dependent fashion, whereas Shep and HeLa cells, showing high staining intensity for NKp44L were lysed in a NKp44-dependent way. Similarly, K562 cells, showing low NKp30L staining intensity were not lysed in an NKp30-dependent fashion, while EM-3, HeLa and Shep cells were. How much lysis of a given target cell depends on NKp30 or NKp44 will also depend on the expression of other activating NK cell ligands. Therefore, the amount of NKp30L or NKp44L staining intensity cannot predict the amount of NKp30 or NKp44-dependent NK cell lysis.</p><p>Heparan sulfate was reported to be involved in the recognition of NCR, suggesting the recognition of similar ligands by these receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Bloushtain1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Hershkovitz1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the differential expression of NKp30L and NKp44L by the cell lines tested in this study suggests the existence of distinct ligands for both receptors. Also, the stainings of intracellular compartments with NKp46-Ig, NKp44-Ig and NKp30-Ig revealed clearly different patterns, strongly suggesting that these receptors recognize distinct target structures. The highly reproducible and strong vesicular, intracellular stainings as compared with the more variable surface stainings suggests that the surface expression of NCR ligands may be regulated by plasma membrane turnover. Changes in internalization rates might provide tumor cells with a means to escape from NK cell attack.</p><p>The NCR ligands are likely to contain a protein component as we found the surface expression of NKp30L and NKp44L to be sensitive to trypsin treatment. This has important implications for the analysis of NCR ligand expression on adherent cells. To avoid artifacts due the detachment of cells by trypsin we used a non-enzymatic cell dissociation reagent in this study.</p><p>The increased surveillance of cells in mitosis by human NK cells is blocked by hyaluronidase treatment and antibodies against NKp46 or NKp44 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-NoltetHoen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. As hyaluronan and NCR do not seem to interact directly, NCR ligands could be higher expressed in mitotic cells. Surprisingly, we found the opposite by demonstrating a clear down-modulation of NKp30L and NKp44L on cells arrested in mitosis. This suggests that the direct interaction between NCR and their cellular ligands is not involved in the increased surveillance of mitotic cells. Instead NCR might be important for the activation of a hyaluronan-binding receptor.</p><p>NK cells are particularly active against cells derived from the hematopoietic system. Interestingly, we found the lowest expression of NKp30L and NKp44L on these cells, consistent with other reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Nowbakht1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Costello1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. This could indicate that the NCR may not play a major role in NK cell recognition of hematological disorders. However, ligands for 2B4, CRACC and NTB-A are commonly present on hematopoietic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001339-Bhat1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

This co-stimulation may provide sufficient NCR-mediated NK cell activation even under conditions of low NCR ligand expression. As these co-stimulatory ligands are missing in cell lines derived from solid tumors, a higher expression of NCR ligands might be necessary for efficient NK cell recognition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and antibodies</title><p>Cell lines used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001339-t001">tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001339-t002">2</xref>.
