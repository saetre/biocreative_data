Recent studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial biogenesis increases during adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>), and this is presumably due at least in part to the presence of the endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS). In fact, eNOS protein is not expressed in either undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells or preadipocytes, whereas its expression markedly increases with adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). It is noteworthy that NO increases mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipocytes via cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent pathways, including peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor &#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;) gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). Consistently, mitochondrial biogenesis is reduced in fat of eNOS-null mutant mice (eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), with decreased energy expenditure and increased body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). This suggests that the eNOS-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis is relevant to adipocyte maturation and fuel metabolism.</p><p>Cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors participate in the physiological modulation of many central and peripheral functions related to the control of energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). They are the most abundant G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors expressed in the brain, where CB1 receptor activation promotes feeding and modulates the rewarding properties of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). CB1 receptors also control metabolic functions by acting on peripheral organs, including white adipose tissue (WAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). Notably, in adipocytes, CB1 receptor expression increases with cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). Moreover, CB1 receptor&#x02013;deficient mice (CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) are lean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>) and resistant to a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Similarly, the selective CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716 (rimonabant) persistently reduces body weight during the treatment of obese animals, although food intake renormalizes after an initial 1- to 2-week weight reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>), suggesting that CB1 receptor blockade stimulates fat metabolism, leading to a decreased fat content.</p><p>We now demonstrate a prominent role for the CB1 receptors to modulate eNOS gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipocytes. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting the endocannabinoid system improves mitochondrial function, implying a novel, unrecognized mechanism of action for the antiobesity drug rimonabant.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture.</title><p>White fat precursor cells were enzymatically isolated from epididymal WAT of wild-type C57BL/6J mice and cultured as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>).

Importantly, however, siRNA against eNOS strongly decreased mitochondrial biogenesis induced by 1 &#x003bc;mol/l SR141716 treatment, indicating that the effect of SR141716 depends, at least in part, on the presence of eNOS (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A&#x02013;E</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mitochondrial biogenesis is increased in WAT of CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</title><p>To assess whether the CB1 receptor blockade increases mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT in vivo, we examined the eNOS expression and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis in epididymal fat pads derived from 8-week-old male CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and their wild-type littermates either on a standard or high-fat diet for 12 weeks.

Furthermore, CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed increased mRNA levels of PGC-1&#x003b1; and Tfam (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>), COX IV, and cytochrome c (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>); increased mtDNA amounts (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>); and increased citrate synthase activity (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>) compared with wild-type littermates. These increments were evident in animals either on standard or high-fat diets. To confirm that the mitochondrial biogenesis induced by CB1 gene deletion occurs in white adipocytes in vivo, mature white adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pad of CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wild-type littermates after standard or high-fat diets. Although we do not rule out that other cell types present in whole WAT (i.e., endothelial cells, macrophages, or others) may be involved, we found that CB1 gene deletion increases eNOS expression and mitochondrial biogenesis and function in white adipocytes (online appendix Fig. 1 &#x0005b;available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1623">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1623</ext-link>&#x0005d;).</p><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on the standard diet had a lower body weight and adiposity (online appendix Fig. 2<italic>A</italic>) than wild-type controls, having showed a significantly reduced body weight compared with wild-type mice throughout the whole period of observation (data not shown). Most importantly, CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice maintained a leaner phenotype under the high-fat diet as evidenced by lower body weight and adiposity (online appendix Fig. 2<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Cumulative food intake was comparable between the two groups of mice on standard or high-fat diet (online appendix Fig. 2<italic>C</italic>), although CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed a smaller feed efficiency (weight gain/food intake, an indirect measurement of increased energy expenditure) than their wild-type littermates (online appendix Fig. 2<italic>D</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Defective mitochondrial biogenesis is restored in WAT of high-fat diet&#x02013;fed SR141716-treated mice.</title><p>CB1 receptor effects on mitochondrial biogenesis were further confirmed in vivo by a long-term treatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist. Four-week-old male mice were put on either standard or high-fat diet. Starting at week 10, standard diet&#x02013;and high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice were treated either with SR141716 (10 mg &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> orally) or vehicle for 11 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Consistent with the data from CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, eNOS mRNA and protein levels and mitochondrial biogenesis were significantly higher in WAT of the SR141716-treated high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice than in those of vehicle-treated high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice, although as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>), they were lower in the vehicle-treated high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice than in the vehicle-treated standard diet&#x02013;fed mice (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). These results suggest that SR141716 treatment amends the high-fat diet&#x02013;induced impairment of the NO generating system, restoring the mitochondrial function at levels observed in wild-type mice on a standard diet. Treatment with SR141716 induced only a slight, but not statistically significant, increase of eNOS expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in mice on the standard diet (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Superimposable results were obtained in isolated mature white adipocytes from SR141716-treated mice (online appendix Fig. 3).</p><p>Interestingly, the mean body weight and adiposity of the SR141716-treated mice were markedly lower compared with that of vehicle-treated mice on the high-fat diet (online appendix Fig. 4<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>).

Thus, AMPK might be involved in the effect of CB1 receptor blockade on eNOS-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. In fact, treatment of cultured white adipocytes with 1 &#x003bc;mol/l SR141716 induced a rapid and persistent AMPK phosphorylation (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>) and significantly increased AMPK activity (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Moreover, in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>), we found that AMPK activity was lower in the WAT of wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet compared with those fed a standard diet. Noticeably, while CB1 receptor deletion did not affect AMPK phosphorylation or activity in WAT of standard diet&#x02013;fed mice (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>), both AMPK phosphorylation (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>) and activity (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>) were normalized in the WAT of high-fat diet&#x02013;fed CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, up to the levels measured in wild-type standard diet&#x02013;fed mice.</p><p>Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the CB1 receptor blockade in vivo concomitantly activates AMPK cascade and upregulates eNOS expression and mitochondrial biogenesis, which are impaired by a high-fat diet in WAT, and these processes may be involved in the control of adiposity and body weight of animals on a high-fat diet.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study demonstrates that genetic and pharmacological blockade of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor increases mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipocytes. Treatment of adipocytes with SR141716, a selective antagonist of CB1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>), increases mitochondrial biogenesis genes, including PGC-1&#x003b1; and Tfam. This possibly implies that SR141716 is antagonizing an endocannabinoid tone present in cultured fat cells. It has been recently reported by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>) that rodent and human adipocytes produce and release endocannabinoids, including 2-arachidonoylglycerol, anandamide, and other cannabimimetic compounds. Thus, our results suggest that SR141716 increases mitochondrial biogenesis by antagonizing the endocannabinoids produced in cell culture. In turn, this strongly implies that the CB1 receptor agonists might downregulate the eNOS-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipocytes. Consistently, cannabinoids, including &#x00394;(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, inhibit the respiratory enzyme system in brain, liver, skeletal muscle, and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>) and, consequently, reduce the rates of oxygen consumption in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>).</p><p>We have recently found that eNOS-dependent NO production induces mitochondrial biogenesis in different cell types, including white adipocytes, by cGMP-dependent pathways and that the newly synthesized mitochondria are functionally active, ensuing high oxygen consumption and ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). This suggests that the SR141716-dependent increase in eNOS expression is mechanistically linked to the mitochondrial biogenesis induced by the CB1 receptor blockade. This was confirmed by the observation that gene silencing of eNOS by RNAi markedly impairs the SR141716 stimulatory effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and function in cultured adipose cells.</p><p>We observed that genetic CB1 receptor blockade in vivo increases eNOS expression and mitochondrial biogenesis both in whole WAT and isolated mature white adipocytes, and this is accompanied by prevention of high-fat diet&#x02013;induced fat accumulation. Most importantly, the pharmacological CB1 receptor blockade fully counteracts the downregulation of eNOS-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis due to a high-fat diet in mice. This might indicate a novel, previously unrecognized mechanism of action of SR141716 as an antiobesity drug. Not only would it transiently suppress food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>) and reduce lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), but it also would increase the oxidative metabolism in white adipocytes by counteracting the inhibitory effects of endocannabinoids, whose levels are increased in fat tissues of obese rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). Thus, we propose that the overactivity of endocannabinoids might contribute to downregulate mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipocytes of obese mice and that the blockade of adipose CB1 receptor might revert this process, thus preventing the high-fat diet&#x02013;induced increase in adiposity and body weight gain.</p><p>There is an open question regarding the mechanisms that link CB1 receptor blockade to the eNOS expression. Furthermore, it remains to be clarified how the recovery of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in WAT could counteract the development of obesity. We found that SR141716 enhances AMPK activity in cultured white adipocytes and that the WAT AMPK activity, which is reduced by a high-fat diet, is normalized in WAT from high-fat diet&#x02013;fed CB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to the levels measured in wild-type standard-diet&#x02013;fed mice. Since AMPK is known to enhance NO production by activating eNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>), the AMPK cascade might operate upstream of the NO generating system, possibly contributing to the CB1 blockade&#x02013;mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, induction of AMPK activity has been found to increase mitochondrial content in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). Thus, the enhanced &#x003b2;-oxidation of free fatty acids elicited by AMPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>) and by eNOS-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>) might functionally link SR141716 treatment to its antiobesity effects.</p><p>The mechanisms that link eNOS-derived NO to the gene expression machinery involved in mitochondrial biogenesis also remain to be elucidated. Studies of eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have demonstrated an obligatory role of eNOS in mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). Noticeably, eNOS, NO, and its intracellular messenger cGMP are located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and several transcription factors possess heme moieties that can bind NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>), but further investigation is needed to understand whether eNOS-mediated responses involve the nuclear NO/cGMP.</p><p>It is now widely accepted that obesity is causally linked to a chronic, low-grade inflammation of visceral adipose tissue, characterized by infiltrating macrophages, abnormal cytokine production, and activation of a network of inflammatory signaling pathways, including tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and inducible NOS (iNOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). It has been observed that upregulation of iNOS (which is induced in inflammatory conditions) often correlates with a downregulation of eNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). Corroborating this, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; increases iNOS expression in different cells and tissues, including fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>) and inhibits eNOS expression, mitochondrial function, and energy production in WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). Interestingly, SR141716 has been shown to reduce plasma tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; levels in inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). Thus, we can speculate that the anti-inflammatory effects of SR141716 could help counteracting the increase of iNOS expression and the reduction of eNOS expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in high-fat diet&#x02013;induced obesity.</p><p>Endogenous cannabinoids and CB1 agonists promote vasodilation and decrease blood pressure, particularly in rodent models of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). A variety of putative mechanisms could explain these effects, including the increased production of vasodilator NO in vessels. Although we have not analyzed the possible effects of SR141716 on eNOS expression in the vasculature, a recent analysis of the impact of rimonabant on blood pressure in the pooled population from four large trials with similar design (the Rimonabant-In-Obesity Program) demonstrates that there is no effect of rimonabant on blood pressure beyond the modest reduction mediated by weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that mitochondrial biogenesis and function, which are impaired by a high-fat diet, are restored to normal levels in white adipocytes by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716, and this is accompanied by prevention of adiposity and body weight increase in high-fat&#x02013;fed obese mice. In view of the present findings, targeting eNOS expression and mitochondrial biogenesis might offer therapeutic gains and simplify the drug approach to clinical situations as complex as obesity and related disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db07-1623_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db07-1623_supps.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the Ministero della Salute (to E.N. and M.O.C.); the Cofinanziamento 2005 Programmi di Ricerca Scientifica di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale from the Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universit&#x000e0; e della Ricerca (to E.N., MOC., and R.V.); the Diabesity EC-FP6 (contract no.
