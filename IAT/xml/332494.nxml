Using antibodies produced against the purified protein, a Drosophila cDNA expression library was screened and a cDNA was isolated which encoded a portion of DmSII. When this cDNA was used to probe Kc cell mRNA the predominant species was found to be 1.4 kb in length. The original cDNA was used to screen a Drosophila Kc cell cDNA library resulting in the isolation of a 1.4 kb cDNA which was then sequenced. The deduced protein sequence for DmSII exhibited high similarity to mouse SII protein sequence. In addition, significant sequence similarity was found with the protein encoded by the yeast gene PPR2, which is involved in regulation of URA4 gene expression. The comparison of amino acid sequences suggests that DmSII is comprised of two domains homologous to mouse SII separated by a flexible, serine rich region of low homology. The shorter yeast protein has sequence similarity only to the carboxy terminal domain.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0108-a" xlink:role="6294"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6293"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6294"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6295"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6296"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6297"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6298"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
