Phylogenetic studies have shown that PPARs form a subfamily of the nuclear receptor superfamily, along with the receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoic acid (RA), vitamin D, ecdysone, and the orphan receptors Rev-ErbAa (5ear1;NR1D1) and E75 (NR1D3, from Drosophila), the two latter being the closest relatives of the PPARs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. PPARs play important role in lipid metabolism, cell differentiation and development, inflammation, cancer and demyelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Three isoforms (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;) for PPAR have been identified so far in xenopus, mouse, human, rats and hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The isoforms exhibit a tissue specific expression pattern. The first isoform PPAR &#x003b1; is expressed in tissues that play a role in fatty acid catabolism such as liver, kidney, heart, and intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This isoform is the first described receptor that is activated by peroxisome proliferators and hence the name [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The main function of this isoform is to regulate the genes encoding lipid metabolizing enzymes and proteins participating in lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The second isoform is PPAR &#x003b2;. This receptor is also called as FAAR (fatty acid activated receptor)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This isoform is expressed mainly in the brain, skeletal muscle, skin, adipose tissue, gut, placenta and has a very broad expression pattern. Based on the cell proliferation and differentiation, the expression profile of this isoform varies. Both isoforms PPAR &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; are involved in lipid utilization activities such as fatty acid oxidation, energy uncoupling reactions and response to fasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. PPAR &#x003b3; has three alternatively spliced isoforms. PPAR &#x003b3;1 is virtually expressed in almost all tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PPAR &#x003b3;2 is primarily expressed in adipose tissue while PPAR &#x003b3;3 is expressed in white adipose tissue, large intestine and macrophages. PPAR &#x003b3; regulates the lipid storage and insulin sensitivity reactions such as lipogenesis, adipocyte differentiation, adipocyte survival and adipokine secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) has been identified as an approach to induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation in a variety of cancer cells. Breast tissue, in particular, was found to express PPAR&#x003b3; in amounts greater than those found in normal breast epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, activation of PPAR&#x003b3; through cells' exposure to synthetic PPAR&#x003b3; ligands such as proglitazone or rosiglitazone is shown to exert antitumor activity through cell growth inhibition and cellular differentiation. Activation of PPARs has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells from different lineages such as liposarcoma, breast adenocarcinoma, prostate carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma bladder carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Various studies have also shown that PPARs are involved in transcription regulation of genes upon activation by a ligand. The binding of PPARs to the promoter sequence either represses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] or activates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] the gene. Hence, PPARs represent promising targets for cancer treatment because of their anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities. The PPAR &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; isoforms share a highly conserved DNA binding domain that recognizes specific DNA sequences known as Peroxisome Proliferator Response Elements (PPREs) (11). PPAR DNA-binding activity is modulated by Retinoic-X-Receptor (RXR). Upon ligand binding, PPAR translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus and forms heterodimer with RXR. PPAR/RXR complex then binds to PPRE composed of a Direct Repeat (DR) preferably spaced by one nucleotide (DR1) with a consensus sequence of AGGTCA-A-AGGTCA. It must be noted that there are DR2 motifs which are also recognized by PPAR that are preferably spaced by two nucleotide (DR2). Experimental evidences link upregulation of the pH regulator Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchanger 1 (NHE1) to the development and progression of carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and its down regulation to inhibition of cells' growth and enhanced apoptotic sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is also suggested that cancer cells are generally under reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As mitochondrial respiration is the main source of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;- </sup>generation in the cells, MnSOD (manganese superoxide dismutase) is of prime importance in maintaining cellular ROS balance and mitochondrial integrity in cells. This is specifically true for tumor cells which are constantly under ROS stress due to its increased metabolic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Considering the abundance of PPAR&#x003b3; receptor and elevated NHE1 expression in a variety of cancer cells including breast cancer and their absolute dependence on MnSOD it is of interest to explore PPAR&#x003b3; agonists for selectively tailoring the expression of NHE1 and MnSOD. Therefore, we manually collected experimentally proven PPRE binding motifs from literature and arrived at a collection of 250 motifs. Search of human NHE1 and MnSOD promoter sequence against this collection predicted two putative DR2 PPRE motifs in NHE1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and one DR1 PPRE and two DR2 PPRE motifs in MnSOD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We further investigated if PPAR&#x003b3; binds to the promoter of NHE 1 and MnSOD genes at these PPRE motifs. Since these genes have not been identified as PPAR&#x003b3; target genes in breast cancer cells, the results for the first time confirm regulation of NHE1 and MnSOD by PPAR&#x003b3;.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of putative PPREs in promoter of NHE1 and MnSOD</bold>.

Our results therefore demonstrate that NHE1 is a PPAR&#x003b3; target gene.

Our results show both full length construct and the 5' deletion construct responded to 15 d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>treatment in a dose-dependent decrease in promoter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). This seems to suggest that the bonafide PPRE would be either PPRE2 or PPRE3. Interestingly, a further 5' deletion construct (-555 to +24) that lacks all three PPREs did not decrease with 15 d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>treatment, which suggests that 15 d-PGJ<sub>2 </sub>treatment on human MnSOD promoter activity is PPAR&#x003b3;-dependent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

More importantly, PPRE2 which was not predicted by PPRE (but was added as it was Alu element (Sx)) to bind PPAR&#x003b3;, our DNA binding assay indeed shows no significant binding by PPAR&#x003b3; to PPRE2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>PPAR&#x003b3; binds to PPRE3 in human MnSOD promoter</bold>.

It is the second highest occurring cancer in women and one of the leading causes of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although anti-estrogens have provided an effective endocrine therapy, a large number of patients acquiring resistance to these drugs pose a significant problem. Recently, a new approach using activators of <underline>p</underline>eroxisome <underline>p</underline>roliferator-<underline>a</underline>ctivated <underline>r</underline>eceptor <underline>g</underline>amma (PPAR&#x003b3;) to inhibit proliferation and increase cell death in breast cancer cell lines has given hope to the development of a new class of anticancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, tumor breast tissue expresses PPAR&#x003b3; in amounts greater than normal breast epithelium, suggesting for a novel therapeutic approach for ligand-activated PPAR&#x003b3; as an anti-tumor agent in differentiation-based breast cancer therapy.</p><p>Normal functioning of cell metabolism occurs within a restricted intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) range. Regulation of pH<sub>i </sub>is accomplished via active extrusion of H<sup>+ </sup>by the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>Exchangers (NHEs), a membrane antiporter expressed in a variety of cell types. The NHE family consists of ten isoforms, NHE1 to NHE10. Interestingly, apart from its role as a principal regulator of pH<sub>i </sub>and cell volume, the ubiquitously expressed NHE1 has been implicated in cell proliferation and transformation. Conversely, tumor cells deficient in NHE1 either fail to grow or show severely retarded growth when implanted in immuno-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. More recently, we showed that down regulation of NHE1 expression by direct silencing of the gene expression or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>treatment leads to cells' growth arrest and sensitization to etoposide or staurosporine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Development of breast cancer has also been correlated to oxidative stress, brought about by alterations to the delicate balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] ROS stress seems to render cancer cells more dependent on MnSOD to protect them by maintaining cellular ROS balance. The importance of MnSOD became clearer when genetic knockout studies in mice indicate that MnSOD, but not other SODs, is essential for cell survival. Several recent studies reported that forced suppression of MnSOD expression by siRNA leads to decrease in breast cancer cells invasive property [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]and to sensitization of ovarian cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although the mouse MnSOD gene has been shown to be a PPAR&#x003b3; target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], a direct association between PPAR&#x003b3; and human MnSOD from tumor cells' perspective has not been shown.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that NHE1 and MnSOD have PPRE binding motifs of high affinity. This confirms that these genes can be downregulated by PPAR&#x003b3; in presence of a ligand. Since, downregulation of NHE1 inhibits proliferation and increases cell death in breast cancer cell lines, the presented data provides new direction for development of a new class of anticancer drugs. Concurrently, downregulaion of MnSOD expression is reported to decrease cancer cells invasive property [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and sensitizes cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs. Thus, the presented data suggests that PPAR&#x003b3; can regulate MnSOD in human cell linesPPAR&#x003b3; has been found to regulate MnSOD transcription by binding to a PPRE on the mouse MnSOD promoter region. This report for the first time suggests PPAR&#x003b3; activation and its involvement in downregulating MnSOD gene expression in human.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>G.V., S.M.K., and A.P.K conceived the idea of developing a PPRE motifs database.
