Mcm1, a MADS-box transcription factor in yeast, is an essential protein involved in regulating diverse sets of genes; including, cell mating-type, cell cycle, osmotic regulation and arginine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c5">5</xref>). In order to carry out these regulatory roles Mcm1 interacts with several different cofactors that help determine its function. For example, in cell-type determination, Mcm1 binds P-elements in the promoters of <bold>a</bold>-specific genes to activate their transcription in the <bold>a</bold>-cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c6">6</xref>). However, in the &#x003b1;-cell type, Mcm1 interacts with the &#x003b1;2 protein at these promoter elements to repress this same set of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c8">8</xref>). Mcm1 also interacts with the &#x003b1;1 protein to bind P&#x02019;Q promoter elements to activate the expression of &#x003b1;-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c10">10</xref>). Therefore, cofactor interaction markedly alters the function and specificity of the Mcm1 MADS-box protein.</p><p>A comparison of P&#x02019;Q elements found upstream of &#x003b1;-specific genes to the consensus P-element derived from the promoters of <bold>a</bold>-specific genes shows they are similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f1">1</xref>). However, the P&#x02019;Q significantly differs from the consensus P-element on the side that is directly flanked by Q, the binding site for &#x003b1;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c9">9</xref>). Since Mcm1 is unable to activate transcription on its own from a P&#x02019;Q site, the &#x003b1;1 protein must help Mcm1 by either increasing its ability to bind to the site or to recruit the transcriptional machinery &#x0005b;reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c2">2</xref>)&#x0005d;.</p><p>The crystal structures of several MADS-box proteins show that many produce a significant bend in the DNA when they bind their sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c13">13</xref>). Biochemical and genetic analysis suggest that this bending can play an important role in transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c18">18</xref>). For example, the <italic>mcm1</italic>-V34A mutant, which reduces the apparent bend angle of a P-element from 95&#x000b0; to 82&#x000b0;, causes a &#x0003e;10-fold decrease in transcriptional activation, yet has only a minor effect on DNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c19">19</xref>). Other mutants with larger defects in binding affinity have less of an effect on activation than the V34A mutant, suggesting that bending may play a role in activation. Interestingly, when the <italic>mcm1</italic>-V34A mutant was assayed for the ability to activate a P&#x02019;Q element in complex with &#x003b1;1, it showed a less severe defect in transcriptional activation than many other mutants, demonstrating that either activation by Mcm1&#x02013;&#x003b1;1 does not require DNA bending or that &#x003b1;1 helps mediate the bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c19">19</xref>).</p><p>To more fully understand the relationship of DNA-bending and cofactor interaction for transcriptional activation, we analyzed bending of a P&#x02019;Q element with wild-type and mutant Mcm1 proteins alone and in complex with &#x003b1;1. Our results demonstrate the &#x003b1;1 cofactor contributes to the DNA bend mediated by the complex and that a change in the bend angle results in a significant decrease in transcriptional activation. These results support a model of the requirement for a proper DNA-bend by the &#x003b1;1&#x02013;Mcm1 complex for full transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast and bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed in either the yeast strain JMY041 (MAT<bold>a</bold> ade2-1 trp1-1 his3-11,15 can1-100 ura3-1 leu2-3 mcm1&#x00394;::kan<sup>r</sup>/pSL1574-MCM1 CEN URA3&#x00029; or EC7 (MAT&#x003b1; ade2-1 trp1-1 his3-11,15 can1-100 ura3-1 leu2-3,112 mat&#x003b1;1&#x00394;::TRP1 mcm1&#x00394;::kan<sup>r</sup>/pSL1574-MCM1 CEN URA3) derived from W303-1A and W303-1B, respectively. The strains were transformed with plasmids that contained either wild-type or mutant derivatives of untagged Mcm1 (pJM231, MCM1 CEN HIS3) or a V5-tagged derivative (pJM421, MCM1-V5 CEN HIS3), both of which complement a mcm1&#x00394; strain for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c17">17</xref>). Cells that had lost the plasmid pSL1574 with a wild-type copy of MCM1 were selected by growth in the presence of 5-FOA.

However, Mcm1 showed only a slightly reduced binding affinity (3-fold) <italic>in vitro</italic> for a P&#x02019;Q site compared with a P-element, suggesting Mcm1 may be bound on its own <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c25">25</xref>). To characterize the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of Mcm1 to P&#x02019;Q elements alone and in complex with &#x003b1;1 chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f2">2</xref>). As expected, in the presence of &#x003b1;1, Mcm1 strongly bound to the promoters of &#x003b1;-specific genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f2">2</xref>, lane 7). Interestingly, there were also significant levels of Mcm1 binding to these sites even in the absence of &#x003b1;1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f2">2</xref>, lane 3). Since Mcm1 bound to the promoters of &#x003b1;-specific genes <italic>in vivo</italic> but failed to activate transcription, it suggests &#x003b1;1 has a greater role in transcriptional activation than simply recruiting Mcm1 to these promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x003b1;1 protein increases the bend of Mcm1 bound to a P&#x02019;Q element</title><p>There is evidence that DNA bending may play a role in transcriptional regulation by MADS-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c18">18</xref>). To determine if &#x003b1;1 affects the degree of DNA bending at a P&#x02019;Q element with Mcm1 we performed EMSAs with circularly permuted fragments that contain P&#x02019;Q sites. As demonstrated previously, Mcm1 induced an apparent bend angle of roughly 99&#x000b0; at a P-PAL element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f3">3</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c16">16</xref>). However, the <italic>STE3</italic> P&#x02019;Q site was only bent with an apparent angle of 76&#x000b0; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f3">3</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;12). The decreased bend angle is presumably due to sub-optimal contacts at bases &#x0002b;5 to &#x0002b;8 in the degenerate side of the P&#x02019;Q site. DNA-bending of the P&#x02019;Q element was further reduced by <italic>mcm1</italic>-V34A, which contains a mutation at a residue required for DNA-bending &#x0005b;Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f3">3</xref>, lanes 13&#x02013;16; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c17">17</xref>)&#x0005d;. In the presence of both &#x003b1;1 and Mcm1 there was a shifted band with significantly slower mobility (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f3">3</xref>, lanes 17&#x02013;20). The presence of &#x003b1;1 significantly increased the bend of the P&#x02019;Q site to an apparent angle of 94&#x000b0;. Interestingly, in the presence of &#x003b1;1 the <italic>mcm1</italic>-V34A mutant had a similar level of DNA bending as the wild-type protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f3">3</xref>, compare lanes 17&#x02013;20 with 21&#x02013;24). These results indicate that the presence of &#x003b1;1 increases the DNA bend at a P&#x02019;Q site and is able to suppress the bending defect caused by the V34A mutation.</p><p>In addition to V34A, several other mutations in Mcm1 cause bending defects at a P-element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c18">18</xref>). On their own, each of the <italic>mcm1</italic> mutants showed a decrease in bending of the P&#x02019;Q site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f4">4</xref>B&#x02013;F, lanes 1&#x02013;4). The relative decreases in bending were comparable with that seen for these mutants binding to a P-element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c18">18</xref>). For example, the T66A mutation only caused a slight decrease in the apparent bend angle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f4">4</xref>E, lanes 1&#x02013;4), whereas the V34A, S37A double mutant caused a substantial decrease (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f4">4</xref>F, lanes 1&#x02013;4). Although these mutants showed significant decreases in bending on their own, in complex with &#x003b1;1 none of the mutants significantly altered the apparent bend angle in comparison with the wild-type protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f4">4</xref>A&#x02013;F, lanes 9&#x02013;12).</p><p>To further test if &#x003b1;1 affects the bending of the complex we examined binding to a mutant P&#x02019;Q site that contains a base pair substitution, T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G. In the context of a P-site this substitution significantly affects Mcm1-dependent DNA bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c18">18</xref>). The T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G substitution also caused a decrease in bending by Mcm1 in the context of the P&#x02019;Q site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f4">4</xref>A, lanes 5&#x02013;8 versus 1&#x02013;4). The difference in the apparent bend angle was comparable with the decrease observed for a P-element with a similar mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c16">16</xref>). The S37A, K40A and T66A mutations in Mcm1 caused a further decrease in the apparent bend angle of the P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f4">4</xref>C, D and F, lanes 1&#x02013;4 versus 5&#x02013;8). However, V34A and the V34A, S37A double mutant showed no further decrease in bending with the P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f4">4</xref>B and F, lanes 1&#x02013;8).

In addition, the P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G mutation did not cause a decrease in &#x003b1;1-binding affinity. The K40A mutant showed the opposite effect with &#x003b1;1 interaction, partially suppressing the binding defect. There was a decrease at a P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G with V34A and the V34A-S37A double mutant in &#x003b1;1 interaction showing an approximate 2-fold decrease.

However, in complex with &#x003b1;1 both mutants showed apparent bend angles comparable with the wild-type protein.

In a wild-type strain activation from the T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G reporter was decreased greater than 4-fold compared with the wild-type site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f7">7</xref>). Since the DNA-binding affinity of the &#x003b1;1&#x02013;Mcm1 complex for P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G was comparable with the wild-type site it suggests that the increase in the bend angle affects activation. We also analyzed the ability of <italic>mcm1</italic>-mutants to drive expression from a P&#x02019;Q and P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G site. The S37A mutant showed levels comparable with wild-type protein at both the P&#x02019;Q and P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f7">7</xref>). Since both the wild-type and S37A proteins showed increased bending of the P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G, it is possible the change in the apparent bending angle causes a decrease in activation at the mutant site. Although the V34A mutant showed a small reduction in activation from a wild-type P&#x02019;Q, this mutant was able to partially suppress the decrease in activation by the P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G site, which correlates with the ability to suppress the bending defect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f7">7</xref>). The T66E and S73R mutants both showed significant decreases in transcriptional activation at both sites, which is likely due to defects in interaction with &#x003b1;1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f7">7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c26">26</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The &#x003b1;1 and Mcm1 proteins combine together to form a complex that activates &#x003b1;-specific genes by binding to promoter elements termed P&#x02019;Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c2">2</xref>). To understand the requirements of both proteins for transcriptional activation we characterized the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding of Mcm1 to P&#x02019;Q promoter elements found upstream of &#x003b1;-specific genes with and without &#x003b1;1. Interestingly, &#x003b1;1 is not required for Mcm1 binding to the promoters of &#x003b1;-specific genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, although Mcm1 binds to P&#x02019;Q sites on its own it fails to activate transcription in the absence of &#x003b1;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c2">2</xref>). This finding suggests the function of &#x003b1;1 is more complex than simply the recruitment of Mcm1 to P&#x02019;Q promoter elements. In this study we provide molecular insight into the requirement of &#x003b1;1 for transcriptional activation.</p><p>It has been shown that Mcm1 causes a large bend in the DNA when it binds a P-element and there is evidence that supports a model that this bending may be important for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c17">17</xref>). However, due to the degeneracy on one side of the site, Mcm1 does not bend a P&#x02019;Q site to the same degree as a P-PAL site. This decrease in bending may explain why Mcm1 fails to activate transcription from a P&#x02019;Q promoter on its own. Bending of a P&#x02019;Q element is significantly increased with the Mcm1&#x02013;&#x003b1;1 complex compared with Mcm1 alone, indicating that one function of &#x003b1;1 might be to increase the DNA bend to an angle that promotes transcriptional activation. This model is further supported by our finding that the presence of &#x003b1;1 suppresses the defect in bending by the V34A mutant at a P&#x02019;Q site. This result may explain why we observed previously that the V34A mutant had a less severe defect in transcriptional activation in complex with &#x003b1;1, compared with activation of a P-PAL element on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c19">19</xref>).</p><p>The &#x003b1;1 protein likely increases the DNA-bend through interaction with Mcm1 by substituting for the lack of optimal Mcm1&#x02013;DNA contacts at bases 5&#x02013;8 on the degenerate side of the P&#x02019; element, which is directly flanked by the binding site for &#x003b1;1. However, the DNA-bending assays of the P&#x02019;Q site suggest that Mcm1 alone and in complex with &#x003b1;1 uses different mechanisms to bend the DNA. The mechanism of DNA-bending by Mcm1 on its own at a P&#x02019;Q element is similar to bending of a P-PAL site. For example, the <italic>mcm1</italic> mutants that are defective for bending at a P-PAL, such as V34A, S37A, K40A and T66A, show similar defects when bound on their own to a P&#x02019;Q element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c17">17</xref>). In addition, a T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G mutation in the context of a P&#x02019;Q element shows a decrease in DNA-bending by Mcm1 on its own, similar to that seen for P-PAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c16">16</xref>). These data suggest that many of the Mcm1&#x02013;DNA contacts and the mechanism of Mcm1-mediated DNA bending at a P&#x02019;Q element are similar to a P-PAL element. In contrast, the <italic>mcm1</italic> bending mutants and the T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G mutation have markedly altered effects when Mcm1 is bound in complex with &#x003b1;1. The mutants do not show significant decreases in DNA-bending in complex with &#x003b1;1. In fact, the T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G mutation caused an increase in the apparent DNA bending angle mediated by the Mcm1&#x02013;&#x003b1;1 complex. The crystal structure of the Mcm1&#x02013;&#x003b1;2 proteins bound to DNA show a complex DNA bend that does not lie in a single plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c13">13</xref>). It is possible the Mcm1&#x02013;&#x003b1;1 proteins also bend the DNA in multiple planes. One model for the altered bending phenotypes seen with Mcm1&#x02013;&#x003b1;1 compared with Mcm1 alone is that the &#x003b1;1 protein induces a DNA bend in a distinct plane relative to the Mcm1 protein on its own. The bending data provided does not differentiate multiple planes within a DNA bend. However, these data suggest the Mcm1&#x02013;&#x003b1;1 mediated DNA bend has a distinct architecture and that cofactor interaction can markedly alter the DNA bend induced by a MADS-box protein.</p><p>Our data suggest the degree of the DNA-bend mediated by Mcm1&#x02013;&#x003b1;1 is important for full transcriptional activation. The P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G site showed greater than a 4-fold decrease in the level of transcriptional activation compared with a wild-type site, which may in part be due to the defect in DNA bending. It is unlikely the decrease in activation was due to binding defects because the relative binding affinities of Mcm1 for these sites differed &#x0003c;1.5-fold (data not shown). Interestingly, the <italic>mcm1</italic>-V34A mutant, which showed roughly wild-type levels of DNA bending at the P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G site (98&#x000b0;), also activated the P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G reporter significantly better than the wild-type or S37A proteins, which both caused hyper-bending of the mutant site. These data suggest that the restoration of the appropriate DNA-bend angle by V34A at a P&#x02019;Q-T<sub>&#x02013;7</sub>G site results in partial suppression of the transcriptional defect, suggesting there may be a correlation between the proper bend angle with transcriptional activation.</p><p>To understand requirements for cofactor interaction we wanted to determine if bending by the Mcm1&#x02013;DNA binary complex would alter the ability of &#x003b1;1 to bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c18">18</xref>). Our data suggest there is no significant correlation between the degree of bending of the Mcm1&#x02013;DNA complex and the ability to interact with &#x003b1;1. The V34A, S37A, K40A and T66A mutants, along with the V34A, S37A double mutant, which all showed significant decreases in Mcm1-mediated DNA bending when bound alone, did not show a correlating defect in their ability to interact with &#x003b1;1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. One exception is the T66E mutation, which caused both a decrease in Mcm1-mediated DNA bending as well as a defect in interaction with &#x003b1;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c18">18</xref>). The crystal structure of Mcm1 bound to DNA shows the T66 residue is the sole DNA contact from the &#x003b2;-sheet layer in the protein and is positioned directly above V34 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh560f8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c13">13</xref>). The T66E mutation introduces a negative charge that would likely repel the DNA in a fully bent form, resulting in a bending defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c18">18</xref>). However, the S73 residue, which is positioned in the same &#x003b2;-sheet layer as T66 and is important for interaction with &#x003b1;1, has approximately wild-type levels of DNA bending. The mutation S73R also causes a defect in interaction with &#x003b1;1, suggesting the &#x003b2;-strand may be involved in a direct interaction with the cofactor &#x003b1;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c26">26</xref>). These findings suggest that proper DNA bending is not required for Mcm1 to interact with the &#x003b1;1 cofactor.</p><p>Protein-mediated DNA bending has been implicated in several cases to be involved in transcriptional regulation: including, Sox2, the &#x003b1; estrogen receptor, and Reb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh560c30">30</xref>). Therefore, establishment of the correct DNA architecture may be critical for proper transcriptional regulation of many genes. The data presented in this work reveals a novel mechanism by which a MADS-box transcription factor can achieve transcriptional activation. Our results demonstrate that interactions by &#x003b1;1 with Mcm1 facilitate the protein-mediated DNA bend and the bend directly correlates with an increase in transcriptional activation. The results also demonstrate that Mcm1 can establish DNA-bends through different mechanisms, one when the Mcm1 protein is bound to the DNA alone and the other when in complex with the cofactor &#x003b1;1. The proper DNA bend by Mcm1 on its own or in complex with &#x003b1;1 may be necessary for the transcriptional co-activators to associate with Mcm1 or serve as scaffolding for the basal transcription machinery.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh560f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> A comparison of the consensus P-element to <italic>STE3</italic> P&#x02019;Q.
