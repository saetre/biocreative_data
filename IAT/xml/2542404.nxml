It has been reported that a mid-oogenesis checkpoint monitors the integrity of pre-vitellogenic egg chambers, and that activation of this checkpoint results in the removal of abnormal egg chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A Tunnel assay was performed, which revealed that in <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1 </sup>ovaries at 144 h AE, prior to vitellogenesis, a 6-fold increase of ovariols containing apoptotic egg chambers was observed, compared to wt ovaries (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

Since patterning defects can arise from aberrant actin fiber formation within the nurse cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we analyzed actin formation during cytoplasmic dumping. In stage 10 wt egg chambers, an elaborate network of F-actin bundles is assembled inside the nurse cells which is a prelude to cytoplasmic dumping. These bundles anchor the nurse cell nuclei to prevent them from entering the oocyte when the remaining nurse cell material is actively squeezed into the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Assembly of this F-actin network requires the Quail protein, which colocalizes with the F-actin fibers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1 </sup>egg chambers, assembly of the cytoplasmic F-actin fibers was disrupted, and the Quail protein failed to associate with the F-actin bundles and remained diffuse throughout the nurse cell cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). As a result of aberrant F-actin assembly, nurse cell nuclei were trapped inside ring canals during dumping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Interestingly, we also found oocyte nuclei that were encapsulated by bundles of actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Furthermore, large actin fibers were assembled at the cortical membrane of the oocyte, and the follicular epithelium of the oocytes was frequently disorganized (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H&#x02013;I</xref>).

Because aberrant apical localization of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>at the follicle cell membranes coincides with impaired oocyte cortex integrity and abnormal F-actin organization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>), this suggests that altered PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>signaling could underlie the F-actin defects in <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1 </sup>egg chambers.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>localization and expression is affected in <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1</sup></bold>. We overexpressed a PLC&#x003b4;-PH-GFP fusion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] under the control of a ubiquitously expressed Act5C-GAL4 driver to analyze PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>localization and expression in a wt (A,B,E,G) and <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1 </sup>(C,D,F,H) background. (A,B) During wt oogenesis, the PLC&#x003b4;-PH-GFP fusion protein is present at the border cells (asterisk) and the apical membranes of the follicle cells that encapsulate the oocyte compartment, while the nurse cell membranes do not accumulate the fusion protein. (C,D) In <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1 </sup>egg chambers, the PLC&#x003b4;-PH-GFP fusion protein is not present at the apical membranes of the follicle cells that encapsulate the oocyte (arrowheads) and large patches of follicle cells are not labeled (dashed lines). In mutant ovaries, the follicular epithelium is sometimes disrupted (arrows in C), and the nurse cell membranes accumulate patches of high levels of the PLC&#x003b4;-PH-GFP fusion protein (arrow in D). The PLC&#x003b4;-PH-GFP fusion protein was also frequently detected at membranes of cells that are (based on their localization) most likely border cells (boxed arrowhead in D). (E-H) For further analysis, F-actin organization was analyzed in combination with localization of the PLC&#x003b4;-PH-GFP fusion protein. (Ea-Ec) In wt egg chambers, the oocyte cortex is in close contact with the apical membranes of the follicle cells, which accumulate the PLC&#x003b4;-PH-GFP fusion protein. (F) In <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1 </sup>egg chambers, the oocyte cortex is disrupted (arrowheads in Fa) and the follicle cells do not accumulate the PLC&#x003b4;-PH-GFP fusion protein (arrowheads and dashed lines in Fb). Arrows point to defects in cell organization of the follicular epithelium. (G) Higher magnification of a wt egg chamber, showing that the PLC&#x003b4;-PH-GFP fusion protein accumulates at the apical membranes of follicle cells in close contact with the oocyte cortex (boxed arrowheads). (H) Higher magnification of a <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1 </sup>egg chamber, showing that the apical membranes of follicle cells in close contact with the oocyte cortex do not accumulate the PLC&#x003b4;-PH-GFP fusion protein (arrowheads in Ha). This coincides with impaired oocyte cortex morphology and aberrant F-actin nucleation (arrow in Hb). DAPI was used to visualize DNA.

Abnormal cytoskeletal organization in <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1 </sup>disrupts the overall shape of all membranous structures and the organization of the cells during morphogenesis. Disorganized tissue integrity could affect Notch and Grk localization and possibly signaling, which is required for specification of the follicle cells that pattern the eggshell, and causes severe chorion patterning defects.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>dPPCS </italic>is required for patterning of various tissues</title><p>Next, we wondered whether dPPCS is also required for morphogenesis of other tissues. Hereto, we closely investigated <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1 </sup>flies for other morphological abnormalities. A stereotypical pattern of four scutellars exists on the dorsal surface of the wt scutellum, and <italic>dPPCS </italic>mutants displayed ectopic formation of scutellars (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1 </sup>flies also developed ectopic wing veins (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Mutants initiated longitudinal vein formation between L3&#x02013;L4 and L4&#x02013;L5. These results show that <italic>dPPCS </italic>is required for morphogenesis of various tissues during <italic>Drosophila </italic>development.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutations in <italic>de novo </italic>CoA synthesis disrupt morphogenesis</title><p>Next, we investigated whether mutations in other CoA biosynthesis enzymes give rise to similar defects. Indeed, mutations in <italic>dPANK/fumble </italic>and the bifunctional enzyme <italic>dPPAT-DPCK </italic>result in similar characteristics compared to the <italic>dPPCS </italic>mutant phenotype. <italic>dPANK/fumble </italic>and <italic>dPPAT-DPCK </italic>mutant females have poorly developed ovaries, have fecundity defects, produce eggs that exhibit polarity defects, synthesize abnormal neutral lipids (droplets), and these mutants display scutellar and wing vein patterning defects (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). As in <italic>dPPCS</italic><sup>1/1</sup>, a mutation in <italic>dPPAT-DPCK </italic>disrupts actin localization and results in plugging of the ring canals by nurse cell nuclei during dumping (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). <italic>dPANK/fumble </italic>mutants produce small ball-shaped eggs, which are typically due to a loss of actin regulatory elements that control the polarized arrangement of F-actin fibers at the basal cortex of follicle cells required to establish planar cell polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These findings imply that impaired CoA synthesis in general disrupts morphogenesis, possibly due to aberrant F-actin organization. Because the biosynthesis route towards the production of CoA is conserved amongst species it would be interesting to explore the significance of CoA during processes that involve actin/PtdIns dynamics such as chemotaxis, axon growth cone guidance, endocytosis/exocytosis, cell division or actin dependent chromatin remodeling.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FB, AR and OCMS conceived and designed the experiments.
