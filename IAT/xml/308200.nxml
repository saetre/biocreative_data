In vitro, the protein shows efficient structure-specific binding of Holliday junctions, yet the rate of junction resolution is remarkably low. We have mapped the sites of cleavage on a synthetic junction through which a crossover can branch migrate through 26 bp and find that &#x0003e; or = 90% of the junctions were cleaved at one site. This observation of sequence-specific cleavage suggests that inefficient resolution may be due to DNA binding events which occur away from the cleavage site and are therefore non-productive. Holliday junction resolution by RuvC protein can be stimulated by a number of factors including: (i) the presence of Mn2+ (rather than Mg2+) as the divalent metal cofactor, (ii) alkaline pH (&#x0003c; or = 10), and (iii) elevated temperature. These observations may indicate that other proteins are required for efficient RuvC-mediated resolution.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0066-a" xlink:role="2491"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0067-a" xlink:role="2492"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0068-a" xlink:role="2493"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0070-a" xlink:role="2495"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2490"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2491"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2492"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2493"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2494"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0070.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2495"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2496"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2497"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
