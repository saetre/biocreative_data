Previous work has demonstrated skeletal muscle defects in dystonin-deficient <italic>dystonia musculorum</italic> (<italic>dt</italic>) mice. In this study, we show that the dystonin muscle isoform is localized at the Z-disc, the H zone, the sarcolemma and intercalated discs in cardiac tissue. Based on this localization pattern, we tested whether dystonin-deficiency leads to structural defects in cardiac muscle. Desmin intermediate filament, microfilament, and microtubule subcellular organization appeared normal in <italic>dt</italic> hearts. Nevertheless, increased transcript levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF, 66&#x00025;) &#x003b2;-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC, 95&#x00025;) and decreased levels of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump isoform 2A (SERCA2a, 26&#x00025;), all signs of cardiac muscle stress, were noted in <italic>dt</italic> hearts. Hearts from two-week old <italic>dt</italic> mice were assessed for the presence of morphological and histological alterations. Heart to body weight ratios as well as left ventricular wall thickness and left chamber volume measurements were similar between <italic>dt</italic> and wild-type control mice. Hearts from <italic>dt</italic> mice also displayed no signs of fibrosis or calcification. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the intricate structure of the sarcomere by situating dystonin in cardiac muscle fibers and suggest that dystonin does not significantly influence the structural organization of cardiac muscle fibers during early postnatal development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plakin crosslinking proteins such as dystonin and plectin have been implicated in regulating the cytoskeletal organization and function of muscle (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Sonnenberg1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Boyer1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>).

Furthermore, the <italic>dt<sup>Tg4</sup></italic> skeletal muscles are weak and fragile. These skeletal muscle defects likely contribute to the limb incoordination phenotype displayed by these mice. Dystonin appears to play a more critical role in maintaining the stability of the cytoarchitecture in skeletal muscle fibers, rather than in the establishment of the cytoskeletal networks during muscle formation and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Dalp1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Given the apparent function of dystonin in skeletal muscle cells, it is reasonable to expect that this crosslinking protein would have a key function in maintaining the structural integrity of cardiac tissue. In the present study, we show using a muscle isoform-specific dystonin antibody, that dystonin is localized at the Z-disc and H zone in cardiac muscle. We assessed the expression of genes routinely used as early indicators of cardiac myopathy, particularly cardiac hypertrophy and show that the expression profile of these markers in dystonin-deficient in comparison to wt hearts is suggestive of early signs of cardiac myopathy. However, our analysis did not reveal any morphological defects in early development which may be attributed in part to the young age of the animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The mice were cared for according to the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) guidelines.

In addition, our findings demonstrate that dystonin-b is found at the sarcolemma and intercalated discs in mouse cardiac muscle. Intercalated discs are composed of other plakin family members such as plectin and desmoplakin. The requirement for multiple cytolinker proteins at this cardiac muscle adhesion structure likely reflects the greater need for structural support to resist the effects of chronic mechanical stress. Three N-terminal variants of dystonin-b isoforms, namely isoforms b1, b2 and b3 are expressed in cardiac tissue (Boyer and Boudreau-Larivi&#x000e8;re, unpublished<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Jefferson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>) though their individual distribution in cardiac muscle fibers is not presently known.

It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that the dystonin signals detected near Z-discs, the H zone, intercalated discs and the sarcolemma may correspond to distinct N-terminal variants of the dystonin-b isoforms. Plectin isoforms harboring unique sequences within the N-terminal region accumulate preferentially within specific regions of the muscle fiber including the Z-disc (plectin 1d), the costameres (plectin 1/1f), and in close proximity to mitochondria (plectin 1b) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Konieczny1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Rezniczek1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Winter1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our protein analyses reveal that desmin, actin and &#x003b1;-tubulin protein levels are largely unaltered in <italic>dt</italic> samples, and that the absence of dystonin in cardiac tissue has little effect on the subcellular localization of the primary cytoskeletal elements in tissues from two-week old animals. Although, it was difficult to obtain high-resolution immunofluorescence images of microtubules, the tubulin staining pattern observed was very similar between wt and <italic>dt</italic> samples. Taken together with the unchanged tubulin protein levels, we conclude that the microtubule network is likely not perturbed in dystonin-deficient cardiac muscle. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the composition of microtubules, for instance changes in acetylated or glutamylated tubulin may be occurring in dystonin-deficient cardiac muscle. Both wt and <italic>dt</italic> samples displayed well defined striations corresponding to either actin microfilaments or desmin intermediate filaments.

In <italic>dt</italic> hearts, plectin mRNA expression (and likely protein levels) remains relatively stable and appears to be sufficient to preserve desmin myocardial structure. It is therefore possible that other intermediate filaments present in cardiac muscle including synemin, paranemin, and cytokeratins, could be the primary intermediate filaments associated with dystonin-b.

The mild increase in desmoplakin expression in <italic>dt</italic> hearts may signal an attempt by cardiac muscle fibers to compensate for the lack of dystonin. This may explain why intercalated discs are intact in dystonin-deficient hearts. More specifically, our immunolocalization data would suggest that despite being present at intercalated discs, dystonin is not likely a key stabilizer of these structures given that desmoplakin and connexion-43 staining appear largely unaltered in dystonin-deficient hearts. A MACF isoform has been shown to harbor a putative IFBD in the center of the protein similar to that described for dystonin-b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Lin1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. If abundantly expressed in heart muscle, this MACF isoform may meet all the structural criteria needed to compensate for the absence of dystonin, however, the results indicate a moderate decrease in MACF expression in <italic>dt</italic> hearts at least at the mRNA level. Taken together, we predict that desmoplakin may be the primary desmin IFs stabilizer at intercalated discs and that plectin is the primary desmin organizer within the sarcomere. The precise architectural functions of dystonin and MACF muscle isoforms remains to be clearly defined.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title><italic>dt</italic> Mice Display Signs of Cardiomyopathy at the Molecular Level but Not at the Histological and Morphological Levels</title><p>Although our findings reveal no overt morphological indicators of cardiac hypertrophy in <italic>dt</italic> hearts from 2-week old mice, our gene expression analysis of ANF (upregulated), BNF (unchanged) and SERCA2a (downregulated) would suggest mild cardiac stress in <italic>dt</italic> hearts from young animals. For instance, in cases of severe cardiomyopathy such as heart failure, ANF levels are usually up-regulated 5&#x02013;10 times in diseased hearts compared to controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Holtwick1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Franch1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, a 2.2 fold increase in ANF expression was observed in <italic>dt</italic> hearts. In comparison,we detected a 20 fold increase in &#x003b2;-myosin heavy chain mRNA levels representing an up-regulation that is well over that observed in rodent models of cardiac hypertrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Depre1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One possible source of the stress can be linked to a weakened diaphragm muscle. Diaphragm muscles from <italic>dt</italic> mice generate less force, fatigue quicker and are more susceptible to mechanically-induced stress compared to wt diaphragm muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Dalp1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the importance of this muscle in breathing, a compromised diaphragm muscle in <italic>dt</italic> mice could result in inefficient oxygen intake leading to compensatory mechanisms from the cardiovascular system to maintain suitable oxygen saturation levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Why Do <italic>dt</italic> Mice Die before the Age of Weaning?</title><p><italic>Dystonia musculorum</italic> mice die before the age of weaning of unknown causes. It is unlikely that premature death of <italic>dt</italic> mice can be attributed to an intrinsic cardiomyopathy because this investigation revealed that <italic>dt</italic> hearts do not display overt signs of morphological or histological cardiac defects. Furthermore, according to the immunofluorescence experiments, the distribution of the primary cytoskeletal networks remains relatively intact when dystonin is absent. A plausible reason for the premature death of the <italic>dt</italic> mice could therefore be related to a compromised diaphragm muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Dalp1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> that would hinder the breathing capacities of <italic>dt</italic> mice.</p><p>It is not known if the lack of one dystonin isoform in particular is responsible for the <italic>dt</italic> condition or if the absence of multiple isoforms is the underlying cause. Determination of the dystonin variant that is responsible for the disease may help us identify the precise cause of death in these mice. Rescue studies as well as tissue and isoform specific conditional knock-out experiments like the ones performed for plectin isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Konieczny1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Winter1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> have been proposed to investigate whether one or multiple isoforms are responsible for the <italic>dt</italic> disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009465-Young1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Additional studies targeting specific tissues, such as muscle, in which dystonin is expressed, are needed to further elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the <italic>dt</italic> disease. For instance, cardiac muscle-specific dystonin knockout mice would be useful to investigate whether they would develop overt morphological defects of the heart with age or whether the absence of dystonin correlates with compromised exercise capacity.</p><p>In summary, we reveal that dystonin-b isoforms localize at the Z-disc, within the H zone and the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes as well at intercalated discs of cardiac tissue. Our results show that dystonin-deficiency does not lead to overt cardiac defects at least in young mice. However, the expression profile of the hypertrophic markers in <italic>dt</italic> hearts is an early indicator of cardiac stress that may be related to extrinsic factors. Whether dystonin-deficiency leads to an intrinsic cardiac muscle defect in the long term is for the moment, not known.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009465.s001"><label>Supplemental information S1</label><caption><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0009465.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009465.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Desmin, &#x003b1;-tubulin and actin protein levels in hearts from P14 wt and dt mice as determined by western blot analysis.
