We investigated the role of inflammation in flow-mediated vascular remodeling using a murine model of partial outflow reduction without flow cessation or neointima formation. Common carotid arteries decreased in size after ipsilateral external carotid artery ligation in wild-type mice, but not in myeloid differentiation protein-88 (MyD88)&#x02013;deficient mice. Inward remodeling was associated with MyD88-dependent and superoxide-initiated cytokine and chemokine production, as well as transient adventitial macrophage accumulation and activation. Macrophage depletion prevented flow-mediated inward vascular remodeling. Expression of MyD88 by intrinsic vascular cells was necessary for cytokine and chemokine production and changes in vessel size, whereas MyD88 expression by bone marrow&#x02013;derived cells was obligatory for changes in vessel size. We conclude that there are at least two distinct roles for MyD88 in flow-mediated inward remodeling of conduit arteries. Our findings suggest that inflammation is necessary for vascular adaptation to changes in hemodynamic forces.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: &#x003b1;-SMA, &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin; Cav, caveolin; DHE, dihydroethidium; EC, endothelial cell; EEL, external elastic lamina; ICE, IL-1&#x003b2; converting enzyme; IP-10, IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced protein of 10 kD; Mig, monokine induced by &#x003b3;-IFN; MyD88, myeloid differentiation protein-88; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; q, quantitative; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SMC, smooth muscle cell; SOD, superoxide dismutase; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRIF, TIR domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-&#x003b2;; TXN, thioredoxin; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>The regulation of blood vessel size is closely coordinated to changes in blood flow. Initial variations in blood flow elicit reversible vasomotor responses, whereas sustained alterations in hemodynamic forces result in permanent structural changes affecting vessel external diameter and/or vessel wall thickness that are described as vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). These adaptive changes in vessel size and medial thickness serve to normalize abnormal vascular stresses initiated by developmental or physiological perturbations of hemodynamic forces. For example, increases in blood flow and shear stress after construction of an arteriovenous fistula induce outward remodeling, whereas decreases in blood flow and shear stress caused by ligation of arterial branches result in inward remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Vascular remodeling is integral to the development of the vasculature and the progression of arterial disease. Attenuated flow in the embryo leads to defective vascular growth that compromises viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), and inward remodeling of arteries distal to flow-limiting occlusive lesions results in luminal loss that further exacerbates tissue ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>The endothelium is responsible for the detection of shear stress and plays an essential role in flow-mediated vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Physical perturbation of various &#x0201c;mechanoreceptors&#x0201d; trigger a network of intracellular signaling pathways, collectively termed mechanotransduction, which activate several transcription factors, notably NF-&#x003ba;B, that regulate the expression of mechanosensitive genes and ultimately lead to vessel wall remodeling through cellular and extracellular matrix reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite, plays a central role in mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). The predominant sources of superoxide in vascular cells are NADPH oxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), whereas less significant amounts of superoxide are produced by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), xanthine oxidase, cytochrome P450, and cyclooxygenase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). An additional major source of superoxide is the mitochondrial electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), and cross talk between mitochondrial ROS and NADPH oxidases has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Besides endogenous vascular cell production of superoxide, infiltrating macrophages within the arterial wall may also represent a source of ROS which can diffuse into the extracellular matrix and activate matrix metalloproteinases that are essential for vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Superoxide anion may directly signal or may be converted to other ROS; the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) leads to conversion to hydrogen peroxide or combination with nitric oxide forms peroxynitrite. These ROS may act as second messengers and modulate mechanotransduction signaling and gene transcription. Indeed, NADPH oxidases are required for outward vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), and mitochondrial ROS is necessary for flow-mediated vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>In addition to direct effects on vascular tissues, ROS may promote recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes. For example, alterations in shear stress can lead to ROS-dependent NF-&#x003ba;B activation in endothelial cells (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). The activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, in turn, contributes to production of chemokines and cytokines by vascular cells that lead to the recruitment and activation of leukocytes within the artery wall. Vascular inflammation caused by microbial infection is also ROS dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Endogenous vascular-derived factors, such as IL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), and exogenous pathogen-derived molecules are recognized by cells via surface IL-1Rs and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), respectively. Both the IL-1R (as well as the IL-18R) and most TLRs share a common signaling adaptor, myeloid differentiation protein-88 (MyD88), which induces activation of NF-&#x003ba;B through intermediary kinases and production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). The exceptions are TLR3, which signals exclusively through TIR domain&#x02013;containing adaptor-inducing IFN-&#x003b2; (TRIF), and TLR4, which signals through both MyD88 and TRIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). MyD88 may also influence other cytokine responses, e.g., by contributing to the stability of certain mRNAs encoding proinflammatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>).</p><p>The accumulation of activated leukocytes within the intima is recognized as a key pathogenetic process in atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Infiltrating monocytes differentiate into macrophages that promote plaque progression and remodeling by sustaining inflammation, oxidative stress, and matrix turnover. In contrast to atherosclerotic changes, flow-mediated remodeling of conduit arteries in the absence of disease is not thought to be dependent on inflammatory responses. Suggestive evidence to the contrary is that TLR4 is necessary for outward remodeling of murine common carotid arteries after complete ligation of the contralateral vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Nonetheless, inflammation is not reported in this context, and TLR4 is not required for inward remodeling of common carotid arteries after ligation of the ipsilateral external and internal carotid arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Interestingly, endothelial expression of proinflammatory molecules and leukocytic infiltrates have been noted in rabbit and mouse models with marked flow reduction in the common carotid artery caused by prevention of outflow from both internal and external carotid arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). However, neointima also develops in these very low-flow models in rodents, and it is difficult to distinguish physiological adaptations from pathological remodeling. Similar caveats apply to complete arterial ligation models with an absence of blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), in which coagulation and platelet activation may further confound the interpretation of mechanisms for vascular remodeling in response to hemodynamic forces.</p><p>Here, we show that vascular inflammatory responses and macrophage function requiring MyD88 are necessary for flow-mediated, superoxide-dependent inward remodeling of common carotid arteries after partial outflow obstruction using an established murine model with proportional vessel shrinkage, but without flow cessation or neointima formation. Our new observations suggest that inflammatory responses may be central to vascular remodeling even in the absence of overt injury.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>MyD88 is necessary for flow-mediated inward vascular remodeling</title><p>Because MyD88 is central to many innate immune responses, we first compared adaptive vascular remodeling in response to reduced blood flow in WT versus MyD88-deficient (MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice by measuring common carotid artery size and wall thickness after ipsilateral external carotid artery ligation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Surgical occlusion of the branch vessel resulted in sustained 40&#x02013;50% reduction in blood flow within the parent vessel in both strains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>). As previously reported for WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), the left common carotid artery decreased 10&#x02013;15% in external diameter without changes in medial thickness compared with the unmanipulated right vessel after 2 wk (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, c and d</xref>). The remodeling changes occurred primarily between 3 and 7 d after the operation (Fig. S1 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081298/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081298/DC1</ext-link>). Strikingly, common carotid arteries in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not inwardly remodel, but responded instead by medial thickening at 2 wk (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, c and d</xref>).

Medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were lost largely from the outer lamella of left common carotid arteries in WT mice, such that two rather than three medial lamellar units were apparent for much of the vessel circumference. The medial atrophy was characterized by decreased immunoreactivity for &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA). However, because of the reduction in the size of the medial compartment, the numbers of SMCs per unit volume (i.e., cell density) was basically unchanged.

Maladaptive vascular remodeling was not secondary to an immunodeficient state because inward remodeling occurred in recombination-activating gene (RAG)1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and Trif<sup>Lps2</sup> mutant mice with defects in adaptive immunity or TLR3 and TLR4 signaling, respectively, albeit with modest medial thickening in the latter strain (Fig. S3 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081298/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081298/DC1</ext-link>). Although the common carotid arteries were smaller in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared with WT mice, there was a comparable difference in body size (Fig. S3 b). Furthermore, vessels from older and larger MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also failed to inwardly remodel, but displayed medial thickening in response to flow reduction (Fig. S3 c). Finally, thrombus, which may modulate vascular remodeling responses, was not noted in any artery specimen on macroscopic examination or in the ligated left external carotid artery on microscopic examination (Fig. S3 d).</p></sec><sec><title>Flow reduction is associated with cytokine production within the vessel wall</title><p>Having established that flow-mediated vascular remodeling is dependent on MyD88, a well-characterized signal transducer for innate immune responses, we next investigated whether vascular inflammatory responses were induced by decreased blood flow. Quantification of transcript expression within common carotid arteries revealed that several cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced protein of 10 kD (IP-10, also known as CXCL10), and monokine induced by &#x003b3;-IFN (Mig, also known as CXCL9), were rapidly induced by 6 h after outflow reduction, whereas other inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-&#x003b1; and inducible (i)NOS, peaked later at 3 d after external carotid artery ligation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>).

We established a method to measure superoxide activity in vivo using HPLC to detect oxidant-dependent products of the fluorogenic probe, dihydroethidium (DHE), which is described as the gold standard for ROS detection in cardiovascular studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). DHE was applied to the adventitia of common carotid arteries together with the superoxide generator menadione. The superoxide-dependent product 2-hydroxyethidium and the superoxide-independent product ethidium were detected in artery extracts after 6 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>). The presence of these oxidative products was dampened by tempol, which is an SOD mimetic agent. We then extended this method to our flow-mediated vascular remodeling studies. After topical application of DHE to both common carotid arteries and ligation of the left external carotid artery, 2-hydroxyethidium was only detected in vessel extracts from the ligated side and threefold more ethidium was detected from the ligated versus unligated sides at 6 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>). There was an associated increase of DHE in ligated (and menadione-treated) arteries of WT mice compared with control vessels (Fig. S4 b).

The lack of superoxide detection in both tempol-treated WT mice and in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was not caused by decreased vessel concentrations of DHE (Fig. S4 b).

Tempol inhibition of superoxide activity prevented the induction of IL-1&#x003b2; transcripts in common carotid arteries from the ligated side at 6 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 c</xref>). Similar results were achieved with a mitochondria-targeted form of the drug, mito-tempol as well as with rotenone, an inhibitor of superoxide generation from the respiratory chain. We also tested other potential sources of ROS. Administration of apocynin, widely used as a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, partially reduced the accumulation of IL-1&#x003b2; transcripts at 6 h. However, inhibition of xanthine oxidase with allopurinol or endothelial (e)NOS with L-NAME did not influence IL-1&#x003b2; production. As pharmacological approaches may have off-target effects, we also used genetic strategies to investigate the effects of superoxide. The expression of IL-1&#x003b2; was partially decreased after external carotid artery ligation in transgenic mice overexpressing SOD2, the mitochondrial isoform of SOD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 c</xref>).

Superoxide inhibition also resulted in variable and incomplete suppression of other proinflammatory factors induced at 6 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 d</xref>). Cumulatively, these data point to a key role of ROS in general, and superoxide in particular, in mediating the generation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by vessel wall cells in response to decreased flow in WT mice. Moreover, the inhibition of vascular inflammatory responses using rotenone in WT mice, SOD2 transgenic mice, and p47<sup>phox&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice prevented inward vascular remodeling and allowed for increased medial thickening after outflow reduction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 e</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Flow reduction is associated with transient perivascular leukocytic infiltrates</title><p>We then investigated if vascular production of cytokines and chemokines resulted in leukocyte recruitment. The temporal expression of transcripts for the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 and the macrophage marker F4/80 trailed those of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IP-10, and Mig, and coincided with those of TNF-&#x003b1; and iNOS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>).

Decreased arterial blood flow after partial outflow ligation leads to vessel shrinkage through nonredundant MyD88-dependent effects, viz. superoxide generation, vascular cytokine and chemokine production, and transient macrophage accumulation and activation. It is generally accepted that physiological flow-mediated vascular remodeling and pathological immune-mediated vascular remodeling are distinct processes. Instead, our work supports the concept that inflammation is necessary for adaptive vascular remodeling in response to hemodynamic forces.</p><p>The degree and kinetics of inward vascular remodeling, as well as the unchanged medial thickness with medial atrophy that we observe in WT mice, is similar to that of previous studies using the external carotid artery ligation technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). In this model, reversible vasoconstriction accounted for early arterial diameter changes up to 3 d after outflow reduction, whereas vasodilator-resistant structural changes were noted by day 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Coincident with the permanent medial remodeling, a loss of SMCs was documented together with an increased rate of cell death as measured by propidium iodide uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Our observation of cell loss primarily in the outermost medial lamellar unit of the ligated vessel is consistent with our hypothesis of vascular remodeling in response to adventitial inflammation. The contrasting phenotype of increased medial thickness and medial expansion after decreased blood flow in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is surprising. Outflow ligation should not increase blood pressure locally to account for unilateral medial expansion. Unchanged vessel size with medial thickening are also found after inhibition of superoxide or depletion of macrophages in our study, and similar findings have been reported in ligated arteries of eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, caveolin-1 (Cav1)<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and &#x003b2;1 integrin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with defective mechanotransduction function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Characterization of the medial hyperplasia in these latter strains demonstrated an increased rate of cellular proliferation as measured by 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Medial expansion may represent a form of dysregulated vascular remodeling to decreased shear stress when normal adaptation in vessel size is prevented. In contrast to adaptive remodeling, this maladaptive change occurs in the absence of MyD88 and involves the inner rather than the outer medial lamellar units. If it, too, is dependent on inflammation, a subject of future studies, this finding implies that the mechanisms underlying these processes are distinct as shown by the differential role of MyD88.</p><p>The time period during which active shrinkage of vessel size occurs from postoperative days 3&#x02013;7 coincides temporally with peak macrophage accumulation and monokine production. Furthermore, the inflammation resolves within a few days of permanent adaptations for abnormal shear stresses, i.e., by 14 d after external carotid artery ligation. The transient nature of the inflammatory responses may explain why they have been overlooked in previous studies of external carotid artery ligation. In models of more severe outflow obstruction caused by combined internal and external carotid artery ligation, persistent vascular inflammation is detected at 2 wk and is associated with neointima formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). The inflammatory changes and intimal expansion are even more pronounced in models of complete outflow obstruction after ligation of the common carotid artery that are associated with thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). These experimental models with very low flow or no flow are useful in reproducing conditions of diseased vessels, but provide limited insight into mechanisms of physiological vascular remodeling. We are uncertain whether our findings will apply to models of outward vascular remodeling of conduit arteries, as it has been previously documented that monocyte adhesion to the endothelium of common carotid arteries is induced by low, but not high, shear stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). In contrast, adventitial infiltration by macrophages has recently been noted after both increased and absent flow in smaller mouse mesenteric resistance arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>).</p><p>We detect SOD-inhibitable, superoxide-specific, and other oxidant-dependent products in common carotid arteries after ipsilateral external carotid artery ligation in WT, but not in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. A confounding variable in the interpretation of our HPLC results is that menadione treatment or outflow ligation is associated with an increased intracellular level of DHE probe in vascular cells after 6 h compared with untreated or unligated vessels. This may reflect the superoxide-dependent, NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated inflammatory responses of ECs spreading to underlying SMCs and manifesting as increased uptake or altered consumption of DHE. The mechanisms responsible for changes in intracellular DHE levels are currently under investigation. Similar caveats to the interpretation of this method of superoxide detection also apply to in vitro systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Despite these methodologic limitations, the absence of superoxide detection in the face of detectable DHE after systemic tempol treatment in WT mice or after outflow reduction in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is compelling. Our pharmacological and genetic studies suggest that both mitochondrial respiratory chain and NADPH oxidase sources of superoxide play at least partial roles in flow-induced vascular inflammation and remodeling. This is consistent with the view of mitochondria as signaling organelles in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) and previous observations of interactions between mitochondrial ROS and NADPH oxidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). An alternative interpretation of the results is that antioxidant strategies in mitochondrial versus cytosolic and membrane locations act as superoxide sinks and may inhibit ROS required for physiological signaling in remote cellular compartments. Prior studies have shown that shear stress increases NADPH oxidase activity in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>) and that superoxide activates endothelial NF-&#x003ba;B and induces monocyte adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). We extend these findings by demonstrating that superoxide generation in response to low shear stress is attenuated in the absence of MyD88, and that superoxide activity contributes to MyD88-dependent vascular inflammatory responses induced by reduced flow. Additionally, the observation of diminished cytokine production after external carotid artery ligation in mice with EC-specific overexpression of TXN2 suggests a primary role for the endothelium in flow-mediated, superoxide-dependent inflammatory responses.</p><p>The mechanisms linking endothelial mechanosensors to MyD88-dependent vascular inflammatory responses, as well as MyD88-dependent macrophage functions to structural vascular remodeling also remain unclear. MyD88-dependent signaling by TLRs, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-18 does not appear to be essential, although individual TLRs may have redundant roles or other TLRs than those we investigated may provide a mechanistic link. Caveolae and eNOS mechanotransduction may be of importance in this context, as our preliminary investigations demonstrate blunted cytokine production in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and eNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after external carotid artery ligation (unpublished data). Interestingly, MyD88 is known to be enriched in Cav1-associated lipid raft microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), and MyD88 activity is modulated by eNOS-dependent nitrosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). However, direct activation of MyD88 by endothelial mechanosensors, such as P2X4 ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) and platelet-EC adhesion molecule-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>) cannot be excluded. It is also possible that the MyD88-dependent effects we observe are not directly related to mechanotransduction signaling pathways, but rather to transcript instability in the absence of MyD88 expression, as described for IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;inducible molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), which could lead to an altered setpoint for vascular cells to shear stress&#x02013;initiated inflammatory responses.</p><p>Our observations regarding macrophage recruitment versus activation and accumulation are consistent with previous reports that MyD88 deficiency impairs monocyte activation and pathogen clearance, but not mononuclear cell trafficking, to sites of certain bacterial and spirochetal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Specifically, in a murine model of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection, the initial recruitment of macrophages was caused by MyD88-independent production of MCP-1. Similarly, MyD88-independent generation of chemokines, other than those we studied, or other chemotactic agonists, such as lipid chemoattractants, may have contributed to early monocyte recruitment in our model. Our results indicate that MyD88-dependent vascular inflammatory responses are necessary for macrophage activation, as indicated by iNOS synthesis, but not for initial leukocyte recruitment after outflow ligation. We cannot tell from the current experiments whether macrophage persistence depends on MyD88-dependent vascular inflammation or on MyD88-dependent macrophage activation. Macrophages are known to facilitate the remodeling of murine resistance arteries after deoxycorticosterone- or angiotensin-induced hypertension and vascular injury and after flow cessation in ligated mesenteric vessels through undefined mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Our ongoing investigations indicate that iNOS production by macrophages is not required for flow-mediated inward vascular remodeling (unpublished data). Other candidate macrophage-derived molecules that may be responsible for structural vascular reorganization include matrix metalloproteinase-9, which is required for extracellular matrix degradation in outward remodeling of mouse carotid arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), and coagulation factor XIII, which is a transglutaminase associated with extracellular matrix cross-linking during inward remodeling of mouse mesenteric arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that decreases in endothelial shear stress activate vascular stress responses that signal via cytokines and chemokines to elicit transient inflammation that is essential for inward vascular remodeling and the restoration of normal hemodynamic forces. MyD88 is a central mediator of this process with superoxide a key intermediary. Adventitial, unlike intimal, accumulation of macrophages may result in adaptive vascular responses without necessarily causing vascular disease. These physiological events may contribute to lumen loss and ischemia in obstructive arterial disease, which is the leading cause of death and disability. A homeostatic role for inflammation may also apply to the responses of other tissues to physical forces.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>We purchased C57BL/6, RAG1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, TLR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, IL-1R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and p47<sup>phox&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice from The Jackson Laboratory.
