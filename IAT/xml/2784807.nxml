The innate immune response, primarily consisting of milk macrophages and neutrophils (<bold>PMN</bold>), is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. The initial stages associated with innate immunity in the mammary gland are not well understood. Mammary epithelial cells (<bold>MEC</bold>) have immunological functions that contribute to the initial response to an intramammary infection (<bold>IMI</bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Researchers have used MEC lines or mammary tissue biopsies to study the immunological role of MEC through response to in vitro challenges with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] Microarray as well as quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (<bold>qPCR</bold>) technology could provide useful information on additional signals produced by MEC during an IMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p><italic>Streptococcus uberis </italic>(<bold><italic>S. uberis</italic></bold>) is a major environmental mastitis-causing pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Infections due to <italic>S. uberis </italic>are predominantly subclinical (ca. 95%) and are responsible for up to 16% and 33% of clinical cases per year in the United States and the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Subclinical mastitis is the dominant form of mastitis affecting cows and frequently goes undetected and untreated for extended periods of time, which can result in spreading to other cows and significant reductions in profitability due to losses of production and milk premiums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recently, Swanson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] examined the mammary tissue transcriptome via microarray technology of 5 Friesian heifers in mid-to-late lactation after IMI with a noncapsular strain of <italic>S. uberis </italic>(Strain 233). Genes involved with immune response were up-regulated and genes involved in lipid metabolism and cell death were down-regulated after IMI with <italic>S. uberis</italic>. The capsular strain O140J has been shown to be more resistant to PMN phagocytosis and more capable of establishing infection when compared to a noncapsular strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of <italic>S. uberis </italic>strain O140J are still unclear, thus, transcriptomic evaluation of mammary tissue gene expression after IMI with <italic>S. uberis </italic>O140J is clearly warranted. More importantly, identifying molecular pathways and gene networks affected by IMI with this strain would yield mechanistic information of the underlying tissue adaptations to infection.</p><p>The main objective of this study was to determine the most affected gene networks and pathways in mammary tissue in response to an IMI with <italic>S. uberis </italic>O140J. We hypothesized that IMI with <italic>S. uberis </italic>would up-regulate genes involved with immune response and alter expression of genes involved with milk synthesis and composition as well as tissue function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Indicators of clinical response to IMI challenge</title><p>All cows developed both local and systemic responses to IMI challenge. Details on local and systemic responses to IMI challenge with <italic>S. uberis </italic>are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Briefly, in response to IMI challenge, heart rate and body temperature were significantly elevated (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001), and there was a trend (<italic>P </italic>= 0.058) for increased respiration rate. All cows developed mastitis after IMI challenge with <italic>S. uberis</italic>. Clinical signs, such as flakes, watery, or yellow colored mammary secretions were observed after inoculation (i.e., between 24-36 h post-inoculation). Milk somatic cell count (<bold>SCC</bold>) from challenged quarters was increased (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001; 5.41 &#x000b1; 0.17 log<sub>10 </sub>cells/mL) by 20 h when compared to 0 h post-inoculation (3.9 &#x000b1; 0.17 log<sub>10 </sub>cells/mL). An overall increase (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) in growth of <italic>S. uberis </italic>was observed in inoculated quarters. By 12 h post-inoculation, <italic>S. uberis </italic>was recovered from all challenged quarters and shedding continued through 36 h post-inoculation similar to results of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Details on individual quarter SCC and shedding of <italic>S. uberis </italic>are shown in Figure S1 in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p><p>Based on previous work in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], as well as challenging 4 'test' cows prior to our experiment, peak clinical signs based on heart rate, respiration rate, milk secretion, shedding of <italic>S. uberis </italic>and, most importantly, increased SCC occurred between 24-36 h post-challenge. Therefore, biopsies were taken prior to peak clinical signs to be more confidient that the majority of gene expression data was attributed to MEC and not infiltrating neutrophils. Additionally, after biopsy (for details see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), tissue (&#x02265; 0.5 g) was blotted with sterile gauze to remove any visible milk secretions, and visible connective tissue was cut off and removed. The infiltration of immune cells was assessed via specific macrophage and neutrophil gene markers present on the bovine microarray (Figure S2 in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The data indicated an absence or a very slight increase in infiltration due to IMI by 20 h post-inoculation. Therefore, most of the responses in the present analysis must be attributed to MEC; however, resident macrophages constitute ca. 5% or more of the parenchyma tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and increased activity of those cells could be detectable via gene expression, particularly for genes with low inherent expression in MEC.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential expression of genes in <italic>S. uberis</italic>-infected quarters</title><p>A total of 2,102 oligonucleotides (1,808 annotated genes) were differentially expressed (<bold>DEG</bold>) in response to IMI infection (False Discovery Rate; <bold>FDR </bold><italic>P </italic>&#x02264; 0.06; unadjusted <italic>P </italic>&#x02264; 0.01) (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for data and statistics).

and chemokines, the GO molecular function analysis (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>) uncovered an increase in binding of genes encoding heat-shock proteins, NAD, and tetratricopeptide repeat (<bold>TPR</bold>) domain of a protein, the latter being important in the regulation of vasorelaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, analysis highlighted a decrease in genes encoding cofactor binding, particularly Mn and Se, a reduction of protein Ser/Thr phosphatase activity, reduction of oxidoreductase by NAD/NADP, an increase in long-chain fatty acid ligase activity but reduction of several processes related to acyl-carrier proteins.</p><p>The biological processes most enriched in GO (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>) indicated a marked effect on cell signaling, mostly related to apoptosis (e.g., caspase activation). The immune response, and associated metabolism (e.g., nitric oxide synthesis) and response to wounding, were the most affected and activated processes. Proliferation was highly increased in immune but also in endothelial cells. Protein metabolism also was highly activated, with protein transport being the most enriched process, particularly protein targeting which was increased. Interestingly, data indicated an increase in transport of proteins towards mitochondria. Data also suggested a marked increase in post-translational modification of proteins such as folding, methylation, and alkylation. The analysis indicated a sparing of the amino acid Ser, probably for protein synthesis, by inhibition of its catabolic utilization. Transcription was strongly activated, as well as post-transcriptional modification, while catabolism of DNA was inhibited. The transport of minerals, particularly di- and tri-valent cations (which include calcium and zinc), was largely increased. Fatty acid biosynthesis was evidently inhibited. Malate metabolism, both mitochondrial (for the TCA cycle) and cytosolic was highly-activated. There was also an inhibition of kinase activity. Lastly, as highlighted by IPA, the regulation of adhesion was highly activated.</p><p>The GO results for cellular components significantly affected during <italic>S. uberis </italic>infection (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>) revealed a strong morphological change of cells, mostly for the formation of filopodium, i.e. "microspikes" or cytoplasmic projections from migrating cells which play an important role in cell migration and wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Extrinsic component of membranes were increased in abundance with large effect on proteins present in the cytoplasm and organelles. Among those most enriched was the endoplasmic reticulum (<bold>ER</bold>), particularly the transport from nucleus to ER. Increased abundance also was evident for components of actin filaments, which agrees with the findings for cytoskeletal rearrangement reported above for GO and IPA. Interestingly, components of lysosomes and the Golgi were inhibited, as well as components of the vesicle membrane; whereas, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment components were induced. Components of the proteasome, involved in protein degradation, were also induced together with the MHC complex components. The increase in abundance of the phosphatase type 2A complex supports the increase in prostaglandin synthesis uncovered by IPA.</p><p>Overall, the analysis of DEG with &#x02265; 1.5-fold by IPA (Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S13">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S14">14</xref>) and GO (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>) provided results strikingly similar to the ones obtained using all DEG. This suggested that the functions found as significantly-enriched in the latter analysis included genes whose expression was highly affected. The GO analysis, however, allowed us to uncover a marked up-regulation in expression of genes for G-coupled receptors, cytokine and chemokine-mediated signaling, NF&#x003ba;B import into nucleus; whereas, down-regulated genes were associated with muscle development and organization. The significant enrichment of negative regulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of fatty acid metabolism via GO analysis also was noteworthy.

Glucocorticoid signaling (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>) and other pathways related to the latter, such as ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>), were highly enriched and were likely induced except ERK/MAPK signaling, which the detailed analysis did not indicate induction or inhibition. It was evident that most of the pathways represented within the DEG were inhibited. Pathways strongly inhibited were <italic>CDK5 Signaling </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), related to neuronal function, and <italic>IGF1 Signaling </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) related to proliferation and survival of cells.

Pathway analysis also revealed a decrease of <italic>Ceramide Signaling </italic>for apoptosis, which suggested that the significant response related to apoptosis uncovered by the functional analysis, was not related to ceramides. Interestingly, results showed that two signaling pathways related to lipid metabolism (<italic>LXR/RXR </italic>and <italic>PPAR&#x003b1;/RXR&#x003b1; Signaling</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>) were inhibited by IMI.</p><p>There were few significant metabolic pathways within the 2,102 DEG which we considered marginally significant (FDR &#x02264; 0.06; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Details of the pathways indicated a decrease in synthesis and oxidation/reduction of NADH and NADPH, an overall decrease of pyruvate metabolism, and an evident increase in utilization of pyruvate for the TCA cycle through formation of malate coupled with decrease of pyruvate utilization for other processes (e.g., lipid synthesis). Arginine and Pro metabolism also were affected. More detailed analysis of this pathway indicated a decreased utilization of Arg for catabolism and an increased utilization of this amino acid for protein synthesis. Similarly, there was evidence for increased utilization of Pro for other metabolic purposes besides synthesis of protein (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).</p><p>The top canonical pathways among DEG affected by &#x02265; 1.5-fold are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>. These included <italic>IL-10 Signaling</italic>, <italic>LXR/RXR Signaling</italic>, <italic>IL-6 Signaling</italic>, and <italic>Glucocorticoid Receptor Signaling</italic>. The majority of genes with &#x02265; 1.5-fold change within these pathways were up-regulated. All those pathways were related to immune response and lipid metabolism, with a general induction of immune-related pathways and inhibition of lipid-related ones. This apparently negative association between immune response and lipid metabolism is supported by the primary functions that were observed in IPA and GO when all DEG were considered (Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>). <italic>Interleukin-10 Signaling </italic>was the primary canonical pathway affected by IMI challenge with <italic>S. uberis </italic>among those genes with &#x0003e;1.5-fold change in expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>). The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (<italic>TREM1</italic>) belongs to the Immunoglobulin (Ig) family of cell surface receptors and is selectively expressed on blood PMN, monocytes and macrophages. TREM-1 lacks known signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic domain and thus activation by TREM-1 is mediated by a transmembrane adaptor molecule DNAX-activating protein 12 (DAP12), leading to proinflammatory immune responses.

Overall, the functional analysis uncovered that few functions were significantly affected, i.e. immune response was clearly the most affected and induced followed by cell proliferation/cycle/death and transport of protein and ions both of which were induced. In contrast, lipid metabolism was inhibited. Cell proliferation was seemingly or evidently induced in IPA analysis but GO analysis revealed that regulation of cell proliferation was not clearly towards induction, suggesting that the process of proliferation was probably increased for certain cells (e.g., immune and endothelial cells) but was not important for others. The overall picture from IPA and GO analyses captured the most affected functions but did not provide information of the potential mechanisms at play. The use of well-established pathways (i.e., canonical pathways) together with information about single genes provided additional means to unravel the mechanisms controlling the mammary response to IMI before peak clinical signs.</p></sec><sec><title>Top up-regulated DEG</title><p>Numerous cytokines involved in the immune response were significantly up-regulated in mammary tissue during IMI challenge with <italic>S. uberis</italic>. Genes coding for the cytokines <italic>TNF, IL6</italic>, and <italic>IL1B </italic>were among the top DEG (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Furthermore, among the list of all DEG (i.e., 2,102) there were several up-regulated DEG that belong to pro-inflammatory pathways including <italic>CD14</italic>, <italic>TRAF6</italic>, <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, <italic>NFKB2</italic>, and <italic>STAT3 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Functional analysis with GO and IPA clearly underscored the induction of inflammation as well as cytokine binding in mammary tissue from IMI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>). Other cytokines or cytokine receptors up-regulated during <italic>S. uberis </italic>IMI included <italic>IL18 </italic>and <italic>IL1R2 </italic>(verified via qPCR; Table S1). Interleukin-18 (IL-18) can induce interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) production from T cells and, in combination with IL-12, IL-18 can inhibit IL-4-dependent immunoglobulin (Ig) E and IgG1 production as well as activate IgG2a secretion by B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, microarray analysis indicated that expression of <italic>IL12 </italic>and <italic>IFNG </italic>was not significantly altered during IMI challenge with <italic>S. uberis </italic>and that <italic>IL4R </italic>expression increased (1.26-fold; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). This may indicate that the up-regulation of <italic>IL18 </italic>had minimal downstream affects on the innate immune response to <italic>S. uberis</italic>. Similar results were observed by Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] where <italic>IL18 </italic>expression, but not <italic>IFNG</italic>, was up-regulated in MEC after IMI challenge with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(<bold><italic>Staph. aureus</italic></bold>).</p><p>The chemokine <italic>IL8 </italic>had the greatest change in expression resulting in a fold-change of 1,054 in infected vs. control quarters (Table S1). The importance of this protein and its related functions was underscored by GO molecular function analysis both when the entire DEG or those with &#x0003e;1.5-fold were analyzed (Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>). This chemokine is induced upon stimulation of TNF or IL-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and serves as a primary chemoattractant during the innate immune response, thus, playing a major role in the chemotaxis of PMN. Therefore, it seems logical that the dramatic increase in <italic>IL8 </italic>expression would occur before peak clinical signs of mastitis. Swanson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] did not observe a significant change in <italic>IL8 </italic>expression in bovine mammary tissue after IMI with <italic>S. uberis </italic>(Strain 233); but increased <italic>IL8 </italic>mRNA expression has been reported in primary isolates of bovine MEC after challenge with <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>(<bold><italic>E. coli</italic></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. With regards to results of Swanson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], mammary tissue was collected between 60-132 hours post-inoculation when peak clinical signs already had occurred. In our study, mammary biopsies were performed prior to peak clinical response and prior to the major influx of PMN into the mammary gland (supported by gene markers analysis, Figure S2 in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), milk compositional changes and clinical signs of mastitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and our previous work using this dose and strain of <italic>S. uberis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The anti-inflammatory IL-10 and pro-inflammatory IL-6 pathways are activated before peak clinical signs</title><p><italic>Interleukin-10 Signaling </italic>was among the primary canonical pathways affected by IMI challenge with <italic>S. uberis </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, and Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>). The binding of the IL-1 cytokine family to the IL-1 receptor mediates the activity of <italic>TRAF6 </italic>(tumor necrosis receptor-associated factor 6; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>), leading to activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway that ultimately leads to increased transcription of <italic>IL10</italic>. Despite a significant down-regulation of p38 MAPK (i.e. <italic>MAPK12</italic>; -1.22-fold; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) during IMI, the observed 13.9-fold up-regulation of <italic>IL1B </italic>and 38.9-fold up-regulation of <italic>IL1R2 </italic>probably overcame that response and also might have been sufficient to account for the fact that JAK1 expression was down-regulated (-1.17-fold; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Interleukin-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that blocks NF-&#x003ba;B activity, which leads to suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as <italic>TNF, IL6</italic>, and <italic>IL1</italic>. Expression of 22 out of 25 putative components (71 total in IPA) of the IL-10 signaling pathway present in our microarray platform were moderately but significantly up-regulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Of interest was the mild up-regulation of <italic>STAT3 </italic>(ca. 3-fold; Table S1) which in turn is known to activate <italic>SOCS3 </italic>and activate IL-6-signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Despite the marked up-regulation of <italic>IL10</italic>, our results of pathway analysis were indicative of more pronounced inflammation and probably hampered IL-10 anti-inflammatory activity.</p><p><italic>Interleukin-6 Signaling </italic>was a major pathway affected by IMI challenge with <italic>S. uberis </italic>(Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Several genes overlap between <italic>IL-6 </italic>and <italic>IL-10 Signaling</italic>, including an up-regulation of <italic>TNF, IL1B, NFKBIA, STAT3, TRAF6</italic>, and <italic>FOS </italic>and down-regulation of <italic>MAPK12</italic>. Expression of <italic>IL6 </italic>occurs via the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. Interleukin-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is also involved in acute-phase protein signaling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The coordinated up-regulation of genes involved in both <italic>IL-6 </italic>and <italic>IL-10 Signaling </italic>during IMI with <italic>S. uberis </italic>is suggestive of an ability of the immune system to generate a pro-inflammatory response via the <italic>IL-6 Signaling Pathway </italic>while attempting to control the severity and duration of the inflammation via the anti-inflammatory <italic>IL-10 Signaling Pathway</italic>. By far, however, our data suggested that the pro-inflammatory response via <italic>IL6 </italic>and <italic>TNF </italic>overrode the anti-inflammatory response via <italic>IL10</italic>.</p><p>IL-6 also has been shown to have anti-inflammatory capabilities through inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In our study, however, the signaling pathway through TNF and IL-1 appeared largely activated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), with a more pronounced up-regulation of <italic>NFKBIA </italic>(in the pathways in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, I&#x003ba;B expression is determined by this gene, which is one of its components) than <italic>NFKB2 </italic>(this genes is a component of NF-&#x003ba;B), which suggested a potential inhibitory effect on the induction of survival genes via NFKB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and a control of inflammatory response. In the context of regulation of cell death/survival, it was evident that cell survival via enhanced growth and differentiation might have been inhibited due to IMI because the genes coding for phosphorylation enzymes in the ERK (extracellular-regulated kinase)/MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) signaling pathway, which is involved in control of a broad range of intracellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] were down-regulated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). These data suggested that signaling through phosphorylation (see also PI3K/AKT signaling; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>) was inhibited as a result of IMI. This latter finding was also observed by GO analysis (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>).</p><p>Our results regarding IL-6 and IL-10 support the work of Swanson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] who observed an up-regulation of the <italic>IL6 </italic>receptor (1.83-fold change) and <italic>IL10 </italic>receptor alpha (1.91-fold change) in bovine mammary tissue after <italic>S. uberis </italic>IMI. Similar to our data, Lutzow et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] after IMI challenge with <italic>Staph. aureus </italic>observed an up-regulation (via microarrays) of genes involved in both IL-6 and IL-10 signaling including <italic>IL1B, IL6, IL8, CD14, FOS</italic>, and <italic>NFKBIA</italic>. In our study, we isolated whey from all infected quarters and analyzed samples for concentrations of IL-10, IL-1&#x003b2;, and TNF at 0, 12, and 20 h (time of biopsy) post-inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. No significant changes in cytokine concentrations were observed by 20 h post-inoculation when compared to pre-infection levels (0 h). This may be attributed to the fact that the mammary biopsies were performed prior to peak clinical signs of mastitis in order to avoid tissue samples with elevated amounts of mRNA from infiltrating PMN. Unfortunately, the side effects of the biopsy procedure (e.g., blood clots) made it impossible to isolate whey from mammary secretions during peak clinical signs. However, Bannerman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] evaluated cytokine secretions in whey collected from mammary quarters challenged with <italic>S. uberis </italic>and observed elevated milk concentrations of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF, and IFN-&#x003b3; compared with healthy quarters by ~30 h post-challenge.</p></sec><sec><title>Toll-like receptor signaling</title><p>Bacteria contain pathogen-associated molecular patterns (<bold>PAMPs</bold>) motifs, such as LPS or lipoteichoic acid (<bold>LTA</bold>), that are potent stimulators of innate immunity.

The complement component C1q is the first step in the initiation of the classical pathway of the complement cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Researchers have not been able to quantify C1q concentrations in mastitic milk and primarily attribute this to its large size (900 kDa), which may render it impermeable to the mammary epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>No current information is available on the use of the lectin pathway in the mammary gland during an IMI. Researchers have concluded that the mammary gland must lack the classical pathway and therefore must rely primarily on the alternative pathway of the complement system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The initial step of the alternative pathway involves the cleavage of complement component 3 (<bold>C3</bold>) into fragments C3a and C3b. The expression of <italic>C3 </italic>(via microarray and qPCR) was significantly up-regulated (1.43-fold change) in mammary quarters infected with <italic>S. uberis </italic>and supports the work of Swanson et al.

C3 is also a downstream intermediate step involved with both the classical and alternative pathways of the complement system that ultimately leads to the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC complex), which consists of complement proteins C5a, C6, C7, C8, and C9. The membrane attack complex plays a role in the disruption of the bacteria cell walls during the immune response.</p><p>Two genes involved in inhibition of the complement cascade were significantly up-regulated in infected versus non-infected mammary quarters.

This binding accelerates their decay, disrupting the cleavage of C3 into C3b and C3a fragments, which leads to inhibition of the cascade and prevention of damage to host cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a significant up-regulation in expression of the <italic>C1QC </italic>gene from mammary quarters infected with <italic>S. uberis</italic>. Swanson et al.

Further research related to the classical pathway of the complement cascade in the mammary gland is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis</title><p>The overall functional analysis both in IPA and GO clearly indicated an induction of proliferation of several types of cells but in particular immune, endothelial, and muscle cells. In contrast, several significantly-enriched pathways related to proliferation/angiogenesis were strongly (e.g., IGF1 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and ephrin receptor in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) or likely inhibited (Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor signaling; Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>), with both the platelet-derived growth factor (<bold>PDGF</bold>) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways likely induced (see below).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Angiogenesis and inflammation: possible role of PDGF signaling and hypoxia</title><p>Platelet-derived growth factor (<bold>PDGF</bold>) refers to a family of dimeric isoforms that are important for growth, survival, and function especially in connective tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Four different PDGF chains have been identified, the classical PDGF-A and PDGF-B and the more recent PDGF-C and PDGF-D isoforms. These isoforms that occur as homodimers or heterodimers (PDGF-AA, AB, BB, CC and DD) exert their effects by differential binding to two receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Binding of PDGF induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase receptors. Depending on the PDGF isoform involved, homo or heterodimers of the receptor are formed. It is interesting that paracrine PDGF-B signaling has a role in blood vessel formation (i.e., angiogenesis) and it is a potent effector of epithelial cancer growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The likely induction of PDGF pathway in our study might partly explain the induction of biological processes such as positive regulation of cell proliferation and vasculature development (Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>). In fact, signaling through PDGF might have counteracted the marked inhibition of the Ephrin receptor signaling pathway (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), which also is a pro-angiogenic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>A key factor contributing to angiogenesis and aberrant cellular growth (e.g., epithelial tumors) is hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. As cells outgrow their blood supply or are deprived of oxygen, a transcriptional response to hypoxia is initiated. Although several transcription factor pathways seem to be involved, most attention has focused on hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (<italic>HIF1A</italic>), which was up-regulated with IMI (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). This is a heterodimer of two DNA binding proteins, HIF1A, and the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (<italic>HIF1B</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In normoxia, HIF1A is unstable and rapidly degrades via the proteasome, but as oxygen tension drops below 2% (e.g., air is &#x0003c;20%), HIF1A is stabilized, translocates to the nucleus and interacts with HIF1B. The heterodimer initiate a complex transcriptional program via specific hypoxia response elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In our experiment, we observed up-regulation of many hypoxia-responsive genes as seen in non-ruminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], e.g. <italic>HIF1A </italic>and several others involved in glucose metabolism/glycolysis (e.g., <italic>SLC2A3</italic>, <italic>GAPDH</italic>, <italic>LDHA</italic>), growth factors/cytokines (e.g., <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>IL8</italic>, <italic>PDGFB</italic>), oxygen transport and iron metabolism (e.g., <italic>HMOX1</italic>, <italic>LTF</italic>), as well as several other genes/transcription factors involved in wound healing and angiogenesis (e.g., <italic>FOS</italic>, <italic>JUNB</italic>) (Table S1; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). It is also interesting that both pyruvate and lactate originating from anaerobic glycolysis in tissues are angiogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In the context of our study, a greater uptake of glucose due to up-regulation of <italic>SLC2A3 </italic>coupled with a reduction in the need for TAG synthesis as well as lactose for secretion in milk (e.g., most lipogenic genes and <italic>LALBA </italic>were down-regulated) could have led to accumulation of pyruvate from glycolysis and might have played a role in promoting hypoxia. The accumulation of pyruvate seems to be supported also by the likely inhibition of pyruvate metabolism (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).</p><p>Despite up-regulation of <italic>HIF1A </italic>and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (<italic>AHR</italic>) due to IMI, our pathway analysis revealed that the two signaling pathways associated with response to hypoxia (Ephrin receptor and Aryl hydrocarbon receptor) were for the most part inhibited (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In the case of the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway, it seems likely that the marked increases in <italic>IL6 </italic>and activation of <italic>NFKBIA </italic>(Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) were the main causes for overall inhibition of the pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>The mystery of IGF1 signaling and inflammation</title><p>Insulin-like growth factor binding 1 (<bold>IGF1</bold>) is considered an anabolic hormone and plays a pivotal role in mammary development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and potentially in maintaining the epithelial cells during the declining phase of lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, there is no evidence of a role of IGF1 in lactating mammary tissue, at the least in bovine. In support of this, work from one of our laboratories has observed that IGF1 signaling is not among the significantly affected pathways in bovine mammary tissue during lactation and appeared to be inhibited (M. Bionaz, S. L. Rodriguez-Zas, R. E. Everts, H. A. Lewin, and J. J.

In the immune system, signaling via IGF1 is a crucial event resulting in postponement of apoptosis (increasing survival) of PMN through mediation of the PI3K signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. If that holds true in mammary after IMI, our data suggest that apoptosis of PMN was probably substantial at 20 h post inoculation. The functional analysis in IPA indicated that apoptosis was significantly affected, with a balance between induction and inhibition (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>) but overall this process was likely induced particularly in macrophages (Figure S2). Furthermore, as indicated by GO analysis (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>), apoptosis occurred through caspase activation (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge a direct inhibitory effect of inflammation on IGF1 signaling has not been reported; however, modulation of IGF signaling by glucocorticoids in muscle was previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This observation suggests a possible effect of corticoids prior to mammary tissue collection. However, plasma cortisol was not increased significantly in cows after IMI in the present experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In summary, the inhibition of IGF1 signaling might have played a role in decreased immune cell survival, particularly macrophages. A possible inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on this pathway cannot be excluded. The inhibition of IGF1 signaling after IMI in bovine mammary is a novel finding that still requires teleological explanation.</p></sec><sec><title>Lipid metabolism and immune response</title><sec><title>Integration of lipid metabolism and inflammation: possible role of LXR/RXR and PPAR signaling pathways</title><p>Both LXRs and PPARs are involved in the regulation of metabolic and inflammatory signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. <italic>PPARA </italic>is expressed in liver, brown adipose tissue, heart, and muscle tissue and plays a pivotal role in fatty acid catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]; whereas, PPAR-&#x003b3; (<italic>PPARG</italic>) is highly expressed in adipose tissue and macrophages and primarily regulates adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].

Interestingly, studies have also shown that <italic>TLR4 </italic>activation in macrophages inhibits LXR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and release of inflammatory mediators are fundamental to the diverse immune functions of macrophages, and the mammary gland possesses resident macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In addition to inducing genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport, LXR reciprocally represses a set of inflammatory genes after bacterial lipopolysacharide (<bold>LPS</bold>), TNF, or IL-1&#x003b2; stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Examples of such genes include those involved in generation of bioactive molecules such as NOS2A, IL-6, TNF, and IL-1&#x003b2;, the chemokines CCL2, and matrix metallopeptidases. We found that IMI resulted in marked up-regulation of <italic>IL6 </italic>(430-fold), <italic>TNF </italic>(45-fold), <italic>IL1B </italic>(14-fold), and <italic>CCL2 </italic>(3.3-fold) and moderate but significant up-regulation of <italic>NOS2A </italic>(1.2-fold) and <italic>MMP7 </italic>(1.4-fold; Table S1 and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). As previously stated, most of the responses in the present study are likely attributed to MEC and potentially resident macrophages, which constitute ca. 5% or more of the parenchyma tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is possible that increased <italic>NOS2A </italic>expression may be attributed to resident macrophages. However, studies have reported increased expression of the endothelial (<italic>eNOS</italic>) and inducible (<italic>iNOS</italic>) forms of nitric oxide synthase in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and murine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] breast cancer tissue. The increased <italic>TLR4 </italic>expression after IMI in our study may partly explain the down-regulation of the genes involved with LXR/RXR signaling.

However, the expression of LXR in bovine mammary tissue only increased slightly during lactation relative to pregnancy and it was not among DEG (M. Bionaz, S. L. Rodriguez-Zas, R. E. Everts, H. A. Lewin, and J. J. Loor, University of Illinois, Urbana, unpublished results). Those responses coupled with the lack of change in LXR expression due to IMI were suggestive of a minor role for LXR in mediating anti-inflammatory or lipogenic mechanisms in bovine mammary tissue.</p><p>Expression of <italic>PPARA </italic>is barely detectable in bovine mammary tissue (M. Bionaz, S. L. Rodriguez-Zas, R. E. Everts, H. A. Lewin, and J. J. Loor, unpublished results) and tends to decrease during lactation, which points to a minor role of this nuclear receptor in bovine mammary lipid metabolism. We recently showed that mRNA expression of <italic>PPARG </italic>was consistently up-regulated during lactation, suggesting that it could play a role in milk fat synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. A role of <italic>PPARG </italic>in regulating bovine milk fat synthesis machinery was supported by recent results we obtained where treatment of MacT cells (bovine mammary epithelial immortalized cells) with rosiglitazone, a specific PPAR&#x003b3; agonist, resulted in coordinated up-regulation of genes involved in FA import (e.g., <italic>CD36</italic>), de novo FA synthesis (e.g., <italic>ACACA, FASN, SREBF1</italic>), and TAG synthesis (e.g., <italic>LPIN1, SCD</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. More importantly in the context of the present study, a recent study with PPAR&#x003b3;-knockout mice indicated that its absence increased utilization of long-chain fatty acids for synthesis of inflammatory lipids due to reduced TAG synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. <italic>PPARG</italic>-knockout mice had a sustained increase in 12-lipoxygenase (i.e., <italic>ALOX5AP</italic>) activity from parturition through the end of lactation. Although we did not observe a significant effect of IMI on <italic>PPARG </italic>expression, up-regulation of <italic>ALOX5AP </italic>(ca. 6-fold; Table S1) might have been associated with increased synthesis of eicosanoids which are classical effectors of an inflammatory response. In addition, activation of PPAR&#x003b3; by specific agonists reduced synthesis of inflammatory cytokines in mammary epithelial cells, suggesting this nuclear receptor has an anti-inflammatory role in mammary tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. A 39-fold increase of <italic>ALOX5AP </italic>in mammary quarters challenged with <italic>E. coli </italic>in a recent study provides further support to the inflammatory role of <italic>ALOX5AP </italic>during an IMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, the above observations coupled with the down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3; target genes point to PPAR&#x003b3; as a major player. The expression of this nuclear receptor appeared not to be affected by IMI (at the least from microarray data) but its activity probably was decreased as suggested by down-regulation of its known target genes. Similar to PPAR&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), the increase in NF&#x003ba;B activity might have inhibited PPAR&#x003b3; activity. Interestingly, insulin-induced gene 1 (<italic>INSIG1</italic>), which is involved in the inhibition of SREBP cleavage (i.e., inactivation of SREBP), and appears to be a PPAR&#x003b3; target gene in bovine mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], was significantly up-regulated (1.5-fold change; Table S1). These data suggested that <italic>INSIG1 </italic>is not only under control of PPAR&#x003b3; but likely contributed to reduced milk fat synthesis through blockage of SREBP1 cleavage, i.e. both <italic>SREBF1 </italic>and <italic>SREBF2 </italic>are moderately up-regulated during lactation in bovine mammary tissue and could be involved in lipid synthesis through activation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase alpha (<italic>ACACA</italic>) and fatty acid synthase (<italic>FASN</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Unfortunately, the IPA Knowledge Base does not contain specific PPAR&#x003b3; pathways, thus precluding a definitive conclusion about the pivotal role of PPAR&#x003b3;. It is important to note that a possible role of PPAR&#x003b1; cannot be excluded because specific PPAR&#x003b1; co-activators or up-stream factors were down-regulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>An enzyme linked to the LXR/RXR and PPARG pathways via SREBP1 in non-ruminant liver and adipose is stearoyl-CoA desaturase (<italic>SCD</italic>), which plays an essential role in TAG synthesis by catalyzing the synthesis of oleic acid via desaturation of stearic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].

Impaired PPAR&#x003b3; signaling might have been associated with the down-regulation of these lipogenic enzymes, either through down-regulation of <italic>SREBF1 </italic>or directly through decreased binding to response elements (e.g., <italic>SCD </italic>and <italic>FABP4</italic>).</p><p>Our findings highlighted a potential relationship between PPAR and LXR, two master regulators of lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses in non-ruminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].

Overall, our results indicated that IMI with <italic>S. uberis </italic>inhibited activity of LXR/RXR and PPAR signaling during IMI, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect of those pathways was not at play. We suggest that PPAR&#x003b3; signaling plays a primary role in mammary tissue but the activity of this nuclear receptor was probably reduced. The overall repression of lipogenic genes in <italic>S. uberis </italic>infected mammary quarters and the mechanisms involved in LXR/RXR or PPAR signaling and the fatty acid switch in the mammary gland during IMI challenge have not been elucidated and require further investigation. PPAR&#x003b3; has a pivotal role in immune cells as well, increasing their ability to face infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>].

Thus, palmitic acid used for ceramide synthesis in mammary appears a required step and also might represent a regulatory point for FA synthesis because ceramides can inhibit this process by blocking the activity of AKT/PKB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>].</p><p>Our data revealed that ceramide signaling was markedly down-regulated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) potentially through the action of <italic>TNF </italic>(Table S1, Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).

The details of the pathway indicated a reduction of ceramide synthesis from sphingomyelin through activity of neutral sphingomyelinases sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase. In addition, the decrease in expression of genes involved in long-chain fatty acids import (e.g., <italic>CD36, LPL</italic>) and de novo fatty acid synthesis (e.g., <italic>ACACA </italic>and <italic>FASN</italic>) had probably reduce the amount of available palmitate for synthesis of ceramide. From our combined results, production of ceramide did not seem to be induced by pro-inflammatory state during IMI, but probably decrease. In addition, we observed an overall inhibition/decrease of ceramide downstream signaling, which clearly indicated that during IMI ceramide is not involved in apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance of the immune response and milk fat synthesis</title><p>The negative relationship between DEG involved with immune response and milk fat synthesis may serve several beneficial purposes for the immune system within the mammary gland. First, the ability of phagocytes such as PMN and macrophages to engulf invading microorganisms is lower in milk when compared to PMN and macrophages that originate from the bloodstream. Milk phagocytes engulf milk fat globules instead of invading pathogens, resulting in a loss of pseudopodia needed for phagocytic capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Therefore, the less milk fat synthesized during an IMI the more likely that milk phagocytes will engulf invading bacteria instead of milk fat globules.

Decreased expression of genes involved in <italic>Lipid Metabolism </italic>(using IPA Knowledge database) has also been recently reported after IMI challenge with <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; and suggests that reduced lipid synthesis in the mammary gland may not be pathogen specific. In addition, microarray and qPCR analyses revealed a down-regulation of <italic>LALBA </italic>(-1.46-fold; Table S1), the rate limiting enzyme in lactose synthesis, which confirmed previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. This may indicate that, at the time of biopsy (20 h post-inoculation), lactose synthesis was reduced as suggested by previously-reported milk whey analysis of mastitic cows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. A decrease in lactose synthesis might help the immune system by reducing substrate (i.e. lactose) for bacteria and also preventing a potential inhibition of PMN phagocytosis by lactose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. Inflammation reduces protein synthesis in muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>], but our transcript profiling did not indicate alterations in protein synthesis in infected compared with non-infected contralateral mammary quarters.

Furthermore, the GO analysis uncovered an evident induction of transcription, post-translational modification, transport, and localization of proteins (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>). Those findings seemed to indicate that protein synthesis in milk should not have been decreased, but the large increase in transcription and protein metabolism was probably more related to increase synthesis and secretion of inflammatory-related proteins such as cytokines or acute-phase proteins. Unfortunately, quarter milk composition was not analyzed during the infection period; therefore, changes in milk fat, protein, and lactose could not be evaluated.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Milk fat synthesis down-regulated DEG</title><p>The majority of DEG down-regulated by &#x0003e;1.5-fold (via qPCR or microarrays) in mammary quarters after IMI challenge with <italic>S. uberis </italic>were associated with lipid metabolism including lipoprotein lipase (<italic>LPL</italic>), <italic>CD36</italic>, lipin 1 (<italic>LPIN1</italic>), and butyrophilin (<italic>BTN1A1</italic>) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). However, the changes in gene expression were not as marked as those observed for up-regulated DEG. Swanson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] also reported down-regulation of genes involved with lipid metabolism (e.g., <italic>LPIN1, APOB</italic>, and <italic>APOA2</italic>) in bovine mammary tissue after IMI with <italic>S. uberis</italic>. This is further supported by G&#x000fc;nther et al.

Exogenous sources of non-esterified fatty acids (<bold>NEFA</bold>) and TAG in the circulation that are used for milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland originate from 1) chylomicra from dietary sources that enter the lymphatics and bypass the liver; 2) very low-density lipoproteins (<bold>VLDL</bold>) that are exported from the liver; or 3) NEFA bound to albumin that originate from adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. The VLDL and chylomicra attach to the mammary endothelium by the enzyme LPL, which then hydrolyzes TG to fatty acids. Our results indicated that <italic>LPL </italic>was the third most down-regulated gene with a -1.98-fold change in expression versus control quarters (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

Furthermore, XDH can be converted to xanthine oxidase (<bold>XO</bold>) by reversible sulfhydryl oxidation or by irreversible proteolytic modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. Production of XO is important for bactericidal activity against major bovine mammary gland pathogens including <italic>E. coli </italic>and <italic>Staph. aureus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. The specific response of bacteria species to XO and the resulting bacteria-dependent nitrosative stress demonstrated that, besides its central role in lipid droplet secretion, XDH plays a role in the mammary gland immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. The up-regulation of <italic>ADFP </italic>might have been a compensatory mechanism to sustain milk lipid droplet secretion. Further investigation is required to determine the specific role of lipid droplet proteins during IMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Glucocorticoid signaling and related pathways</title><p>Glucocorticoids, a class of steroid hormones, exert dramatic effects on metabolism and immune response during periods of stress and lead to catabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins while increasing glucose availability in the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. Glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor &#x003b1; (<italic>NR3C1</italic>) activating it. The activated glucocorticoid receptor inhibits inflammation through transcriptional repression of proinflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>] and activates genes involved in the anti-inflammatory response (e.g. annexin I/lipocortin; <italic>ANXA1</italic>) and apoptosis (e.g. <italic>BAX</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>].

There was also a tendency towards an increase in expression of <italic>BAX </italic>(1.52-fold change; qPCR <italic>P </italic>= 0.06; Table S1).</p><p>The glucocorticoid signaling through glucocorticoid receptor is related to ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. Even though those pathways were overall likely induced by 20 h of IMI, the genes (mostly kinases) which are related those pathways were down-regulated. ERK/MAPK signaling seems to be essential for the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids via repression of p38 MAPK upon glucocorticoid treatment in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. Evidence of a modulatory effect of glucocorticoids on ERK/MAPK signaling pathways have been reported for human cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. Interestingly, in our case we observed a down-regulation of most of the genes coding for kinases (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Explanations for the down-regulation of kinases in the ERK/MAPK (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) are not readily available. The PI3K/AKT is essential in the activation of NF&#x003ba;B by TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>], thus playing an inflammatory role in the tissue. In our case the details of the pathway indicate that the PI3K/AKT signaling was in favor of NF&#x003ba;B mediated transcription probably though induction by growth factors, while other down-stream effects were mostly inhibited (Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>). Based on the evident induction of proliferation and apoptosis, suggested by functional analysis (see above and Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>) and details of the PI3K/AKT pathway, we can conclude that the likely induction of PI3K/AKT pathway is probably related to proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation. The down-regulation of several genes in common with the glucocorticoid pathway seems to indicate that the relationship among those pathways is not playing a role in modulating inflammation at 20 h post-inoculation.</p></sec><sec><title>Leukocyte extravasation and pain are transcriptionally regulated after IMI</title><p>The nervous system was not highly affected when considering functional analyses in IPA (Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>) or GO (Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>); however, several pathways involved in neuronal outgrowth appeared significantly inhibited including Ephrin receptor, axonal guidance, and CDK5 signaling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Most of those pathways are not strictly related to neurons.</p><p>Ephrin receptor signaling plays a role in attraction/repulsion, adhesion/de-adhesion implicated in axon guidance and migration of other cells beside neurons (e.g., leukocytes) but also plays a role in angiogenesis and synaptic plasticity. It has been suggested, based on multiple lines of evidence, that ephrin receptors play a direct role on inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]. The evidence points to a dual-phase pattern. In the early phase of inflammatory response the ephrin pathway is activated, inducing a decrease in adhesion between endothelial cells and epithelial cells. In a subsequent phase of inflammatory response the pathway is inhibited, increasing adhesion of circulating leukocytes to vascular endothelium and to epithelia of internal organs. The combination of the two allows the extravasation of leukocytes. Based on these effects, the evident inhibition of ephrin receptor signaling in our data (Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>) seems to indicate that at 20 h the inflammatory response was on its second phase, i.e. namely the adhesion and extravasation of leukocytes. Similar conclusions could be drawn from the axonal guidance signaling, which shares many of the Ephrin receptor pathway molecular networks (Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). The importance of movement and invasion of leukocytes and cell regulation of cell adhesion was underscored also by functional analysis (Figure S2; Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>).</p><p>The CDK5 signaling is strictly related to neuronal physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>] and seems to participate in dendrite and synapse development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>], but also in nociception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>]. The nociceptive role of CDK5 signaling has been clearly demonstrated during induction of peripheral inflammation in mouse. During an inflammatory status, or other sort of pain, the level of calpains increases rendering the CDK5 more stable, a process which seems to increase the perception of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. Based on those previous results, the strong inhibition of CDK5 signaling at 20 h of IMI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) seems to indicate a degree of modulation or control of pain through decrease nociception within mammary tissue prior peak clinical signs of infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene networks during IMI challenge with <italic>S. uberis</italic></title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows results from merging of the top 5 gene networks generated via IPA (i.e., networks most likely to have affected the system) describing relationships among DEG with &#x02265; 1.5-fold expression due to IMI.

This premise is further supported by results of Eckersall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>], who demonstrated that expression of <italic>M-SAA3 </italic>mRNA and haptoglobin (<italic>HP) </italic>mRNA were up-regulated during an experimental challenge with <italic>Staph. aureus </italic>and that mRNA for <italic>M-SAA3 </italic>was greater than that for <italic>HP</italic>.

It is challenging to be able to distinguish between 2 gene isoforms with a 70-bp oligonucleotide on a microarray platform. The latest annotation of our microarray identified this oligo as both <italic>SAA1 </italic>and <italic>SAA3 </italic>and it clearly depends on the tissue type (i.e. liver or mammary) as to which isoform is primarily expressed. Upon verification, we confirmed that the sequencing results of primers were specific for <italic>SAA3 </italic>(Tables S3 and S4 in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

Briefly, 10 multiparous Holstein cows in mid-lactation were used for this study. To be eligible, cows must have exhibited positive energy balance for &#x0003e; 2 consecutive weeks with composite milk SCC &#x0003c; 200,000 cells/mL, and cows must not have been treated for clinical signs of mastitis or any other disease during early lactation.

In addition, data were analyzed using GO by means of GeneSpring GX7 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Approach used in IPA</title><p>The 2,102 oligos (with FDR &#x02264; 0.06) with their associated annotation (when present) and the LSmean (after back-transformation) were uploaded into IPA. Data from qPCR analysis instead of microarray were used for those genes verified. Because we uploaded data from part of the oligonucleotides present on the microarray (i.e., those with FDR &#x02264; 0.06), the IPA Knowledge Base was used as a reference set for statistical analysis of enriched functions/pathways. This approach suffers from the biases towards overrepresented functions in the bovine oligonucleotide microarray platform. Each annotated gene was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the IPA Knowledge Base. The 2,102 DEG were run without fold-change cut-off or with 1.5-fold change cut-off (a total of 173 genes passed this last criterion). The latter was done with the purpose of identifying highly affected functions. For both datasets, several analyses were run:</p><p>- <italic>Functional Analysis</italic>. The functional analysis in IPA identified the biological functions that were most significant to the data set. To minimize false positives among significantly-enriched functions an FDR &#x02264; 0.000001 (-log <italic>P</italic>-value = 6.0) was used to determine the probability that each biological function assigned to that data set was due to chance alone.</p><p>- <italic>Network Generation</italic>. It was conducted only with the 158 DEG with a &#x02265; 1.5-fold cut-off that were eligible to generate a network. See the above sections for greater description.</p><p>- <italic>Canonical Pathway Analysis</italic>: Canonical pathway analysis identified the pathways from the IPA library that were most significant to the data set. Genes from the data set that were associated with a canonical pathway in the IPA Knowledge Base were considered for the analysis. The significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured in 2 ways: 1) a ratio of the DEG that mapped to the pathway divided by the total number of genes that mapped to the canonical pathway; 2) an FDR &#x02264; 0.0005 to calculate a <italic>P</italic>-value determining the probability that the association between the DEG and the signaling canonical pathway was explained by chance alone. For metabolic pathways a less stringent approach (FDR &#x02264; 0.06) was used because no metabolic pathways were present among the canonical pathways at an FDR corrected <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.0005.</p></sec><sec><title>Criteria used to interpret the IPA functional analysis</title><p>These criteria are valid only for the analysis of the 2,102 DEG. The description of the functions in IPA was a consideration of the response of the genes (up- or down-regulated) and the "effect on function" feature in IPA. The final evaluation on the effect on any particular function was an extrapolation of the ensemble following these criteria (see Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>):</p><p>- when a function in IPA "effect of function" had a number of genes in "increase/decrease function" that was &#x0003c;10% higher from those in "decrease/increase function" including genes in "affect function" which evidently induce or inhibit the function (assessed by carefully considering the IPA links which include IPA descriptions or the original papers for those functions) the functions were considered to be in equilibrium or not having a net effect (or not evident net effect). Further, even though the function was significantly enriched with DEG, a final judgment of a biological outcome was not feasible, thus the function was considered in equilibrium (denoted by &#x02194;).</p><p>- when a function in IPA "effect of function" had a number of genes in "increase/decrease function" that was &#x02265; 10% higher from those in "decrease/increase function" including genes in "affect function", which evidently induce or inhibit the function (as reported above), the function "tends to increase/decrease (or induced/inhibited)" which for simplicity was denoted with arrows (tendency to induce or increase = &#x02191;; tendency to inhibit or decrease = &#x02193;);</p><p>- when the number of genes which increase/induce or decrease/inhibit the function was &#x02265; 100% more (or &#x02265; 2-fold) compared to decrease/inhibit or increase/induce, the function was considered to be evidently induced or inhibited (simple arrows &#x021d1; or &#x021d3;);</p><p>- when all, or nearly all, the genes found in increase/induce or decrease/inhibit function or the analysis of "affect function" stated that they were involved in inducing or inhibiting the function, the function was considered to be completely induced or inhibited (&#x021d1;&#x021d1; or &#x021d3;&#x021d3;);</p><p>- genes which were up-regulated and were found in "decrease function" were considered to actively decrease or inhibit the function;</p><p>- genes which were down-regulated and were found in "decrease function" were considered to decrease the function and also to allow the function to take place;</p><p>- genes which were up-regulated and were associated with "increase function" were considered to increase or induce the function;</p><p>- genes which were down-regulated and were associated with "increase function" were considered as failing to increase or induce the function;</p><p>- the final evaluation on the state of a particular function was a sum of all up- and down-regulated genes.</p></sec><sec><title>GO analyses</title><p>This analysis was performed by means of GeneSpring GX7 with the annotation updated on March 3, 2009 by the automatic annotation feature in GeneSpring GX7 using GeneBank accession numbers. The updated GO had 7,710 annotated out of 13,257 total oligos in Biological process (Bp), 7,765 in Cellular component (Cc), and 8,327 in Molecular function (Mf) oligos. The analysis was run for the overall DEG (2,102 oligos, 1,359 annotated for Bp, 1,365 for Cc, and 1,452 for Mf; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>), for the overall up-regulated DEG (1,082 oligos, 738 annotated for Bp, 731 for Cc, and 776 for Mf), overall down-regulated DEG (1,020, 621 annotated for Bp, 634 for Cc, and 676 for Mf); DEG with &#x02265; 1.5-fold change (173 oligos, 130 annotated for Bp, 128 for Cc, and 132 for Mf; Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>), up-regulated DEG &#x02265; 1.5-fold change (130 oligos, 99 annotated for Bp, 101 for Cc, and 101 for Mf), and down-regulated DEG &#x02265; 1.5-fold change (43 oligos, 31 annotated for Bp, 27 for Cc, and 31 for Mf). The <italic>P</italic>-value was set at 0.05. Results from each GO category and from each list was saved as a text file, and formatted and processed with Excel (see Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>). All GO results with a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.05 are available in Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref> (i.e., all DEG) and 16 (DEG with &#x02265; 1.5-fold).</p></sec><sec><title>Criteria used to interpret the GO categories and build GO figures</title><p>The GO analysis provided a <italic>P</italic>-value and the number of genes in each sub-category within Bp, Mf, or Cc. The most representative list is that using the overall DEG (2,102 oligos), which simultaneously considered all genes/functions which were affected regardless of the direction of the change (see Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>). This allowed visualization of the enrichment of GO categories but did not facilitate an interpretation of the biological effect (i.e., inhibition or activation). The separate analysis of up- and down-regulated DEG was performed with the purpose of overcoming this limitation. Because all genes in each specific list had the same direction the interpretation was facilitated. However, it is important to note that use of only the separate analysis could be tricky because there are GO categories which can be enriched equally in up- and down-regulated DEG, thus precluding a conclusion except on the evidence of the enrichment. Using Microsoft Excel software we clustered all the GO categories significantly enriched in the overall gene list, &#x021d1; genes and &#x021d3; genes simultaneously, and by means of Pivot table in Excel, we compared the simultaneous enrichment of each specific category in overall, up-, and down-regulated DEG. When the significantly-enriched categories in the overall DEG list were enriched in up- and down-regulated DEG, we concluded that the category was induced (if the significant enrichment was present in up-regulated DEG) or inhibited (if the significant enrichment was present in down-regulated DEG). When the enriched category in the overall DEG list was present in both up- and down-regulated DEG we concluded that the category was induced if the number of up-regulated DEG was at least 30% greater than in down-regulated DEG and inhibited when vice versa. If a category in the overall DEG list was also present in up- and down-regulated DEG and the aforementioned criteria was not satisfied or the category was absent from both up- and down-regulated DEG, we concluded that the category was enriched but without a clear directional (up or down) effect.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KMM participated in the design of the study, organized the research trial, performed mammary tissue biopsies, performed microarray and qPCR analyses, performed qPCR statistical analysis, and wrote the manuscript.
