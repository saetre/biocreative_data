Lack of LEKTI causes stratum corneum detachment secondary to epidermal proteases hyperactivity. This skin barrier defect favors allergen absorption and is generally regarded as the underlying cause for atopy in NS. We show for the first time that the pro-Th2 cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), the thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, and the macrophage-derived chemokine are overexpressed in LEKTI-deficient epidermis. This is part of an original biological cascade in which unregulated kallikrein (KLK) 5 directly activates proteinase-activated receptor 2 and induces nuclear factor &#x003ba;B&#x02013;mediated overexpression of TSLP, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;, and IL8. This proinflammatory and proallergic pathway is independent of the primary epithelial failure and is activated under basal conditions in NS keratinocytes. This cell-autonomous process is already established in the epidermis of <italic>Spink5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos, and the resulting proinflammatory microenvironment leads to eosinophilic and mast cell infiltration in a skin graft model in nude mice. Collectively, these data establish that uncontrolled KLK5 activity in NS epidermis can trigger atopic dermatitis (AD)&#x02013;like lesions, independently of the environment and the adaptive immune system. They illustrate the crucial role of protease signaling in skin inflammation and point to new therapeutic targets for NS as well as candidate genes for AD and atopy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The epidermis is a stratified epithelium providing a first line of defense against the harsh external environment. The skin also maintains the body's integrity by sequestering the internal milieu and impeding transcutaneous water loss through the formation of an impermeability barrier. This protective barrier is conferred by the outermost layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum (SC), which results from a finely regulated terminal cell differentiation process from the basal layer of the epidermis to the granular layers (GRs), through the spinous compartment. The SC consists of dead and keratin-filled cells, corneocytes, which are attached to each other by corneodesmosomes and embedded in a lipid matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Proteolytic degradation of corneodesmosomes by epidermal proteases leads to the shedding of the most superficial corneocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). This desquamation process allows the regulation of the skin thickness. Alterations in these processes, as well as mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in terminal differentiation, can lead to abnormal stratification and keratinization, as seen in ichthyoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>In this respect, the filament-aggregating protein FILAGGRIN is a key protein that plays an important role in the formation of the barrier function. Recent genetic studies have shown that loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding FILAGGRIN underlie ichthyosis vulgaris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), a very common genetic disorder of keratinization. The same <italic>FILAGGRIN</italic> mutations have also been identified as a major risk factor for atopic dermatitis (AD) and are strongly associated with asthma in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). These results linked for the first time a primary skin disease to systemic allergic manifestations, through defective skin barrier function.</p><p>AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by eczema, pruritus, and cutaneous hyperreactivity to environmental factors that are innocuous to normal nonatopic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). AD has a complex etiology that results from interactions between environment and several susceptibility genes involved in skin barrier function and systemic and local immunological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). AD is often the initial step in the so-called &#x0201c;atopic march,&#x0201d; which leads to asthma and allergic rhinitis in the majority of afflicted patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). These conditions are all characterized by elevated serum IgE levels and peripheral eosinophilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Clinically unaffected skin in AD manifests impaired skin barrier function that could favor the penetration of microbes and allergens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), leading to the development of cutaneous and systemic allergies through activation of antigen-presenting cells such as Langerhans cells (LCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). However, keratinocytes are immunologically active cells. Indeed, traumatic barrier disruption alone stimulates both keratinocyte proliferation and their cytokine and chemokine production (IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and GM-CSF), characteristic features of skin inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Thus, the skin should be considered as an important organ of innate immunity. In fact, keratinocytes from lesional skin of AD patients express a proallergic cytokine, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Notably, the local increase of TSLP is directly associated with LC activation and migration to skin draining lymph node, where they trigger the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into proallergic CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). TSLP overexpression is also sufficient in mouse skin to induce an inflammatory Th2 microenvironment and an AD-like skin phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Keratinocytes are therefore important orchestrators of the innate immunity through the secretion of a wide range of proinflammatory and proallergic molecules inducing and supporting cutaneous acute and chronic inflammatory responses.</p><p>One of the most severe ichthyoses of children and young adults is Netherton syndrome (NS; Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man reference number 256500). NS is a rare (1 in 100,000 newborns) autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by generalized exfoliative erythroderma, a specific hair shaft defect (trichorrhexis invaginata) and severe atopic manifestations, which distinguish NS from the other ichthyoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Indeed, NS patients suffer from recurrent AD with elevated serum IgE levels, asthma, and multiple food allergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Bacterial infection, hypernatraemic dehydration, hypothermia, and extreme weight loss are frequent complications during the neonatal period, resulting in high postnatal mortality, and are probably favored by the severe alteration of the skin barrier function.</p><p>We previously identified <italic>serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5</italic> (<italic>SPINK5</italic>) as the defective gene in NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). <italic>SPINK5</italic> encodes the multidomain serine protease inhibitor lymphoepithelial Kazal-type&#x02013;related inhibitor (LEKTI), whose tissue distribution pattern is restricted to the most differentiated viable layers of stratified epithelial tissues and the Hassall's corpuscles in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In the epidermis, LEKTI is mainly restricted to the GR. It is expressed as high molecular mass precursors, which are rapidly processed into several proteolytic fragments secreted in the intercellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). It has been shown that LEKTI fragments can efficiently and specifically inhibit the epidermal kallikrein (KLK) 5, KLK7, and KLK14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).</p><p>Using <italic>Spink5</italic> KO mice (<italic>Spink5</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), which faithfully reproduce key features of NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), we deciphered the biological functions of LEKTI and identified cutaneous pathophysiological pathways of the disease. We showed that epidermal LEKTI deficiency results in KLK5 and KLK7 hyperactivity and dysregulation of a new epidermal protease, which is under characterization. These unrestricted protease activities lead to abnormal desmosome cleavage in the upper GR, resulting in accelerated SC shedding and consequent loss of skin barrier function. This work identified LEKTI as a key regulator of epidermal protease activity and skin barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).</p><p>Because NS patients suffer from severe atopic manifestations, such as AD, genetic association between <italic>SPINK5</italic> single nucleotide polymorphisms and severe AD has been tested by several groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Positive association was found in several studies in patients with different ethnical background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Although the skin barrier defect is considered to be the key event leading to skin inflammation and allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), it is likely that more specific and intrinsic signals could be directly induced by <italic>SPINK5</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes. In this paper, we therefore explored the molecular mechanisms leading to the recruitment of inflammatory cells in NS skin. We show that in LEKTI-deficient keratinocytes, KLK5 hyperactivity activates proinflammatory signaling, leading to the recruitment of eosinophilic and mast cells, which is reminiscent of AD-like skin lesions in NS, independent from skin barrier defect, environmental stimuli, and the adaptive immune system.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title><italic>Spink5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> grafted skin reproduces the histological and ultrastructural anomalies of NS</title><p>As newborn <italic>Spink5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (KO) mice died a few hours after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), total dorsal skin of embryonic day (E) 19.5 embryos was grafted on nude mice to analyze the consequences of <italic>Spink5</italic> inactivation in adult skin. 8 wk after grafting, WT skin (WTg) presented normal hair development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), whereas the KO graft was alopecic, scaly, and erythematous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Histological analysis showed that WT grafted skin was similar to adult WT skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In contrast, the KO epidermis was hyperplastic (acanthosis), with epidermal invaginations in the dermis (papillomatosis), and nuclei were seen to persist in the SC (parakeratosis), which appeared focally detached from the GR. In addition, a massive inflammatory infiltrate was observed in the dermis and the epidermis associated with spongiosis in the basal layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The hair follicles were hyperplastic and cystic in KO graft, concordant with the alopecic phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and D</xref>). Analysis of the differentiation program revealed that keratin 14 was only expressed in the basal layer of the WT graft epidermis, whereas all layers were stained in the KO epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082242/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>). Keratin 10 and involucrin, which are normally expressed in the suprabasal and GR of WT epidermis, respectively, extended to more profound spinous layers in the KO graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, G&#x02013;J</xref>; and Fig. S5). We previously demonstrated in newborn KO mice that premature desmosome cleavage leading to SC detachment was a key event of NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). As SC cohesion was also affected in KO graft, desmosomes were examined by electron microscopy. Well-structured desmosomes were seen at the interface between the GR and the SC (GR-SC) of the WT grafted epidermis, whereas asymmetrical split of desmosomes was observed in KO graft resulting in the loss of GR-SC cohesion and increase of intercellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, M and N</xref>). The desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-1 was not detected in these superficial layers of the KO epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 L</xref> and Fig. S5), which is in agreement with its degradation as previously described in newborn KO mice and NS skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). In summary, the abnormal differentiation pattern observed in KO graft, together with the desmosomal cleavage, confirmed that the KO grafted skin reproduces all major histological and ultrastructural anomalies seen in NS patients skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>), thus providing a suitable model to understand the long-term effect of LEKTI deficiency in the skin.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Ichthyosiform phenotype, abnormal differentiation, and asymmetrical desmosomal split in <italic>Spink5</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> grafted epidermis.</bold> (A and B) Macroscopic observation of WT (WTg) or <italic>Spink5</italic> KO (KOg) mice skin 8 wk after grafting on nude recipient mice.

Polynuclear eosinophils were observed in the upper dermis and in the basal epidermal layer in KO skin graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Eosinophilic cells were six times more numerous in KO than in WT dermis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082242/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>).

Immunodetection of &#x003b2;1-tryptase showed that this proinflammatory protease was detected in mast cells in the dermis as well as in the basal and suprabasal layers of the KOg epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref> and Fig. S5). Western blot analysis confirmed overproduction of 34-kD &#x003b2;1-tryptase monomer in KO grafted skin relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>). In addition to the protease hyperactivities at 20 and 30 kD, which has been previously described in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), casein gel zymography experiments showed a KO graft-specific activity migrating at 34 kD. This activity was inhibited by leupeptin, which is consistent with monomeric &#x003b2;1-tryptase activity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082242/DC1">Fig. S2, B and C</ext-link>). Collectively, these results support mast cells activation and secretion of &#x003b2;1-tryptase in KO grafted skin contrary to WT. Our results show that KO grafted skin exhibits a massive skin inflammation in athymic nude recipient mice, providing evidence that lack of LEKTI in the epidermis alone is sufficient to induce cutaneous inflammation in the absence of mature T lymphocytes.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Inflammatory cells infiltrate in <italic>Spink5</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> grafted skin.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Hematoxylin/eosin (HE) staining shows a high number of polynuclear eosinophilic cells (yellow arrows) in the upper dermis and the basal layer of KO grafted epidermis (KOg).

In this paper, we provide evidence that the epidermis plays a major and direct role in the modulation of the immune response. We show that in baseline culture conditions, keratinocytes from NS patients secrete major proinflammatory (ICAM1, IL8, and TNF-&#x003b1;) and Th2-polarizing (TSLP, TARC, and MDC) mediators in the absence of any external stimulation, thus excluding any effect of skin barrier disruption and/or pathogen and allergen penetration. We demonstrate for the first time the direct role of KLK5 hyperactivity in initiating a proallergic signaling cascade through PAR2 receptor cleavage and NF-&#x003ba;B pathway activation, which results in <italic>ICAM1</italic>,<italic> IL8</italic>,<italic> TNF-&#x003b1;</italic>, and <italic>TSLP</italic> overexpression in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). This study disclosed a new role for KLK5 in skin inflammation and in the induction of allergic inflammatory actors. Therefore, KLK5 represents a major epidermal specific protagonist, which initiates TSLP overexpression without contribution of the adaptive immune system. In addition, the pro-Th2 mediators TARC and MDC were overexpressed in keratinocytes from NS patients independently of KLK5 and PAR2 activation. This up-regulation could be promoted by other uncontrolled proteases, such as KLK7 or KLK14 and/or secreted factors in the medium, sustaining the induction of multiple signaling pathways in LEKTI-deficient skin. These results provide evidence that the activation of this biological cascade leading to cutaneous inflammation in NS is an intrinsic property of LEKTI-deficient keratinocytes, i.e., is a cell-autonomous process.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>KLK5 triggers proinflammatory and proallergic microenvironment independently of external stimuli.</bold> Lack of KLK5 inhibition by LEKTI initiates proinflammatory and proallergic cascades independently of environmental factors. In LEKTI-deficient keratinocytes, hyperactive KLK5 directly induces TSLP, IL8, and TNF-&#x003b1; overexpression through PAR2 and NF-&#x003ba;B pathway activation. Unregulated KLK5 also degrades desmosomes at the interface between the GR and the SC leading to defective SC adhesion and IL-1&#x003b2;, IL8, and TNF-&#x003b1; secretion by mechanically stressed keratinocytes. In addition, all these cytokines could induce TARC and MDC chemokines secretion by keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. These proinflammatory mediators trigger eosinophilic and mast cell recruitment and activation. TSLP has been reported to activate resident LCs, which migrate to draining lymph nodes and promote the differentiation of naive T cells (Th0) into Th2 cells.

It is of interest to note that elimination of T lymphocytes in <italic>K5-Tslp</italic> mice by crossing with TCR-&#x003b2;&#x02013;deficient mice does not affect eosinophilic and mast cell skin infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), as observed in <italic>Spink5</italic> KO grafted skin. These data support the notion that, in our model, TSLP-mediated skin inflammation mainly involves the innate immune system and that this cytokine may directly recruit and activate mast cells that express TSLP receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). TSLP, synergistically with IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;, stimulates the production of pro-Th2 cytokines by activated mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). Massive production of active &#x003b2;1-tryptase by activated mast cells in <italic>Spink5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> grafted skin could also directly participate in the inflammatory response and favor a Th2-permissive microenvironment through PAR2 activation on mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>), dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>), and eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). In addition, in an immune-competent system, TSLP has the potential to activate dendritic cells and epidermal LCs in particular, triggering the generation of proallergic CD4<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>).</p><p>Our present results established that <italic>Spink5</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> epidermis by itself induces a cutaneous inflammatory response and the synthesis of proallergic mediators. This new mechanism could account for atopic manifestations in NS patients and is concordant with TSLP overproduction in the epidermis of NS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) who display KLK5 and PAR2 deregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Thus, TSLP provides an important link between the absence of LEKTI protease inhibitor and the AD-like phenotype constantly seen in NS patients. This notion supports the possibility that <italic>SPINK5</italic> could play a role in atopic disease. Several studies have reported significant genetic association of <italic>SPINK5</italic> polymorphisms with AD in different populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), whereas other studies did not confirm these results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). This suggests that <italic>SPINK5</italic> genetic variations may account, to some extent, for predisposition to AD in some patients, depending on other genetic and/or environmental factors.</p><p>Therefore, expression of TSLP, TARC, and MDC by LEKTI-deficient keratinocytes could initiate and amplify the skin atopic inflammation as well as the systemic allergic response of NS patients. The abundant and epidermally restricted TSLP secretion could induce an AD-like phenotype associated with elevated serum levels of IgE, as illustrated in Tslp skin-specific transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>). Thereby, the effect of LEKTI deficiency on triggering PAR2 signaling could be a primary event inducing atopic manifestations in NS before skin barrier defect. In parallel, as the result of protease hyperactivities, FILAGGRIN is also decreased (agranulosis) and the SC is often detached from the underlying cell layers in the epidermis of NS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Both anomalies impair skin barrier and favor allergen and pathogen penetration in NS epidermis, thus contributing to the aggravation of the atopic phenotype.</p><p>These results identify KLK5 as a major actor in NS because up-regulation of this protease has a direct effect on proinflammatory signaling and on skin barrier disruption, both of which contribute to the development of atopic manifestations in NS. KLK5 and all the highlighted actors in this study constitute attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention, which are upstream from the IgE response and independent of allergen exposure. These new approaches based on blocking this biological cascade initiated in the epidermis could improve not only the allergic manifestations but also the skin barrier defect of NS patients. In addition, the results point out the importance of the control of protease/protease inhibitor balance in skin barrier function and in immune response orientation.</p><p>An emerging hypothesis regarding asthma and AD is that they are epithelial diseases initiated by the epithelial cells themselves through the production of TSLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>). In the present study, we have identified a mechanism leading to the production of the major pro-Th2 cytokine TSLP by skin epithelial cells, despite the absence of microbe products or physical injury. This new physiological pathway could also explain why the eczematous skin lesions in infants often start in the absence of specific IgE antibodies, indicating that IgE sensitization may occur secondary to eczema. This new mechanism, which is based on the control of epidermal serine protease activity, could be considered to be additional genetic regulation involved in AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Skin sample and dermis/epidermis separation technique.</title><p>This work was approved by the Commission de G&#x000e9;nie G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;tique (23 November 2003, agreement number 3987) and by the Local Ethical Committee (DEC 04005).
