To gain new insights into the transcriptional regulation of this restriction factor, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of A3G. Transcriptional start sites were identified by 5&#x02032;-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that a 1025&#x02009;bp A3G promoter sequence (from &#x02212;959 to +66 relative to the major transcriptional start site) displayed constitutive promoter activity. In T cells, the A3G promoter was not inducible by mitogenic stimulation, interferon treatment or expression of HIV-1 proteins. Using a series of 5&#x02032; deletion promoter constructs in luciferase reporter assays, we identified a 180&#x02009;bp region that was sufficient for full promoter activity. Transcriptional activity of this A3G core promoter was dependent on a GC-box (located at position &#x02212;87/&#x02212;78 relative to the major transcriptional start site) and was abolished after mutation of this DNA element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the identified GC-box represented a binding site for the ubiquitous transcription factors specificity protein (Sp) 1 and Sp3.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The recently discovered APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases is considered to play an important role in antiviral intrinsic immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In primates, the seven paralogs APOBEC3A, B, C, DE, F, G, H (A3A-H) have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and they appear to fulfill individual functions. Human APOBEC3G (A3G), the most prominent member of the APOBEC3 family has been identified as the cellular restriction factor that is responsible for inhibition of <italic>virion infectivity factor</italic> (Vif)-deleted human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replication in non-permissive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A3G is packaged into HIV-1&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> particles and causes C-to-U deaminations on the single-stranded viral DNA during reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). This leads to degradation of the uracile-containing DNA by cellular repair mechanisms or to hypermutation of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). As a result, only a marginal fraction of the A3G-containing HIV-1 particles is able to complete the replication cycle. In addition to the inhibition of HIV-1, A3G restricts replication of other lentiviruses, gammaretroviruses, deltaretroviruses, spumaviruses, long-terminal-repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons, orthohepadnaviruses and avihepadnaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">9&#x02013;21</xref>). Interestingly, deamination seems not to be the only A3G-mediated antiviral mechanism; in the case of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), A3G was shown to restrict virus replication by deamination-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25">22&#x02013;25</xref>). Another member of the APOBEC3 family, APOBEC3F (A3F), appears to have similar activities like A3G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). A3F is also packaged into HIV-1&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> particles and induces similar C-to-U deaminations, although the proteins differ in their target sequences specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Furthermore, A3F proteins were detected in many tissues that express A3G and are able to form heteromultimers with A3G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Both proteins localize to mRNA processing (P) bodies, cytoplasmic compartments involved in the degradation and storage of non-translating mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>A3G has been shown to be expressed in T cells, a relevant cell target for HIV-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, but little is known about its regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). There is a report describing that mitogenic stimulation of T cells upregulates A3G mRNA levels, but this was not analyzed on the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Since the A3G promoter has not been systematically analyzed so far, our aim was to clone the A3G promoter and characterize its regulation in T cells. In our study, we observed that A3G uses multiple transcriptional start sites (TSS). By generating a series of 5&#x02032; deletions of the A3G promoter, we identified a 180&#x02009;bp region that mediated basal transcription. In T cells, transcriptional activity of this core promoter was not inducible by mitogenic stimulation or interferon treatment, but was dependent on a GC-box which was recognized by Sp (specificity protein) 1 and Sp3 transcription factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human T cell lines A3.01 and PM1 (NIBSC, UK) and the human myeloid cell line U937 (NIBSC, UK) were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2&#x02009;mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine and 100&#x02009;U/ml penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin.

The DNA sequence ranging from positions &#x02212;959 to +66 relative to the identified transcription start was amplified via PCR using the primers 3Gprom1025 (5&#x02032;-TGTGAACGCGTTGCTGCAGGCCATCTGGATGTATATG-3&#x02032;) and 3Gpromreverse (5&#x02032;-ACAGCAGATCTAGGGACCTCTGATAAAGACAGG-3&#x02032;). PCR reactions were performed with <italic>Pwo</italic> DNA Polymerase (Roche) using the following cycle conditions: one cycle 94&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;min; 30 cycles 94&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;s, 58&#x000b0;C for 60&#x02009;s, 72&#x000b0;C for 60&#x02009;s; one cycle 72&#x000b0;C for 7&#x02009;min. The amplicon was ligated into the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic (Promega) via MluI and BglII restriction sites, which were introduced by the primers. The resulting construct contained 1025&#x02009;bp of the A3G promoter and was designated pGL3-APOprom1025. Reporter plasmids containing shorter fragments of the APOBEC3G promoter were constructed using pGL3-APOprom1025 as template and the following forward primers: for plasmid pGL3-APOprom502 (containing sequence &#x02212;436/+66): 3Gprom502 (5&#x02032;-TGTGAACGCGTTCCATAACATGGGGACAAGA-3&#x02032;); for plasmid pGL3-APOprom225 (containing sequence &#x02212;159/+66): 3Gprom225 (5&#x02032;-TGTGAACGCGTCGAGGGCAGGATCCGGGAGT-3&#x02032;); for plasmid pGL3-APOprom180 (containing sequence &#x02212;114/+66): 3Gprom180 (5&#x02032;-TGTGAACGCGTTCTTGATGGTGGAGAGGAGG-3&#x02032;); for plasmid pGL3-APOprom150 (containing sequence &#x02212;84/+66): 3Gprom150 (5&#x02032;-TGTGAACGCGTGCGGGACCACCAGGGGAGGGGCTT-3&#x02032;); for plasmid pGL3-APOprom120 (containing sequence &#x02212;54/+66): 3Gprom120 (5&#x02032;-TGTGAACGCGTTGCTGGCTCAGCCTGGTGTG-3&#x02032;); for plasmid pGL3-APOprom60 (containing sequence +7/+66): 3Gprom60 (5&#x02032;-TGTGAACGCGTCCCTTTGCAATTGCCTTG-3&#x02032;); each in combination with the reverse primer 3Gpromreverse (described above).

As for pGL3-APOprom1025, MluI and BglII restriction sites were introduced via the primers and PCR products were ligated into pGL3-Basic (Promega) via these restriction sites. pGL3-APOprom180mut carries two point mutations (bold) and was generated using the primer 3GProm180mut (5&#x02032;-TGTGAACGCGTTCTTGATGGTGGAGAGGAGGCTCCAGCTG<bold>TT</bold>CGGGACCACCAG-3&#x02032;) in combination with primer 3Gpromreverse. This PCR was performed with an annealing temperature of 65&#x000b0;C. pGL3promE1 (containing nucleotides &#x02212;114/&#x02212;85) and pGL3promE2 (containing nucleotides &#x02212;92/&#x02212;63) were constructed by annealing the following single-stranded oligonucleotides: 114_85Plus (5&#x02032;- CGCGTTCTTGATGGTGGAGAGGAGGCTCCAGCTGGA-3&#x02032;) and 114_85Minus (5&#x02032;- GATCTCCAGCTGGAGCCTCCTCTCCACCATCAAGAA-3&#x02032;) or 92-63Plus (5&#x02032;-CGCGTCCAGCTGGGCGGGACCACCAGGGGAGGGGCA-3&#x02032;) and 92_63Minus (5&#x02032;-GATCTGCCCCTCCCCTGGTGGTCCCGCCCAGCTGGA-3&#x02032;). After annealing, the double-stranded oligonucleotides which contained the respective 30&#x02009;bp of the APOBEC3G promoter and sticky ends compatible with MluI and BglII restriction sites were ligated into the pGL3-Promoter (Promega) vector. The sequences of all constructed plasmids were verified by sequence analysis. Nucleotide &#x02212;219 of the cloned APOBEC3G promoter differs from the sequence in the database (GenBank&#x02122; accession number DQ147772). An A-to-C substitution is present at this position.

To analyze whether this putative Sp1/Sp3-binding site mediates transcriptional activity of the 180&#x02009;bp core promoter, we introduced two point mutations which changed the sequence from TGGGCGGGAC to TG<bold>TT</bold>CGGGAC (mutations shown in bold). This resulted in a 71% reduction of the transcriptional activity compared to the unmodified 180&#x02009;bp promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) and this value was only marginally higher than the luciferase activity of the 150&#x02009;bp fragment, indicating that the identified motif is essential for basal activity of the A3G core promoter. To further examine the transcriptional potency of the 30&#x02009;nt present in the 180&#x02009;bp promoter, we cloned the region <bold>&#x02212;</bold>114/<bold>&#x02212;</bold>85 (containing all nucleotides which are deleted in the 150&#x02009;bp fragment, designated E1) or the region <bold>&#x02212;</bold>92/<bold>&#x02212;</bold>63 (containing the putative Sp1/Sp3 motif, designated E2) into the vector pGL3-Promoter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Originally identified as a restriction factor of HIV-1 infection, expression of APOBEC3G was found in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages, which represent the main target cells for HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In addition, the protein was detected in lung, liver, spleen, testis and ovary, but little is known about its transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). To address this question, we cloned the human APOBEC3G promoter and analyzed its regulation in T cells. Applying 5&#x02032;-RACE, we identified multiple start sites for transcription of the A3G gene. This observation is consistent with the fact that the gene appears to lack canonical CCAAT and TATA boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), a condition often associated with multiple transcriptional start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51">49&#x02013;51</xref>). However, one single start site was detected in 6 of 19 clones and was designated as +1. This TSS is located 66&#x02009;bp upstream of the start of the published mRNA sequence (GenBank&#x02122; NM021822).</p><p>We cloned a 1025&#x02009;bp promoter, which ranges from position &#x02212;959/+66 relative to the identified TSS. Luciferase reporter assays showed that this promoter was transcriptionally active in A3.01&#x02009;T cells. Treatment with the phorbol ester TPA did not further enhance transcriptional activity, although upregulation of A3G mRNA levels in T cells by TPA has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Rose <italic>et al</italic>. used actinomycin D to block further transcription and did not find evidence for enhanced mRNA stability. Therefore, the authors suggested that an enhanced transcription rate could be responsible for the increased amount of A3G mRNA after TPA treatment. However, the promoter analysis we performed indicates a different mechanism that is independent of transcriptional regulation. In addition, we observed that the A3G promoter was not inducible by IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3; in A3.01&#x02009;T cells, whereas in the hepatic cell line HepG2, a moderate induction was measured. It has been described previously that A3G gene expression is upregulated by interferons in hepatocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46 B47 B48 B52">46&#x02013;48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). In this context, two interferon-responsive elements have been identified at the positions &#x02212;6/+9 and +1/+15 relative to the TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Consistent with this data, we observed an interferon induction in hepatocytes for the fragments ranging between 1025 and 120&#x02009;bp length. The activity of the 60&#x02009;bp fragment that does not contain these motifs was not affected. Thus, the induction we observed was most likely mediated by the described interferon-responsive elements. However, according to our results, these motifs can enhance transcription in hepatic cells, but not in T cells. This is surprising, since IFN-&#x003b1;-inducible signaling cascades are present in A3.01&#x02009;T cells: we showed that the control plasmid harboring interferon-responsive GAS elements was markedly induced by IFN-&#x003b1; treatment. In contrast, the GAS element was not responsive to IFN-&#x003b3; treatment in these cells, suggesting that our T cell line was not able to mediate IFN-&#x003b3;-induced signals. So far, enhanced A3G promoter activity by interferons is clearly described in hepatocytes and macrophages, whereas the situation in T cells is still unclear. A recent study found no influence of IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3; on A3G expression in resting primary blood lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Another publication describes an enhanced expression of A3G after IFN-&#x003b1; treatment in resting primary CD4&#x02009;T cells, but not in activated T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). This observation is not contradictory to our results since T cell lines are mitotically active and therefore rather in an activated than in a resting state. In conclusion, the current data suggests that regulation of the A3G promoter activity by interferons is dependent on the cell type and possibly also from the cellular activation status.</p><p>We additionally analyzed the influence of HIV-1 proteins on A3G promoter activity. The HIV-1 Vif protein is neutralizing the antiviral function of A3G by a multitude of ways. Targeting the A3G protein for proteasomal degradation is considered to be the main mode of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39 B40 B41">37&#x02013;41</xref>), but it becomes more and more clear that other mechanisms are also involved. There is evidence that Vif also promotes exclusion of A3G from the virus particles and an influence on the A3G translation process is discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The question whether Vif alters transcription controlled by the A3G promoter has not been analyzed so far. Our analysis indicates that transcription from the A3G promoter is unaffected by Vif or other HIV-1 proteins. Taken together, in T cell lines, the A3G promoter appears constitutively active.</p><p>By generating a series of 5&#x02032; deletions, we showed that the core promoter is located within the region &#x02212;114/+66 relative to the TSS. This 180&#x02009;bp promoter was transcriptionally active in the lymphoid, myeloid and hepatic cell lines we tested, indicating that ubiquitous transcription factors are involved in regulation of A3G gene transcription. A GC-box with the sequence TGGGCGGGAC was identified at position &#x02212;87/&#x02212;78 of the A3G promoter. This GC-box is essential for basal promoter activity, since changing the motif to TG<bold>TT</bold>CGGGAC by introducing two point mutations strongly reduced A3G promoter activity. The transcriptional potency of the GC-box was further demonstrated by cloning it upstream of an SV40 promoter. This resulted in a 4-fold enhanced transcription rate. The hypothesis that a general transcription factor is involved in regulation of A3G transcription was confirmed by EMSA. Supershift analysis showed that the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 which are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, bind specifically to the identified motif. In addition, the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the endogenous A3G promoter was demonstrated by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. This observation is consistent with the results of the 5&#x02032;-RACE, since Sp1 is known to play an important role for RNA polymerase II to bind to the transcription initiation site in TATA-boxless promoters and is associated with multiple transcription initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54 B55 B56">54&#x02013;56</xref>). We also tested whether overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 proteins had an influence on A3G promoter activity. Luciferase assays revealed that A3G promoter activities remained unchanged (data not shown), most probably due to the high basal expression level of the endogenous Sp1 and/or Sp3 proteins. The Sp family of transcription factors is involved in transcriptional regulation of many housekeeping, tissue-specific, viral and inducible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Whereas Sp1 typically acts as an activator, Sp3 can serve as a repressor or activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). However, in the context of the A3G promoter, both transcription factors serve as activators, as shown by siRNA-mediated silencing of the single factors. Although siRNAs directed against Sp1 or Sp3 significantly reduced transcription controlled by the 180&#x02009;bp promoter, transcriptional activity was not reduced to the level of the 150&#x02009;bp fragment. This can be explained by the remaining low amounts of Sp1/Sp3 proteins which can be seen in the western blot analysis. Alternatively, other transcription factors could be involved in A3G regulation.</p><p>Our results also provide information about the regulation of APOBEC3F (A3F), another member of the human APOBEC3 family. A3F is expressed in many human tissues that also express A3G and both proteins have been shown to form heteromultimers, which are most likely generated through binding to an RNA intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). A3F only differs in 16&#x02009;nt from the 560&#x02009;nt upstream of the TSS of A3G (GenBank&#x02122; DQ146365 and DQ147772). The 180-bp core promoter region, which we identified for A3G has 100% identity with the A3F sequence. Therefore, Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors are most likely also mediating basal transcription of the A3F gene.</p><p>Our study revealed that the human A3G gene is controlled by a promoter with multiple transcriptional start sites. In A3.01&#x02009;T cells, the A3G promoter appears constitutively active and is not inducible by TPA, type I or II interferons or by HIV-1 proteins. The core promoter is located within a region of 180&#x02009;bp at position &#x02212;114/+66 relative to the TSS. A GC-box is crucial to the function of the core promoter and represents a binding site for Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. Our results can serve as a basis for future studies aimed at understanding how A3G and A3F expression is controlled in different tissues and how these restriction factors can be used to develop novel therapeutic strategies against HIV-1 infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Thomas Pietschmann for providing HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines, Ute P&#x000e4;gelow and Mario K&#x000f6;ster for providing the pGL2-CVX plasmid and Nathaniel R.
