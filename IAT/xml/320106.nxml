The gene was isolated from a recombinant phage library of human chromosome 22 using a mouse Ig lambda cDNA as probe. DNA sequence analysis predicts a short leader peptide interrupted by an intron of 88 nucleotides, and a mature polypeptide of 96-97 amino acids which shares 61% homology with mouse V lambda I chains. Comparison with the amino acid sequence of known human lambda chains of all six subgroups shows agreement at 22/25 low variance positions. However the maximum homology with human chains is 49%, so we conclude that this sequence represents a new IgV lambda subgroup. The coding region is followed by the conserved heptamer, CACAGTG, and nonamer, ACATAAACC, sequences which have been implicated in V-J segment recombination. This gene has the hallmarks of an active V lambda gene including recently identified transcriptional controlling sequences. Probing genomic DNA with the subcloned V lambda gene detects a family of about 10 cross hybridizing members at low stringency and 2 at high stringency. There is limited polymorphism of the V lambda locus.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0022-a" xlink:role="6657"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6647"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6648"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6649"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6650"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6651"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6652"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6653"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6654"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6655"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6656"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0022.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6657"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0023.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6658"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0024.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6659"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6660"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00335-0026.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6661"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
