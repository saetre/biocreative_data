The gene products important for visual processing by a living and behaving vertebrate animal have not been identified in an unbiased fashion. Likewise, the genes that affect development of the nervous system to shape visual function later in life are largely unknown. Here we have set out to close this gap in our understanding by using a forward genetic approach in zebrafish. Moving stimuli evoke two innate reflexes in zebrafish larvae, the optomotor and the optokinetic response, providing two rapid and quantitative tests to assess visual function in wild-type (WT) and mutant animals. These behavioral assays were used in a high-throughput screen, encompassing over half a million fish. In almost 2,000 F2 families mutagenized with ethylnitrosourea, we discovered 53 recessive mutations in 41 genes. These new mutations have generated a broad spectrum of phenotypes, which vary in specificity and severity, but can be placed into only a handful of classes. Developmental phenotypes include complete absence or abnormal morphogenesis of photoreceptors, and deficits in ganglion cell differentiation or axon targeting. Other mutations evidently leave neuronal circuits intact, but disrupt phototransduction, light adaptation, or behavior-specific responses. Almost all of the mutants are morphologically indistinguishable from WT, and many survive to adulthood.

Mutations of behaviorally important genes may alter or disrupt either the physiology of neuronal circuits or their development. The first task of a research program aimed at identifying the genetic underpinnings of perception and behavior is to build a comprehensive catalog of genes with specific, non-lethal phenotypes, initially with no regard of when and where in the organism they are acting. Forward genetic screens are the method of choice to identify those genes in an unbiased fashion. This approach was pioneered over 30 years ago by Benzer in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d; and was quickly extended to <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In these invertebrate species, the forward genetic strategy was particularly productive for the analysis of sensory systems, such as vision, mechanosensation, and olfaction, where these screens helped to discover many genes important for the patterning of sensory epithelia and for sensory transduction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Very few behavioral screens have been attempted in vertebrates to date. In mice, Takahashi and colleagues carried out a screen for dominant mutations disrupting circadian behavior &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Other groups have carried out behavioral &#x0201c;shelf screens&#x0201d; of previously discovered mutants in both zebrafish and mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d; or collected mutants in motility and locomotor coordination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we report on the results of the first large-scale behavioral screen focused on a vertebrate sensory system. Following chemical mutagenesis, we searched for recessive mutations that disrupt visually evoked behaviors in zebrafish<italic>.</italic> Brockerhoff et al. first showed the utility of optokinetic behavior as a powerful screening tool to find visual mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

These two behaviors employ different motor outputs (swimming and eye movements, respectively), but they are both elicited by large-field motion and are dependent on the retina as the light-sensing organ &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. In a high-throughput screen of almost 2,000 mutagenized genomes, we discovered 41 loci whose mutations lead to a broad spectrum of specific visual (or visuomotor) impairments. Some of the more striking phenotypes include new mutants in retinal axon targeting and in the adaptive dynamics of light responses. This first survey reveals the extent to which single-gene mutations can perturb visual behavior without affecting gross development or vital organ functions. The identities of the corresponding genes are beginning to provide novel insights into how the visual system is assembled and how cellular and molecular interactions shape sensory processing in the vertebrate brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design of an Efficient, Large-Scale Mutagenesis Screen in Zebrafish</title><p>We carried out a large-scale screen for mutants with defects in visually elicited behavior. Forty-one founder males (F0) treated with ethylnitrosourea (ENU; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) were mated with wild-type (WT) females to generate more than 5,000 F1 fish. Adult F1 fish were mated with other F1 fish, or with WT fish, to generate more than 2,000 F2 families. In total, 3,171 F1 fish were used to generate the 1,896 F2 families (2,550 F1 fish for F1 &#x000d7; F1 crosses, and 621 F1 fish for F1 &#x000d7; WT) that gave at least one healthy clutch of F3 embryos in the subsequent generation. F3 embryos and larvae were obtained by random crosses between siblings from F2 families (6,468 F3 clutches in total, or 3.4 clutches per each F2 family on average). From each F3 clutch, typically 12 larvae were tested for OKR and 25 larvae for the OMR (see below). Fish were routinely scored on the seventh day postfertilization (7 dpf). Including retests, over 500,000 individual fish were screened in the course of three years. Calculations based on binomial statistics &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, taking into account the number of F1 fish used to generate the F2 families, the number of F2 families, the number of crosses for each F2 family, and the number of F3 larval fish tested, show that our screen encompassed 1,688 ENU-mutagenized genomes.</p><p>The efficiency of mutagenesis in the founder male germlines was determined by a specific-locus test, using <italic>sandy (sdy),</italic> a zebrafish tyrosinase mutant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

A coarse grating that drifts across the fishes' visual field elicits either of two distinct responses, an OKR or an OMR. In the OMR, WT animals vigorously swim in the direction of the perceived motion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010066-sv001">Video S1</xref>). When restrained from swimming and presented with a rotating whole-field motion stimulus, the fish show an OKR to cancel retinal slip: WT animals move their eyes to track the motion. These pursuit phases are interrupted at regular intervals by reset movements, or saccades (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010066-sv002">Video S2</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. To achieve high throughput, we automated both visual stimulation and analysis, as described elsewhere &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. We found that the two screening assays were complementary: The OKR assay is slower and more labor-intensive, but has single-fish resolution; the OMR assay, on the other hand, is fast, but measures only population responses. For each assay, a behavioral index ranging from 0 (no response) to 1.0 (WT) was calculated (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Typical OMR and OKR mutant phenotypes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g001">1</xref>B.</p><p>Mutants detected by at least one of the two assays in the primary screen were kept. To select against phenotypes with general defects, we discarded mutants with overt developmental problems, as well as those that were poor swimmers, with a few exceptions. Putative F2 carriers were mated at least twice more for confirmation of the phenotype in their progeny before they were outcrossed. The OKR screen initially picked up 241 putative mutants, or &#x0201c;putants.&#x0201d; Following two retests, 46 lines (23&#x00025;) were outcrossed. The OMR screen picked up 361 putants, 34 (9&#x00025;) of which were confirmed and successfully propagated. In addition to high-contrast stimuli, we also routinely used a lower-contrast grating to detect subtle and/or contrast-specific visual defects. The high percentage of false positives is mostly attributable to the use of these weak test stimuli. The OKR and OMR assays were used independently within the primary screen. A considerable number of OKR mutants were later found to be OMR-deficient, and vice versa, as discussed below (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010066-t0101">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The initial false positive rate of this behavioral screen greatly exceeded that of a morphological screen for small-eye mutants carried out in parallel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. However, almost all behavioral mutants were recovered in the following generation. Our strategy of extensive retesting as part of the primary screen therefore dramatically decreased the number of false positives and made this screen practical. Mutants or putative mutants with low penetrance were not kept or are not reported here. The mutants presented in this paper, therefore, were found in about 25&#x00025; of the population in a clutch. To establish potential complementation groups, we systematically crossed heterozygous carriers of mutants with similar phenotypes. Noncomplementing mutations (in which the transheterozygous progeny showed a mutant phenotype) were considered to be allelic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010066-t0101">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Secondary Screening Assays Allowed Classification of Behavioral Phenotypes</title><p>In addition to OMR and OKR, we also assessed the larvae's visually mediated background adaptation (VBA) at 5 dpf, as a complementary strategy to enrich for visual mutants. The VBA is a neuroendocrine response that is controlled by ambient light levels and appears to depend on the function of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

We tested the VBA only in response to long (over 20 min) exposure to bright light, i.e., the mutants' ability to become pale. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g001">Figure 1</xref>C shows gradations of the VBA defect in three representative mutants. We found that, of the 89 VBA mutants discovered in the screen, 19 (21&#x00025;) also had specific OMR or OKR defects. The remaining 70 &#x0201c;dark&#x0201d; mutants were either behaviorally normal or had externally visible, morphological phenotypes and were not always maintained.</p><p>To identify defects in motor functions, we systematically tested spontaneous swimming activity (SSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) in all our mutants. We also made sure that all mutants listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010066-t0101">Table 1</xref>, except <italic>s513,</italic> showed spontaneous, conjugate eye movements similar to WT when presented with a stationary stimulus. Finally, to identify mutants with developmental defects, we systematically examined their retinal and tectal histology and their retinotectal projections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010066-t0101">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Mutations May Affect Some Visual Behaviors More than Others</title><p>Because OKR and OMR are both evoked by motion of a large field grating, but differ in their motor output, our collection of mutants presented us with an opportunity to ask how well single-gene mutations can dissociate these two related behaviors. Are there mutations that impair OMR and OKR in a differential manner (weak dissociation) or even disrupt only one of the behaviors, while leaving the other unaffected (strong dissociation)? <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010066-t0101">Table 1</xref> shows that none of our mutants showed a complete absence of either OMR or OKR together with no defect at all in the other behavior. However, the two behaviors were often affected to different degrees. To reveal potential correlations, we plotted the behavioral profiles of our mutant set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Each data point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g002">Figure 2</xref> corresponds to one mutant, measured repeatedly (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 3 clutches), and was also shaded to represent that mutant's light-exposed VBA score. Although many mutants lacked any visual responses, for those with partial OMR and OKR phenotypes, there was no clear relationship between the magnitudes of the deficit in the two behaviors (correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.4, when mutants with OKR &#x0003d; 0 and OMR &#x0003d; 0 were excluded). Perhaps surprisingly, the severity of the VBA phenotype was not positively related to either OMR (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; &#x02212;0.5) or OKR (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; &#x02212;0.4) defects. The overall correlation of all OMR and OKR indices (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.75) and the absence of exclusively OMR- or OKR-specific mutants suggest that these behaviors are weakly dissociable by single-gene mutation. This indicates that OMR and OKR share a major portion of the underlying neural circuitry. In contrast, the VBA appears to employ a dedicated neural pathway largely segregated, and therefore genetically separable, from motion vision.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Genes Required for Photoreceptor Differentiation and Survival</title><p>We discovered seven genes essential for photoreceptor differentiation and/or maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g004">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010066-t0101">Table 1</xref>). No other phenotypes could be discovered in these mutants, and at least four of them are adult viable. In two mutants (five alleles of <italic>wud</italic> and <italic>yoi<sup>s121</sup></italic>), cone photoreceptors are present, but their shapes are shorter and thicker than in WT (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This &#x0201c;stumpy&#x0201d; morphology is not restricted to one particular cone type, as shown by labeling with zpr1, a double-cone-specific marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g003">3</xref>D). In five mutants (five alleles of <italic>mti,</italic> as well as <italic>gosh<sup>s341</sup>, pday<sup>s351</sup>, lim<sup>s382</sup>,</italic> and <italic>ssd<sup>s386</sup></italic>), all photoreceptors are lost before 6 dpf, except for a small population in the margins of the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g004">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g004">4</xref>J), where proliferation and differentiation of neuronal precursors continue throughout the life of the fish &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. This suggests that some of the newborn cells select the photoreceptor fate, but die shortly after beginning differentiation. In <italic>mti</italic> mutants, degeneration spreads to the outer part of the inner nuclear layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g004">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g004">4</xref>H). This mutant is also the only one in this class with defective VBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g004">Figure 4</xref>K), as examined further below.</p><p>Six of the seven photoreceptor-defective mutants appear normal in their VBA response to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g004">Figure 4</xref>K). This is a curious finding, as it may suggest that classical cone/rod-mediated photoreception is not strictly required for this neuroendocrine response. It is conceivable that the pineal gland, a light-sensing organ in the dorsal forebrain, may control the VBA instead of, or together with, the retina. We therefore asked if presence of the VBA correlated with an intact pineal in our photoreceptor-degeneration mutants. Both VBA-normal and VBA-defective mutants showed a normal pineal, based on expression of shared marker zpr1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010066-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). This suggests that none of the mutated genes found here are necessary for the maintenance of the pineal photoreceptors. Moreover, it implies that pineal photoreceptors are not sufficient to control the VBA.

In brief, initially light-adapted fish were placed in a dark environment for a period of 45 min and then tested for OKR after return to light. The recovery of visual responsiveness following the sudden transition from dark to light served as a convenient surrogate measurement for light adaptation, although we do not know how closely this paradigm mimics adaptation.

The reversed response is seen only when the grating rotates around the mutant, as in the OKR assay, because in this situation the direction of motion is opposite between the two eyes (e.g., temporal-to-nasal for the right eye and nasal-to-temporal for the left eye). In the OMR assay, both eyes are exposed to motion flowing in the same direction.

Another possible cause could be an as-yet unknown patterning defect in the brain, which is often found in ipsilateral RGC projection mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In <italic>darl<sup>s327</sup></italic> mutants, the ventral branch of the optic tract is completely missing, and with it AF-2, AF-3, and AF-6; the dorsal optic tract (with AF-4, AF-5, AF-7, AF-8, and AF-9) appears intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g007">Figures 7</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g008">8</xref>). The tectum has normal size and histology, but only its dorsal half is innervated at 7 dpf; the ventral half is devoid of retinal input. We asked if the dorsal RGCs, which project their axons to the ventral branch of the optic tact in WT fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g008">Figure 8</xref>A), are missing in <italic>darl<sup>s327</sup></italic> mutants. We detected differentiated RGCs throughout the retina, including the dorsal part (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010066-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Axon tracing, following injection of 3,3&#x02032;-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine (DiO) and 1,1&#x02032;-dioctadecyl-3,3,3&#x02032;,3&#x02032;- tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD) into the nasal-dorsal and temporal-ventral quadrants of the eye, respectively, revealed that the dorsally located RGCs project into the dorsal, instead of the ventral, branch of the optic tract, sharing the same route as the ventral RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). The absence of both the ventral optic tract and the ventral innervation of the tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g008">Figure 8</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g008">8</xref>D) suggests that the <italic>darl</italic> gene is required for specifying dorsal RGC fate. Positional information along the temporal-nasal axis of the retina seems unaltered in the mutant. Despite the severity of the anatomical defect, this mutant's OMR and OKR scores are not substantially reduced. The VBA, however, is severely disrupted, suggesting that this neuroendocrine behavior requires input from dorsally specified RGCs.</p><p>The mutants <italic>walk<sup>s536</sup>, exa<sup>s174</sup>,</italic> and <italic>miss<sup>s522</sup></italic> show specific axon targeting defects, best seen in, but not restricted to, AF-4. AF-4 is associated with the dorsal branch of the optic tract and normally has a well-ordered, compact structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g007">Figure 7</xref>E). In <italic>walk<sup>s536</sup></italic> and <italic>exa<sup>s174</sup>,</italic> AF-4 is overelaborated and located at a greater distance from the optic tract (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g007">Figure 7</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g007">7</xref>H). The tectum in the <italic>exa<sup>s174</sup></italic> mutant shows an abnormal shape, particularly in the ventral-posterior region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010066-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), and AF-9 is often missing or reduced (unpublished data). In <italic>miss<sup>s522</sup></italic> mutants, on the other hand, AF-4 and AF-9 are reduced in size or undetectable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g007">Figure 7</xref>I). This mutant is completely unresponsive to motion, while the <italic>walk<sup>s536</sup></italic> and <italic>exa<sup>s174</sup></italic> mutants show residual OKR and OMR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010066-t0101">Table 1</xref>). In all three mutants, AFs associated with the ventral tract appear normal. This observation, together with the finding that OMR and OKR are intact in <italic>darl<sup>s327</sup></italic> mutants, which lack the ventral tract, suggest that one or more AFs in the dorsal tract play a key role in OMR and OKR.</p><p>In <italic>mich<sup>s314</sup></italic> mutants, a subset of RGC axons make an abnormal turn shortly after crossing the midline and stall to form an ectopic AF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010066-g007">Figure 7</xref>J). The location of this new retinorecipient area is highly consistent among individual mutants.

In order to capture a large number of mutants, we screened almost 2,000 F2 families and cast a wide, dense net by screening with three complementary behavioral assays. We report here on the initial characterization of 53 specific mutations in 41 genes, only two of which had previously been described.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>OKR versus OMR versus VBA as Screening Assays</title><p>Choice of a suitable assay is paramount to the success of any genetic screen. We found that each of the three assays employed had its specific strengths and limitations. The OKR assay requires each fish to be mounted individually, dorsal side up, in methylcellulose and is therefore much more time-consuming than the OMR assay, for which each group of fish can just be poured into an elongated tank. The OKR assay therefore dictated the pace of the screen, and we were thus unable to test as many fish as with the OMR assay (and may therefore have missed some mutants). However, since the OKR assay records fish individually, whereas the OMR assay records a population, the OKR has the potential to find less-penetrant phenotypes than the OMR. In the primary screen, OMR and OKR assays each discovered a largely nonoverlapping set of visual mutants, which, upon retesting, showed defects in either assay. Thus, the high throughput of the OMR assay complemented the specificity of the OKR assay. This tradeoff also applies to genetic linkage mapping, which we have so far completed for 25 of the 41 loci. We found that the OMR is most useful for presorting of mutants, while the OKR is most suitable for the subsequent &#x0201c;weeding-out&#x0201d; of false positives. The VBA response, on the other hand, is extremely effective in sorting mutants for linkage mapping, but is less suited as a primary screening assay, because it is prone to missing important mutant classes. Screening with all three assays increased the likelihood of finding all mutants and often provided independent confirmation of a behavioral phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>How Many and What Kinds of Genes Control Visual Behavior?</title><p>We found that at least one-quarter, and probably more than half, of the behavioral mutations discovered here affect photoreception. Their phenotypes include defects in photoreceptor formation or maintenance, phototransduction, and adaptation to sudden light changes (whose likely cellular and molecular substrate is located in the outer retina). Another sizable fraction (at least a quarter) of mutations affect RGCs and their projections to the brain. As far as we can conclude so far from our ongoing analysis, mutations affecting the development of higher visual centers (beyond the retinofugal projections) are largely absent from our collection. This could mean that the genes involved in the formation of circuits in higher brain regions are either essential for embryonic development (i.e., their loss of function would lead to early lethality), or they are redundant, which would prevent their discovery by classical mutagenesis screens.</p><p>The number of genomes screened should have been sufficient to uncover at least one mutation in each gene of interest, based on the mutation rate measured in the F0 founder males. However, the empirical allele frequency clearly contradicts this optimistic scenario. Of the 41 loci in our collection, 35 are represented by a single allele and four by two alleles. The other two genes for which we found five alleles each, <italic>mti</italic> and <italic>wud,</italic> appear to be outliers. Excluding these two loci, and assuming that the probability of finding a mutation follows a Poisson distribution, the number of genes with no hits is estimated at about 150. This back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that our screen was not saturating, and that many more genes may be discovered using our approach. Potential obstacles to future screens include the intrinsic difficulty of detecting mutants in behavior, as opposed to, say, pigmentation (which was used to measure the mutation rate), and the low mutability of some loci, as has been observed in other large-scale zebrafish screens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Satisfyingly, we discovered new alleles of several previously identified genes. These include mutants falling within the limits of our screening criteria, such as <italic>bel</italic> and <italic>nof</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010066-t0101">Table 1</xref>), as well as others with more severe phenotypes, such as <italic>chk</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>bru</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>ome,</italic> and <italic>nok</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; (unpublished data). It is possible that some of our mutations have generated weak (or maternally rescued) alleles of housekeeping or other essential genes, although the molecular identification of the first set of genes shows that this is not generally the case.

Our behavioral screen focusing on the zebrafish visual system has achieved three major goals. First, the mutant phenotypes found here have revealed novel genes, or new functions for known genes, which can be identified by positional cloning. Second, these mutations provide novel tools to study central nervous system development and behavior, to localize functions in the brain and to explore the ways in which neuronal circuits reorganize in response to genetic perturbations. Third, our unbiased screen is yielding fundamental insight into the genetic architecture of brain functions and their pathologies. A mutational approach to circuit formation and function, while being an essential first step, should be complemented in the future by targeted manipulations of cells and synapses. Zebrafish are slated to become an excellent system for an integrated genetic approach to unravel cellular and molecular mechanisms of behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fish strains, mutagenesis, and screening.</title><p>We used fish from the TL strain for mutagenesis and crossed them to fish from the WIK strain for linkage mapping (see below).

Candidate markers showing co-segregation with the mutant pool were confirmed by PCR of single-fish DNA. Map position was further verified by demonstration of linkage to additional markers located in the presumed chromosomal region.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Complementation tests.</title><p>We completed classical complementation crosses among all mutants with similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010066-t0101">Table 1</xref>) or with reported mutants with similar phenotypes or similar map position (if available).

The pigmentation of the fish was visually scored in four grades to determine the VBA score, with 1 &#x0003d; normal (WT), 0.7 &#x0003d; slightly dark, 0.3 &#x0003d; intermediate dark, and 0 &#x0003d; strongly dark. In this scoring system, the previously discovered, RGC-deficient <italic>lakritz</italic> mutant scored 0 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; and served as a reference to calibrate the index. The VBA score for variably dark mutants was estimated by averaging over at least ten individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Recording of the OMR.</title><p>The OMR assay was conducted as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Visual stimuli were displayed on a flat-screen CRT monitor that faced upward. The stimuli, which consisted of moving sinusoidal gratings, were generated in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, United States), using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (<ext-link xlink:href="http://psychtoolbox.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://psychtoolbox.org</ext-link>). The gamma function of the CRT was measured using a Minolta LS-100 (Tokyo, Japan) light meter, and corrected using MATLAB. The images of the fish before and after each stimulus were captured by a digital still camera (Nikon CoolPix &#x0005b;Tokyo, Japan&#x0005d;), which was triggered by MATLAB using a set of serial commands. These images were downloaded from the camera offline and analyzed using custom macros in Object-Image (<ext-link xlink:href="http://simon.bio.uva.nl/object-image.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://simon.bio.uva.nl/object-image.html</ext-link>). Ten to 40 larvae (routinely 25) were placed in custom-built acrylic tanks, or &#x0201c;racetracks,&#x0201d; which allowed the larvae to swim in only two directions. Twelve racetracks were placed side by side on the monitor. After subtracting two consecutive images to remove the background, the position of each fish was determined by using the Analyze Particles function of Object-Image. The average position of the fish in each tank before a stimulus was then subtracted from the average position after 30 s of exposure to a standard motion stimulus. The OMR index of a recessive mutant was calculated for stimuli of 100&#x00025; and 75&#x00025; contrast by measuring the average distance swum by the 25&#x00025; weakest responders in a clutch, divided by the distance swum by the 75&#x00025; best responders. Each stimulus contrast and stimulus direction were repeated four times and the average OMR score was calculated offline.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Recording of the OKR.</title><p>The OKR assay was conducted as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. An animation of sine-wave gratings was projected on the internal wall of a drum (height, 6 cm; inner diameter, 5.6 cm), using an LCD projector (InFocus LP755 &#x0005b;Wilsonville, Oregon, United States&#x0005d;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. To focus the image at close distance, a wide-angle conversion lens (Kenko VC-050Hi &#x0005b;Tokyo, Japan&#x0005d;), a close-up lens (King CU&#x0002b;1 &#x0005b;Tokyo, Japan&#x0005d;), and a neutral density filter (Hoya ND4 &#x0005b;Tokyo, Japan&#x0005d;) were placed in front of the projector. Twelve zebrafish larvae were immobilized in 2.5&#x00025; methylcellulose in E3 egg water with their dorsal sides up in the inverted lid of a 3.5-cm diameter petri dish and placed into the center of the drum. The fish were imaged using a dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ-800) and a CCD camera (Cohu MOD8215&#x02013;1300 &#x0005b;Tokyo, Japan&#x0005d;) to observe horizontal eye movements. Sinewave gratings with a spatial frequency of 20&#x000b0; per cycle moving at 10&#x000b0;/s were used. Image-J (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) was used for both stimulus generation and image analysis. Images were captured via an LG-3 video capture board (Scion; <ext-link xlink:href="http://scioncorp.com" ext-link-type="uri">http://scioncorp.com</ext-link>) at two frames per second with Scion Java Package 1.0 for Image-J Windows. A custom-programmed Image-J plug-in (A. M., unpublished data) was used to calculate the changes in eye angles. The OKR index of a mutant was defined here as the saccade number per minute divided by the saccade number per minute observed in WT.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Surrogate light adaptation assay.</title><p>The dynamics of OKR in response to sudden changes in illumination was measured as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Fish larvae were put in the dark for 45 min to let them dark-adapt, then subjected to the OKR recording at 2, 8, 15, and 30 min after return to a bright environment (2,400 cd/m<sup>2</sup> underneath the larvae; 400&#x02013;600 cd/m<sup>2</sup> at the internal drum wall, where the visual stimulus was projected).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Recording of spontaneous swimming activity.</title><p>Spontaneous swimming activity was measured as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010066-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Larvae at 7 dpf were tested in groups of six fish in a rectangular compartment (3 cm &#x000d7; 7.5 cm) of a four-well, clear acrylic plate (12.8 cm &#x000d7; 7.7 cm &#x0005b;Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark&#x0005d;). Fish images were captured by a digital camcorder (Sony TRV-9 &#x0005b;San Diego, California, United States&#x0005d;) at a rate of 0.5 Hz for 20 min in Adobe Premiere. Recorded movies were analyzed using Image-J. Each frame was subtracted (pixel by pixel) from the previous frame to extract the fish that moved during the inter-frame interval. Spontaneous activity was quantified by counting the number of moving fish across all frames. The SSA index was calculated by dividing the number of movement episodes seen in mutants by that seen in WT siblings.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Histology and immunohistochemistry.</title><p>Zebrafish larvae were fixed in 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 &#x000b0;C for 2&#x02013;16 h, transferred to 30&#x00025; sucrose in PBS plus 0.02&#x00025; NaN<sub>3</sub> for 16 h or more, mounted in O.

OMR and OKR performance is not correlated to VBA index.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0010066.g002"/></fig><fig id="pgen-0010066-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Example of a Mutant with Abnormal Morphology of Cone Photoreceptors</title><p>Photoreceptors in a retinal section stained with DAPI (A and B) and a marker for double cones, zpr1 (C and D) at 7 dpf in WT larva (A, C, and E) and <italic>yoi<sup>s121</sup></italic> mutant retina (B, D, and F).
