The generation of cortical neurons is a tightly orchestrated process that involves the commitment of multipotent stem cells to lineage-restricted progenitors, progression of progenitors to postmitotic neurons and their subsequent migration to correct layer positions. The molecular mechanisms that underlie many of these early events are being unraveled. Accordingly, genetic mechanisms involving proneural genes <italic>Ngn1/2 </italic>and the homeodomain gene <italic>Pax6 </italic>have been implicated in the specification of pyramidal neurons. Similarly, proneural gene <italic>Mash1 </italic>and homeodomain genes <italic>Dlx 1</italic>, <italic>2 </italic>that are specific to basal ganglia are known to direct the specification of cortical interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the intrinsic regulators, numerous extrinsic signals that influence the cortical progenitors and neurons have been identified. Among these, chemokines are known to exert regulatory roles in the developing nervous system. Stromal derived factor (SDF-1), an alpha chemokine, has been identified in the developing and adult brain. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies and histological examinations have shown that SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 are constitutively expressed in the developing and adult cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although most chemokines are promiscuous in their ability to bind to different receptors, SDF-1 is a notable exception as it is the only known ligand that can bind to CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], a G-protein coupled receptor.</p><p>Interestingly, mutant mice that lack SDF-1, or its receptor CXCR4, die soon after birth with major developmental anomalies, including defects in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While these mutants have reduced cortical thickness the cerebellum and hippocampus show anomalous development. In the present study, using low concentrations of SDF-1, or AMD3100 in rat primary cultures we demonstrate that chemokine signaling regulates cell proliferation, at least in part through a mechanism involving intercellular communication. Further, SDF-1 enables the morphological differentiation of cortical glutamatergic neurons by inducing axon elongation and branching, and concurrently aids the neurochemical differentiation of GABAergic neurons. Finally, cortical cultures derived from CXCR4 mutants also indicate reduced cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation with fewer GABAergic neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SDF-1 maintains proliferation in primary cortical cultures</title><p>Stromal derived factor-1 is expressed in the developing telencephalon at a time when cell proliferation and differentiation are key events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To investigate the role of SDF-1 signaling in cortical cell proliferation, rat E17 primary cultures were exposed to a chronic treatment of chemokine medium (4&#x02013;6 nM). Subsequent examination of cultures displayed a significant increase in the number of proliferating cells, as revealed by Ki67 immunocytochemistry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>; <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, n = 4 experiments). Conversely, treatment with 40 &#x003bc;m of AMD3100, the receptor antagonist, reduced cell proliferation (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, n = 4 experiments). Further, to determine whether chemokine delays the progenitors from exiting the cell cycle cortical cultures were pulsed with BrdU for 1 hr and examined after 5 days of treatment. Analysis of these cultures for cells that contained BrdU but were negative for Ki67 (BrdU+/Ki67-) showed the fraction of BrdU labeled cells that exited the cell cycle to become either postmitotic or quiescent. Accordingly, 91% of the BrdU labeled cells in control cultures were postmitotic compared to 81% after SDF-1 treatment (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, n = 4 experiments), suggesting that the chemokine maintains the progenitors in proliferation. To ensure the presence of applied SDF-1 in culture medium, chemokine concentration was measured using ELISA after each application of treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Medium collected from control cultures showed the concentration of endogenous SDF-1 increasing from approximately 0.15 nM to 0.4 nM in 3 days (n = 2 experiments). However, treatment with AMD3100 appeared to prevent the baseline chemokine levels from rising above 0.15 nM, whereas application of SDF-1 medium caused a cumulative increase to a maximum concentration of 0.8 nM.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>SDF-1 signaling regulates cortical cell proliferation.

Thus, cultures pulsed with BrdU before the application of treatment corresponding to D1, D3, D5, or 24 hr after D5 were maintained for 1 hr and fixed for analysis (see illustration in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). BrdU labeling of cultures grown in chemokine medium showed an increased rate of proliferation after 48 hr, which continued to remain high at both days 4 and 5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d, e</xref>; <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, n = 3 experiments). To further illustrate the regulatory role of SDF-1 in cell proliferation, a cell cluster analysis was performed. In brief, rat E17 intact cortex was pulsed with BrdU for 1 hr prior to dissociation and the resulting cell suspension was mixed with non-BrdU labeled cells. This resulted in a culture containing clusters of BrdU+ cells in a larger population of unlabeled cells. Because BrdU is passed on to each daughter cell during mitosis the number of progeny in each cluster will provide an estimate of cell division; only those clusters that were separated by a minimum distance of 300 &#x003bc;m were included in the analysis. Initial analysis of cultures maintained in serum-free defined medium (DM1) showed BrdU+ clusters of 2 cells that increased to 3 after 24 hr (DM2, prior to commencing treatment). Cultures grown in control, SDF-1 medium or AMD3100 were analyzed after 2 or 5 days in treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f, g</xref>). Clusters in control cultures contained 3 cells on average, whereas exposure to SDF-1 medium markedly increased the average cluster size to 6.5 cells by day 2 (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, n = 27 clusters,) and 6.2 cells by day 5 (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, n = 18 clusters). We next investigated whether SDF-1 at the applied concentration promotes cell survival, or prevents cell death, which might in part explain its role in proliferation. To assess cytotoxicity, medium was collected on each day of the treatment and assayed for released LDH activity (n = 3 experiments). As shown in a representative experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), the levels of LDH in control and AMD3100 treated cultures increased over time, suggesting a progressive increase in cytotoxicity due to cell death or stress. By contrast, the degree of toxicity in SDF-1 treated cultures remained largely unchanged over the course of the experiment. In a separate study we sought to determine if SDF-1 promotes the survival of cortical cultures (n = 3 experiments). However, MTT assays performed on end point cultures did not indicate a significant difference in survival between control and treatment groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cell death and cell survival assays.

Earlier reports have shown that cortical progenitors express gap junctions and their proteins, connexins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, more recent studies have highlighted that connexin-mediated gap junction channels and open hemichannels in non-junctional membranes are two biologically relevant mechanisms by which progenitors can coordinate their responses to the extracellular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, we postulated that treatment with SDF-1 might regulate cell proliferation, at least in part through hemichannels or through docked gap junction channels in cortical progenitors. To test this hypothesis a multi-experimental approach was adopted. First, Cx 43 expression was measured in cortical cultures following exposure to SDF-1. Second, cell proliferation was assayed using Ki67 immunocytochemistry in cultures grown in SDF-1 medium in concert with carbenoxalone to block both connexin hemichannels and gap junction channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Third, intercellular dye-transfer was assessed in cortical explants using a modified scrape-load technique. Finally, spontaneous Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients were measured in cortical explants using real time imaging.</p><p>To measure Cx 43 protein expression, control and treated cortical cultures were processed for quantitative immunocytochemistry. Analysis showed a marked increase in Cx 43 protein expression in cultures exposed to chemokine medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>; <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, n = 40 fields). Interestingly, strong expression of connexin was noted outlining the cell surfaces as 'plaques' (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref> green; arrows), typical of gap junction channels; in controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>) and AMD3100 treated cultures (data not shown) the pattern of staining was punctate. To determine whether SDF-1 regulates cell proliferation through connexin channels, E17 cortical cultures were treated with 10 &#x003bc;M carbenoxalone. Subsequent processing for Ki67 staining revealed diminished proliferation in cultures that were exposed to carbenoxalone alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d, e, g</xref><italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, n = 35 fields), or together with SDF-1 medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d, f, h</xref><italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, n = 22 fields). This clearly illustrates that SDF-1 mediates cell proliferation at least in part through connexin hemichannels or gap junction channels. Consistent with this finding further reduction in proliferation was noted in cultures grown together with AMD3100 and carbenoxalone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>SDF-1 regulates connexin 43 expression and intercellular coupling.

Briefly, cortical explants that were whole mounted with ventricular surface on the top were scrape-loaded with a mixture of LY and rhodamine dextran. The extent of LY transfer was then quantified into a coupling index (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i&#x02013;m</xref>). Remarkably, explants that were maintained in SDF-1 medium showed a 2-fold increase in dye-transfer compared to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3j&#x02013;m</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, n = 15 explants). Finally, to measure the spontaneous Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients in VZ cells, cortical explants exposed to either acute (15 min) or chronic (24 hr) SDF-1 treatment were loaded with Oregon Green BAPTA, a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>indicator and analyzed using real time imaging. Images were collected every second and changes in the average intensity were converted into a 'cell coupling score' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Interestingly, exposure of cortical explants to either acute or chronic chemokine treatment significantly increased the frequency of synchronized Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients between adjacent VZ cells (acute treatment: Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3n</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05, n = 19 pairs of cells; chronic treatment: Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3o</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, n = 33 pairs of cells). To confirm that the coupling was indeed in the cortical VZ, explants were subsequently fixed and processed for Ki67 immunocytochemistry (data not shown). Taken together, these results illustrate that SDF-1 signaling regulates intercellular coupling and Cx 43 protein expression in cortical progenitors. Although, it is very likely that the coupled progenitors express Cx 43 the contribution of other connexins cannot be ruled out.</p></sec><sec><title>SDF-1 signaling regulates the differentiation of cortical neurons</title><p>To investigate the role of SDF-1 signaling in regulating neuronal differentiation, rat E17 cortical cultures were immunolabeled for Neu-N, a neuron specific marker. Analysis did not indicate a significant difference in the output of neurons between control and treatment groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), suggesting that the chemokine does not affect the differentiation of glutamatergic neurons, which constitute 80&#x02013;85% of all cortical neurons as has been shown in both <italic>in vivo </italic>and in <italic>vitro </italic>studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Next, to examine whether SDF-1 signaling regulates the differentiation of cortical GABAergic neurons cultures were processed for GABA immunocytochemistry. Interestingly, a 2-fold increase in GABA+ neurons was noted in cultures grown in SDF-1 medium compared to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b&#x02013;d</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, n = 47 fields). Recent studies have implicated a role for Shh signaling in the differentiation of cortical GABAergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As SDF-1 has been shown to modulate Shh signaling in the developing cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] we reasoned that a similar mechanism might regulate the differentiation of cortical GABAergic neurons. Thus, cortical cultures were exposed to cyclopamine, a Shh antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], alone or in the presence of SDF-1 medium. Although, application of cyclopamine to control cultures did not show a marked difference in the output of neurons as indicated by Neu-N staining, an increase was noted in the expression of GABA+ neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, n = 23 fields). Further, cultures grown in SDF-1 medium together with cyclopamine also showed elevated GABA expression, similar to the response noted with either of the treatments alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, n = 33 fields).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>SDF-1 regulates the differentiation of cortical neurons.

Thus, to examine whether the chemokine exerts a similar regulatory mechanism in the developing cortex, E17 cultures were transfected with GFP to randomly label cells. A transfection efficiency of 20&#x02013;25 GFP+ cells/coverslip was chosen for the morphological analysis of neurite outgrowth. Following transfection, cortical cultures were maintained in control, SDF-1 medium or AMD3100 as described previously. Although, the longest neurite was defined as an axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], immunocytochemistry was performed to label neurofilaments that are specific to axons (data not shown). Quantitative analysis confirmed that GFP+ neurons grown in SDF-1 medium showed a greater degree of morphological differentiation with elongated axons compared to those grown in control conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a&#x02013;f</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05, n = 45 cells). Further, SDF-1 increased the frequency of axon branching, however the treatment did not alter the number of branches, at least at the low concentrations of chemokine used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5g</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, chi-square test, n = 45). To characterize the phenotype of GFP+ neurons, control and treated cultures were labeled for GABA immunoreactivity. Interestingly, 95% of GFP+ neurons in both groups were GABA negative, thus confirming their glutamatergic origin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a, b</xref>). Further, cortical glutamatergic pyramidal neurons are known to have extended axons; this also alludes to the phenotype of GFP+ neurons in treated cultures as glutamatergic neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>SDF-1 promotes axon elongation and branching in cortical neurons.

Analysis of mutant cultures revealed diminished output in both the total neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7c</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, n = 68 fields) and GABAergic population compared to wild type controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7d</xref>, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, n = 45 fields). Previous studies have indicated reduced cortical thickness in CXCR4-/- mutants with no gross defect. Consistent with the earlier findings, staining of E15 mutant brain sections (n = 3 mutants) for Ki67 indicated a mild anomaly in the proliferative population [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Line-scan analysis of immunolabeled sections (n = 5 representative sections/brain) showed reduced pixel intensity (approximately 20%) in mutant cortex compared to wild type [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Although, examination of wild type and mutant brain sections did not show a notable difference in neuronal staining [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>], labeling for GABA displayed an altered pattern of immunoreactivity. Typically, GABAergic neurons that originate in the ventral telencephalon migrate tangentially through the subventricular zone, intermediate zone and marginal zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, in the mutants the marginal zone contained distinctly fewer GABA+ neurons while the intermediate zone appeared to have increased immunoreactivity compared to those in wild type tissue [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Similar pattern of staining was observed with calbindin, also a marker of migrating cortical GABAergic neurons (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Proliferation and differentiation are reduced in E15 CXCR4-/- cortical cultures.

The synthesized cRNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix rat genome RG-230v2 microarrays according to the manufactures guidelines. Following background correction and normalization, the intensities of the biological replicates were averaged to obtain the mean expression value for each transcript in all experimental conditions. Thus, every data point in figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a&#x02013;d</xref> represents the average of three independent hybridizations (biological replicates). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref> illustrates the change in the mean expression level of all hybridized transcripts (31,042 probes). The dataset was then filtered using a threshold for expression level and fold change to generate a list of 584 transcripts. Of these, 12% of the transcripts showed an upregulated expression greater than 2-fold following treatment with SDF-1, while 37% displayed an intermediate expression that was less than 2-fold (transcripts between fold lines x2 and x1; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>). By contrast, 72% of the probes showed a near 2-fold down regulation in response to AMD3100 treatment (transcripts between fold lines/2 and x1; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8c</xref>). The filtered data was further processed using K-means with Pearson correlation and pre-specified number of clusters to group transcripts into sets of clusters.

The increase in the number of BrdU+ cells in defined medium suggests a cell cycle length of 20&#x02013;24 hr consistent with earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our experiments indicate that the progenitors are likely to have divided asymmetrically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] to yield 3- cell clusters in defined medium, which then continued to generate clusters of 6.5 cells after 48 hr in SDF-1 treatment. In support of this view, quantitative estimation of cells that were BrdU+/Ki67- suggests that SDF-1 impedes the progenitors from exiting the cell cycle. By contrast, the proportion of dividing cells in control cultures was less, as many would have exited the cell cycle to become either postmitotic or quiescent. Taken together, it is evident that SDF-1, at concentrations less than 10 nM, maintains the cortical progenitors in proliferation and possibly enables their survival by reducing cytotoxicity. However, it is less likely for the treatment to have shortened the cell cycle time, or switched the mode of cell division from asymmetric to symmetric division. It is pertinent to note that in the proliferation of cerebellar granule cells the mitogenic potency of SDF-1 is only apparent in concert with Shh, a potent mitogen expressed by Purkinje neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study has highlighted that SDF-1 induces the proliferation of cortical neurospheres that were expanded in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a known mitogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Remarkably, the mitogenic effect of SDF-1 noted in our preparations has close parallels to the activity of bFGF in rat cortical cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Accordingly, the growth factor maintains the progenitors in cycle by increasing the number of cell divisions, stimulates the quiescent cells into proliferation and enables their survival without shortening the length of cell cycle. Although, a direct link between SDF-1 and bFGF is yet to be shown, it is more likely that both factors share common downstream signaling mechanisms that facilitate the proliferation of cortical progenitors. Notably, ERK1/2 and PI-3 kinase pathways have been implicated in the SDF-1 induced proliferation of bFGF- expanded neurospheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In agreement with the data from antagonist experiments in rat cultures, examination of CXCR4-/- cultures showed diminished mitotic activity and increased cell death. Further, staining of mutant brain sections for Ki67 immunoreactivity revealed a minor anomaly in cell proliferation consistent with the earlier finding of reduced cortical thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Earlier studies have demonstrated that cortical progenitors are coupled by a network of gap junction channels that regulate the entry of dividing cells into S-phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, it is now evident that undocked connexin hemichannels distributed in the progenitors during late G<sub>1 </sub>or S-phase propagate spontaneous Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients that may modulate proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In our experiments treatment with SDF-1 significantly increased the cortical progenitor population (Ki67+ cells), which declined sharply when exposed to carbenoxalone, a blocker of both connexin hemichannels and gap junction channels. Further, treatment of cortical cultures with chemokine medium increased Cx 43 immunoreactivity with a pattern of staining that was robust and predominantly localized to the cell surface. Thus, to distinguish whether chemokine treatment influences the undocked connexin hemichannels or gap junction channels, LY dye transfer experiments were performed in whole mounted cortical explants. Interestingly, the scrape-load technique clearly illustrated that in the presence of SDF-1 medium the degree of dye transfer was significantly more on both sides of the scrape line compared to control explants. Although, a few cells at the ventricular surface were filled with LY, possibly through open hemichannels, they were located away from the scrape line in both control and SDF-1 treated explants. Open hemichannels are known to be prevalent in lower Ca<sup>2+ </sup>conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], thus few undocked channels may have remained open in our preparations as they were maintained in regular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>containing medium. In this context, our calcium imaging experiments corroborate the LY dye transfer data. As Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients were recorded from cells that were positioned within a depth of three layers from the VZ surface, it is very likely these cells were in late G<sub>2</sub>, M or early G<sub>1 </sub>phase of the cell cycle. Based on the premise that connexin hemichannels are distributed on the membranes of progenitors in late G<sub>1 </sub>or S-phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the spontaneous Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients recorded in our experiments are likely to have propagated through gap junction channels.</p></sec><sec><title>SDF-1 mediated differentiation of cortical neurons</title><p>Our experiments showed that SDF-1 treatment significantly up regulates the differentiation of GABAergic neurons, including the calretinin subtype. Although chemokine treatment has been shown to promote the survival of neurons in other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], we believe that alone cannot increase the differentiation of GABAergic neurons. A growing body of evidence now suggests that cortical progenitors do have the competency to generate GABAergic neurons <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, while the work of Gulacsi and Lillien showed that the balance between the inductive and repressive signals of Shh and BMP, respectively, determines the expression of GABA+ neurons, Nery and colleagues have illustrated that cortical progenitors are competent to express <italic>Dlx 2 in vitro</italic>. In light of these earlier reports, it is plausible for the chemokine signaling to have induced the generation of cortical GABAergic neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, staining of control and treated cultures for BrdU and GABA immunocytochemistry did not yield a quantifiable co-labeling to suggest that GABAergic neurons were generated <italic>in vitro </italic>(data not shown). Thus, it is conceivable that SDF-1 induced the expression of GABA in postmitotic neurons that were yet to assume a neurotransmitter identity. Alternatively, a subset of cortical glutamatergic neurons may have transiently expressed GABA in response to chemokine treatment. Although, our experiments illustrated an increase in GABA+ neurons in response to SDF-1, it is not known whether these cells function as inhibitory interneurons, or would continue to express GABA in the absence of chemokine signaling. Further, the effects of SDF-1 and antagonist treatment were notably evident in the cortical calretinin population. Calretinin, a marker of preplate cells during early development is later expressed in a subset of GABAergic neurons. Because our rat cultures were derived from embryos of mid corticogenesis stage, it is less likely for the chemokine treatment to have induced the differentiation of preplate neurons. Moreover, the majority of calretinin+ neurons in our cultures appeared bipolar in shape, suggesting a GABAergic lineage in contrast to the preplate cells that exhibit multipolar morphology <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, cortical cultures derived from CXCR4-/- mice also showed diminished neuronal differentiation and importantly fewer GABAergic neurons. Consistent with these culture experiments, examination of E15 mutant brain sections showed distinctly fewer GABA+ neurons in the marginal zone compared to wild type tissue. It is possible that loss of chemokine signaling may have dispersed or misdirected the movement of a subset of neurons from the marginal zone towards the intermediate zone, as an increase in GABA immunoreactivity was noted in the latter region. In this context, it is pertinent to note that secreted SDF-1 in the meninges enhances the dispersion of a subset of Cajal-Retzius cells derived from cortical hem and that loss of chemokine activity causes disorganization of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Sonic hedgehog signaling has been implicated in the generation of cortical GABAergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, in our experiments blocking of Shh signaling with cyclopamine increased the output of GABA+ neurons alone or in concert with SDF-1. This suggests, unlike in cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], SDF-1 signaling does not interact synergistically with Shh, at least for the differentiation of GABAergic neurons.</p><p>A noteworthy finding was the elongation of axons of cortical projection neurons in cultures exposed to chemokine medium. In addition, neurons that showed axon branching with one or more collaterals were prevalent in cultures grown in SDF-1 medium. Similar findings have been reported in cultured cerebellar granule neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Accordingly, both groups of neurons responded differently to SDF-1 treatment depending largely on the applied dosage; lower concentrations of chemokine induced axon elongation in cerebellar granule neurons with apparently no change in the number of branches, while higher concentrations abolished the effects. It is relevant to note that the concentration of chemokine used in our experiments was much lower and closer to the physiological limits than those used in earlier studies. What might be the significance of SDF-1 mediated regulation of cortical axons? A recent study has highlighted that SDF-1 through its G-protein coupled receptor modulates the repellent activities of Slit-2 in cultured retinal ganglion cell axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Given that Slit-1, a repellent of cortical axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], closely follows the endogenous expression of SDF-1 in the developing cortex raises the possibility that the chemokine might modulate the repressive signals and provide a permissive environment for the cortical afferents.</p></sec><sec><title>Down stream gene activation of SDF-1 signaling</title><p>Using gene chip analysis together with qRT-PCR, we have explored the activation of downstream genes following chemokine treatment in cortical cultures.

Our results demonstrate that exogenous SDF-1, at low concentrations, can exert a mitogenic effect by retaining the cortical progenitors in proliferation possibly through enhanced intercellular communication. Concurrent to its role in proliferation, chemokine signaling regulates the morphological differentiation of cortical glutamatergic neurons and enables the neurochemical differentiation of GABAergic neurons.

Primer and probes were designed and chosen using the Roche Applied Science Probe Finder software v2.10.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To determine the level of significance between control and various treatments, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used with Bonferroni's posttest correction. To compare the significance between two parametric variables, Student's unpaired t-test was performed while for the analysis of categorical variables (branched or unbranched axons) chi-square analysis was used. Error bar in graphs represent standard error of the mean and *, **, ***, indicates significance at p &#x0003c; 0.05, p &#x0003c; 0.01 and p &#x0003c; 0.001, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SDF-1: Stromal derived factor-1, BrdU: 5 bromodeoxyuridine, E17: embryonic day 17, VZ: ventricular zone, ELISA: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, DM: defined medium, LY: Lucifer yellow, Cx 43: connexin 43, GABA: gamma aminobutyric acid, Shh: sonic hedgehog, qRT-PCR: quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction.
