Oxidative DNA damage including strand breaks and oxidative base lesions are specifically repaired by base excision repair pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The first step in this pathway is carried out by a lesion-specific DNA glycosylase, which cleaves the N-glycosidic bond between the base and deoxyribose sugar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The most abundant and highly mutagenic oxidative DNA damage lesion is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-G or GO) that can form base-pair with adenine or cytosine during DNA replication to produce a G:C to T:A transversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, MutT, MutM (Fpg), MutY, MutS, and Nei (End VIII) are involved in defending against the mutagenic effects of 8-oxoG lesions [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The MutT protein has pyrophosphohydrolase activity, which eliminates 8-oxo-dGTP from the nucleotide pool. MutM glycosylase (Fpg protein) removes both mutagenic GO adducts and ring-opened purine lesions paired with cytosines. MutS and MutY increase replication fidelity by removing the adenines misincorporated opposite GO or G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and thus reduce G:C to T:A transversions. Nei can excise GO, when GO is paired opposite a cytosine or adenine and can serve as a backup pathway to repair 8-oxoG in the absence of MutM and MutY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Unlike most DNA glycosylases, MutY does not target a damaged base, but a normal base, e.g., removing A mispaired with GO, C, and 5-hydroxyuracil [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]]. In addition, MutY can excise guanines from G/GO mismatches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. MutY also binds tightly to DNA containing T/GO and C/GO, however, it exhibits no catalytic activity on them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The N-terminal domain of EcMutY retains the catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] while the C-terminal domain of MutY plays an important role in the recognition of GO lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The X-ray crystal structures of EcMutY catalytic domain with bound adenine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and intact <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus </italic>MutY (Bs-MutY) bound to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] show that MutY distorts the bound DNA substrate and the mismatched A is flipped out of the helix. In the active site pocket of EcMutY, seven amino acids (R19, E37, L40, N140, Q182, M185, and D186) are involved in adenine binding (filled circles in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. V45 and Q182 of EcMutY are proposed to be key residues in determining substrate specificity. V45 is considered to be important for glycosylase activity because V45N is inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and is conserved among MutY family members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Q182 forms a hydrogen bond with adenine at the domain interface of EcMutY, but is less conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence Alignment</bold>.

The substrate specificity of Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I is in the order: U/G = T/G &#x0003e; G/G &#x0003e; T/C = U/C &#x0003e; A/G. In the binding pocket for the target base, Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I shares six out of seven residues of EcMutY's adenine binding (R19, E37, L40, N140, Q182, M185, and D186). The only non-conserved residue in this binding pocket is Q182 of EcMutY, which corresponds to L187 of Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Interestingly, Fondufe-Mittendorf <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] could convert Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I into a MutY-like glycosylase with altered substrate preference of Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I from T/G to A/G by replacing two residues (A50V and L187Q) in the substrate binding pocket.

V45A, Q182L, and V45A/Q182L mutant proteins have reduced binding affinity and glycosylase activity to DNA containing A/G or A/GO mismatches. These mutants are impaired to complement <italic>E. coli mutY </italic>mutants <italic>in vivo</italic>. The affinities to T/G dramatically increased in V45A and Q182L mutants, but not in the V45A/Q182L double mutant. However, V45A, Q182L, and V45A/Q182L mutant proteins do not exhibit glycosylase activity towards T/G or T/GO. Therefore, V45 and Q182 of EcMutY are important for the adenine-specific activity of EcMutY.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Selection of EcMutY mutation</title><p>The study by Fondufe-Mittendorf <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] indicates that the substrate preference of Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I can be altered from T/G to A/G by replacing two residues (A50V and L187Q) in the substrate binding pocket. Their results are in agreement that V45 and Q182 of EcMutY are the key determinants of adenine specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. According to the adenine soaked EcMutY structure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], V45 is located in the minor-groove reading &#x003b1;2&#x02013;&#x003b1;3 motif (37-EVMLQQTQ<underline>V</underline>-45) and Q182 is located in the adenine recognition &#x003b1;10 motif (182-<underline>Q</underline>AMMD-186). Interestingly, the proximity of V45 and Q182 to adenine in EcMutY structure closely correlates with the BsMutY structure with the DNA product and cleaved adenine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the residues corresponding to Val45 and Gln182 in D144N BsMutY with A/GO-containing DNA (so called the lesion recognition complex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] do not directly make contacts with the adenine of the A/GO mismatch. In the later structure, the Val seems to be positioned below the adenine, but the Glu188 of BsMutY (corresponding to Glu182 of EcMutY) is far away from adenine. The fact that there are differences in adenine recognition among various MutY structures raises a question whether these residues really are involved directly in adenine recognition. To determine whether these two residues are important for adenine recognition and excision, we carried out targeted mutagenesis study to determine the effect of EcMutY V45A, Q182L, and double mutant on repair of A/G- and A/GO-containing DNA. We also further determined whether their substrate specificity is altered in terms of binding or catalysis of T/G or T/GO mismatches.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>(A). <italic>E. coli </italic>MutY structure bound to adenine base (RCSB ID 1MUD) with thymine docked into the binding pocket as proposed by Mol <italic>et al. </italic></bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]<bold> for Mig.MthI</bold>.

First, we determined the active site concentrations of these proteins by performing A/GO binding with DNA concentrations which are at least 17-fold higher than their estimated dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows the average results from two independent experiments with 8 nM of A/GO-DNA. The increase in wild-type (WT) EcMutY binding reached a maximum at a concentration about 25 nM of MutY and 5.44 nM DNA was bound (68% of 8 nM). This horizontal line intercepts with the slope line of initial rate at 8 nM of MutY. Thus, the WT EcMutY preparation is 68% active. Similar analyses showed that V45A, Q182L, and V45A/Q182L were 48%, 25%, and 40% active, respectively. Dissociation constant value for each mutant was determined with nine enzyme concentrations by at least three independent experiments (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Because MutY displays a high affinity for its products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d </italic></sub>values measure its affinities to a mixture of the substrate and the product. Compared to wild-type EcMutY of which the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d </italic></sub>to A/G is 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.11 nM, the V45A and Q182L mutants had <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d </italic></sub>values of 6.1 &#x000b1; 1.7 and 8.9 &#x000b1; 5.0 nM, respectively. The <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d </italic></sub>value (15 &#x000b1; 2 nM) of V45A/Q182L double mutant was higher than the single mutants. Thus, the affinities to A/G of V45A, Q182L, and V45A/Q182L are weakened by 5-, 7-, and 12-fold, respectively. For A/GO binding, V45A and Q182L mutations resulted in a 94- and 11-fold increase in <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d </italic></sub>values, respectively. The V45A/Q182L double mutation resulted in a 102-fold increase in <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d </italic></sub>value (i.e. 102-fold weaker binding affinity). Thus, V45A is more defective in A/GO binding than A/G binding as compared to wild-type MutY. It is interesting to note that the double mutant exhibited an additive reduction in binding to both the A/G and A/GO as for the single mutants. These results confirm that V45 and Q182 play important but independent roles in adenine binding.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Active site titration of wild-type EcMutY by binding to A/GO-containing DNA</bold>.

The geometry or architecture of the substrate binding pocket in the V45A/Q182L double mutant may not favor thymine binding. For T/GO binding, V45A, Q182L, and V45A/Q182L mutants showed similar <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d </italic></sub>values as wild-type EcMutY (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), indicating that the T/GO binding affinity of EcMutY does not involve V45 and Q182. This result is consistent with the findings of Li <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] that tight T/GO binding is controlled by the C-terminal domain of EcMutY.</p><p>Because Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I T/G glycosylase can be converted to an A/G glycosylase by replacing two residues (A50V and L187Q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we examined the glycosylase activities of Vl45A, Q182L, and V45A/Q182L on T/G and T/GO. None of the EcMutY mutants showed any T/G and T/GO glycosylase activity at enzyme concentration up to 1 &#x003bc;M under different buffers and temperatures (data now shown). Therefore, recognition and glycosylase of EcMutY mutants to T/G and T/GO are controlled by different mechanisms.</p><p>The previous success to mutate Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I into MutY-like enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] is in contrast to our failure to covert EcMutY to thymine glycosylase. It is possible that it is easier to catalyze adenine removal than thymine excision. It is interesting to point out that wild-type Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I is a weak adenine glycosylase and Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I with A50V/L187Q mutation becomes a stronger adenine glycosylase. However, wild-type EcMutY has no thymine glycosylase activity and V45A/Q182L mutant may be harder to gain this activity. In addition, the active site of Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I is more relaxed for both purine and pyrimidine excision while MutY is more strict to excise purines. The difference in the base removal by these two enzymes may be contributed by other residues surrounding the active site.</p><p>By aligning MutY and Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and inspecting the structures of Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], EcMutY catalytic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] with docked thymine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), we predicted that several residues may contribute to their difference in activities. The thymine docked into the EcMutY active site preserves the proposed edge-on hydrogen bonding interaction with the conserved glutamate (E37, E42 in Mig.MthI) and can support a potential hydrogen bond with a tyrosine in a potential S120Y mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). It is clear from Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> that the MutY active site poorly accommodates the methyl group of thymine relative to the Mig.MthI active site. In the present study, one important mutation (Q182L) has been created. Based on our observations and the models shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, the subsequent mutations most likely to promote the conversion of MutY into a thymine glycosylase would be Q25R and L22F. These two mutations would complete the methyl-binding pocket and stabilize the interaction with thymine. In addition, an S120Y mutation, which would provide an additional hydrogen bond (i.e. to the O2 of thymine) might further enhance any thymine glycosylase activity resulting from the Q182L, Q25R, and L22F mutations. However, such predictions highlight the difficulty inherent in designing proteins with novel activities. In particular, it has been shown that Y126S mutation of Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I inactivates T/G mismatch-specific glycosylase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], however, the presence of Tyr in BsMutY indicates that Tyr may not be the only key residue for T/G catalytic activity. Similarly, BsMutY contains R31 to accommodate the methyl group of thymine relative to the Mig.MthI active site, but does not excise thymine.</p><p>Recently, a bifuncional MutY-like glycosylase, TthMutY, has been shown to have strong A/GO and G/GO activities, comparatively weak T/GO and A/G activities, and no T/G glycosylase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Unlike Mig.MthI, TthMutY and EcMutY contain extra C-terminal domains which facilitate their recognition of the mispaired GO base. V42 and Q170 of TthMutY are identical with the corresponding residues in EcMutY (V45 and Q182) but different from A50 and L187 of Mig.MthI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Although TthMutY has weak T/GO glycosylase activity, its L19 and Q39 residues, which correspond to F27 and R47 of Mig.MthI, respectively, are also conserved in EcMutY and BsMutY. This suggests that F27 and R47 of Mig.MthI may not be absolutely required for T/G or T/GO glycosylase activity. Interestingly, Y112S TthMutY mutant lost the thymine glycosylase activity supporting that Y126 of Mig.<italic>Mth</italic>I may be important for T/G catalytic activity. It remains to be tested whether S120Y, Q25R, and L22F mutants of EcMutY or in combination with V45A and Q182L can gain T/G glycosylase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>V45A, Q182L, and V45A/Q182L EcMutY mutants cannot complement the <italic>mutY</italic> mutation</title><p>The reduced binding and glycosylase activities toward A/G and A/GO of these EcMutY mutants led us to check whether they have normal biological activity.

The cell titer of each culture was determined by plating 0.1 ml of and 10<sup>-6 </sup>dilution onto LB agar plates. For each measurement, four independent cultures were plated, and the experiments were repeated at least three times. The mutation frequency was determined by calculating the ratio of Rif<sup>r </sup>cells to total cells. For LacZ<sup>+ </sup>reversion mutation assay, overnight cultures (0.2 ml) of each strain were plated on M9 agar plates containing 0.2% lactose and colonies were scored after three days. The ratio of LacZ<sup>+ </sup>cells to total CC104 cells was calculated to be the G:C&#x02192;T:A transversion frequency. The ratio of LacZ<sup>+ </sup>cells to total CC102 cells was calculated to be the G:C&#x02192;A:T transition frequency.</p></sec><sec><title>EcMutY protein expression and purification</title><p><italic>E. coli </italic>strains PR70/DE3 harboring expression plasmids pMY-V45A, pMY-Q182L, and pMY-V45A/Q182L were grown in LB broth containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin at 37&#x000b0;C.

After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Enzyme-bound and free DNA bands were quantified on PhosphorImager and analyzed by ImageQuant (GE Health). To determine active site concentrations, binding experiments were performed with 8 nM of A/GO-containing DNA for wild-type, V45A, and Q182L EcMutY while 30 nM of the same DNA was tested for the V45A/Q182L mutant.
