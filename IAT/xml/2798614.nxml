However, despite the Ras gene family's established role in tumorigenic cellular signal transduction events, little is known about p19 function. Previous results showed that p19 did not interact with two known p21 effectors, Raf1 and Rin1, but was shown to interact with RACK1, a scaffolding protein that promotes multi-protein complexes in different signaling pathways (Cancer Res 2003, 63 p5178).

We also found that p19 overexpression induces G1/S phase delay; an observation that correlates with hypophosphorylation of both Akt and p70SK6. Similarly, we also observed that FOXO1 is upregulated when p19 is overexpressed. The three observations of (1) hypophosphorylation of Akt, (2) G1/S phase delay and (3) upregulation of FOXO1 lead us to conclude that p19 induces G1/S phase delay, thereby maintaining cells in a reversible quiescence state and preventing entry into apoptosis. We then assessed the effect of p19 RNAi on HeLa cell growth and found that p19 RNAi increases cell growth, thereby having the opposite effect of arrest of the G1/S phase or producing a cellular quiescence state.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>Interestingly, p19 induces FOXO1 that in combination with the G1/S phase delay and hypophosphorylation of both Akt and p70SK6 leads to maintenance of a reversible cellular quiescence state, thereby preventing entry into apoptosis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Three functional c-<italic>ras</italic> genes, known as c-H-<italic>ras</italic>, c-K-<italic>ras</italic>, and c-N-<italic>ras</italic>, have been largely studied in mammalian cells with important insights into normal and tumorigenic cellular signal transduction events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Reuther1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Barbacid1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Malumbres1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Using the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) technique, we found a 15&#x00025; FRET efficiency between ECFP-RACK1 (donor) and EYFP-p19 (acceptor) at the perinuclear region, thereby confirming the localization of p19 (our results not shown). Moreover, the perinuclear region and nucleus were also mainly found to be decorated with anti-p19 antibody SP57 in different human cells type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, to further underscore the different role of p19 with respect to the p21 isoform, p19 showed no protein-binding activity to not only the p21 effectors Raf1, MAXP1, AF6, and Ral-GDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), but also the p21 activators SOS, yeast CDC25, and p120GAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These findings are in line with that fact that p19 does not localize to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). They also indicate that p19 does not interfere with p21 activity by sequestering or downmodulating these effectors and activators by direct protein-protein contact. We have not compared p21 and p19 in all the experiments here presented, because: i) as p19 has been detected in different compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and ii) as there is no binding of p19 to p21 effectors/activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), we deduce then a different function for p19. Furthermore, p21 has been hardly studied and we believed, then, it is not necessary to repeat again taking into account that, in our hands, p21 even does not express at the same level as p19.</p><fig id="pone-0008513-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008513.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>P19 activates PKC and ERK1.</title><p>A) Subcellular localization of endogenous p19 in different human cell types detected by indirect immunofluoresence (IF) with antibody SP57 (1/500).

To further analyze p19-RACK1 interaction, the C-terminal of p19 was mutated at three positions, S160A, W164A, and D165G, and each single mutation was analyzed by yeast two-hybrid assays. Several mutations of p21 were described to produce a transforming phenotype of the <italic>H-ras</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Reuther1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Barbacid1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Malumbres1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Codons 12 and 61 are &#x02018;hotspots&#x02019; for mutations that activate their malignant transforming properties. Mutations on codon 38 and 39 affect the effector domain of p21 and S17N is a dominant negative H-ras mutant. Since these mutations are localized in the common region between p19 and p21, we also investigated the effect of these mutations on p19-RACK1 binding using yeast two-hybrid assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1D</xref> of all the mutations tested, only the W164A mutant prevented p19-RACK1 binding. The inhibition of the RACK1-p19 interaction is not due to a mis-targeting to different compartment, since we detected the same p19 and RACK1 perinuclear staining when the W164A mutant was overexpressed (our unpublished results). RACK1 is a scaffolding protein that assemblies multimeric protein complexes, several of which contain PKC&#x003b2;II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-LopezBergami1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. As RACK1 and PKC&#x003b2;II have been detected to co-localize at the perinuclear region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-LopezBergami1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, the co-localization of p19 and PKC&#x003b2;II was analyzed and showed to also co-localize at the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008513.s002">Figure S1</xref>). This finding adds further credence to our hypothesis that p19, RACK1, and PKC&#x003b2;II may form a multimeric protein-complex with a conjointly action at the perinuclear region, being this possible thus RACK1 and PKC&#x003b2;II have specific protein-protein binding sites distinct to the RACK1-p19 binding site. Consequently, we analyzed the effect of p19 on PKC activity using overexpressed p19 in HeLa cells. We found a 3 to 4.5-fold increase of PKC activity compared to cells expressing empty vector or mutant p19W164A (p19mut) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), thereby showing that p19 strongly induces PKC activity.</p><p>The upregulation of PKC by p19 prompted us to analyze the phosphorylation levels of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and 2, p38 MAPK&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;, JNK1, 2 and 3, and the transcriptional activator p-Jun in HeLa cells overexpressing either p19 or p19mut. Of the nine factors tested, p19 only induced a change of phosphorylation level in ERK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1F</xref> and unpublished results). Moreover, the RNAi of p19 was also found to reduce the level of p-ERK1 without affecting p-ERK2 or p-JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).

We showed here that ERK1 but not ERK2 is activated by p19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Additionally, activated ERK was recently reported to regulate G1/S delay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Villanueva1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. To assess at which stage cell cycle progression could be modified by p19, we studied the cell phase distribution of HeLa cells overexpressing p19. Overexpression of p19 was observed to increase the number of cells in the G1 phase by 25&#x00025; and prolong G1 phase length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Interestingly, apoptosis was not observed in HeLa cells overexpressing p19, where no apoptotic peaks were detected; a finding that was further confirmed by the annexin/propidium iodure method and other protein markers, e.g. anti-PARP and eIF2&#x003b1; (our unpublished results). Thus, we conclude that p19 plays a role in regulating the switch from the G1 to S phase, thereby inducing a G1/S phase delay and also a decrease in the G2 phase.

Therefore, we tested binding of p73&#x003b1; and p73&#x003b2; to p19 and p21 using a yeast two-hybrid approach. We used the C-terminal of both p73 proteins (called C-ter p73&#x003b1;, from 1441&#x02013;1912 nucleotides, and C-ter p73&#x003b2;, from 1441-stop codon nucleotides) that is known to contain the protein-binding site region. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows that p19 binds to both p73&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, whereas p21 does not. This finding indicates that p73 interaction is p19 specific and that the p73 binding site should be in the common p73&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; region, i.e. amino acids from nucleotides 1441&#x02013;1484 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g003">Figure 3B:</xref> CTPPPPYHADPSLV).

The finding that ERK1 and Akt are hyper- and hypophosphorylated, respectively, in combination with an upregulation of TCTP, by overexpression of p19, is of key interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g004">4A and 4B</xref>. respectively) since all three proteins belong to the TSC pathway. The inhibition of the TSC pathway was verified by the inactivation of p70S6K by p19 overexpression; an effect that is reverted by the p19mut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>P19 Induces and Maintains a Reversible Quiescence State</title><p>P19 overexpression induces G1/S phase delay; an observation that correlates with hypophosphorylation of Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Tran1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Kops2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similarly, we also observed that FOXO1 is upregulated when p19 is overexpressed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In fact, the FOXO1 level was doubled as can be seen when comparing the pRK5-p19 and the pRK5 lanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The three observations of (1) hypophosphorylation of Akt, (2) G1/S delay and (3) upregulation of FOXO1 lead us to conclude that p19 induces G1/S phase delay, thereby maintaining cells in a reversible quiescence state and preventing entry into apoptosis. Although 19 overexpression does not induce apoptosis, Kim <italic>et al.</italic> showed that p19 stimulates the p73&#x003b2; induced apoptosis when both proteins are simultaneously overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Kim1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The results here showed may explain this previous effect, thus there would be a combination of a cell arrest effect (induced by p19 overexpression) and cell arrest plus apoptosis effect (induced by p73&#x003b2; overexpression) that amplifies the synergistic activation of p73&#x003b2;-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008513-Kim1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In this direction we have assayed the effect of the p19 RNAi on the HeLa cell growth. As it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008513-g005">Figure 5</xref>, the reduction of p19 level increases the cell growth, having then just the opposite effect of a G1/S arrest or quiescence state.</p><fig id="pone-0008513-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008513.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>P19 RNAi induces cell proliferation.</title><p>P19 RNAi was performed as detailed in methods.

However, it should be noted that asimilar mTOR quiescence mechanism has not been described in mammals so far. This observation would also explain why few protein genes are up- and downregulated by p19 H-Ras overexpression. In summary: on one hand p19 induces FOXO1, that in combination with the G1/S phase delay, hypophosphorylation of both Akt and p70SK6 leads to maintenance of a reversible cellular quiescence state, thereby preventing entry into apoptosis. On the other hand, the p19 reduction induces cell growth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Human HeLa cells were used in all experiments and cultured in standard conditions (DMEM/10&#x00025; FCS/5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> and 37&#x000b0;C).
