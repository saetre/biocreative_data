In addition to its function in the protein degradation machinery, it has been linked to BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 product) and homologous DNA recombination, mRNA export, and exocytosis. While the fungal orthologues of Dss1 are not essential for viability, the significance of Dss1 in metazoans has remained unknown due to a lack of knockout animal models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the current study deletion of <italic>dss-1 </italic>was studied in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>with a <italic>dss-1 </italic>loss-of-function mutant and <italic>dss-1 </italic>directed RNAi.

Although it was originally isolated as a candidate gene for the split-hand-split-foot syndrome (<italic>DSS1</italic>, <underline>d</underline>eleted in the <underline>s</underline>plit hand/<underline>s</underline>plit foot SHFM1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the connection with the syndrome has not been confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Instead, it has emerged that Dss1 is a subunit of the 26S proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The proteasome is a multi-protein complex responsible for the degradation of polyubiquitinated target proteins. It consists of a 20S core, responsible for the degradation of proteins inside the core channel, and a 19S regulatory particle, containing about 20 proteins arranged into a base and lid structure. The 19S regulatory particle binds ubiquitin-tagged substrates, unfolds the substrates and transfer them into the proteolytic core, but the precise role of many of the subunits is not yet known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Within the cell, protein degradation must be regulated with precision. Emerging data indicates that the number of proteasomes and their subunit composition can vary depending on cellular conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Various proteasome-interacting proteins have been discovered, and post-translational modifications of proteasome subunits may have an effect on proteolytic activity. Alternative regulatory particles to 19S exist that possibly function in ubiquitin-independent proteolysis, and the proteasome has also been implicated in tasks separate from protein degradation, e.g. transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Dss1 binds to the 19S regulatory particle both in mammalian cells and in fission and budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This binding is possibly mediated by lid components Rpn3 and Rpn7, with separate binding sites in Dss1 for both proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Genetic and biochemical data from yeast suggest that Dss1 is involved in the proteolytic function of the proteasome. Accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins occurs in <italic>sem1 </italic>mutants, the Dss1 homologue in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Synergistic interactions are seen between double mutants of <italic>sem1 </italic>and a lid subunit, <italic>rpn10 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition to a role in protein degradation, Dss1 is involved in DNA repair. It binds to BRCA2, a breast cancer susceptibility gene product and a component of the homologous recombination machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Loss of either BRCA2 or Dss1, both in mammalian and fungal cells, results in defects in homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Conflicting evidence exists whether the effect of Dss1 is mediated by regulation of BRCA2 stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is possible though that the Dss1 effect on homologous recombination is dependent on its role in the proteasome complex as proteasomes have been shown to bind to double-stranded breaks, sites of homologous recombination, and specifically BRCA2 binds the proteasome lid components Rpn3 and Rpn7, similar to Dss1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, proteasome activity is required for DNA repair. However, Dss1 does not regulate BRCA2 affinity for the proteasome, as the BRCA2-Rpn7 interaction is not dependent on Dss1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Dss1 has also been shown to be required for mRNA export in fission yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Finally, both <italic>SEM1 </italic>overexpression and deletion in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>can suppress exocyst mutations, suggesting that Dss1 is directly or indirectly involved in protein secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Sem1 in yeast is dispensable at 24&#x000b0;C, the normal growth temperature of yeast, despite the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. However, <italic>SEM1 </italic>deleted cells are temperature-sensitive ceasing to grow at elevated temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, loss of Sem1 triggers or enhances a cell differentiation process, pseudohyphal growth, in diploid <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In higher eukaryotes, there is currently no <italic>in vivo </italic>data about the significance of Dss1. Attempts to identify mutations in the <italic>DSS1 </italic>coding region of a selected set of breast cancer patients did not support a direct role for Dss1 in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Here we present the first characterization of <italic>dss-1 </italic>in a multicellular organism, the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. We show that <italic>dss-1 </italic>is functionally conserved from fungi to metazoans, and required for oogenesis and intestinal function. In addition, <italic>dss-1 </italic>is important for embryogenesis and larval growth. Taken together, the results show, for the first time, that <italic>dss-1 </italic>is essential for the development of metazoan animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>C. elegans dss-1 </italic>is expressed throughout development and encodes a nuclear protein</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans dss-1 </italic>(Y119D3B.15) encodes a 82 aa protein that is 55% similar and 34% identical to the product of the <italic>S. cerevisiae SEM1 </italic>gene, and 71% and 46%, respectively, to the human <italic>DSS1 </italic>gene product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We examined the expression of the <italic>dss-1 </italic>transcript and DSS-1::GFP fusion protein in worm tissues. It has previously been shown that human and mouse <italic>dss1 </italic>are expressed ubiquitously in several adult and fetal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Similarly, the <italic>C. elegans dss-1 </italic>transcript was present throughout larval development and in adult worms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To observe the cellular localisation of DSS-1, transgenic worms were generated expressing DSS-1::GFP fusion protein from 4 kb of <italic>dss-1 </italic>promoter sequence. This fusion protein localised to the intestinal epithelium and to unidentified neuronal cells in the head region (data not shown). No expression was seen in the gonad, presumably because of germ line silencing of transgene expression. Subcellularly the strongest expression was seen in the nucleus with diffuse staining in the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This is similar to the reported Dss1 localisation in cultured human and yeast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of <italic>C. elegans dss-1</italic></bold>.

A deletion allele for <italic>dss-1 </italic>was obtained from the National Bioresource Project, Japan. <italic>dss-1(tm370) </italic>is a loss-of-function allele with a 1466 bp deletion completely removing exon 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The <italic>dss-1(tm370) </italic>homozygous worms grew up into adults but produced no offspring (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). We tested whether the lack of progeny were due to a defect in sperm formation by mating <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutant worms with N2 males. No offspring were obtained from mutant worms indicating that wild type sperm cannot rescue the sterility of <italic>dss-1(tm370) </italic>(n = 7). The sterility is not due to compromised gonad development as a two-arm gonad with developing germ cells was present in 98% of mutant worms examined (n = 169). Gonad development was further studied by crossing the mutants to the <italic>lag2::GFP </italic>marker strain. This marker expresses GFP in the distal tip cells (DTC) of the gonad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Comparable numbers of <italic>dss-1(tm370) </italic>homo- and heterozygous worms showed a GFP signal in both distal tip cells (data not shown). However, the formation of oocytes was defective in the <italic>dss-1(tm370) </italic>homozygous worms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C&#x02013;E</xref>). Only 23% of 3-day-old mutant worms had any oocytes (n = 30) in contrast to 100% of the heterozygous worms of similar age containing oocytes (n = 18). The difference was partially due to a delay in oogenesis, as the percentage of mutant worms with oocytes increased to 50% when the worms were examined at 3.5 days (n = 72), and to 73% at 4&#x02013;6 days after egg-laying (n = 67). However, the oocyte formation was abnormal as also in the older mutant worms the number of oocytes was always less than in control worms, with an average of two oocytes per gonad arm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). The oocytes were generally smaller and aberrant-looking. Occasionally embryo-like multicellular structures were visible in the uterus (25% in 3.5-day-old and 57% in 4&#x02013;6-day-old worms) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). Their number per gonad arm was low, and no eggs were laid by the <italic>dss-1(tm370) </italic>mutants. Sperm were present in the spermatheca of the mutant worms in numbers comparable to the heterozygous control worms (83% of <italic>dss-1(tm370)/dss-1(tm370) </italic>mutants had sperm versus 94% <italic>dss-1/+ </italic>in 3-day-old worms). This suggested that spermatogenesis was superficially normal. However, some delay in sperm formation could be witnessed as spermatocytes were still found in 35% of 3-day-old <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants, but in none of the control worms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I'</xref>). In 3.5-day-old mutants spermatocytes were no longer seen.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>dss-1 </italic>deletion results in defects in oogenesis and intestinal absorption</bold>.

The expected ratios of fertile (<italic>dss-1/sC1</italic>, 48% vs. expected 50%) and dumpy adults (<italic>sC1/sC1</italic>, 26% vs. expected 25%) were observed. The remaining <italic>dss-1(tm370)/dss-1(tm370) </italic>worms were classified as either sterile or young adults indicating that the mutant worms seemed to grow at comparable rates to their heterozygous siblings. When grown at 25&#x000b0;C or 26&#x000b0;C, the results were similar except that the adult mutant worms were smaller than mutants grown at lower temperatures (data not shown). <italic>dss-1(tm370) </italic>homozygotes grown at room temperature were thinner than <italic>dss-1/+ </italic>heterozygotes, with often a slightly protruding vulva (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

At the same temperatures, but with vector-treated control RNAi, the worms were fertile (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Similar to the <italic>dss-1(tm370) </italic>mutants, oogenesis was defective with only 18% (n = 40) of the worms having oocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B&#x02013;D</xref>). Very few embryo-like structures were found in the uterus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).

We chose to study the <italic>kgb-1 </italic>mutant for comparison with <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants for two reasons. First, the <italic>kgb-1 </italic>mutant phenotype has many similarities with the <italic>dss-1 </italic>homozygotes. The mutants are sterile, with no mature oocytes or embryos, and, in older worms, exhibit a protruding vulva and bloated appearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This sterility is temperature-sensitive at 26&#x000b0;C similar to the <italic>dss-1 </italic>RNAi phenotype. Secondly, KGB-1, a MAP kinase, is believed to act in proteolytic degradation of an oogenesis-specific protein. It binds GLH-1, an RNA helicase required for fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and in <italic>kgb-1 </italic>mutants GLH-1 protein levels are elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Biochemical evidence indicates that KGB-1 regulates GLH-1 degradation by phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We postulated that DSS-1 and KGB-1 might both be regulatory factors required for the proteolysis of GLH-1 and/or other proteins required for oogenesis. <italic>kgb-1(um3) </italic>uteri were generally void of embryos (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The gonad arms were disorganized with no well-formed rachis (data not shown). Occasionally the <italic>kgb-1 </italic>proximal gonad contained a mixture of more differentiated oocytes surrounded by less developed germ cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Although the <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutant gonads were in general more organized, upon closer inspection we found some similar mixtures of more mature oocytes surrounded by less mature germ cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). A prominent feature of the <italic>kgb-1 </italic>mutant gonads is the <italic>emo </italic>phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>). In younger <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants no DAPI-positive <italic>emo </italic>cells were visible either in the gonad or the uterus (n = 33). However, in older <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants 20% of the gonads had <italic>emo</italic>-like cells (n = 24) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). In addition, in 71% of the <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants DAPI-positive <italic>emo</italic>-like structures were found in the uterus, possibly resulting from unfertilised embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4J</xref>). In <italic>kgb-1 </italic>mutants 95% had <italic>emo </italic>cells in the gonad (n = 20), but only 20% in the uterus.</p><p>Examination of GLH-1 protein levels by Western analysis showed no significant differences in the amount of GLH-1 between <italic>dss-1 </italic>homozygotes, <italic>dss-1/sC1 </italic>heterozygotes, and N2 control worms (data not shown).

At three days after egg-laying, control <italic>dss-1 </italic>heterozygotes had both mature oocytes and sperm, whereas <italic>dss-1 </italic>homozygotes still had spermatocytes and relatively few animals had oocytes at all. Approximately 12 h later sperm had matured in the majority of the mutants, and the proportion of adult worms with oocytes continued to increase. This delay could be intrinsic to the germ line itself. Alternatively, the sterility could be a secondary consequence caused by the general sickness of the worms, possibly mediated by the intestine. For example, lipoproteins secreted by the intestine are known to affect germ line development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The 4 kb <italic>dss-1 </italic>promoter drives expression mainly in the intestine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We attempted to rescue the <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutant with the DSS-1::GFP fusion protein expressed under the 4 kb promoter but were not successful (data not shown). Since transgenic expression is often silenced in the germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] this suggests though that DSS-1 expression solely in the intestine is not sufficient for rescuing <italic>dss-1 </italic>oogenesis defects, and that its expression in the germ line may be required for oogenesis.</p><p>Although oocyte formation seemed to increase with aging of the <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutant worms it remained defective. Normal numbers of oocytes were not achieved, and the formed oocytes were not capable of fertilization, even with wild type sperm. <italic>C. elegans </italic>BRC-2 is required for proper progression of meiosis, and <italic>brc-2 </italic>mutants have abnormal diakinesis (chromosome condensation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Similarly, abnormal chromosome condensation was found occasionally in <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants. However, abnormal diakinesis does not explain completely the oogenesis defects seen in <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutant worms as in <italic>brc-2 </italic>mutants oocytes progress through fertilization producing embryos that die, something not occurring to the same degree in <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants.

This could be caused by targeting of secondary mRNAs, homologous to <italic>dss-1</italic>. We find this explanation unlikely as no homologous targets have been identified either by Wormbase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] or by our own attempts. An alternative possibility is that the progeny obtained from <italic>dss-1 </italic>RNAi treated worms are escapers from the oogenesis defect, and that the embryonic lethality and larval arrest observed are caused indirectly by partially defective oogenesis. However, as the parental generation of RNAi treated worms showed no signs of sterility and laid eggs comparably to the control worms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), we do think this is a probable option. Therefore, we believe that the depletion of the maternal transcript provided by the heterozygous mothers of <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants results in the early defects seen in the RNAi treated worms. This suggests that the <italic>dss-1 </italic>transcript is an essential component of embryogenesis and larval development. It is feasible that these effects are mediated by the involvement of DSS-1 in proteasome function. The proteasome is required for development, as RNAi against the majority of the <italic>C. elegans </italic>proteasome subunits has a strong, early lethal effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Accumulation of bacteria in the intestine is seen in the <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants and <italic>dss-1 </italic>RNAi treated worms.

In addition, stress such as heat appears to enhance the phenotypic effects seen in <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants or RNAi worms. This is in line with the role of DSS-1 in protein degradation since the proteasome function has previously been linked to aging and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The cellular function of DSS-1</title><p>Dss1 is known to participate in the proteasome complex, and either directly or indirectly via proteolytic activity in BRCA2 function and DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

What does the analysis of the loss-of-function phenotype of <italic>dss-1 </italic>in <italic>C. elegans </italic>tell us of its function in a multicellular organism?</p><p>The proteasome is an essential component of the housekeeping machinery inside a cell, and perturbing its function generally results in lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. As such, the significant portion of embryonic lethality and larval growth defects seen in <italic>dss-1 </italic>RNAi treated worms are indicative of an essential function. Whether this function relates to the proteasome is uncertain. We did not observe an apparent effect on proteasome activity or on the amount of proteasome subunits in whole worm extracts when <italic>dss-1 </italic>was knocked down by RNAi. In addition, <italic>dss-1 </italic>homozygous mutants survive into adulthood with only specific defects. The homozygous <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutant embryos are likely to be rescued by expression of the maternal <italic>dss-1 </italic>transcript. The lack of a lethal phenotype in the adult homozygotes can indicate either that DSS-1 is not required for proteasome activity in adults, or that the requirement of DSS-1 for proteasome activity is restricted to specific tissues or specific subsets of proteins. Indeed, recent work in cultured mammalian cells showed that depletion of <italic>dss-1 </italic>mRNA by RNAi has a minimal effect on proteolytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Taken into account that the <italic>dss-1 </italic>depletion in their experiment was not complete, it is possible that in metazoans Dss1 is not necessary for general proteasome activity. In order to resolve these issues, methods to measure local or substrate-specific proteasome activity in the <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutant worms are required.</p><p>The fertility defects seen in the <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutants differed from the defects seen when <italic>rpn-10</italic>, another proteasome subunit, was mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Either, DSS-1 and RPN-10 have independent tasks in the proteasome complex, or, alternatively, RPN-10 acts redundantly with another subunit, thus explaining the mild oogenesis defects seen in <italic>rpn-10 </italic>mutants. Indeed, RNAi against <italic>rpn-10 </italic>has no effect, whereas combined RNAi against <italic>rpn-10 </italic>and <italic>rpn-12 </italic>is lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We did not observe any synthetic effect between <italic>rpn-10 </italic>and <italic>dss-1 </italic>suggesting that RPN-10 and DSS-1 are not required for the same molecular process.</p><p>The function of <italic>dss-1 </italic>has been at least partially conserved during evolution, as we have shown that both the human and nematode homologues can complement the growth and differentiation phenotypes of the yeast <italic>sem1 </italic>mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]). However, the <italic>C. elegans dss-1 </italic>can not fully rescue the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in <italic>sem1 </italic>mutant yeast cells. <italic>sem1 </italic>mutant cells accumulate polyubiquitinated proteins already at the permissive temperature but their growth compared to <italic>SEM1 </italic>expressing cells is indistinguishable. It is possible that the homology between DSS-1 and the yeast Sem1 protein is only sufficient for partial functionality in proteasome activity, but that even this incomplete activity is enough to sufficiently reduce the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins to allow growth at the restrictive temperature. Alternatively, the temperature-sensitive growth defect could result from a proteasome-independent function of Sem1 that is not conserved between yeast and nematode. We do not think that this function would be related to homologous recombination. First, in yeast no BRCA2 homologue has been identified. Second, loss of <italic>SEM1 </italic>in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>does not cause increased sensitivity to UV-irradiation or to chemicals that induce double-stranded breaks, or cause significant differences in the capability of these cells to repair gapped plasmids ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], J.

In summary, in contrast to unicellular organisms, <italic>dss-1 </italic>in a multicellular animal is an essential gene, which is required for oogenesis, embryogenesis, and larval growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Genetics</title><p>Worms were grown at room temperature on NGM plates unless otherwise indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The following worm strains used:</p><p>Bristol N2 (CGC)</p><p><italic>rrf-3(pk1426) </italic>(gift from Simon Tuck)</p><p><italic>dss-1(tm370)/+ </italic>(Shohei Mitani, NBP, Japan)</p><p><italic>sC1(s2023) [dpy-1(s2170)] </italic>(Genetic Toolkit project, BC4279, CGC)</p><p><italic>brc-2(tm1086)</italic>/<italic>hT2 </italic>(DW104, CGC)</p><p><italic>kgb-1(um3) </italic>(KB3, CGC)</p><p><italic>rpn-10(tm1349) </italic>(Shohei Mitani, NBP, Japan)</p><p><italic>lag-2::GFP </italic>(qIs56 IV or V, JK 2868, CGC)</p><p><italic>pie-1::GFP::H2B </italic>(ruIs32 III, AZ212, CGC)</p><p><italic>vit-2::GFP </italic>(<italic>sqt-1(sc103), bIs7) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (gift from Simon Tuck)</p><p><italic>dss-1(tm370) </italic>allele was outcrossed once when balanced against <italic>sC1</italic>.

Both L4 and L1 larvae were used as starting stages for the RNAi experiments. RNAi starting with L1 larvae were tested at different temperatures, but no phenotypes were observed. Phenotypes were obtained using N2 L4 larvae at 24.5&#x000b0;C &#x02013; 26&#x000b0;C. At 26&#x000b0;C the RNAi phenotype was most severe (without the control worms being affected) so this temperature was chosen for phenotypic analysis. L4 larvae were placed on bacterial RNAi plates and allowed to lay eggs for 24 h after which they were transferred to a fresh set of RNAi plates. After an additional 24 h the worms were removed from RNAi plates. The progeny from both plate sets was followed for three to five days.</p></sec><sec><title>PCR genotyping of <italic>dss-1(tm370)</italic></title><p>Nested PCR was performed from single lysed worms. For identification of the <italic>tm370 </italic>allele, oligos designed by the National Bioresource Project, Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] were used. For detection of the wild type allele the following oligos were used: external, 5'-ATCTACCGCCGCCAAAAAAG-3' and 5'-GATATCTTAGGCGACTTGGTGTCC-3'; internal, 5'-TCGGGAAAATAGGTTTTTAGGC-3' and 5'-TTCCTCCTTCAATTGCTTCG-3'.

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and DNase treated using DNA-free kit (Ambion). Equal amounts of RNA (1.6 &#x003bc;g) were used to prepare cDNA with the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham BioScience) and the <italic>Not </italic>I-d(T)<sub>18 </sub>bifunctional primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was amplified by standard PCR for 30 cycles using the forward primers 5'-TGCTGTCGTTGAGAAGAAGG (<italic>dss-1</italic>) and 5'-AAGGTGTGATGGTCGGTATGGG-3' (<italic>act-4</italic>) and the reverse primers 5'-GCGACTTGGTGTCCAGATTT-3' (<italic>dss-1</italic>) and 5'-TTCGTAGATTGGGACGGTGTGG-3' (<italic>act-4</italic>). Equal amounts of each reaction were then analyzed on 1% TBE agarose gel.</p></sec><sec><title>DAPI staining</title><p>As the <italic>dss-1 </italic>mutant gonads were very fragile, either disintegrating or remaining inside the worm carcass upon dissection, DAPI staining was performed on whole animals.

DAPI (Molecular Probes, USA) was used at 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteasome activity assay</title><p>A fluorogenic peptide substrate assay was performed to determine the chymotrypsin-like peptidase activity of the proteasome in whole worm extracts. Whole worm extracts were prepared from frozen worm pellets resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT) and subjected to sonication and centrifugation. 25 &#x003bc;g of whole animal extracts was incubated with 140 &#x003bc;M Suc-LLVY-AMC (Calbiochem) in proteasome activity assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 5 mM ATP) at room temperature.</p><p>The fluorescence intensity was measured in triplicate samples at 380 nm excitatory and 455 nm emission wavelengths using a FLUOstar Optima Mircoplate Reader (BMG Labtech). The assay was performed in the absence and presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 &#x003bc;M, Peptides Interrnational) to calculate the proteasome-specific activity, after which the L4440 sample was assigned an activity value of 100%. The results are from two independent RNAi experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>For GLH-1 immunoblotting 50 adult worms of each genotype were lysed in 25 &#x003bc;l of 1&#x000d7; Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Rabbit anti-GLH-1 antibody (kind gift from Susan Strome) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. The membrane was reblotted with mouse anti-&#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma T5168, dilution 1:1000) to check for equal loading. For detection of proteasome subunits in RNAi-treated worms, extracts were prepared from frozen worm pellets by sonication in lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM NEM, 10 &#x003bc;M MG132 and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to Western blotting with antibodies against proteasome &#x003b1;-subunits (BIOMOL International, PW8195) and &#x003b1;-tubulin.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast <italic>sem1 </italic>mutant rescue</title><p>Yeast strain H2187 (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a </bold><italic>ura3 sem1::kanMX</italic>) was transformed with the empty yeast expression plasmid pVT102U or pVT102U containing <italic>dss-1 </italic>or <italic>sem1 </italic>cDNA. Transformants were patched on SCD-ura plates, grown overnight at 24&#x000b0;C and replicated using velvet to different temperatures. The growth of the patches was followed for three days. For analysis of accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, the above transformants were grown overnight in SCD-ura at 24&#x000b0;C. The cultures were diluted to OD<sub>600 </sub>0.2 and regrown to OD<sub>600 </sub>0.6&#x02013;1.0. The cultures were divided in two and the growth was continued either at 24&#x000b0;C or at 37&#x000b0;C. Samples were collected at 1.5, 3 and 5 hours after the temperature shift. Cells were lysed in 2% SDS, the total protein concentration was measured (BCA Protein Assay Kit, Pierce) and equal amounts of the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-polyubiquitin antibody (BIOMOL International, PW8805) and anti-Sso1/2 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Quantification of the band intensities was done by scanning the films with GS-710 densitometer (Bio-Rad) using the Quantity One program, version 4.0 (Bio-Rad). The optical density of the whole lane for each sample was quantified. The polyubiquitin band intensities were normalized to the Sso1/2 band intensities.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JP performed the mutant, RNAi, and anti-GLH-1 Western analysis; SP performed the <italic>lag2::</italic>GFP analysis, CIH designed and performed the developmental RT-PCR, anti-polyubiquitin Western, and proteasome activity assays; while JJ did the transgenic injections, yeast rescue assay, and conceived the study.
