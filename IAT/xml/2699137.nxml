Both receptor types trigger a receptor-proximal tyrosine phosphorylation cascade through Src family kinases and Syk, but further downstream signaling events are poorly understood. We show that phospholipase C (PLC) &#x003b3;2 is phosphorylated downstream of Src family kinases and Syk during integrin or Fc receptor-mediated activation of neutrophils. PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils are completely defective in &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrin or Fc&#x003b3; receptor-mediated functional responses such as respiratory burst, degranulation, or cell spreading in vitro and show reduced adhesion/spreading in inflamed capillary venules in vivo. However, PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils respond normally to various other agonists, including chemokines, bacterial formyl peptides, Toll-like receptor ligands, or proinflammatory cytokines, and migrate normally both in vitro and in vivo. To confirm the in vivo relevance of these observations, the effect of the PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutation was tested in the K/B&#x000d7;N serum transfer arthritis model, which is known to require &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrins, Fc&#x003b3; receptors, and neutrophils. PLC&#x003b3;2 deficiency completely protected mice from clinical signs and histological features of arthritis as well as from arthritis-induced loss of articular function.

Neutrophils use several cell surface receptors to sense their environment including &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrins, immunoglobulin Fc receptors, various G protein&#x02013;coupled (e.g., formyl peptide or chemokine) receptors, Toll-like receptors, and receptors for various proinflammatory cytokines.</p><p>Lymphocyte antigen receptors, Fc&#x003f5; receptors of mast cells, and Fc&#x003b3; receptors of macrophages use a common receptor-proximal signal transduction machinery consisting of the sequential activation of Src family kinases, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) containing transmembrane adapters, and the Syk or the ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase. Studies from other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) and our own unpublished observations indicate that neutrophil Fc&#x003b3; receptors also use a receptor-proximal Src family&#x02013;ITAM-bearing adaptor&#x02013;Syk signaling pathway. We have recently shown that &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrins in neutrophils signal through a conceptually similar receptor-proximal pathway, using Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), two ITAM-bearing transmembrane adapters (DAP12 and the Fc receptor &#x003b3; chain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), and the Syk tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We and others have reported similar ITAM-based integrin signaling pathways in other cell types including macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), and microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Collectively, integrins and Fc receptors in various hematopoietic lineages signal through a conceptually similar ITAM-based receptor-proximal tyrosine phosphorylation cascade (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). However, the signal transduction mechanisms downstream of this common receptor-proximal pathway are poorly understood.</p><p>Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes catalyze the breakdown of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, triggering a concomitant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and protein kinase C activation. Of the best known PLC isoforms, the PLC&#x003b2; family is activated by G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors, whereas the PLC&#x003b3; family is activated downstream of tyrosine phosphorylation pathways. There are two known PLC&#x003b3; isoforms: PLC&#x003b3;1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas PLC&#x003b3;2 is preferentially expressed in the hematopoietic system. Genetic deficiency of PLC&#x003b3;1 leads to embryonic lethality, likely as a result of defective erythropoiesis and vasculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). In contrast, PLC&#x003b3;2-deficient mice are viable, their principal phenotype being a profound defect in B cell development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>Although PLC&#x003b3;2 is activated by various Fc receptors, its possible functional role downstream of those receptors is rather controversial. Genetic deficiency of PLC&#x003b3;2 attenuates Fc&#x003f5; receptor-mediated degranulation of mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) but it does not affect extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation or cytokine production under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Although PLC&#x003b3;2 is required for Fc&#x003b3; receptor-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in macrophages, PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages show normal phagocytosis of IgG-coated erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). The role of PLC&#x003b3;2 in Fc receptor-mediated functions in other cell types such as neutrophils is presently unknown.</p><p>PLC&#x003b3;2 is also activated by integrins but its role in integrin signal transduction is also controversial. Although a statistically significant decrease of spreading was reported in PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), that difference only accounted for a 30% reduction of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin-induced increase in cell surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) or a delayed kinetics and moderately smaller percentage of full spreading on an &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin ligand surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Hence, PLC&#x003b3;2 appears to be a modulator rather than a critical component of integrin signaling in platelets. In contrast, a recent study focusing on the role of Vav family proteins in neutrophils suggested that PLC&#x003b3;2 downstream of Vav may be more directly involved in integrin signaling in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p><p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a severe chronic autoimmune disease affecting &#x0223c;1% of the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). The disease is initiated by the emergence of autoreactive T cells (initiation or immunization phase), which then trigger the second (effector or tissue destruction) phase, mediated in large part by cells of the innate immune system. These two phases are very clearly separated in the K/B&#x000d7;N arthritis model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). This model is initiated by a transgenic autoreactive T cell receptor (KRN transgene) on the autoimmunity-prone MHC background from the NOD mouse strain. This initial phase leads to the generation of autoantibodies that trigger excessive joint inflammation and destruction resembling human rheumatoid arthritis. Serum of affected mice can trigger the effector phase of the disease in otherwise normal mice (serum transfer arthritis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), allowing a clear separation of the two phases of the disease.</p><p>Analysis of the K/B&#x000d7;N and other models of autoimmune arthritis revealed that innate immune mechanisms are of critical importance in the later effector phase of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Several studies using lineage depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), or combined genetic/reconstitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>) approaches indicate that neutrophils play a critical role in the effector phase of various animal models of autoimmune arthritis. However, the molecular mechanisms of how neutrophils contribute to the disease are very poorly understood.</p><p>Several cell surface receptors have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis in mice. These receptors include Fc&#x003b3; receptors such as Fc&#x003b3;RIII or Fc&#x003b3;RI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>) as well as members of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). However, it is at present unclear how (e.g., through what intracellular signaling mechanisms) Fc receptors and integrins participate in the development of joint inflammation.</p><p>The aforementioned results prompted us to test the role of PLC&#x003b3;2 in various in vitro neutrophil functions as well as in the development of neutrophil-mediated autoimmune arthritis in vivo. Our results indicate that PLC&#x003b3;2 is critically involved in integrin and Fc receptor-mediated neutrophil functions as well as in the neutrophil-mediated effector phase of autoimmune arthritis.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>PLC&#x003b3;2 is the dominant PLC&#x003b3; isoform and is phosphorylated downstream of Src family kinases and Syk in neutrophils</title><p>First, we tested the expression level of the two PLC&#x003b3; isoforms in neutrophils and compared it to that in other cell types. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, PLC&#x003b3;2 was expressed at comparable levels in WT murine neutrophils and splenocytes but at much lower levels in WT thymocytes. In contrast, PLC&#x003b3;1 was expressed in neutrophils at a much lower level than in the thymus or the spleen. Although these results suggested that PLC&#x003b3;2 is the predominant PLC&#x003b3; isoform in neutrophils, they did not allow the quantitative assessment of the relative expression of the two proteins in these cells. Hence, the expression of PLC&#x003b3;1 and PLC&#x003b3;2 was titrated against known amounts of recombinant Myc-tagged versions of the two proteins (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081859/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081859/DC1</ext-link>). Based on those studies, WT mouse neutrophils were estimated to contain 53 &#x000b1; 26 ng PLC&#x003b3;2 (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and 3.0 &#x000b1; 1.2 ng PLC&#x003b3;1 (<italic>n</italic> = 3) per 10<sup>6</sup> cells, indicating that the expression of PLC&#x003b3;2 is &#x0223c;18-fold higher than that of PLC&#x003b3;1 in these cells. The expression of the two isoforms was also tested in PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Although no PLC&#x003b3;2 signal was observed in PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, the expression of PLC&#x003b3;1 was not affected by the same mutation. The specificity of the antibodies used was also confirmed by the blocking effect of isoform-specific PLC&#x003b3;-blocking peptides (Fig. S1 B). Collectively, these results indicate than neutrophils express both PLC&#x003b3;1 and PLC&#x003b3;2, although PLC&#x003b3;2 is the predominant isoform. Furthermore, the genetic deficiency of PLC&#x003b3;2 does not affect the expression of PLC&#x003b3;1 in these cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression and activation of PLC&#x003b3;2 in neutrophils.</bold> (A) Expression of PLC&#x003b3;2 and PLC&#x003b3;1 in WT neutrophils compared with WT thymocytes and splenocytes.

Next, we tested whether PLC&#x003b3;2 is also phosphorylated under these conditions and whether Src family kinases and Syk participate in this process. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 (C and D)</xref>, plating WT neutrophils on a polyvalent integrin ligand surface (poly-RGD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) triggered phosphorylation of PLC&#x003b3;2. Importantly, this phosphorylation response was absent in cells lacking the Src family kinases Hck, Fgr, and Lyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) or the Syk tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Murine neutrophils can also be activated in an Fc&#x003b3;RIII/Fc&#x003b3;RIV-dependent manner by plating them on immobilized IgG immune complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>), leading to cellular responses that are dependent on Src family kinases and Syk (unpublished data). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 (E and F)</xref>, neutrophil activation by such immobilized immune complexes leads to phosphorylation of PLC&#x003b3;2 in WT but not in Src family&#x02013;deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>) or Syk-deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>) neutrophils. These results suggest that PLC&#x003b3;2 is a downstream target of Src family kinases and Syk during both integrin and Fc receptor-mediated activation of neutrophils.</p></sec><sec><title>PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow chimeras and neutrophil surface marker expression</title><p>Our next aim was to test the role of PLC&#x003b3;2 in functional responses of neutrophils, using cells that are genetically deficient of this phospholipase isoform. Because we (and others) have not been able to breed homozygous PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (indicating a fertility defect in PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> males and/or females), the mutation was maintained in heterozygous (PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup>) form. Even under such conditions, only 12% (rather than the expected 25%) of a total of 379 offsprings from PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> &#x000d7; PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> matings were found to be of the PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> genotype at weaning age, indicating a partial defect in survival of PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> embryos or newborn pups, which is likely a result of a lymphatic vascular developmental defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) similar to that seen in SLP-76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Syk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). To overcome this problem, bone marrow transplantation was used to generate chimeric mice with a PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hematopoietic system. To this end, recipient mice carrying the CD45.1 allele on the C57BL/6 genetic background were lethally irradiated and then injected intravenously with isolated PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or control C57BL/6 bone marrow cells (both donor strains carry the CD45.2 allele). Repopulation of the neutrophil compartment by donor-derived cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of the donor-specific CD45.2 allele in peripheral blood leukocytes 4&#x02013;5 wk after transplantation (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081859/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081859/DC1</ext-link>).

Although the therapy of the disease has significantly improved during the last decades, it is still far from being solved. This is exemplified by the still widespread use of the highly cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate, the severe cardiovascular complications of COX-2 inhibitors, or the tremendous costs and possible side effects (e.g., reactivation of silent tuberculosis) of anti-TNF therapeutics. Better understanding of rheumatoid arthritis at the molecular level would strongly facilitate the development of novel treatment strategies for the disease.</p><p>The experiments presented in this paper provide evidence for the role of PLC&#x003b3;2 in the K/B&#x000d7;N arthritis model, one of the most widely used animal models of rheumatoid arthritis. A unique feature of this model is that its effector phase can be clearly separated from its initiation phase by transferring the serum of an arthritic K/B&#x000d7;N mouse to an otherwise nonarthritic recipient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Our experiments performed using this serum transfer model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) indicate that PLC&#x003b3;2 participates in the effector phase of the disease. Furthermore, the fact that bone marrow chimeras with PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hematopoietic system but PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>+/+</sup> nonhematopoietic tissues are protected from K/B&#x000d7;N serum transfer arthritis indicates that PLC&#x003b3;2 within the hematopoietic system is indispensable for disease development.</p><p>The effector phase of rheumatoid arthritis is mediated by several cell types, likely including various phagocytic lineages. To our knowledge, of those lineages only neutrophils have been consistently linked to the development of the inflammatory process in a diverse array of arthritis models and experimental approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Of the other phagocytes, liposome-mediated depletion studies suggested a pathogenetic role for macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>), but another genetic study indicated that certain macrophage subsets play a negative rather than a positive role in autoimmune arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). Although an elegant series of genetic and reconstitution studies indicated the role of mast cells in the development of K/B&#x000d7;N serum transfer arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>), another study using a different genetic approach suggested that arthritis development may proceed normally in the absence of mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Based on these results, the most likely explanation for our in vivo results is that PLC&#x003b3;2 within neutrophils is required for the autoantibody-induced inflammation process. The second most likely PLC&#x003b3;2-dependent compartment would be the mast cell lineage, which also expresses PLC&#x003b3;2 and may be activated through integrins and Fc&#x003b3; receptors. However, because mast cells are long-lived radioresistant cells that survive a lethal irradiation in most tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>), it is unlikely that our bone marrow transplantation approach was able to replace the majority of the recipients' mast cells. Hence, it unlikely that the complete defect of arthritis development in PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow chimeras is caused solely by the deficiency of PLC&#x003b3;2 in mast cells.</p><p>Several cell surface receptors have also been shown to participate in various models of autoimmune arthritis. Several studies using mice lacking the Fc receptor common &#x003b3; chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>) or Fc&#x003b3; receptor-specific ligand binding &#x003b1; chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>) indicated a critical role for Fc&#x003b3; receptors in various autoimmune arthritis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). The role of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) or their putative ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>) has also been shown in various autoimmune arthritis models. Somewhat surprisingly, however, there is very little information available on whether and to what extent signaling molecules downstream of these receptors play a role in the development of autoimmune arthritis. In this context, it is particularly important that our study identifies PLC&#x003b3;2, a component of integrin and Fc receptor signal transduction, as a critical player of the effector phase of autoimmune arthritis.</p><p>Neutrophils are critical players of the innate immune response but they also participate in tissue destruction during autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Integrins and Fc receptors are two major groups of cell surface receptors participating in neutrophil activation at the site of inflammation or bacterial invasion. We and others have shown that integrin and Fc receptor signaling in neutrophils are both mediated by a receptor-proximal tyrosine phosphorylation cascade consisting of Src family kinases, ITAM-bearing adaptor molecules, and the Syk tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>; for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) (unpublished data). In the present work, we identify PLC&#x003b3;2 as a common downstream mediator of integrin and Fc receptor signaling in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). PLC&#x003b3;2 thus appears to be a new member of a growing family of intracellular molecules participating in both integrin and Fc receptor signal transduction in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>; for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). In contrast, PLC&#x003b3;2 is dispensable for neutrophil activation through several other cell surface receptors such as G protein&#x02013;coupled formyl peptide or chemokine receptors, various cytokine receptors (TNF and GM-CSF), or members of the Toll-like receptor family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Hence, PLC&#x003b3;2 plays a specific role in signaling by a defined subset of neutrophil activatory receptors.</p><p>In addition to participating in adhesion-dependent functional responses of neutrophils, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrins are also required for the migration of the cells to the site of inflammation. Somewhat surprisingly, although PLC&#x003b3;2 is required for the former response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrin-mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) neutrophil migration can occur in the absence of PLC&#x003b3;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). This is, however, in line with the normal migration of neutrophils lacking Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), ITAM-bearing adapters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), or members of the Vav family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>) under CD18-dependent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Therefore, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrins likely use other PLC&#x003b3;2-independent pathways to support neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation.</p><p>It is also puzzling how and to what extent spreading and extravasation can be dissected at the cellular and molecular level, given the generally accepted view that spreading and firm leukocyte adhesion precedes the transmigration of leukocytes through the vessel wall. Our prior studies on leukocyte&#x02013;endothelial interactions in Syk<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow chimeras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>) indicated that a significant level of extravasation is possible even when adhesion is severely reduced and leukocyte spreading over the endothelium is apparently completely absent. Similar studies on PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow chimeras presented in this paper also indicate that severely defective adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and C</xref>), and decreased and delayed spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>) do not necessarily hinder the extravasation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>) of leukocytes. Hence, transmigration of leukocytes through the vessel wall is possible even if adhesion and spreading are severely defective. It is at present unclear how transendothelial migration occurs under these conditions. One possibility is that integrin-mediated spreading and firm adhesion simply coincide with concomitant transmigration without any major role of the former two processes in the latter one. Alternatively, spreading and adhesion may play dual roles by promoting transmigration, for example, through arresting the leukocytes at the site of inflammation, but also hindering it, for example, by holding leukocytes back by the adhesive process. If so, then a defective adhesion/spreading response would not have any major net effect on transmigration of leukocytes. Further studies will be required to reveal whether and how these or other mechanisms can explain transmigration of leukocytes when their spreading and/or adhesion responses are severely impaired.</p><p>Along the same line of thinking, it is also interesting to note that our histological analyses showed a complete lack of leukocytic infiltration in periarticular regions of PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow chimeras injected with arthritogenic K/B&#x000d7;N serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 G</xref>). Based on the normal migration of PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils under other conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), we hypothesize that the lack of PLC&#x003b3;2 blocks the development of the inflammatory environment (chemokines, cytokines, and inflammatory endothelium). Hence, the otherwise migration-competent neutrophils are not attracted to the periarticular tissues in PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow chimeras.</p><p>All of the experiments presented in this paper have been performed on inbred mice on the C57BL/6 genetic background. This strain is the most widely used genetically homogeneous mouse strain, allowing the most accurate comparison of our results with those from other investigators. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that PLC&#x003b3;2 would be less critically involved in in vitro neutrophil functions and/or the effector phase of autoimmune arthritis on a different genetic background. Such a phenomenon could theoretically be possible through compensation by either PLC&#x003b3;1 or a PLC&#x003b3;-independent mechanism. Although it would be rather difficult to predict the possible extent of compensation by the latter mechanism, studies showing that overexpression of PLC&#x003b3;1 in PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells was not able to restore B cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>) or the development of multinucleated osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>) suggest that there is relatively little room for functional compensation between the two members of the PLC&#x003b3; family.</p><p>In addition to providing clear evidence for a role of PLC&#x003b3;2 in integrin-mediated neutrophil functions and the development of K/B&#x000d7;N serum transfer arthritis, our studies also raise several novel questions that have yet to be addressed in the future. Although we hypothesize that the effect of the PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutation in vivo is a result of a neutrophil defect, this has yet to be confirmed more directly, for example, by lineage-specific deletion of PLC&#x003b3;2 in neutrophils. The same holds true for whether our in vivo phenotype is indeed caused by an integrin and/or Fc receptor signaling defect and whether PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils are indeed capable of migrating to the site of inflammation during a full-blown K/B&#x000d7;N serum transfer arthritis. Although our studies strongly implicate PLC&#x003b3;2 in the effector phase of autoantibody-mediated arthritis, its contribution to other aspects of the disease have yet to be tested, for example, using the TNF-mediated human TNF-transgenic Tg197 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>) or the IL-17&#x02013;mediated SKG point mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref>) models. It is also unclear whether the lipase activity and/or other structural features of PLC&#x003b3;2 contribute to its role in neutrophil functions in vitro and arthritis development in vivo. This, and the reason for why PLC&#x003b3;1 is apparently not able to compensate for the lack of PLC&#x003b3;2, will need to be tested by reexpression of various PLC&#x003b3;2 mutants and/or PLC&#x003b3;1 in PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells, for example, by using a retroviral reconstitution strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Finally, the role of PLC&#x003b3;2 in the various aspects of antimicrobial functions of leukocytes (such as phagocytosis by myeloid lineage cells) and its relationship to that of Src family kinases and Syk has yet to be tested in more detail.</p><p>Collectively, we found that PLC&#x003b3;2 is a central component of integrin and Fc receptor signal transduction in neutrophils, linking the receptor-proximal Src family&#x02013;ITAM adaptor&#x02013;Syk cascade to functional responses of these cells. Our results also identify PLC&#x003b3;2 as a critical player of the effector phase of autoimmune arthritis, most likely through its role in integrin and Fc receptor signaling of neutrophils. These studies provide novel insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of autoimmune inflammation and may eventually point to novel targets of future therapies of major human diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Animals.</title><p>Heterozygous mice carrying a deleted PLC&#x003b3;2 allele (<italic>PLCg2</italic><sup>tm1Jni</sup>, referred to as PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) were obtained from J.

Where indicated, primary antibodies were preincubated with 0.4 &#x000b5;g/ml of the relevant blocking peptides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) before incubation with the immunoblotting membrane. Lysates prepared from thymus or spleen cells of WT mice served for comparisons of signal intensity.</p><p>Purified recombinant Myc-tagged human PLC&#x003b3;1 and PLC&#x003b3;2, expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculoviral expression system, were obtained from P.

PLC&#x003b3;2 was precipitated using the Q-20 PLC&#x003b3;2 antibody and captured using a 1:1 mixture of protein A Sepharose (Invitrogen) and protein G Agarose (Invitrogen). Triton-soluble whole-cell lysates or PLC&#x003b3;2 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with antibodies against phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10; Millipore), PLC&#x003b3;2, p38 MAP kinase (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), ERK1/2 (combination of C-16 [ERK1] and C-14 [ERK2]; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), I&#x003ba;-B&#x003b1; (Cell Signaling Technology), or phosphospecific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) against the p38 MAP kinase, ERK, and I&#x003ba;-B&#x003b1; (14D4).</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro and in vivo migration.</title><p>In vitro migration of neutrophils was assessed by a Transwell assay system essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In brief, Transwell inserts with polycarbonate filters of 3-&#x000b5;m pore size (Corning) were precoated with human fibrinogen, filled with suspensions of WT or PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> murine neutrophils, and inserted in 24-well plate wells filled with assay media containing varying concentrations of fMLP.

To this end, bone marrow cells of PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on the C57BL/6 genetic background (i.e., carrying the CD45.2 allele) were mixed with bone marrow cells from congenic mice expressing CD45.1 on the C57BL/6 genetic background at varying ratios ranging from 10 to 70% of CD45.2-expressing cells. This mixed cell suspension was injected intravenously into lethally irradiated CD45.1-expressing recipient mice, giving rise to mixed bone marrow chimeras carrying CD45.2-expressing PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and CD45.1-expressing PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>+/+</sup> hematopoietic cells. To exclude any effect of the different CD45 alleles on cell migration, a few control chimeras were generated in a similar fashion but using PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>+/+</sup> (intact C57BL/6) mice as the CD45.2-expressing donor strain, giving rise to mixed chimeras with CD45.1- and CD45.2-expressing PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>+/+</sup> hematopoietic cells. 5&#x02013;8 wk after transplantation, the mixed bone marrow chimeras were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 3% thioglycollate broth (Heipha Diagnostics). Blood was taken directly before as well as 2 and 4 h after the injection, and the peritoneal cavity was lavaged at 4 h. The relative percentage of CD45.1- and CD45.2-expressing neutrophils in the peripheral blood and peritoneal lavage samples was determined by flow cytometry in the Gr1-positive granulocyte gate. Relative migration of neutrophils of the CD45.2-positive PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>+/+</sup> genotypes (relative to the CD45.1-expressing PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>+/+</sup> cells) was calculated as follows:<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="20081859eqn001.jpg"/></disp-formula></p></sec><sec><title>Intravital microscopy and whole mount cremaster muscle preparation.</title><p>Bone marrow chimeras were anesthetized using intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine and the cremaster muscle was prepared for intravital imaging as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Intravital microscopy was performed on an upright microscope (BX51; Olympus) with a 40&#x000d7; 0.75 NA saline immersion objective.

Superfusion of the cremaster muscle and local treatment with 1 &#x000b5;M fMLP was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Postcapillary venules ranged from 25 to 35 &#x000b5;m in diameter and were observed before and during fMLP administration.</p><p>Geometric and hemodynamic parameters, such as vessel diameter, leukocyte diameter, and vessel segment length, of postcapillary venules were assessed from recorded video tapes using a digital image processing system as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref>). Spreading of adherent leukocytes in postcapillary venules was assessed by measuring the diameter (height) of attached leukocytes perpendicular to the vessel wall before and at various time points during fMLP superfusion as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Mean blood flow velocities and wall shear rates (&#x003b3;<sub>w</sub>) were estimated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Rolling leukocyte flux fraction was defined as the ratio of rolling leukocytes to the total number of leukocytes passing the same vessel per minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">78</xref>). Leukocyte adhesion was defined as the number of adherent cells per millimeters squared of vessel surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Systemic leukocyte concentration was determined from blood samples taken at the end of the experiment as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>).</p><p>For whole mount preparations, mouse cremaster muscles were surgically prepared, as described in the first paragraph of this section, and superfused with 1 &#x000b5;M fMLP in superfusion buffer for 15 min. Thereafter, cremaster muscles were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and whole mounts were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref>). Fixed cremaster muscles were stained with Giemsa and analyzed for the number of intravascular and perivascular leukocytes using an upright microscope (Axioskop; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) through a 100&#x000d7; 1.3 NA oil immersion objective. Whole mounts from untreated cremaster muscles prepared from both WT and PLC&#x003b3;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow chimeras served as negative controls.

Visible clinical signs of arthritis were scored on a 0&#x02013;10 scale by two investigators blinded for the origin and treatment of the mice. Ankle thickness was measured by a spring-loaded caliper (Kroeplin). For histological analysis, mice were killed 4 d after serum transfer and their ankle joints were fixed in formalin (Sigma-Aldrich). The joints were then decalcified, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Histopathology Llc.). Photomicrographs were taken on a microscope (DMI 6000B; Leica).</p><p>To assess articular function, mice were placed on a custom-made wire grid (Charles River Laboratories) with identical wire thickness and spacing to a regular wire cage lid. The wire grid was flipped upside down and the length of time the mice held on to the grid was recorded. This test was performed three times daily during the period of 8&#x02013;12 d after the serum injection.
