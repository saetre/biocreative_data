Gap junctions are composed of protein subunits called connexins, which are encoded by a gene family with more than 20 members in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and are expressed in a majority of organs, including most of the endocrine and exocrine glands in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. At least 10 connexins with differing cell specificities are expressed in mammalian nervous systems; connexin 36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], connexin 45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and connexin 30.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] are considered to be preferentially expressed by neurons. Interestingly, connexin 36 has also been reported to affect synchronization of pancreatic islets and release of the peptide insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To what extent connexin 36 affects hormone and neuropeptide release from and within the central nervous system is, however, unknown.</p><p>Neuropeptide-releasing neurons in the hypothalamus and other brain areas are known to participate in coordination of autonomic, endocrine, and behavioral functions maintaining the homeostasis of the organism. The neuropeptides oxytocin, vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and somatostatin, all released from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) into the blood stream and the central nervous system, are all crucial for these functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Temporal patterns of action potentials in PVN neurons are notable; when stimulated the magnocellular oxytocin and vasopressin cells show characteristic changes in electrical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Pulsatile release of oxytocin, such as that observed during lactation, is achieved by synchronous firing of a fixed population of cells, whereas continuous release of vasopressin involves the asynchronous discharge of a variable number of neurons recruited in proportion to the stimulus intensity. As neuronal gap junctions are essential for synchronous firing in many brain areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], gap junctions between neuropeptide-containing cells could thus be a possible mechanism to explain the characteristic firing patterns of PVN neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Intriguingly, dye-coupling studies and electrophysiological experiments in rats have provided evidence for the presence of gap junctions between neurons in both the PVN and the SON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The identity of the proteins that comprise these putative gap junctions has however not been established.</p><p>In order to investigate connexin 36 expression within the PVN, we used Western blot analysis. Furthermore, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice (EGFP/connexin 36 mice) which specifically express Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) under the control of the connexin 36 promoter were used to further explore to what extent neuroendocrine as well as neuropeptide-containing cells in hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei contain connexin 36.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal protocols were approved by The Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

This approach does not interfere with the two functional copies of the connexin 36 gene. As the BAC comprises more than 100 kb of flanking DNA both upstream and downstream of the connexin 36, it contains all regulatory sequences needed for an accurate expression of the connexin 36 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Western-blot analysis</title><p>Three adult male and three adult female Swiss-Webster mice were decapitated and the following brain regions were dissected according to the procedure previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and rapidly frozen: PVN, suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus.

Accordingly, previous dye coupling studies indicate a dendritic location of the gap junctions in PVN neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Further, available anti-connexin 36 antibodies give rise to a 'punctate' staining pattern, and require delicate experimental conditions in order to work. Similarly, some of the peptides of the current study are mainly located in the axons, which for this study demands specific experimental conditions (i.e. pre-treatment with colchicine). Taken together, these cellular localizations and experimental conditions make it difficult to conduct regular colocalization studies using antibodies against the actual proteins. As the antigenicity of the EGFP protein is maintained during the required experimental conditions we used EGFP/connexin 36 transgenic mice in order to investigate coexpression patterns. These mice have a robust expression of EGFP in the PVN and other brain regions shown to contain connexin 36 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>A large number of studies using dye coupling have provided indirect evidence for gap junction communication between oxytocin and vasopressin containing neurons in the PVN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], respectively. Our data using EGFP/connexin 36 transgenic mice suggest that connexin 36 is expressed in neuroendocrine cells of PVN and PeVZ but not in neurons containing oxytocin or vasopressin, neither in unstimulated nor in stimulated animals. This result raises the possibility that other neuronal gap junction proteins may be enabling the proposed communication between magnocellular neurons in the PVN.</p><p>As neither electrotonic coupling nor gap junctions have been reported in neurons of the PVN containing CRH, our results showing EGFP/connexin 36 expression in these neurons are intriguing. However, since the number of CRH neurons in the PVN expressing EGFP/connexin 36 is low, the functional relevance of this colocalization is not obvious. Nevertheless, neural net simulations in our laboratory using data modeling suggest that a small subset of coupled neurons can have great implications for the population of neurons they belong to (Weingarten et al, unpublished data). Moreover, as mentioned above, previous studies show that neuronal coupling among PVN neurons is increased by stimulation. To what extent physiological stressors are important for connexin expression and gap junctional coupling in CRH neurons needs to be further explored.</p><p>As CRH is expressed in several specific brain nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] we further investigated if EGFP/connexin 36 was colocalized with CRH in additional brain areas outside the hypothalamus. In contrast to the PVN, where a small subset of CRH neurons were EGFP/connexin 36 positive, a majority of CRH neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus also expressed EGFP/connexin 36. Parabrachial neuronal projections are widely distributed throughout the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and are involved in the regulation of visceral, cardiovascular, respiratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and taste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] responses. Interestingly, electrical coupling and synchronization of taste-sensitive neurons in parabrachial nucleus has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, a considerable overlap between EGFP and CRH was also seen along the fourth ventricle in medial vestibular nucleus and in prepositus nucleus. These brainstem areas are known to comprise CRH neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and have previously been reported to contain connexin 36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. As no overlap between EGFP and CRH was seen in the preoptic area, the bed nucleus of stria terminalis or in the amygdala, a specific role for connexin 36 for CRH neurons in some brain areas, but not in others, is indicated.</p><p>Our studies of EGFP-positive neurons in the PeVZ show that most of these cells express somatostatin and project to the bloodstream, that is, they stained for somatostatin and contained the retrograde tracer Fluorogold injected peripherally. To what extent connexin 36 may affect somatostatin release from these neuroendocrine cells, maybe using mechanisms similar to those involved in the release of the peptide hormone insulin from pancreatic islets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], deserves further study.</p><p>The EGFP/connexin 36 expression pattern seen in the lateral hypothalamus and in the tuberomammillary nucleus was in line with previous investigations of connexin 36 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. No EGFP expression was however seen in neurons producing orexin or histamine, located in these two areas, respectively. The close proximity of neurons expressing EGFP to neurons producing orexin or histamine is however intriguing and its potential relevance deserves further investigation.</p><p>As the EGFP expression of the EGFP/connexin 36 BAC transgenic mice delineates cells expressing connexin 36, but does not provide any information regarding the number or functionality of the connexin proteins of these cells, further studies are necessary to address these issues. In order to confirm our findings indicating colocalization between connexin 36 and CRH in specific brain regions new immunohistochemical protocols, in which these two antigens can be investigated together, must be developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results contribute independent data sets indicating that the neuronal gap junction protein connexin 36 is found in the PVN. In EGFP/connexin 36 BAC transgenic mice, subsets of EGFP-positive neurons of the PVN and PeVZ project to the bloodstream, and/or contain somatostatin or CRH. Furthermore, a majority of CRH neurons of the parabrachial nucleus expressed EGFP/connexin 36. The functional implications of these findings need to be addressed in future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LW participated in the design of the study, wrote the first draft of the manuscript, performed immunohistochemistry experiments, did confocal microscopy analysis and bred the transgenic mouse strain.
