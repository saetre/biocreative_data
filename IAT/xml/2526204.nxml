In this study, we have identified a crucial regulatory role of the transcription factor NFATc2 in T cell&#x02013;dependent experimental colitis. Similar to ulcerative colitis in humans, the expression of NFATc2 was up-regulated in oxazolone-induced chronic intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, NFATc2 deficiency suppressed colitis induced by oxazolone administration. This finding was associated with enhanced T cell apoptosis in the lamina propria and strikingly reduced production of IL-6, -13, and -17 by mucosal T lymphocytes. Further studies using knockout mice showed that IL-6, rather than IL-23 and -17, are essential for oxazolone colitis induction. Administration of hyper-IL-6 blocked the protective effects of NFATc2 deficiency in experimental colitis, suggesting that IL-6 signal transduction plays a major pathogenic role in vivo. Finally, adoptive transfer of IL-6 and wild-type T cells demonstrated that oxazolone colitis is critically dependent on IL-6 production by T cells. Collectively, these results define a unique regulatory role for NFATc2 in colitis by controlling mucosal T cell activation in an IL-6&#x02013;dependent manner. NFATc2 in T cells thus emerges as a potentially new therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: AAD, amino-actinomycin D; CD, Crohn's disease; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; LPMC, lamina propria mononuclear cell; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; UC, ulcerative colitis.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the two key forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Growing evidence indicates a central role of a genetically determined dysregulation of the mucosal immune response toward the resident bacterial flora in the pathogenesis of human IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). This pathological immune response is characterized by an accumulation of antigen-presenting cells and T cells that represent the vast majority of activated mononuclear cells infiltrating the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>The differentiation and activation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the lamina propria play a major role in the pathogenesis of IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Whereas CD is associated with increased production of Th1-like cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF, the cytokine profile in chronic UC is characterized by the increased production of several Th2 cytokines, such as IL-5, -6, and -13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Interestingly, both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines have been shown to play an important pathogenic role in various animal models of IBD, suggesting that both T helper subsets can induce chronic intestinal inflammation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). This pathogenic function of Th1 and Th2 cells can be counteracted by immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;, which are produced by regulatory T cells and Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>T lymphocytes transit through sequential stages of cytokine activation, commitment, silencing, and physical stabilization during polarization into effector subsets, a process that is tightly controlled by regulatory transcriptional events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Although transcription factors such as STAT-6, GATA-3, c-Maf and JunB have been shown to control Th2 cytokine production, STAT-1, STAT-4, and T-bet are associated with signaling events in Th1 cells and play a key role in Th1-specific cytokine production in peripheral T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In the mucosal immune system, several studies have suggested important roles for STAT-4 and T-bet in Th1 cell effector functions in the gut in experimental colitis and CD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). However, the functional role of other T cell transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in IBD is poorly understood.</p><p>The NFAT family of transcription factors consists of five members: NFATc1 (also known as NFATc or NFAT2), NFATc2 (NFATp or NFAT1), NFATc3 (NFATx or NFAT4), NFATc4 (NFAT3), and NFAT5 (TonEBP or OREBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). All NFAT proteins have a highly conserved DNA-binding domain that is structurally related to the DNA-binding domain of the REL family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). This REL-homology region (RHR) is the unifying characteristic of NFAT proteins and confers a common DNA-binding specificity.</p><p>NFAT proteins seem to play a pivotal role in the activation and differentiation of T lymphocytes and are activated by calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). In fact, calcium-bound calmodulin activates the calcineurin phosphatase complex, which dephosphorylates NFATc1 and causes its import into the nucleus, where NFATc1 and its nuclear partner, NFATn, cooperatively bind to DNA. NFATc1 complexes act as &#x0201c;coincidence detectors&#x0201d; and allow the integration of multiple signaling pathways at the level of DNA binding. In addition to NFATc1, NFATc2 is constitutively expressed in T cells and controls T cell activation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Consistently, NFATc2 KO mice developed a hyperproliferative syndrome with increased numbers of peripheral lymphocytes caused by defects in activation-induced cell death and reduced expression of several proapoptotic genes, such as CD95L and TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). NFATc2-deficient mice also showed alterations in T cell cytokine production. Whereas NFATc2-deficient splenic T cells displayed reduced early IL-4 production, increased levels of IL-4 were found at later time points during Th2 development, suggesting that NFATc2 is important for cytokine production by peripheral T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to peripheral T cells, the function of NFATc2 in mucosal T cells remains largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the role of NFATc2 signal transduction in intestinal inflammation. A significantly higher expression of NFATc2 was found in UC tissues compared with control samples. Furthermore, NFATc2 was found to play a pivotal regulatory role in T cell&#x02013;dependent experimental colitis by controlling IL-6&#x02013;dependent T cell activation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Enhanced expression of NFATc2 in patients with IBDs</title><p>The NFAT plays a fundamental role in controlling calcium-dependent T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). As T cells have been suggested to play a major role in patients with IBDs, we analyzed expression of NFATc2 by immunohistochemistry.

To determine whether T lymphocytes in IBD express NFAT proteins, double staining for CD3 and NFATc2 was performed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).

To analyze the functional role of NFATc2 in experimental colitis, we then took advantage of genetically engineered mice in which the NFATc2 gene was inactivated by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In these studies, we determined whether NFATc2-deficient mice exhibit an altered susceptibility to oxazolone colitis that (similarly to UC) is characterized by IL-5 and -13 production by T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). It was found that NFATc2-deficient mice were almost completely protected from oxazolone colitis. Although WT mice challenged with oxazolone showed a marked weight loss, no diarrhea and weight loss were noted in mice lacking NFATc2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Consistently, histological analysis showed significant suppression of colitis activity in NFATc2-deficient mice compared with WT mice after administration of oxazolone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

Colonic cryosections from WT and NFATc2 KO mice were incubated with anti-NFATc2 antibodies followed by tyramide signal amplification. An increased expression of NFATc2 was observed in colonic tissue from WT mice with oxazolone colitis (WT oxa) as compared with WT unchallenged mice. Colonic tissue from NFATc2 KO mice (NFATc2 oxa) served as negative control and did not reveal any specific staining as expected. (B) Oxazolone colitis was induced by sensitizing mice with oxazolone, followed by intrarectal administration of the hapten reagent after 1 wk. The body weight of the mice was monitored after oxazolone rechallenge at the indicated time points. Mean values &#x000b1; the SEM from two representative experiments out of six are shown. The average weight of the mice at the beginning of the experiments was 22.9 g (WT group) and 22.5 g (NFATc2 KO group), respectively. For this experiment, 6 WT and 7 NFATc2 KO mice were used. (C) Histological sections (left) of colonic inflammation in WT or NFATc2-deficient mice upon oxazolone administration. Signs of inflammation such as goblet cell depletion, ulcers, and accumulation of mononuclear cells were noted in WT mice, whereas NFATc2 KO mice showed little or no evidence of colitis. Quantitative histopathologic assessment of colitis activity (right) showed a significant (&#x0002a;P <italic>&#x0003c;</italic> 0.05) protection from inflammation and tissue injury in NFATc2 KO mice compared with WT mice.

(D) High-resolution miniendoscopic analysis (left) of the colon of NFATc2 KO and WT mice in oxazolone colitis. Marked erosions and ulcers were seen in the WT group, whereas an almost normal colon architecture was noted in NFATc2-deficient mice. Quantitative endoscopic analysis (right) of inflammation (MEICS score) in WT and NFATc2 KO mice in oxazolone colitis was done at day 2 after administration of oxazolone. A significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.05) lower endoscopic score was observed in NFATc2-deficient mice compared with WT mice. (E) Adoptive T cell transfer from WT and NFATc2-deficient mice in SCID mice. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were transferred into CB-17/SCID mice, followed by oxazolone sensitization and intrarectal oxazolone administration. The body weight of reconstituted mice was analyzed at indicated time points. Mean values &#x000b1; SEM from one representative experiment out of three are shown. Whereas mice reconstituted with WT T cells showed a marked weight loss, mice given NFATc2-deficient T cells were protected from colitis and gained weight.

As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>, mice given WT T cells developed severe colitis with weight loss, whereas mice reconstituted with NFATc2-deficient T cells were protected from such colitis, suggesting that NFATc2 mediates its pathogenic role in oxazolone colitis via its effects on T lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased apoptotic rate of NFATc2-deficient lamina propria T cells in oxazolone-induced colitis</title><p>Because it is known that NFATc2-deficient mice have a defect in lymphocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), we next assessed the apoptotic rate of lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) in oxazolone-induced colitis. Accordingly, cryosections of oxazolone-treated WT and NFATc2 KO mice were stained by TUNEL assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Surprisingly, a significantly higher number of apoptotic cells was observed in NFATc2-deficient mice as compared with WT control mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Furthermore, double staining analysis for CD3 and TUNEL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) revealed a higher number of apoptotic T cells in the former as compared with the latter mice, suggesting that NFATc2-deficient lamina propria T cells in oxazolone colitis are more susceptible to undergo programmed cells death than WT T cells. To further analyze this possibility, we analyzed freshly isolated T cell enriched lamina propria cells from WT and NFAT-deficient mice for apoptosis by FACS analysis using 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD) and anti&#x02013;annexin V antibodies. In oxazolone-induced colitis, a significantly higher rate of apoptotic lamina propria cells was seen in NFATc2 KO mice compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Furthermore, there was a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic T lymphocytes in the lamina propria of NFATc2 KO mice compared with WT mice in oxazolone-induced colitis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Interestingly, NFATc2-deficient T cells expressed lower amounts of antiapoptotic proteins, such as bcl-xl and bcl-2, compared with WT T cells in colitis (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072484/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072484/DC1</ext-link>). As NFATc2-deficient T cells are normally resistant to undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), our data thus suggested the possibility that external factors such as the cytokine milieu may cause increased mucosal NFATc2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cell apoptosis in experimental colitis.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Augmented T cell apoptosis in the colon of NFATc2-deficient mice in oxazolone-induced colitis.</bold> (A) Cryosections of colonic tissue from WT and NFATc2-deficient mice in oxazolone-induced colitis were made, and apoptotic cells were stained using the TUNEL reaction.

In comparison to WT cells, LPMCs from NFATc2-deficient mice showed an increased number of apoptotic cells in oxazolone-induced colitis.

Whereas T cell survival at the end of the cell cultures differed by only &#x0223c;10% between the groups (79% in WT vs. 70% in NFAT KO mice), the production of the above cytokines was reduced by &#x0003e;70% in the absence of NFATc2, suggesting that NFATc2 controls cytokine production by mucosal T cells. In contrast to IL-6, -13, and -17, no significant changes in IL-4 production were noted. Furthermore, a significant induction of IL-5 production by NFATc2-deficient cells was observed, suggesting that only distinct cytokines produced by T cells are reduced by the absence of the transcription factor NFATc2. The reduced IL-17 production by T cells lacking NFATc2 was remarkable, as both splenic and lamina propria cells from NFATc2-deficient mice expressed normal or even increased amounts of the Th17 master transcription factor ROR-&#x003b3;t (unpublished data).

Here, we have identified a central pathogenic role for the transcription factor NFATc2 in chronic intestinal inflammation. In an initial series of studies, we demonstrated that NFATc2 expression is increased in lamina propria T cells in UC compared with control patients. We then took advantage of genetically altered mice that lack NFATc2 to uncover a critical role for this factor in chronic intestinal inflammation. We found that NFATc2&#x02013; and IL-6&#x02013;deficient T cells fail to induce T cell&#x02013;mediated oxazolone colitis. In further mechanistic studies, we found that NFATc2 deficiency blocks IL-6 production by mucosal T lymphocytes thereby inducing T cell apoptosis and preventing development of IL-6/-13&#x02013;producing T cells. Finally, we showed that activation of IL-6 signaling in vivo via hyper-IL-6 abrogates the protective effects of NFATc2 deficiency in T cell&#x02013;mediated colitis and induces IL-6 and -13 production. These data identify NFATc2 as a master regulator for IL-6 production and subsequent T cell activation in experimental colitis in vivo.</p><p>Consistent with a recent proteomic study in UC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), we observed that expression of NFATc2 proteins is increased in IBD patients. The finding that lamina propria T lymphocytes in patients with IBD expressed increased amounts of NFATc2 led us to further investigate the functional role of this transcription factor in a T cell&#x02013;mediated animal model of IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). These results demonstrated a potent regulatory role of NFATc2 in experimental colitis. In fact, NFATc2 KO mice were protected from oxazolone colitis, and this protective effect could be adoptively transferred by T lymphocytes, strongly suggesting that NFATc2 regulates mucosal T cell activity in vivo.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that inactivation of the NFATc2 gene leads to increased numbers of peripheral lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). This finding is at least partially caused by a defect of NFATc2-deficient splenic T cells to undergo activation-induced cell death in a Fas/FasL-dependent pathway. In contrast to these findings in peripheral T cells, we observed a significantly increased number of apoptotic mucosal CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in NFATc2-deficient mice in experimental colitis, suggesting that augmented T cell death in the absence of NFATc2 might contribute to protection from experimental colitis. To analyze the potential mechanism for these differences in mucosal T cell apoptosis, we next assessed the production of proinflammatory cytokines in experimental colitis. Consistent with previous studies on augmented Th2 T cell development by NFATc2-deficient T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), we observed that splenic T cells from NFATc2 KO mice in oxazolone colitis produced significantly more IL-4 than T cells from WT mice. However, no significant differences in the production of this cytokine were observed between WT and NFATc2-deficient mucosal T cells, whereas IL-5 production was induced in the absence of NFATc2. In contrast, the production of IL-6, -13, and -17 was significantly reduced by NFATc2-deficient mucosal T cells compared with control WT T cells. Interestingly, IL-17 production was reduced in spite of normal or even increased levels of the Th17 master transcription factor ROR&#x003b3;t (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), suggesting that both ROR&#x003b3;t and NFATc2 are required to induce optimal IL-17 production by a large number of mucosal T cells. However, both IL-23&#x02013; and IL-17A&#x02013;deficient mice showed normal susceptibility for oxazolone colitis, suggesting that other cytokines might be crucial for the decreased susceptibility of NFATc2-deficient mice to oxazolone colitis.</p><p>IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine with pro- and antiinflammatory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), and it stimulates target cells via a membrane receptor complex consisting of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and the signaling receptor subunit gp130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Although gp130 is ubiquitously expressed, the IL-6R is only found on hepatocytes and some hematopoietic cells. Interestingly, a soluble form of the IL-6R (sIL-6R) has been shown to bind IL-6 and to stimulate gp130 on cells that do not express the IL-6R. This process has been named IL-6 trans-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) and activates T cells lacking the IL-6R such as most mucosal T cells. As IL-6 signaling has been identified as a key regulator of T cell apoptosis in experimental colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>), we have focused on the effects of IL-6 trans-signaling in NFATc2-deficient mice. It was found that the administration of hyper-IL-6, a potent activator of IL-6/sIL-6R signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>), completely restores IL-13 production by NFATc2-deficient T cells and abrogates the protective effect of NFATc2 deficiency in oxazolone colitis in vivo. These data suggest that NFATc2 regulates experimental colitis in vivo in an IL-6&#x02013;dependent fashion and that IL-6 signaling is important to augment mucosal IL-6 and -13 production. Finally, adoptive transfer studies showed that IL-6 production by T lymphocytes is important for activity of oxazolone-induced colitis.</p><p>NFATc2 deficiency in RAG KO mice results in the development of severe colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>), suggesting that this transcription factor plays a protective role in innate mucosal immune responses. In contrast, we observed here that NFATc2 plays an important pathogenic role in controlling T cell effector responses in experimental colitis. In fact, this study identifies NFATc2 as a master regulator for T cell-mediated oxazolone colitis and the regulation of IL-6 production by mucosal T cells with subsequent effects on T cell cytokine production and apoptosis. Thus, modulation of NFATc2 function in T cells appears to be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in T cell&#x02013;mediated chronic intestinal inflammation such as is observed in IBDs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Patients.</title><p>Gut specimens obtained from patients with CD or UC or from control patients were studied.
