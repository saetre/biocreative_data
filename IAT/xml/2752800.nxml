Despite the importance of IF mechanics for cell biology and cell mechanics, the structural basis for their mechanical properties remains unknown. Specifically, our understanding of fundamental filament properties, such as the basis for their great extensibility, stiffening properties, and their exceptional mechanical resilience remains limited. This has prevented us from answering fundamental structure-function relationship questions related to the biomechanical role of intermediate filaments, which is crucial to link structure and function in the protein material's biological context. Here we utilize an atomistic-level model of the human vimentin dimer and tetramer to study their response to mechanical tensile stress, and describe a detailed analysis of the mechanical properties and associated deformation mechanisms. We observe a transition from alpha-helices to beta-sheets with subsequent interdimer sliding under mechanical deformation, which has been inferred previously from experimental results. By upscaling our results we report, for the first time, a quantitative comparison to experimental results of IF nanomechanics, showing good agreement. Through the identification of links between structures and deformation mechanisms at distinct hierarchical levels, we show that the multi-scale structure of IFs is crucial for their characteristic mechanical properties, in particular their ability to undergo severe deformation of &#x02248;300&#x00025; strain without breaking, facilitated by a cascaded activation of a distinct deformation mechanisms operating at different levels. This process enables IFs to combine disparate properties such as mechanosensitivity, strength and deformability. Our results enable a new paradigm in studying biological and mechanical properties of IFs from an atomistic perspective, and lay the foundation to understanding how properties of individual protein molecules can have profound effects at larger length-scales.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intermediate filaments (IFs), in addition to microtubules and microfilaments, are one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Herrmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Hutchison1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Herrmann2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

It has also been observed that due to severe stiffening, the tangent modulus of IFs increases manifold during deformation, a property that is believed to be crucial for providing mechanical stability to cells at large stretch.

Each vimentin dimer contains 466 amino acids and forms the fundamental building block of IFs. Each dimer consists of four major structural segments linked in series in the sequence 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B, connected by linkers L1, L12 and L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Although there exists clear evidence that IFs play a key role in important physiological and pathological mechanisms, a complete atomistic-level molecular model of the basic constituents of this kind of protein material remains elusive. So far, only parts of two of the four segments, a section of the 1A and 2B domain of the vimentin dimer structure, have been crystallized and their atomic structure identified based on x-ray diffraction experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Parry1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Sokolova1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Strelkov1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Strelkov2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> (the structures are found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries 1gk4, 1gk6 and 1gk7).

Since IFs are intrinsically disordered structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Rafik1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, x-ray diffraction studies on naturally occurring or recombinantly produced IF bundles do not provide sufficient data to produce a full atomistic model of IFs.

This heterogeneous distribution of the bending stiffness along the molecule's axis strongly affects the filaments' motion by enhancing its mobility due an effectively reduced persistence length, which might be significant for IF self-assembly. Thereby, the linker domains act as hinges around which the molecular structure can rather easily bend and rotate.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g002">Figure 2C</xref> shows a snapshot of the molecular model of the vimentin tetramer, consisting of two anti-parallel dimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Sokolova1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Segments 1A, 1B and 2A are fully contained in this part, but the 2B segments in the immediate vicinity of the two terminals are located completely outside. We find that the head segment of each dimer is coiled around the other dimer, increasing the contact surface area and thereby providing enhanced interdimer interactions. This structure is an alternative configuration to the sandwich model that has been discussed as a possible tetramer arrangement, where the head domain is located in between the two dimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Kreplak2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007294.s013">Movie S2</xref> shows the equilibrated structure of the vimentin tetramer, suggesting that the overlapped L1/L12 linker domains represent regions of locally soft bending stiffness similar to the dimer geometry. From an analysis of the movie it can be seen that compared with the dimer structure, the tetramer structure is notably more stiff due to its increased area moment of inertia, resulting in an effectively increased persistence length.

The simulations reveal three distinct regimes of deformation. In the first regime (I), the pulling force increases linearly with strain until it reaches an angular point, where a dramatic change in the slope emerges. In the second regime (II), the force-strain curve resembles a plateau regime where the pulling force remains almost constant. It is found that unfolding of all alpha-helical domains occurs in this regime (II). In the third regime (III), the stretching force increases rapidly as the strain increases. This is caused by pulling the unfolded polypeptide backbone of the protein, where the stretching of covalent bonds leads to a much increased stiffness.

The simulations reveal four distinct regimes. In the first regime (I), the pulling force increases linearly with the strain until it reaches the angular point. In the second regime (II), the force-strain curve forms a plateau, where the pulling force keeps almost constant, which is similar to the case of the deformation properties of the dimer. From simulation snapshots, we find that the 2B segments unfold first, starting from the stutter location, then expanding throughout the entire segment. In the third regime (III), we observe a significant transition in the force-strain behavior. During this transition, the pulling force changes from the low-force plateau (&#x0003c;1 nN) to a peak value of 7.3 nN, marking the onset of the final regime (IV). Beyond the peak value, the force level in regime (IV) begins to decrease. The force plateau observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g004">Figs. 4A and B</xref> relates to the stepwise unfolding of the coiled-coil segments. We observe that at the end of the plateau regime, the dimer and tetramer behave differently. Once the dimer is completely uncoiled, the pulling force abruptly increases due to the stretching of the protein backbone. Whereas for the tetramer, the overlapped part in center begins to uncoil, and the pulling force approaches a much broader transition region, where the structure becomes significantly stiffer and eventual fails by interdimer sliding. The two dimers are completely detached at &#x02248;300&#x00025; strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

The comparison between simulation and experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, showing overall good agreement between simulation and experiment. Specifically, the Young's modulus for small deformation, calculated from the pre-angular point regime shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> (where the dimer is deformed homogeneously), results in values in the range of &#x02248;380&#x02013;540 MPa. This is in close agreement with experimental results from corresponding vimentin IF bending experiments, which show moduli in the range of 300&#x02013;900 MPa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Guzman1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. This agreement supports the notion that IFs should be considered as a continuous body in the very small-deformation regime where no unfolding or sliding occurs. The resulting maximum stress for the filament is predicted to be &#x02248;97 MPa (found at &#x02248;205&#x00025; strain) from simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), close to experimental measurements of 90 MPa at similar levels of strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Kreplak1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The transitions of the stress-strain behavior and the maximum strength in the two methods show overall good agreement. However, in the lower strain regime before transition, the experimental stress is higher, possibly caused by effect of sliding of the filament on the surface during stretching. From the analysis of the stress-strain behavior, we extract the tangent modulus for the full length filament to be &#x02248;3..12 MPa below 50&#x00025; strain. This modulus is close to experimental results, where a range of &#x02248;7..15 MPa was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Kreplak1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Fudge2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. We note that the initial tangent Young's moduli found here are significantly smaller than typical values reported for &#x003b1;-keratins (1.8 GPa), microtubules (0.9 GPa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Hearle1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and F-actin (2.6 GPa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Gittes1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, confirming the characteristic properties of IFs. In both simulation and experiment, the tangent modulus increases by a factor of &#x02248;20 once 150&#x00025; strain is reached, leading to severe stiffening. The tangent modulus in simulation approaches &#x02248;185 MPa before failure, similar to experimental results. Possible explanations for the discrepancies between experiment and simulation include the presence of defects, structural irregularities, and the fact that much longer filaments are considered in experiment, whereas the small system considered in our simulations is perfect without any structural flaws.

The reason why the 2A segment ruptures first is that while the other three segments are coiled-coils, the 2A segment is essentially a parallel alpha-helical bundle, which has a lower mechanical stability against tensile stretch as pointed out earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Parry1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Qin1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Once the 2A segment is fully uncoiled at &#x02248;19&#x00025; strain, the other segments 1B, 1A and 2B begin to uncoil sequentially.

The unfolding sequence with unfolding in the order 2B&#x02192;1A&#x02192;1B&#x02192;2A is repeatable in different simulations. Notably, the unfolding sequence in the tetramer is reversed when comparing it with the dimer.

Thereby, the specific sequence of alpha-helix unfolding (providing great sensitivity to mechanical deformation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g008">Figs. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g009">9</xref>), subsequent <italic>&#x003b1;-&#x003b2;</italic> transition and interdimer sliding via beta-sheet crystal rupture ensures the mechanical function of IFs under a wide range of strains.

The unfolding of alpha-helical domains, facilitated by repeated breaking of serially arranged clusters of H-bonds (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g006">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g007">7</xref>) absorbs stretching energy while keeping the other structures intact. Thereby, the grouping of H-bonds into clusters of 3&#x02013;4 in each alpha-helical turn has been shown to be crucial in order to yield maximum mechanical strength against rupture, and contributes to the enhanced stability of alpha-helical turns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Ackbarow2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The coiled arrangement of the polypeptide into turns provides the structural basis for increased &#x0201c;hidden length&#x0201d; of the backbone chain, which is being released when rupture occurs. This, together with the serial arrangement of multiple turns into long alpha-helical domains is the structural basis to enable their ability to stretch more than 140&#x00025; at relatively low force levels on the order of hundreds of pN. The arrangement of two alpha-helices into coiled-coil domains provides increased strength and additional deformability to increase the overall mechanical stretchability in excess of 150&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Ackbarow4">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. During the uncoiling of alpha-helical and coiled-coil structures, an <italic>&#x003b1;-&#x003b2;</italic> transition occurs. This is facilitated by allowing the uncoiled chains to connect via H-bonds, and thereby to form beta-strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), assembled into small clusters with several H-bonds each. These beta-shear topologies are highly efficient in resisting tensile force and thus control the mechanical behavior in the regime of large deformation at strain levels in excess of 150&#x00025; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g008">Figs. 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g009">9B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Keten1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

We carried out molecular dynamics simulations to measure their response to mechanical stress. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nanomechanical analysis of the vimentin dimer and tetramer at atomistic and molecular resolution. Our analysis provides detailed insight into the molecular-level deformation mechanisms, and enabled us to link the force-strain behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) to geometric changes in the structural makeup of the protein at different hierarchical levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g006">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007294-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The overall good agreement between experiment and simulation suggests that our model captures the key structural and mechanical features of the vimentin IF. Specifically, the tetramer molecular simulation study highlights the two molecular ingredients elementary for IF tensile properties, an alpha-helix to beta-sheet transition, and a sliding process that begins at large deformation.</p><p>The most salient feature of vimentin and other IFs is that the filament is rather compliant at low strain, whereas it becomes much stiffer at high strain, as confirmed in the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g004">Fig. 4</xref>. We find that there is no sliding at small strain, suggesting that IFs should be considered as a continuous body at small strains. This is confirmed by the fact that the predictions put forth based on the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> agree closely with experimental modulus measurements in bending. We find that large deformation of both the dimer and the tetramer is accompanied by an <italic>&#x003b1;-&#x003b2;</italic> transition, a phenomenon that has been observed for other long coiled-coil protein filaments such as &#x003b1;-keratin IF fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Hearle1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Kreplak3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Kreplak4">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, myosin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Schwaiger1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and IF hagfish slime threads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Fudge1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007294-Fudge2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results further suggest that the hierarchical makeup of IFs is elementary in defining their characteristic mechanical properties through a cascaded activation of deformation mechanisms, each associated with a specific level of filament strain as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007294-t001">Table 1</xref>. This process, likely evolutionarily driven, combines disparate properties such as strength and superelasticity (the ability to tolerate large deformation without breaking). At larger levels, these properties may play a role in the protection of the structure and topology of the cell's cytoplasm under large deformation and at large forces. Furthermore, the characteristic sequence of segment unfolding as a function of different levels of strain (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g008">Fig. 8</xref>) may be an important element in mechanotransduction, as each unfolded segment could perhaps facilitate the binding of specific signaling proteins, providing a means to enable biochemical signaling of different levels of stretch.</p><p>The assumptions made in the design of the computational approach used here are based on using methods that allow for the development of the most appropriate simulation model, given constraints such as simulation size, computational resources, and requirements based on the particular biophysics of the problem. Future work could be focused on further refinement of the structural model reported here, for example by using higher fidelity atomistic force field models, or perhaps by using methods that facilitate the enhanced sampling of structural configurations. However, due to the large size of the protein filaments considered here, the computational expense of such simulations can be significant, in particular if long time-scales are considered.</p><p>The use of other methods, such as replica exchange simulations or coarse-grained approaches could be explored to provide an additional comparison with the results obtained here, for example to reach a better sampling of structural configurations at long time-scales. Here we report a first simulation of the vimentin tetramer using a coarse-grained model with explicit water, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g011">Fig. 11A</xref>, where the initial geometry is based on the result of the full atomistic equilibration (structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). This coarse-grained model enables us to reach time-scales of hundreds of nanoseconds to microseconds. An analysis of the structural evolution of the tetramer in this coarse-grained representation provides further evidence for the stability of the predicted structure at long time-scales of hundreds of nanoseconds, as confirmed in the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g011">Fig. 11B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007294-g011">Fig 11C</xref>. Since the structure is stable with the atomistic (both effective Gaussian model and explicit solvent), as well as with the coarse-grained representation provides evidence that the results are reliable, despite variations in the model representation. The coarse-grained model may be applied to studying the assembly process of unit length filaments or the compacting process of full length filaments.</p><fig id="pone-0007294-g011" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007294.g011</object-id><label>Figure 11</label><caption><title>Coarse-grained representation of the vimentin tetramer (in explicit water) and structural stability of the vimentin tetramer structure at time-scales of hundreds of nanoseconds.</title><p>By replacing the full atomistic representation with a bead model (where several beads reflect one amino acid), much longer time-scales can be reached.

The study reported here provides a new way forward in carrying out molecular-level studies of IF structure-property relationships. This may be particularly important to probe the effects of the variability of the structure and associated changes in chemical and intermolecular interactions (e.g. amino acid mutations and other molecular defects). Defects may be introduced at different hierarchical levels of the structure of vimentin intermediate filament, and the effects on the biomechanical performance may provide important insight into physiological and diseased states of IFs. This specifically includes the possibility of probing the effect of mutations using <italic>in silico</italic> materiomics methods, enabling pathogenesis studies of severe medical conditions associated with IF. The model sets the stage for studies ranging from <italic>in vivo</italic> cross-linking events (e.g. how keratinocyte transglutaminase crosslinks keratins in the skin) to investigating the effects of protein binding on IF mechanics. Due to the emerging significance of intermediate filaments in a variety of cellular process, the results of our study also contribute to improved understanding of cell deformation, cell adhesion and mechanotransduction. IFs can also be considered a model system that may enable us to fabricate <italic>de novo</italic> engineered materials that display a high sensitivity to applied forces, show resilient mechanical properties, and provide biological compatibility.

The explicit solvent model and the coarse-grained approach is used to validate the results of implicit solvent simulations. The use of the effective solvent model is further motivated by our desire to overcome the limitations of relatively fast unfolding rates used in the simulations. The lack of slow water relaxation processes in the implicit model enables us to effectively model the physical conditions of pulling experiments at much longer time-scales.
