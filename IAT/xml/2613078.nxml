During <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblast division, this process involves stabilization of the apical complex and interaction between the Inscuteable (Insc) and Partner of inscuteable (Pins) proteins. Both cell-intrinsic factors and cell&#x02013;cell interactions seem to contribute to cell fate decisions in the retina. The Pins protein is known to play a major role in the asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants during development of the central nervous system in general, but its role in asymmetric cell divisions and retinoblast cell fate has never been explored. The primary aim of this study was to determine the spatial distribution and time course of mouse homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Partner of Inscuteable (mPins) expression in the developing and adult mouse eye.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The expression pattern of <italic>mPins</italic> was studied in the mouse eye from embryonic (E) stage E11.5 until adulthood, by semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. In addition, variations in mRNA and protein levels for mPins were analyzed in the developing postnatal and adult lens, by semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR, western blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We detected <italic>mPins</italic> mRNA at early stages of mouse embryonic eye development, particularly in the neuroblastic layer. In early postnatal development, <italic>mPins</italic> mRNA was still detected in the neuroblastic layer, but also began to be detectable in the ganglion cell layer. Thereafter, <italic>mPins</italic> mRNA was found throughout the retina. This pattern was maintained in differentiated adult retina. Immunohistochemical studies showed that mPins protein was present in the neuroblastic layer and the ganglion cell layer during the early stages of postnatal retinal development. At these stages, mPins protein was colocalized with Numb protein, a marker of the ACD. At later postnatal stages, mPins protein was present in all retinal nuclear layers and in the inner plexiform layer. It continued to be detected in these layers in the differentiated retina; the outer plexiform layer and the photoreceptor inner segments also began to display positive immunostaining for mPins. In the adult retina, mPins was also detected in the retinal pigment epithelium and choroidal melanocytes. Throughout development, mPins protein was detected in nonretinal tissues, including the cornea, ciliary body, and lens. We focused our attention on lens development and showed that mPins protein was first detected at E14.5. The most striking results obtained concerned the lens, in which mPins protein distribution switched from the anterior to the posterior region of the lens during embryonic development. Interestingly, in the postnatal and adult lens, mPins protein was detected in all lens cells and fibers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We provide the first demonstration that mPins protein is expressed from embryonic stages until adulthood in the mouse eye. These results suggest that mPins plays important roles in eye development. This work provides preliminary evidence strongly supporting a role for mPins in the asymmetric division of retinoblasts, and in the structure and functions of adult mouse retina. However, the link between the presence of mPins in different ocular compartments and the possible occurrence of asymmetric cell divisions in these compartments remains to be clarified. Further studies are required to elucidate the in vitro and in vivo functions of mPins in the developing and adult human eye.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell proliferation and cell differentiation are fundamental processes in invertebrate and vertebrate development. They involve crucial events, such as cell polarization, segregation and localization of cell fate determinants, mitotic spindle orientation, and symmetric or asymmetric cell divisions. The establishment and maintenance of cell polarization are extremely important for epithelial cells and neurons, and for several other cell types. Three different groups of proteins have emerged as the key players in both epithelial cell and neuronal polarization: 1) the PAR proteins, 2) the CRB, Stardust and Patj (PALS1 and PATJ in mammals) proteins; and 3) a set of proteins including Scribble (Scrb), Discs-large (Dlg), and Lethal-giant-larvae (Lgl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Elegant experiments have shown that these 3 sets of proteins involved in cell polarization interact genetically to define the apical and basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. A large number of studies performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> over the past 15 years have demonstrated strong associations between certain PAR proteins and the occurrence of asymmetric cell divisions during the development of the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. An example is provided by the development of the abdominal segment of the ventral nerve cord in the embryonic CNS in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Each segment consists of about 700 neurons and 60 glial cells with different fates and morphologies, all derived from progenitor cells called neuroblasts (NBs). A diversity of cell fates is generated from a single precursor cell through programmed asymmetric cell division. During the asymmetric division of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NBs and sensory organ precursor cells, 2 different protein complexes have been shown to be necessary and to play different main roles: the mouse homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Partner of Inscuteable (mPins)/G&#x003b1;i complex is principally involved in spindle orientation (metaphase NBs align their spindles perpendicular to the epithelium layer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], whereas the PAR complex appears to be involved in the basal localization of cell-fate determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. PAR complex function requires 2 cortical tumor suppressors: Dlg and Lgl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Dlg and Lgl are primarily involved in localizing basal proteins and have only a mild effect on the increasing formation of apical proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. However, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Pins interacts with Dlg and is a key protein in the Frizzled signaling pathway regulating the establishment of cell polarity and asymmetric cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>].</p><p>Two Pins homologs have been characterized in vertebrates: AGS-3 (activator of G protein signaling), which is found only in certain tissues, and Leu-Gly-Asn repeat-enriched protein (LGN), which is ubiquitous and has a sequence more similar to that of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. The mouse homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins (mPins), also called LGN, has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. The mPins protein has a similar amino acid sequence and similar functional domains to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins protein, along its entire length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. <italic>Pins</italic> encodes a protein with 7 tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) in its N-terminal region and 3 GoLoco motifs at its C-terminal region. TPR motifs are involved in protein&#x02013;protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>], and are, in particular, responsible for interaction with the asymmetric localization domain of Inscuteable (Insc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. GoLoco motifs bind to the G&#x003b1;i subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Deletion analysis of Pins has shown that, as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], the C-terminal GoLoco-containing region specifies membrane targeting, whereas the N-terminal TPR further refines localization to the apical cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Pins, G&#x003b1;i, and Insc proteins form a complex. Pins and Insc are dependent on each other for apical asymmetric localization in delaminated NBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. This leads to Pins/G&#x003b1;i recruitment to the apical cortex in NBs. Pins activates G&#x003b1;i, and this polarized activation of G&#x003b1;i attracts 1 of the 2 spindle poles, thereby inducing reorientation of the mitotic spindle during asymmetric cell division (ACD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. This Pins/G&#x003b1;i/Insc complex appears to be conserved in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Pins is expressed in many mouse tissues, but its distribution in the CNS correlates with zones containing proliferative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Mouse Pins has been shown to be a functional homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins, able to display asymmetric localization and to substitute for Pins function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Indeed, mammalian Pins physically interacts with the asymmetric localization domain of Insc through its TPR (TPR3-TPR7). Insc function is conserved in mammals and is required for correct orientation of the mitotic spindle in precursor cells of the rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. These data suggest that the same Pins/G&#x003b1;i/Insc complex may be involved in spindle reorientation and may lead to the specification of different cell types in the developing mammalian retina.</p><p>During development of the mammalian nervous system, a small number of progenitor cells gives rise to a huge variety of neurons and glial cells. ACD makes a significant contribution to this neuronal diversity. It has been demonstrated that ACD also contributes to the neuronal diversity of the retina, which is actually much greater than initially predicted by Ramon y Cajal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] and most neuroscientists. Cell differentiation begins in the central part of the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Cell divisions that give rise to differentiating cells initially occur only in the central retina. During the same period, cell divisions in the peripheral retina are exclusively symmetric and play an essential role in increasing the pool of progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. There is evidence that both cell-intrinsic factors and cell&#x02013;cell interactions contribute to cell fate decisions in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>], but the relative importance and molecular bases of these elements remain unknown.</p><p>In summary, the mammalian retina displays a huge cell diversity and ACD has been shown to occur in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>] and chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>] retina. Based on these data and the crucial role of Pins in asymmetric cell division in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], we focused this study on the determination of temporal and spatial expression patterns of the mouse homolog of <italic>Drosophila Pins</italic> (<italic>mPins)</italic> in the developing mouse eye, to determine what potential roles mPins could play in the development of the diverse mouse ocular compartments. We also determined mPins expression patterns both in term of mRNAs and proteins in the adult mouse retina to provide novel information concerning possible roles of mPins in adult mouse retinal physiologic functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animals were handled in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research.

C57Bl6/j mice, used for the preparation of tissue RNA extracts or tissue sections, were obtained from Charles River (L'arbresle, France). The date of conception was established by the presence of a vaginal plug in the dam and recorded as E0 (embryonic day 0). The day of birth was designated as P0 (postnatal day 0).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>The mouse embryos were microdissected from the whole trophoblast under a dissecting microscope. Microdissected embryos were placed on the surface of hard plastic cups filled with optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium (Tissue Tek; Bayer Diagnostic, Puteaux, France). The lower surface of the cups was delicately isolated at the surface of a progressively refrigerating isopentane solution. The cups remained at the surface of the refrigerating isopentane solution until a temperature of &#x02212;30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C was reached. The specimens were subsequently frozen in powdered dry ice for 15 min and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until use. Cryostat sections (14&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) were mounted on slides coated with 2% 3-aminopropyl-triethoxylane in acetone. Sections were fixed by incubation for 30 min in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 2.7&#x000a0;mM KCl, 4.2&#x000a0;mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4,</sub> and 1.47&#x000a0;mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and adjusted pH to 7.4), rinsed briefly in water and dehydrated through a series of ethanol solutions of increasing concentration.

Eyes were rapidly removed and fixed by incubation for at least 36 h in 4% PFA at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. They were then embedded in paraffin and 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m sections were cut with a microtome (HM355; Microm: Walldorf, Germany), mounted on glass slides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Illkirch, France), dried overnight at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and stored at room temperature until use.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from mouse eyes at different postnatal ages (P0, P8, P15, P21, and 2M), from lenses at different stages (P0, P14, P16, and 2M), and from the retina at 2M, using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Next, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g total RNA was reverse-transcribed using an oligodT primer with SuperScript II Rnase H Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a total reaction volume of 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l. For semiquantitative PCR, the number of cycles and annealing temperature were optimized (data not shown). The PCR reactions were systematically optimized by testing serial dilutions of the amount of DNA templates, variable concentrations of the specific PCR primers, variable MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations and variable annealing temperatures to obtain a specific and unique band of the appropriate expected size for each targeted co-amplified cDNA product. Each amplified product was subsequently checked systematically by automated sequencing to verify its molecular identity. We checked systematically all the adequate parameters to be sure that the number of cycles required for obtaining unique co-amplified bands was in the range of values comprised between 20 and 30 PCR cycles. This procedure provided us the guarantee that we were still in the linear phase of the exponential curve of PCR amplification and, thus, that we had not yet reached the plateau phase.

The extent of colocalization of the 2 labels (mPins and Numb) was measured using the &#x0201c;Coloc&#x0201d; module of Imaris 6.1.2, 32-bit version (Bitplane AG, Saint Paul, MN). Each confocal section consists of an array of square elements called pixels. A voxel is defined from a pixel as a prism in which the base is the pixel and the height is the thickness of the confocal section. Imaris colocalization analyzes the confocal stack by measuring the intensity of each label in each voxel. The program uses a determined threshold for each of the two labels (10 on the 0&#x02013;255 scale of pixel intensity). Voxels with intensities above this threshold are considered to be above the background. A voxel is defined as displaying colocalization when the intensities of both labels are above their respective thresholds. The extent of colocalization is expressed in terms of two measures: 1) &#x0201c;Percentage of material colocalized,&#x0201d; taking into account the number of voxels displaying colocalization and the intensities of the two labels in each voxel; &#x0201c;material&#x0201d; takes into account both the number of voxels and their intensities; and 2) &#x0201c;Pearson correlation coefficient&#x0201d; calculated for voxels, giving values of between +1 and &#x02212;1, with positive values indicating a direct correlation, negative values indicating an inverse correlation, and values near 0 indicating no correlation. This measure is more stringent than the &#x0201c;Percentage of material colocalized&#x0201d; because it also requires the intensities of the 2 labels to vary together.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>Total proteins were extracted separately from the lens at P0, P14, P16, and 2M, from the retina and total eye of adult C57Bl/6J mice, using an extraction reagent (TRIzol; Invitrogen-Gibco) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

In vertebrates, neurogenesis is thought to involve the proliferation of progenitor cells by symmetric division, followed by several asymmetric divisions giving rise to different populations of neurons and glia. The generation of daughter cells with different cell fates involves 3 levels of control: 1) regulated programs of gene expression, controlling cell fate; 2) unequally segregated fate determinants, which, in turn, regulate programs of gene expression in only one of the two daughter cells; and 3) cell polarity machinery coordinating the asymmetric localization of fate determinants with respect to the cell division plane. Many genes essential to this process have been identified, including those encoding Bazooka/Par3, Insc, and Pins, which plays an important role in the segregation of cell-fate determinants and rotation of the spindle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. In this study, we investigated mPins mRNA and protein expressions in the developing mouse whole eye and, more specifically, in the retina, in which ACD has been reported in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>] and chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>].</p><p>Late embryonic mouse retina (E11.5 and E18.5) displayed strong <italic>mPins</italic> hybridization signals in all cells of the neuroblastic layer which are on different stages of proliferation as well as differentiation. <italic>mPins</italic> mRNA was absent from the GCL, which is the first layer to differentiate. At these developmental stages, cell divisions may occur in diverse progenitor cells, which are still endowed with high mitotic potentials, and in many progenitor cells already engaged in a cell fate pathway but retaining some mitotic capability. The mouse retina continues to develop after birth. It is therefore not surprising that from P3, the cells of the inner neuroblastic layer continue to display strong mPins immunoreactivity as the retinal progenitors in this layer continue to undergo cell division. These results are consistent with those reported for the developing mouse CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>], in which mouse <italic>Pins</italic> gene expression has been shown to be limited to zones of proliferation and absent from differentiating postmitotic cells. By contrast with embryonic stages, at these early postnatal stages, <italic>mPins</italic> mRNA was detected in the GCL. The pattern observed for mPins protein in immunohistochemistry experiments could be readily reconciled with that observed for the distribution of <italic>mPins</italic> mRNA determined by in situ hybridization. It is noteworthy that mPins mRNA and protein seemed to be stronger in the inner cells of the neuroblastic layer at early postnatal retinal developmental stages.</p><p>Based on this pattern of <italic>mPins</italic> expression in dividing cells and the demonstration that mPins is a functional homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pins that can substitute for Pins function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, our results strongly suggest that mPins may be involved in ACD in the developing mouse retina. The retinal neuroblastic layer undergoes cell division, and ACD has been shown to occur in the retina. These data suggest that mPins may be involved in ACD in the developing retina. Such a role would require mPins to have the same cellular distribution as a marker of ACD, such as Numb. The results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis of colocalization between mPins and Numb in an undifferentiated retina at an early postnatal stage (P3) suggest that this is the case. The percentage of material colocalized and the Pearson correlation coefficient must be considered together to evaluate the extent of colocalization. The &#x0201c;percentage of material colocalized&#x0201d; (40%) obtained for the developing retina indicated strong, widespread colocalization of the 2 proteins. Moreover, the Pearson coefficient (0.73) obtained at P3 showed that the intensities of the proteins studied varied together. Thus, we have shown that <italic>mPins</italic> is widely expressed in the retinal neuroblastic layer and that mPins protein is colocalized with a marker of ACD in these dividing cells. Overall, our results strongly suggest the involvement of mPins in ACD in the developing retina.</p><p>However, previous studies in mice involving the analysis of marked clones in adult retinas have suggested that retinal cells do not follow a stem cell mode of division. Instead, both daughter cells of a progenitor may continue to divide. These studies have even suggested that cell type determination in the rodent retina is independent of lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. These findings are debatable, because the authors used only clone size as the crucial parameter for interpretation of their results. However, it has long been known that at least 2 types of neurons and M&#x000fc;ller glia in postnatal rodent retina may arise from a common progenitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, it seems likely that mPins is involved in ACD in the retina, because ACD has been reported in the retina in both rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>] and chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. In addition, Insc, which acts together with Pins in ACD, has been shown to regulate spindle orientation and cell fate in the developing retina&#x02014;2 major mechanisms involved in ACD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>].</p><p>So, how does mPins regulate ACD in the retina? The orientation of cell division is important for invertebrate development, but it has been suggested that vertebrates develop in a different manner entirely dependent on cell migration and diffusible morphogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated correlations between spindle orientation and the fate of the resulting daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. In the developing mouse brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>] and in rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>], progenitor divisions along the vertical axis are more likely to generate 2 different daughter cells, whereas parallel divisions are usually symmetric. Mammalian Insc regulates the orientation of neural progenitor divisions, playing an important role in specifying cell fate in the retina and determining whether divisions are symmetric or asymmetric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Insc may act by recruiting the Pins homolog, LGN, to the apical cell cortex, as described in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In addition, LGN may activate G proteins regulating the attachment of astral microtubules to the cell cortex in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. These mechanisms would result in polarized G protein activation. Moreover, LGN binds the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein NuMA, which is a large coiled-coil, and microtubule-binding protein, which organizes the orientation of the spindle poles. NuMA/LGN interaction is required for the binding of LGN to the &#x003b1; subunits of G-protein (G&#x003b1;) in the cell cortex. Thus, the NuMA/LGN/G&#x003b1; complex regulates the interaction of aster microtubules with the cell cortex, causing chromosome segregation during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, many of the proteins involved in ACD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have orthologs in mammals, and the asymmetric distribution of these compounds is conserved in various mammalian tissues. For example, mammalian Numb is asymmetrically distributed at the apical pole of dividing neuroepithelial cells in the developing mouse cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>], in the rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>], and in zebrafish retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. Based on our results demonstrating the colocalization of mPins and Numb and the relative conservation of interactions between proteins involved in ACD from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to vertebrates, there is growing evidence that mPins may regulate ACD by the described mechanisms.</p><p>One of the major findings of this study is the demonstration that <italic>mPins</italic> is expressed in the postnatal terminally differentiating retinal neurons. The cell bodies of the ganglion cell layer are immunolabeled for mPins from P3. Moreover, at later postnatal stages, <italic>mPins</italic> mRNA and protein are detected in all layers of the retina other than the plexiform layers. No significant amount of <italic>mPins</italic> mRNA was detected in the plexiform layers, whereas these layers did contain the mPins protein. The mPins protein may therefore be produced in neuronal cell bodies and translocated into neuronal processes and terminals. The same pattern of <italic>mPins</italic> expression was observed in the adult retina. Weak immunolabeling in the outer plexiform layer and strong labeling in the photoreceptor inner segments were also observed. If the major role of mPins is related to the orientation of the mitotic spindle during retinal development, what role does this protein play in the quiescent nondividing neuronal cells of the retina? Like many molecules, Pins seems to perform different functions in the retina during development and in adulthood. There are two possible explanations for these different roles: 1) Pins may be a multifunctional protein; or 2) Pins may interact with different partners during these two different phases of mammalian life. Previous studies reported a crucial role of Pins in differentiated neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. In mammals, Pins and G&#x003b1;i, form a protein complex with SAP102 and NMDAR in hippocampal neurons. The formation of this complex has been shown to be essential for NMDAR translocation to the plasma membrane and its incorporation into the postsynaptic membrane of dendritic spines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, both rods and cones use the excitatory amino acid glutamate to transmit signals to the second-order neurons (retinal bipolar neurons) in the chain. Retinal ganglion cells and some amacrine cell types express functional NMDA receptors in addition to non NMDA receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. We suggest that mPins may regulate vesicle trafficking in retinal neurons, as described in hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. However, further experiments are required to confirm this hypothesis. How can we reconcile the roles of mPins in processes as diverse as spindle orientation and vesicle trafficking? During spindle orientation, Pins may mediate microtubule attachment to the plasma membrane by interacting with microtubule-associated protein (NuMA) and G&#x003b1;i. Pins may also act in a similar manner in vesicle trafficking, mediating the attachment of NMDAR-containing vesicles to microtubule motors, thereby facilitating their transport to the plasma membrane. mPins protein was detected on both sides of the inner nuclear layer, in areas potentially corresponding to the horizontal and amacrine cells. However, double labeling with specific markers of amacrine or horizontal cells is required to confirm this hypothesis. These cells are involved in the transmission of electrical messages in visual signals. Indeed, the horizontal cells establish direct connections with the photoreceptor, whereas the amacrine cells are responsible for lateral modulation of the vertical transmission channel of the signal, establishing synapses with and between bipolar cells. In retinal horizontal and bipolar cells, neuronal signaling and membrane excitability are mediated principally by G-protein-coupled Kir3 (GIRK) channels. Various subunits of Kir channels have been characterized in rat retinal ganglion cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>]. GIRK (G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium) channels are G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; effectors activated by inhibitory transmitters to dampen excitatory synaptic transmission and reduce the excitability of central neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>]. In mammals, LGN has been shown to play an essential role in maintaining basal GIRK channel activity and harnessing neuronal excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>]. In light of these roles in neurons, the strong expression of mPins in the adult mouse neural retina and the many possible roles of the mPins protein in cellular trafficking and neuronal excitability within the retina appear much less surprising.</p><p>The mPins mRNA and protein are observed in the RPE during early postnatal development, but also in adult RPE. The RPE constitutes the outer hemato-ocular barrier, and the cells constituting the RPE cell layer are strongly linked by tight junctions. In mammalian epithelia, PAR-3 localizes to tight junctions at the apical/lateral boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>], and is involved in the assembly of these junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>]. Human Insc establishes an interaction between LGN and PAR-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>]. It would be interesting to assess the involvement of mPins in epithelial tight junction formation and the maintenance of the structure of these junctions during adulthood, in the RPE, and in the ciliary and corneal endothelium, by appropriate experiments.</p><p>The corneal epithelial cells&#x02014;particularly the basal epithelial cells&#x02014;express large amounts of mPins mRNA and protein. It is currently widely thought that the renewal of this epithelium requires the production of new cells through mitotic activity in the limbal basal cell layer, these cells then displacing the existing cells both superficially and centripetally. Francois Majo (H&#x000f4;pital ophtalmique universitaire Jules-Gonin, Lausanne, Switzerland; unpublished data, personal communication) has proposed a model in which corneal epithelial cell generation favors horizontal symmetric cell divisions, ensuring the self-renewal of basal corneal epithelial progenitor cells, and asymmetric vertical cell divisions, generating both basal corneal epithelial cells and differentiating suprabasal cells moving toward the inner part of the tear film at the surface of the cornea. This model is consistent with results obtained for the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r61">61</xref>]. The same mechanism of spindle reorientation may therefore lead to the specification of different cell types in the developing retina, and stratification in the epidermis and cornea. Based on these data, we suggest that mPins may also be involved in corneal cell division.</p><p>One of the major findings of our study is the different patterns of mPins mRNA and protein distribution in the lens during development and in adulthood, with protein levels in the lens increasing during postnatal development. At the E14.5 stage, mPins protein is produced in the anterior region of the lens corresponding to the lens anterior epithelial cells. However, no significant mRNA hybridization signal was detected in this region of the lens at this stage. The level of <italic>mPins</italic> mRNA may have been just below the detection threshold of the method used, such that hybridization signals were not considered significant. This experimental artifact may account for the lack of detection of <italic>mPins</italic> mRNA in the lens at this stage. Interestingly, the mPins mRNA and protein are significantly detected, at late stages, not in the anterior, but in the posterior part of lens, corresponding to the formation of differentiated secondary fibers. From P9, mPins mRNA and protein were detected unambiguously in the anterior epithelial cells, the proliferating cells of the germinative zone, cells of the transitional zone and differentiated lens fibers at postnatal stages. By contrast, at the earliest stages of postnatal lens development (P3 and P5), the immunostaining observed in the lens was diffuse and appeared less significant. However, by RT&#x02013;PCR we detected significant amounts of mPins in the lens from P0. During embryonic development, the germinative zone is already formed and the lens undergoes rapid growth. These findings raise two questions: 1) How can we interpret the finding that mPins expression becomes detectable in the mitotic germinative zone only during later postnatal stages? and 2) How can we explain the changes in mPins protein profile during development? It has been shown that Dlg protein may be required for the maintenance of cell cycle control in the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the interaction between the proteins Pins and Dlg has been shown to regulate cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, the pattern of Dlg expression in the lens reported by Nguyen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>] is similar to the pattern of mPins expression reported here. Yeast two-hybrid screening with LGN/mPins had identified Dlg as an interacting protein (Blumer J. B. Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, unpublished data). Interactions between mPins and Dlg may be involved in cell division and proliferation in the mouse lens. Given the role of mPins in cell proliferation processes, it is surprising that mPins is detected in the germinative zone only after birth. Moreover, mPins levels in the lens increase during postnatal development. We can therefore speculate that this increase in mPins levels during postnatal development is correlated with lens growth until the lens reaches its adult size. The spatial distribution and time course of mPins expression in the lens reported here suggest that mPins protein expression is strongly controlled, and that mPins functions are thus important throughout lens development. However, the roles of this protein remain unclear, and further experiments are required to determine these roles.</p><p>In conclusion, we have determined the pattern of <italic>mPins</italic> gene expression and mPins protein distribution in mouse eye from embryonic to adulthood. Our results suggest that mPins may be involved not only in proliferation, but also in differentiation and the maintenance of differentiation in mouse eye. These findings highlight the importance of further exploration of the role of mPins and of the major sets of polarity genes during eye development, normal ocular functioning in adulthood and eye aging.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Xiaohang Yang (Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore) for providing us anti-mPins antibody and Weimin Zhong (Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT) for providing us anti-Numb antibody.
