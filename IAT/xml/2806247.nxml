No pathological alterations, however, were observed in liver, kidney or heart. Thus we considered the hematopoietic system and found that seven days after poly injection, the number of blood cells in peripheral blood decreased drastically. Investigation of bone marrow cells showed that these became apoptotic within seven days after poly injection. Committed myeloid progenitor cells and cells with long term reconstituting potential were lost from bone marrow within four days after poly injection. Furthermore, infusion of normal bone marrow cells rescued mice from death induced by loss of THOC5/Fms interacting protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>THOC5/Fms interacting protein is an essential element in the maintenance of hematopoiesis.

The mature mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation. Nuclear export of mRNA composes one part of a larger network of molecular events that begin with transcription of the mRNA in the nucleus and end with its translation and degradation in the cytoplasm. The TREX (transcription/export) complex is conserved in evolution from yeast to man and is required for coupled transcription elongation and nuclear export of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The TREX complex in mammals and <italic>Drosophila </italic>is composed of the THO (suppressors of the transcriptional defects of hpr1delta by overexpression) subcomplex (THO-complex 1 (THOC1) 1, THOC2, THOC5, THOC6 and THOC7), THOC3, UAP56 and Aly/THOC4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the THO complex components are not essential for bulk poly (A) + RNA export in higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the nuclear export of only a subset of mRNAs is affected by depletion of a member of the THO complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These data suggest that various nuclear mRNA export pathways, which may be indicated by different adaptor RNA binding proteins, exist in higher eukaryotes. Recent data show that Aly and THOC5 function in the tip associating protein (TAP)-p15 mediated nuclear export of Hsp70 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It was demonstrated that the depletion of THOC5 does not affect bulk poly (A)+ RNA export, but does affect Hsp70 mRNA export in Hela cells. Interestingly, the deletion of THOC1, a major conserved component of THO complex, causes apoptosis in transformed cells, but not in normal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the embryonic development of the conventional THOC1 knockout mice is arrested around the time of implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], suggesting that the THO complex may play an essential role in early development.</p><p>Fms interacting protein (FMIP) was originally identified as a substrate for the Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF) receptor tyrosine kinase, Fms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. FMIP has been demonstrated to be a member of THO complex, THOC5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We have previously shown that depletion of THOC5/FMIP by siRNA or ectopic expression causes abnormal hematopoiesis and abnormal adipocyte differentiation in myeloid progenitor or mesenchymal progenitor cell lines, indicating that the THO-complex is essential for the differentiation process in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In this study we show that THOC5/FMIP is essential at an early stage of murine development. Furthermore, using interferon inducible THOC5/FMIP knockout mice we demonstrated that this gene is essential for survival. In these mice, bone marrow and spleen cells became apoptotic, hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers collapsed and the animals became anemic. Although the THOC5/FMIP gene was deleted in liver, kidney, and heart, pathological alterations to these organs were not observed. Furthermore, 9 out of 14 THOC5/FMIP depleted mice survived over two months by normal bone marrow cell transplantation with no apparent symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>THOC5/FMIP is essential at an early stage of mouse development</title><p>To examine the role of THOC5/FMIP <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first generated a floxed THOC5/FMIP allele (THOC5/FMIP flox) by recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Given that the THOC5/FMIP gene spans 20 exons in a 33,523 kb region on chromosome 11, we adopted a targeting strategy where, by flanking exons IV and V with loxP sites, we could inactivate THOC5/FMIP in a conditional manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The deletion of exons IV/V of THOC5/FMIP causes a frame shift of product and the truncated protein is expected to be only 83 amino acids long and lacking the THOC1 binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. ES cells were used to establish a THOC5/FMIP flox strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Homozygous THOC5/FMIP (flox/flox) mice were fertile and did not display any phenotypic or histological abnormalities, showing that the two loxP sites in the THOC5/FMIP flox locus did not affect its function. First, we bred THOC5/FMIP <italic>floxed </italic>mice to EIIa-Cre mice in which Cre is ubiquitously expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. After generation of heterozygote mice (F1), we bred F1 mice and generated F2 mice. We did not detect any THOC5/FMIP-/- newborn mice from F2 mice. In addition, the genotype of 59 embryos collected between E5.5 and E8.5 was determined by the exon IV/V specific PCR analysis of genomic DNA. Of 59 embryos which we examined, none was THOC5/FMIP-/- indicating that loss of THOC5/FMIP causes embryonic lethality before E5.5. Among 59 embryos, 18 were THOC5/FMIP +/+ and 41 were +/- which was the expected Mendelian ratio (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001 by Chi squared test).

Bone marrow cells from five to six-week-old mice were flushed from femora zero, four or seven days after the first 250 &#x003bc;g poly (I:C) injection (n = 9). Cytospin preparations were stained by May Grunwald solution and hematoxylin. Although after four days we did not detect any difference in morphology of bone marrow cells, after seven days it became apparent that few hematoxylin-stained cells were present in samples from Mx-cre THOC5/FMIP(flox/flox) mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). A high proportion of those cells that were present showed dense chromatin staining, reminiscent of apoptotic cells. To examine whether the cells that survived were apoptotic more than 2,000 4', 6-Diamidino-2-phenyindole (DAPI) positive bone marrow cells were co-stained with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and DAPI for each preparation. Two and four percent respectively of DAPI positive bone marrow cells in control THOC5/FMIP(flox/flox) mice are stained with TUNEL in the presence or in the absence of poly (I:C) treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In Mx-cre THOC5/FMIP(flox/flox) mice, 15% of bone marrow cells are stained without poly(I:C) injection, possibly as a result of the natural presence of interferons. After three poly (I:C) injections, only a few DAPI positive cells are left and all remaining cells were stained with TUNEL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), suggesting that deletion of THOC5/FMIP causes bone marrow cell apoptosis. Furthermore, no significant increase of TUNEL positive cells (10-20%) was observed, suggesting that apoptotic cells may fail to stay in bone marrow or be phagocytosed. DNA laddering, indicative of apoptosis, in bone marrow cells and hepatocytes was also examined.

Since we could obtained more consistent data from mice treated with 2 &#x000d7; 500 &#x003bc;g than mice treated with 2 &#x000d7; 250 &#x003bc;g at this time point, we injected five to six-week-old Mx-cre THOC5/FMIP (flox/flox) (n = 5) and THOC5/FMIP (flox/flox) (n = 6) mice with (2 &#x000d7; 500 &#x003bc;g (poly I:C) at a two-day interval) in this experiment.</p><p>First we determined femoral cellularity which was found to be depressed in Mx-cre THOC5/FMIP (flox/flox) mice treated with poly (I:C) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The same samples were then taken for assessment of primitive hematopoietic cell numbers. We determined the total number of cells which were not expressing lineage markers for mature hematopoietic cells, a measure of progenitor cells present in the marrow. The Lin- cells were depleted to a greater extent in THOC5/FMIP depleted animals than in control animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). We therefore assessed multipotent colony forming cell numbers in soft gel assays. We could detect no GEMM-CFU (granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, macrophage-colony forming unit) (which includes early erythroid progenitors, see below) in THOC5/FMIP depleted murine femora whilst they were present in both control populations assayed. Similarly, granulocyte macrophage colony forming cells (GM-CFU) were undetectable in THOC5/FMIP depleted bone marrow but were present in control femora (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). The effect of poly (I:C) injection in Mx-cre THOC5/FMIP(flox/flox) mice on primitive multipotent colony forming cells, GEMM-CFU, and GM-CFU is therefore a profound reduction. Furthermore, an analysis of the Lineage marker depleted, Sca<sup>+</sup>, Kit<sup>+ </sup>(LSK) cell numbers present in the bone marrow revealed that the proportion of LSK cells (which co-enrich with primitive hematopoietic cells and include long term reconstituting cells) was not substantially changed when Mx-cre THOC5/FMIP(flox/flox) mice were treated with poly (I:C). However the total number of these cells per femur was decreased by 80% per femur. This argues for primitive hematopoietic cells as well as lineage specific progenitor cells being depleted as a consequence of THOC5/FMIP knockout.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Deletion of THOC5/FMIP causes loss of primitive hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow</bold>.

It may be explained that THOC5/FMIP depletion displays a phenotype first in this fast turnover tissue that is very dependent on stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Hematopoietic cells especially white cells such as neutrophils turn over rapidly, and it is in keeping with observations on the sensitivity of hematopoiesis insult such as irradiation or cytotoxic drugs that the first major signs of THOC5/FMIP removal are observed in bone marrow derived cells. The question rose as to whether other organs, such as liver, kidney and heart would have shown pathological alterations if the mice had survived for longer periods. Therefore, we examined next whether a transfer of normal bone marrow cells rescues THOC5/FMIP depleted mice. We transferred 10<sup>6 </sup>bone marrow cells derived from THOC5/FMIP(flox/flox) mice into nonablated Mx-cre THOC5/FMIP(flox/flox) mice via i.v. and a day after transplantation we injected recipient mice with poly (I:C), followed by two additional injections. Nine out of 14 mice survived longer than two months and no symptoms were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Furthermore, the exon IV/V of THOC5/FMIP gene was deleted completely from liver genomic DNA of survivors (data not shown), indicating that cre-recombinase was expressed by poly (I:C) injection in liver. Although THOC5/FMIP expression was drastically down-regulated in the livers of survivors, histological abnormalities were not observed in liver, kidney and heart. Cytospin preparations revealed that only few hematoxylin-stained cells were present in samples from four bone-marrow-recipient mice which died (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>, Non-survivor), while normal populations of hematoxylin-stained cells with few apoptotic cells were present in samples from survivors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>, Survivor). The phenotype of the non-survivors is identical (leukocytopenia, anemia, bleeding, the reduced size spleen, and so on.) to that of non-recipient mice, suggesting that bone marrow transplantation did not work in these mice. It may be related to the fact that the bone marrow cell transplantation was performed into nonablated mice. In some case, there may be no <italic>open space </italic>for donor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

Furthermore, the binding of THOC7 to THOC5/FMIP requires the nuclear localization of THOC7. These facts raise the question as to whether loss of THOC5/FMIP molecule influences stability of another member of the complex. Since THOC5/FMIP expression was drastically down-regulated in the livers, we analyzed the expression of the members of the THO complex in liver tissue before and after poly (I:C) injection. Fourteen days after poly (I:C) injection, there was more than an 80% decrease of THOC5/FMIP observed at the protein level. Although Aly, and THOC6 were unchanged, the amount of THOC1 went down to 30% within 14 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>). A reduced level of THOC1 was also observed in THOC5/FMIP depleted bone marrow cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). Furthermore, a broad band with molecular mass of 60 kDa was detected from poly (I:C) treated liver and bone marrow cell extract by THOC1 specific immunoblot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>), suggesting that THOC1 protein may not be stable in the absence of THOC5/FMIP. To examine whether THOC1 decreases at the mRNA level, we performed RT-PCR in these organs. Using THOC5/FMIP specific primers 643 bp product was obtained from untreated liver mRNA, while a 431 bp product was obtained from poly (I:C) treated liver mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>). The difference in size corresponds to the exon IV/V deletion in treated animals. The mRNA levels of THOC1 and Aly were unchanged by treatment with poly (I:C). To confirm these data without poly (I:C) effect, we utilized mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) isolated from THOC5/FMIP (flox/flox) mice. After infection with adenovirus carrying GFP and cre-recombinase, THOC5/FMIP was drastically reduced within four days. In agreement with data obtained from liver tissue, the level of THOC1 protein was also drastically reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D</xref>). As control we infected adenovirus carrying GFP alone. We did not observe a reduction of THOC5/FMIP or THOC1 in control virus infected MEF. These data suggest that depletion of THOC5/FMIP causes down regulation of THOC1 also in cell culture system.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Depletion of THOC5/FMIP causes down-regulation of THOC1</bold>.

Furthermore, although THO complex does not play a role in nuclear export of bulk mRNA, THOC1 deletion causes embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This led us to investigate the potential roles for THOC5/FMIP <italic>in vivo</italic>. To do this we first generated conventional knockout mice, deleting THOC5/FMIP. These mice died at an early embryonic stage. Furthermore, although heterozygotic THOC5/FMIP deletion mutant mice were fertile and did not display any phenotypic or histological abnormalities after birth, 50% of THOC5/FMIP heterozygotes died during embryogenesis (El Bounkari and Tamura, unpublished data), suggesting that the level of expression of THOC5/FMIP plays a key role in embryo development.</p><p>When an inducible system was developed a key developmental system, hematopoiesis, was found to be sensitive to depletion of THOC5/FMIP. Our data showed that bone marrow cells and spleen cells, but no other organs, such as liver, heart, kidney, intestine, testicle, or lung, became apoptotic in THOC5/FMIP deficient adult mice, suggesting hematopoietic required THOC5/FMIP. In addition, transplantation with bone marrow cells derived from cre minus THOC5/FMIP(flox/flox) mice rescues poly (I:C) injected Mx-cre THOC5/FMIP(flox/flox) mice from death. This extends back to the primitive cells in the hematopoietic system, since THOC5/FMIP depleted mice showed a major decrease in progenitor cells (GEMM-CFU, GM-CFU, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>) and also a fall in the slowly cycling bone marrow LSK cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). The effects of an RNA processing protein on stem cells were also profound and this we argue in part explains the massive effect on the committed progenitor cell compartment compared to LSK cells. Nonetheless, the rapid onset of the effect also argues that the progenitor cell compartment is sensitive to loss of FMIP/THOC5 expression.</p><p>Mx-cre directed depletion by poly I:C injection was observed in bone marrow cells, heart, kidney, liver and spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Indeed, THOC5/FMIP specific PCR analyses using genomic DNA as a template revealed that exons IV/V were deleted from these organs, including spleen after only one &#x000d7; times poly (I:C) injection. We did not observe the depletion of THOC5/FMIP protein in spleen for any time period however, the size of spleen is drastically reduced after seven days poly (I:C) injection, suggesting that apoptotic cells are released from spleen and that the THOC5/FMIP protein half life in certain cells was longer than in other cells.</p><p>The issue remains how and why THOC5/FMIP is required for primitive hematopoietic as well as embryo stem cell survival and/or proliferation. Our data suggest that the THO complex is required for mRNA export of particular genes that play a key role in hematopoietic primitive (multipotent) and committed progenitor cell survival and/or proliferation. Alternatively, the THO complex may be essential for bulk poly (A)+ RNA export in primitive cells. The yeast TREX complex is composed of the THO transcription elongation complex (Hpr1 (the THOC1 orthologue), Tho2 (the THOC2 orthologue), Mht1 and Thp2), Tex1 (the THOC3 orthologue), Sub2 (the UAP56 orthologue) and Yra1 (the Aly/THOC4 orthologue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Yeast TREX mutants show a nuclear export defect for bulk poly A+ RNAs and are synthetically lethal with many mutants of the mRNA machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In Drosophila loss of the THO complex function results in only minor differences in transcription profiles as revealed by the whole genome array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The analysis of the cytoplasmic mRNA from bone marrow cells was not successful, because cytoplasmic mRNA from bone marrow cells was not stable enough for microarray analysis. Therefore, we analyzed the expression level of cytoplasmic mRNA in fibroblasts. In the presence or absence of THOC5/FMIP, we found that less than 100 genes were down-regulated more than three-fold using the mouse whole genome array (Hauser and Tamura, unpublished data). In the fibroblast system, however, the depletion of THOC5/FMIP did not cause apoptosis, but reduced cell growth (Tran and Tamura, unpublished data), suggesting that THOC5/FMIP has a specific function in proliferating cells. It has been shown recently that in response to treatment of mice with interferon-alpha hematopoietic stem cells efficiently exit G<sub>0 </sub>and enter an active cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], suggesting that poly (I:C) treatment may exacerbate the phenotype which is observed in THOC5/FMIP deletion mice. Further studies will be required to examine whether the mice would present the same phenotype if other methods of conditional deletion of THOC5/FMIP in the relevant cell types were used.</p><p>We show here that the THOC5/FMIP binding partner, THOC1 was down-regulated via THOC5/FMIP knockdown. Furthermore, we have shown that the expression of mutant THOC5/FMIP lacking the THOC1 binding site degraded faster than the wild-type and down-regulated the level of endogenous THOC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], suggesting that these two molecules may stabilize each other forming a functional unit. It indicates that the phenotype we observed might be the result of both THOC1 and THOC5/FMIP depletion. It has been shown that over-expression of THOC1 causes apoptosis in several cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The deletion of THOC1 also causes apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the embryonic development of conventional THOC1 knockout mice is arrested around the time of implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].
