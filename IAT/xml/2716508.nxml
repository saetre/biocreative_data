Additional functional experiments with cycloheximide, Brefeldin A, or vincristine were done to analyze the biology of the CK19-release. CK19-EPISPOT was used to detect disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow (BM) of 45 breast cancer patients who were then followed up over a median of 6 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CK19 was expressed and released by colorectal (HT-29, HCT116, Caco-2) and breast (MCF-7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines. The CK19-EPISPOT was more sensitive than the CK19-ELISA. Dual fluorescent EPISPOT with antibodies against different CK19 epitopes showed the release of the full-length CK19, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Functional experiments indicated that CK19 release was an active process and not simply the consequence of cell death. CK19-releasing cells (RCs) were detectable in BM of 44% to 70% of breast cancer patients. This incidence and the number of CK19-RCs were correlated to the presence of overt metastases, and patients with CK19-RCs had a reduced survival as compared with patients without these cells (<italic>P </italic>= 0.025, log-rank test; <italic>P </italic>= 0.0019, hazard ratio, 4.7; multivariate analysis).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Full-length CK19 is released by viable epithelial tumor cells, and CK19-RCs might constitute a biologically active subset of breast cancer cells with high metastatic properties.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytokeratins (CKs) constitute the largest intermediate filament protein subgroup and represent a multigene family with more than 20 different types of polypeptides that are divided into acidic type I (CK9-CK20) and basic type II (CK1-CK8) keratins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Cells of normal epithelium express at least one type I and one type II keratin. CKs form the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells, and their main function is to maintain the epithelial cell integrity. However, other functions include roles in cell signaling, stress responses, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. CKs undergo a complex regulation involving post-translational modifications and interactions with self and with various classes of associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. During apoptosis, epithelial cells are targets of caspase-mediated proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. CK19, one of the three main keratins besides CK8 and CK18 expressed in simple or stratified epithelium and in various carcinomas including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], is cleaved by caspase 3, and the soluble fragments are released and detected in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, the release of intact, nondegraded CK molecules has not yet been demonstrated.</p><p>Bone marrow (BM) is the common homing site for disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in patients with epithelial tumors and the predominant site of overt metastasis in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the survival analysis of large cohorts of breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and further immunophenotyping of DTCs has indicated that only a subset of DTCs might be relevant for metastatic relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, the characterization of the biologic properties of DTCs is of utmost importance. Interestingly, CK19 expression is the most common single marker used for the RT-PCR-based detection of DTCs in the BM of breast cancer patients, and the detection of DTCs expressing this particular cytokeratin is correlated to an unfavorable prognosis because of metastatic relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It can therefore be speculated that CK19 not only is a marker for epithelial tumor cells but also may have some biologically relevant functions in early metastatic spread. In view of the recent hypothesis on the role of cancer stem cells in metastatic spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], it also is interesting that CK19 has been suggested as a potential breast stem/progenitor cell marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus, it can be speculated that CK19-positive tumor cells might be an important subset of breast cancer cells.</p><p>The present investigation is an extension of our initial work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], including now as novel findings (a) the proof that full-length CK19 is released by cancer cells, (b) detailed clinical data on the cancer patients, and (c) most important, clinical follow-up information including multivariate analysis. Our data suggest that the presence of CK19-releasing tumor cells in BM of breast cancer patients is linked to metastatic progression. This discovery may contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneous biologic potential of DTCs in breast cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>Colorectal (HT-29-ATCC: HTB-38; CaCo-2-ATCC: HTB-37; HCT116-ATCC: CCL-247) and mammary (MCF-7-ATCC: HTB-22; SKBR3-ATCC: HTB-30; MDA-MB-231-ATCC: TB-26) adenocarcinoma cell lines were used for the optimization of the CK19-EPISPOT.

The antibodies used in both immunometric assays were not able to distinguish the soluble fragment CYFRA 21-1 and the full length of CK19. In parallel, we assessed the intracellular expression of CK19 protein with flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry (ICC), and Western blot experiments. CK19 expression and release were detected in colon and breast cancer cell lines but not in the head and neck squamous and thyroid cancer cell lines analyzed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The lack of CK19 expression in the two head and neck cancer cell lines is of interest, given the reported impact of CYFRA 21-1 measurements in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Thus, for the coating step, the same anti-CK19 antibody Ks19.1 that recognizes an epitope on the CYFRA 21-1 fragment of the CK19 (amino acids 311 to 335) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) was used.

Control experiments were performed to demonstrate that this release was an active process and not simply the consequence of apoptosis. In addition, our clinical follow-up results &#x02013; although still preliminary &#x02013; suggest that viable tumor cells secreting CK19 may contribute to metastatic progression.</p><p>By using the EPISPOT on different breast and colon cancer cell lines with monoclonal antibodies targeting different epitopes of CK19, we showed that a significant fraction of these cells release the intact full-length CK19. As immunospots are the protein fingerprints left only by the viable RCs, a cell culture is needed to accumulate a sufficient amount of the released marker proteins. Thus, dying cells that do not secrete adequate amounts of protein are not detected, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The full-length nature of the released CK19 protein was confirmed by proteomic experiments on MCF-7 breast cancer cell supernatants: (a) we did not detect a specific tryptic fragment peptide, which should have been detected if the CYFRA 21-1 were present in the culture supernatant; and (b) we found a specific hydrophobic peptide (amino acids 227 to 247), which can emerge only from the intact insoluble CK19 protein.</p><p>By using different combinations of dual-fluorescent EPISPOT, immunocytochemical analyses and cycloheximide, Brefeldin A or vincristine cell-incubation, we obtained the first evidence that the release of the intact full-length CK19 protein might be an active process, probably mediated by vacuoles or vesicles but using another protein-transport pathway than that between the classic endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The precise mechanism, however, remains to be elucidated. Keratin-like antigens can be released during cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and ultrastructural studies indicated an association of keratin proteins with secretory granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and mucin droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the CK19 molecule lacks a secretory leader and hydrophobic membrane-translocation sequence. Moreover, it has no precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and it has never been located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. A possible mechanism might be blebbing of proteins of the cytoplasm surrounded by plasma membrane (like viral budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) or the release through exosomes known to contain cytoskeletal proteins and to be involved in metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In a first attempt to unravel whether the release of CK19 has a biologic function in tumor progression, we applied the CK19-EPISPOT to detect with a high sensitivity viable cells releasing CK19 in the BM of breast cancer patients. The consistent negative findings in samples from patients without carcinoma supported the assumption that CK19-RCs appear to be DTCs. CK19-RCs were frequently found in the BM of breast cancer patients, and the number of CK19-RCs was correlated with the disease stage. This observation is consistent with the fact that BM is the most prominent distant site for metastatic progression in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Most important, our clinical follow-up data suggest, for the first time, that the release of CK19 seems to be important for the occurrence (M<sub>0 </sub>patients) or progression (M<sub>1 </sub>patients) of metastasis in breast cancer patients. Although the biologic role of CK19 release remains to be elucidated, it might be noteworthy that another cytokeratin (keratin 17) was recently implicated in epithelial cell growth regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Moreover, Ding <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] showed that overexpression of CK19 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells is related to metastatic behavior.</p><p>The assumption that not all DTCs are relevant to metastatic progression was emphasized by the present observation that, in contrast to CK19-RCs, DTCs releasing MUC1 had no prognostic impact. However, the number of patients analyzed in our study is far too small to exclude that MUC1-expressing cells might have clinical relevance in certain subsets of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, our results indicate that DTCs with different phenotypes appear to have a heterogeneous potential to contribute to metastatic relapse, which is consistent with previous reports on the expression of the HER2 oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and the urokinase-type plasminogen-activator receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] on DTCs.</p><p>Although we cannot exclude the possibility that CK19 release is only a marker for the detection of DTCs, we propose that DTCs with the CK19<sup>+</sup>/MUC1<sup>- </sup>phenotype might have a particular biologic potential. This assumption also is supported by the findings of Gudjonsson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], who reported that CK19<sup>+</sup>/MUC1<sup>- </sup>cells in the human breast may have stem cell-like properties.
