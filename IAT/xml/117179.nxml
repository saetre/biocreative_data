They have a wide variety of responsive genes to which they bind as mono-, homo- and heterodimers through response elements. NRs are composed of five to six independent domains that encode specific functions, including transcriptional activation and repression, DNA and ligand binding, cellular compartmentation and dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c1">1</xref>). NRs can activate transcription through two independent activation functions located in the N-terminal AB domains (AF-1) and the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD, AF-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c3">3</xref>). Binding of the ligand induces a major conformational change in the LBD, which modulates coregulator binding to NRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c5">5</xref>). Direct transcriptional repression by some NRs is mediated by co-repressor complexes that are associated with the unliganded receptor and condense the chromatin environment of the promoter through histone deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c6">6</xref>). Upon ligand binding, co-repressors dissociate from the NR, and co-activators are recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c6">6</xref>). Co-activators recognize the holo-LBD via conserved LxxLL motifs and in some cases the N-terminal activation function AF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c7">7</xref>). We have previously shown that the yeast yADA3 protein can act as a NR co-activator in yeast and transfected mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c8">8</xref>). ADA3 belongs to a group of proteins that were first characterized in yeast, and later identified in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c14">14</xref>). ADA proteins have been found to be required for transcriptional activation by a number of yeast activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c17">17</xref> and references therein). In yeast, several ADA protein complexes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c21">21</xref>). ADA3 is found <italic>in vivo</italic> within multisubunit complexes of different size (0.2, 0.9 and 1.9 MD) and complexity that contain at least three to four additional proteins: ADA1, ADA2, ADA5 and GCN5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c21">21</xref>). In higher order complexes, different TAFs and Spt proteins were also found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c22">22</xref>). In mammalian cells, the majority of ADA3 protein also seems complexed with Spt and TAF or TAF-like factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c11">11</xref>), making up the P&#x0002f;CAF, GCN5, STAGA and TBP-free-TAF-containing complexes (TFTCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c14">14</xref>). These complexes are thought to be functional homologs of the yeast ADA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c14">14</xref>). Although at present not convincingly demonstrated, these complexes probably are recruited by different transcriptional activators, and have stimulatory activity on transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c26">26</xref>). Interestingly, these complexes contain besides ADA2 and ADA3 additional subunits that have previously been implicated in NR signaling. TAF<sub>II</sub>30 is present in P&#x0002f;CAF, GCN5, STAGA and TFTC complexes, and has been shown to act on estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#x003b1;) function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c27">27</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that ER&#x003b1; transactivation is impaired in yeast when yADA3 is deleted, and yADA2 and yGCN5 are required in addition to yADA3 for estrogen and retinoid X receptor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c8">8</xref>). GCN5 and the related protein P&#x0002f;CAF are also found in all four previously described mammalian complexes, and were reported to interact either directly or indirectly with NRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c30">30</xref>). Moreover, TAF<sub>II</sub>135 and TAF<sub>II</sub>55, both present in the TFTC, have been reported to have effects on NR transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c32">32</xref>). Finally, it was possible to demonstrate that the major glucocorticoid receptor transactivation domain &#x003c4;-1 can function by recruiting the STAGA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c26">26</xref>). Intriguingly, ADA2 is involved in connecting both molecular entities, but does not seem to be the only factor capable of binding to and recruiting STAGA to the glucocorticoid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c26">26</xref>).</p><p>Here we present the cloning of the mouse homolog of ADA3. Surprisingly, although structurally related to yeast ADA3 and coding for two NR boxes, mADA3 unlike yADA3 does not bind NRs directly. We present evidence, that instead, mADA3 can be recruited to human estrogen receptor alpha (hER&#x003b1;) as part of the TFTC, and is found in intact cells to be associated with hER&#x003b1;. These results support our initial observation that NRs might function by recruiting ADA3 complexes to activate transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning of mADA3</title><p>The 301 nt long mouse EST sequence we identified as being homologous to the C-terminus of yADA3 has GenBank accession no.

We identified a 301 nt mouse EST clone (GenBank accession no. AA289046) bearing homologies to the C-terminal domain of yADA3. Oligonucleotides were designed and used to specifically amplify a nested fragment of the EST sequence by RT&#x02013;PCR from 9 to 12.5 days post-coitum mouse embryo poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNAs. The purified fragment was radioactively labeled in a random primed reaction and used to screen a &#x003bb;ZAPII random primed cDNA library made from mouse heart tissue. Positive clones encompassing an entire open reading frame of 1296 nt with an in-frame termination codon just upstream of the initiating ATG were identified and fully sequenced (the sequence has been submitted to GenBank, accession no. AF383154). The sequence-predicted protein is 432 amino acids in length and shows 23&#x00025; overall identity (47&#x00025; similarity) with yeast ADA3, 35&#x00025; identity (61&#x00025; similarity) with its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart and 99&#x00025; identity with the recently cloned human ADA3-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c12">12</xref>). As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f1">1</xref>A, the putative mouse ADA3 harbors a much shorter N-terminus than yADA3, and the two LxxLL motifs found in the sequence are not located in positions similar to those of yeast ADA3. A northern blot with different mouse tissues reveals the expression pattern of this newly cloned cDNA, which is highest in heart and testis tissues and barely detectable or absent in spleen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f1">1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>The novel cDNA clone encodes the mouse homolog of ADA3</title><p>To ascertain that this novel cDNA indeed encodes a functional homolog of the yeast ADA3 protein, we first unsuccessfully attempted to complement the growth defects of an <italic>ada3</italic> deletion strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c8">8</xref>) with low or high-copy-number plasmid carrying the mouse cDNA clone (data not shown). In this respect, it is noteworthy that human ADA2 and GCN5 cDNAs were also unable to complement the <italic>ada2</italic> and <italic>gcn5</italic> deletion strains for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c9">9</xref>). This reflects a high degree of evolutionary diversification between yeast and mammalian organisms, and has been observed for other transcription factors and adaptors as well.</p><p>Yeast ADA3 is known to be recruited to yeast ADA complexes through interaction with yeast ADA2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c17">17</xref>). Thus, we speculated that this interaction might be conserved between the different species and hence tested the putative mADA3 clone for interaction with yeast and human ADA2 in yeast two-hybrid assays. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f2">2</xref>A, a VP16 fusion of the putative mADA3 interacts strongly with lexA&#x02013;yADA2 and lexA&#x02013;hADA2. This interaction in both cases is stronger than the interaction of yADA3 with both proteins. To corroborate this result, and exclude the presence of a bridging factor in yeast, we tested the interaction of yADA3 and the putative mADA3 with GST-fused hADA2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> translated and <sup>35</sup>S-labeled yADA3 and mADA3 were incubated with glutathione matrix-bound GST&#x02013;hADA2 or, as a control, unfused GST protein alone. An autoradiography of a representative experiment is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f2">2</xref>B. Clearly, the putative mADA3 does interact with the hADA2 as does yADA3, but it does not bind the unfused GST, indicating that interaction is specific. This result, together with the above mentioned yeast two-hybrid assays, and the sequence homology to yeast ADA3 strongly support the notion that the novel cDNA indeed encodes the&#x0002f;a mouse homolog of the yeast ADA3 and is henceforth referred to as mADA3.</p></sec><sec><title>mADA3 does not interact directly with ER&#x003b1; in yeast or <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Since we had shown that yADA3 functions as a bona fide co-activator for retinoid X receptor and especially ER&#x003b1; in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c8">8</xref>), we investigated whether mADA3 would be capable of performing a similar role. When performing yeast two-hybrid interaction studies similar to those shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f2">2</xref>A using lexA fusions of ER&#x003b1; DEF domains, we detected only a marginal interaction between mADA3 and hER&#x003b1;DEF in the presence of estrogen, while yADA3 strongly interacted with liganded hER&#x003b1;DEF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f3">3</xref>A). Similar results were obtained with a lexA fusion of retinoid X receptor (data not shown).</p><p>Furthermore, when similar experiments were performed <italic>in vitro</italic> using GST fusions, we were also unable to detect an interaction between mADA3 and hER&#x003b1;CDEF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f3">3</xref>B, lanes 7 and 8), while a ligand-independent interaction between yADA3 and hER&#x003b1;CDEF was readily detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f3">3</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that, in contrast to yADA3, mADA3 has no ER&#x003b1;-binding capability on its own.</p></sec><sec><title>mADA3-containing complexes interact with ER&#x003b1; in mammalian cells and <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We next investigated whether complexes between ADA3 and ER&#x003b1; might be formed <italic>in vivo</italic>. COS-1 cells were transfected with expression vectors for Flag-tagged yADA3 or mADA3 and hER&#x003b1;, and immunoaffinity co-purification experiments were performed from estrogen-treated or untreated cells. Western blot analysis revealed that hER&#x003b1; efficiently associates with yADA3 in the immunoprecipitated complexes from co-transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f4">4</xref>A, lanes 9 and 10). However, this interaction is not ligand-dependent and therefore differs from that observed in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f3">3</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c8">8</xref>), indicating that the mechanisms by which yADA3 associates with hER&#x003b1; in mammalian and yeast cells are slightly different. Note that in <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f3">3</xref>B), we also observe ligand-independent binding of yADA3 to the ER&#x003b1;CDEF domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f3">3</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4).</p><p>In the case where we transfected an expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged mADA3 instead of yADA3 and performed similar co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we were also able to detect an interaction between mADA3 and hER&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f4">4</xref>B, lanes 6 and 7). This result indicates that similar to yADA3, mADA3 associates with ER&#x003b1; in mammalian cells. From the yeast two-hybrid data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f3">3</xref>A) and the <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction studies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f3">3</xref>B), it is evident that while yADA3 can bind directly to ER&#x003b1; the interaction of mADA3 with the receptor is mediated by a third, yet unidentified factor, present in the mammalian cell. Note that the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction between yADA3 and NRs, albeit direct, might be stabilized by a third protein as well. Since both ADA3 and the related ADA2 have been reported to be present in several high-order complexes in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c12">12</xref>), we speculated that an interaction between such complexes and ER&#x003b1; is responsible for the apparent indirect association between mADA3 and hER&#x003b1;.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we first tested whether the TBP-free TAF-containing complex TFTC &#x0005b;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c14">14</xref>); a gift from Dr Lazlo Tora, highly related to STAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c11">11</xref>) and P&#x0002f;CAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c12">12</xref>) complexes&#x0005d; would be able to associate with hER&#x003b1; <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, we performed GST-based binding experiments similar to those described above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f3">3</xref>B) replacing free mADA3 with purified ADA3-containing TFTC. We opted to analyze TFTC interactions with the GST&#x02013;hER&#x003b1;CDEF in both the presence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f4">4</xref>C, lane 4) and absence (data not shown) of estrogen and in the presence of anti-estrogen 2-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f4">4</xref>C, lane 3). As can be shown by western blotting of bound fractions, several major components of the TFTC can be easily detected to interact in a ligand-insensitive fashion with ER&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f4">4</xref>C, lanes 3 and 4). TFTC is complexed in a similar fashion with ER&#x003b1; also in the absence of any ligand (data not shown). The fact that OHT has no effect on the TFTC interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f4">4</xref>C, lane 3) highlights and confirms the observation that association does not depend on the ligand state of the receptor. In conclusion, these experiments demonstrate that TFTC, and most likely other ADA3-containing complexes related to TFTC, can mediate an interaction between mammalian ADA3 and ER&#x003b1;. Several subunits of TFTC and related complexes have already been shown to interact with estrogen receptors and&#x0002f;or with other NRs: hTAF<sub>II</sub>30, the hallmark subunit of TFTC, interacts directly with the hER&#x003b1; D-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c27">27</xref>). The GCN5-related P&#x0002f;CAF subunit has been shown to functionally interact with retinoid receptors, and is considered a CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c28">28</xref>) and SRC1&#x0002f;TIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c33">33</xref>) co-activator, which itself acts to stimulate the transcriptional activities of a variety of NRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c33">33</xref>). These notions are further corroborated by the fact that GCN5 and P&#x0002f;CAF are the histone-acetyl transferases of the above mentioned ADA protein-containing complexes in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c14">14</xref>). ADA2, which is found tightly associated with ADA3 and GCN5 in yeast, has been shown to interact and stimulate the &#x003c4;-1 activation function of glucocorticoid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c26">26</xref>). Furthermore, we have recently been able to show a direct functional interaction between hADA2 and estrogen receptors (A.Benecke, R.Losson and P.Chambon, manuscript in preparation).</p><p>To put our observation that ADA3 protein-containing complexes are associated with ER&#x003b1; to a final test, we immunopurified endogenous hADA3 protein from MCF7 human breast cancer cells by virtue of a specific polyclonal antibody (&#x003b1;1328, directed against mADA3), and probed the immunoprecipitates for the presence of hER&#x003b1;. Nuclear extracts from cells treated with OHT, with estrogen (E2), and vehicle alone (&#x02013;) were used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f5">5</xref>A). As a control, we also performed immuno-affinity co-purification experiments from the same extracts with an irrelevant monoclonal anti-Gal4 antibody (&#x003b1;Gal4). It is evident from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f5">5</xref>A that endogenous hER&#x003b1; co-purifies with hADA3 from MCF7 extracts. Note that we could not reveal the presence of hADA3 since the specific band co-migrates with the immunoglobulin heavy chains (revealed in the lower panel to confirm similar loading). We also purified endogenous hER&#x003b1; from MCF7 nuclear extracts to investigate whether the above described interactions are also detectable in this direction. Unfortunately, we are unable to detect hADA3 in these immunoprecipitates since the amounts are beyond the detection limit of our antibody. However, as can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f5">5</xref>B (lanes 5 and 6), both the ADA3 partner ADA2 and the core TFTC component TAF<sub>II</sub>30 can be readily co-immunopurified together with the estrogen receptor. This interaction is again insensitive to the ligand the cells were exposed to prior to harvest, confirming our initial observations <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f4">4</xref>C) and in transfected COS cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf335f4">4</xref>A and B). Thus, we have demonstrated that ADA3-containing complexes are associated with ER&#x003b1; both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in intact cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We have previously implicated the yeast ADA3 protein in transcriptional activation by estrogen and retinoid X receptors in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c8">8</xref>). Here we report the cloning of the mouse homolog of ADA3 and its characterization with respect to ER&#x003b1; function. Mouse mADA3 is 23&#x00025; identical and 47&#x00025; similar to yeast yADA3, and mADA3 in contrast to yADA3 does not interact with NRs directly even though it contains two LxxLL NR boxes. However, the ADA3-containing TFTC can interact with ER&#x003b1; in a ligand-independent manner, indicating that other subunits of the complex are sufficient to mediate interaction with NRs. These results further implicate ADA3 proteins as critical NR co-factors and indicate that their transcriptional activity is most likely exerted by high molecular weight complexes of the TFTC&#x0002f;PCAF&#x0002f;STAGA group.</p><p>It will be of utmost interest to demonstrate the function of this interaction between ER&#x003b1; and the mADA3-containing complexes. Our attempts to demonstrate a co-activator role for mADA3 in transient transfection experiments did not show significant effects of an over-expression of mADA3 on hER&#x003b1; function (data not shown). In this respect, it is interesting to note that hADA3 has been shown to stimulate transactivation by the transcription factor p53 in transient transfection experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c36">36</xref>), which demonstrates that hADA3 can act as an independent co-activator. The fundamental molecular difference between p53 transactivation by hADA3 and ER&#x003b1; transactivation by mADA3 is that hADA3 interacts directly with p53 while mADA3 interacts indirectly via other proteins with hER&#x003b1;. Over-expression of mADA3 in the ER&#x003b1; case can only indirectly affect transcription by stabilizing the ADA3-containing complex(es) that interact with ER&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c14">14</xref>). Similarly, ADA3 over-expression could also lead to destabilizing such complexes by titrating components to which it binds directly. We have not observed any significant changes in ER activity in the presence of exogenous mADA3, indicating that neither effect is significant or dominant, and ADA3 is not the sole limiting component in the cell. We suggest that the ADA-complex independent activity of ADA3 on p53 is also at the basis of the co-activator function that yADA3 exerts on ER&#x003b1; since yADA3 in contrast to mADA3 can directly interact with ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf335c8">8</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf335f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> A novel cDNA clone closely related to yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human ADA3.
