In familial forms of CAA single mutations in the A&#x003b2; peptide have been linked to the increase of vascular A&#x003b2; deposits accompanied by a strong localized activation of glial cells and elevated expression of neuroinflammatory mediators including complement proteins. We have developed human amyloid-&#x003b2; precursor protein transgenic mice harboring two CAA A&#x003b2; mutations (Dutch E693Q and Iowa D694N) that mimic the prevalent cerebral microvascular A&#x003b2; deposition observed in those patients, and the Swedish mutations (K670N/M671L) to increase A&#x003b2; production. In these Tg-SwDI mice, we have reported predominant fibrillar A&#x003b2; along microvessels in the thalamic region and diffuse plaques in cortical region. Concurrently, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes have been detected primarily in association with fibrillar cerebral microvascular A&#x003b2; in this model. Here we show that three native complement components in classical and alternative complement pathways, C1q, C3, and C4, are elevated in Tg-SwDI mice in regions rich in fibrillar microvascular A&#x003b2;. Immunohistochemical staining of all three proteins was increased in thalamus, hippocampus, and subiculum, but not frontal cortex. Western blot analysis showed significant increases of all three proteins in the thalamic region (with hippocampus) as well as the cortical region, except C3 that was below detection level in cortex. Also, in the thalamic region (with hippocampus), C1q and C3 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated. These complement proteins appeared to be expressed largely by activated microglial cells associated with the fibrillar microvascular A&#x003b2; deposits. Our findings demonstrate that Tg-SwDI mice exhibit elevated complement protein expression in response to fibrillar vascular A&#x003b2; deposition that is observed in patients with familial CAA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Abnormal accumulation of amyloid &#x003b2; peptides (A&#x003b2;) in brain is one of the major pathological characterizations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A&#x003b2;, a 39&#x02013;42 residue proteolytic product of the amyloid-&#x003b2; peptide precursor (A&#x003b2;PP) by &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-secretase cleavages, possesses a high propensity to self-assemble into &#x003b2; sheet-rich fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. One prominent site of brain A&#x003b2; deposition is in and along the walls of cerebral blood vessels, a condition known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which is frequently found in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In contrast to parenchymal plaques, which can be composed of either diffuse or fibrillar deposits, cerebral vascular A&#x003b2; deposits appear to be exclusively fibrillar in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Several familial forms of CAA result from specific point mutations within the mid-region of the A&#x003b2; domain, which significantly enhance the fibrillogenic and cerebral vascular cytotoxic properties of A&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Previously, we generated transgenic mice that express neuronally derived human A&#x003b2;PP, containing the Dutch-type (E693Q) and Iowa-type (D694N) familial CAA mutations, the Tg-SwDI mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These mice were shown to develop early-onset and robust deposition of cerebral microvascular fibrillar amyloid but only diffuse parenchymal A&#x003b2; plaques. The microvascular accumulation of fibrillar A&#x003b2; is most prominent in the thalamic and subiculum regions of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In these areas with the most fibrillar microvascular A&#x003b2; deposits, activated inflammatory cells, microglia and astrocytes, were also found highly enhanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines were shown to be elevated in Tg-SwDI mouse brains, indicating the active synthesis of inflammatory molecules by these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Another important aspect of the neuroinflammatory response in AD and CAA is the innate immune system activation, among which, complement is a key player [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Complement proteins have been shown to be induced and associated with A&#x003b2; plaques in brains of AD patients and familial CAA patients as well as AD animal models, specifically those plaques containing the fibrillar form of the A&#x003b2; peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The overall outcome of complement activation depends on the balance of its detrimental and beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. On one side, complement activation could induce cell lysis and cause cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; on the other side, complement components such as C1q and C3b can promote the clearance of cellular debris and apoptotic cells and enhance cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although complement proteins are typically secreted by immune cells, in the CNS, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons have been reported being capable of producing complement components upon stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the current study, we investigated the expression of several native complement components in twelve months old Tg-SwDI and wild-type C57BL/6 mice, and found they were increased significantly in association with microvascular amyloid deposits and co-localized with activated microglial cells. The finding that microglial synthesis of the native complement proteins was induced suggests that early complement activation may be increased in the Tg-SwDI mouse model of cerebral microvacular A&#x003b2; deposition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Generation of Tg-SwDI transgenic mice on a pure C57BL/6 background was recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

The deposition of mutant Dutch/Iowa A&#x003b2; peptide starts around 3 months of age and begins to plateau at about 15 months in transgenic mice with low variation between individuals. Homozygous Tg-SwDI and nontransgenic C57BL/6 mice at 12 months of age were used in this study.

Half of each group were homogenized on ice in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 0.5% IGPEL in PBS with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) at 10 ml/g tissue ratio. The protein concentration was determined using the bichinchonic acid method (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of protein (50 &#x003bc;g) were loaded, fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and subsequently electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Hertogen-bosch, Netherlands) in blotting buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 192 mM glycine, and 20% methanol). Blots were washed for 15 min in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), pre-incubated with blocking solution (5% non-fat milk powder in PBST), washed three times with PBST, and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies and peroxidase-labeled secondary goat anti-rat or donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Detection was performed by chemiluminescence according to the description of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim, Almere, Netherlands) and exposed to Kodak (Rochester, NY) X-OMAT-R films and quantified using VersaDoc imaging system (BioRad, Hercules, CA).

However, in the cortex A&#x003b2; deposits were largely in the parenchyma and in diffuse form. In the transgenic mice, activation of microglia and astrocytes was also elevated along with the microvascular fibrillar A&#x003b2; accumulation in the thalamic and hippocampal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Since complement proteins have been reported to be present in reactive inflammatory cells associated with amyloid deposits, we first examined the presence of the three early native complement components in different brain regions of Tg-SwDI and wild-type C57BL/6 mice and their relationship with fibrillar A&#x003b2; deposits in the transgenic mice. Brains from twelve months old mice were harvested and processed as described in Materials and Methods. Immunostaining for C1q revealed very little cellular labeling in either the cortex of transgenic animals (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) or the entire C57BL/6 wild-type mouse brain (data not shown). However, in thalamic region of Tg-SwDI mouse brains (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), C1q was present in many cells associated with the microvascular fibrillar amyloid. Similarly, there were minimal immunoreactivities for either C3 or C4 in the cortical region of Tg-SwDI (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, respectively) or any region of C57BL/6 mice (data not shown), but strong staining in the thalamus of Tg-SwDI mice (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, respectively).

Given that no prominent hemorrhage or compromised blood brain barrier has been observed in Tg-SwDI mice, the elevated expression of cerebral complement components is unlikely from peripheral leakage. To test this hypothesis, we next investigated the messenger RNA productions of these proteins to determine that the increase of complement expression was due to local synthesis. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed for C1q and C3 on mRNAs extracted from micro-dissected brain regions, using TATA box binding protein as the housekeeping gene. The data showed that there was a significant increase (p &#x0003c; 0.02) in the mRNA levels of both C1q and C3 in the thalamic regions of Tg-SwDI over wild-type (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The increase in cortex of C3 mRNA was also statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.02), but not of C1q mRNA (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). To confirm that the increase in mRNA was translated into changes in protein levels, we performed quantitative Western blot analysis for these three complement proteins on homogenates from micro-dissected thalamic and cortical regions. In thalamic region, the results were consistent with both the immunohistochemical and real-time PCR data that protein levels of C1q (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), C3 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), and C4 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) were statistically significantly higher (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in Tg-SwDI mice compared to C57BL/6 mice.

Both microglia and astrocytes, when activated, can produce many complement components. In order to investigate the cell types that were responsible for the induction of complement synthesis in Tg-SwDI mice, brain sections were immunolabeled for both complement proteins and markers of activated microglia or reactive astrocytes. The cells positive for complement proteins morphologically resembled activated microglial cells. When fluorescent images of both stainings were merged, it was clear that while almost no astrocytes were positive for any of the three complement proteins (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), most of the complement-positive cells were strongly labeled with antibody for activated microglia (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

In association with the microvascular fibrillar A&#x003b2; deposits, reactive microglia and astrocytes were found in these animals, and increased with age in parallel to the microvascular A&#x003b2; deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We also detected pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 to be enhanced in Tg-SwDI mice, suggesting that these activated cells are actively expressing inflammatory molecules surrounding the microvasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Previously, it has been shown that complement components are induced in AD patients and familial CAA patients as well as brains of AD animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition to the well-studied pathogen elimination by complement activation, amyloid clearance may be promoted by C1q binding to fibrillar amyloid deposits, and generation of an opsonin, the C3b fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Human studies have also shown increasing complement staining with growing presence of CAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, due to the inefficient binding of mouse C1q to human A&#x003b2;, complement activation is much less in mouse models for AD than in AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which might explain why we did not observe the presence of late-stage complement activation products. In brain, activated microglia are the major source of complement proteins in brain, although reactive astrocytes and neurons have also been shown to express complement when stimulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Here we demonstrate that early native classical complements C1q and C4, as well as C3, an important player in both classical and alternative complement pathways, are up-regulated in Tg-SwDI mouse brains. This induction was likely due to local synthesis since we have detected the increase in messenger RNA and protein levels by real-time PCR technique and Western blot, respectively. The observed differences between mRNA and protein levels of C1q and C3 were possibly due to several reasons. For example, increased levels of certain complement proteins may reflect decreased turnover and/or accumulation with amyloid deposits in the absence of increased expression. Also, the sensitivities of real-time PCR and Western blot are different depending on primers and antibodies, and the message levels may not be translated linearly to protein expression.</p><p>The immunoreactivities of C1q, C3, and C4 were cell associated and appeared to track along cerebral microvascular amyloid deposits, particularly in thalamus and subiculum (data not shown). We then investigated the cell type that expressed the complement. Double immunofluorescent labeling indicated that most complement-positive cells were activated microglia, not astrocytes. Although not all complement-positive cells overlapped with activated microglial labeling, this was possibly due to the multiple activation stages and types of microglia and one activation marker (keratan sulfate in this case [30, 31] may not reflect all activated microglial cells. These findings further support the notion that microglia in the Tg-SwDI mouse model are actively participating in the neuroinflammatory response and provide more insight into the specific reactions of microglia during disease progression as well as modulations of these reactions. In light of our recent work in which we detected improvement of memory performance in animals when microglial activation was suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the effect of that inhibition on complement induction remains to be investigated to further elucidate the function of elevated complement in this model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, complement proteins C1q, C3, and C4 were induced in Tg-SwDI mice in proximity to the cerebral microvasculature. This increase in expression was primarily in thalamus and hippocampus, and also in subiculum by immunohistochemistry (data not shown), regions that contain the highest amount of fibrillar microvascular amyloid deposition. These complement proteins were locally synthesized in brain, and mostly by activated microglial cells associated with microvascular A&#x003b2; deposits.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RF processed the animal tissue, performed immunohistochemistry and Western blot, analyzed the data, and drafted the manuscript.
