Recently, we demonstrated nucleotide excision repair (NER)&#x02013;dependent histone H2A ubiquitination at sites of ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage. In this study, we show a sustained H2A ubiquitination at damaged DNA, which requires dynamic ubiquitination by Ubc13 and RNF8. Depletion of these enzymes causes UV hypersensitivity without affecting NER, which is indicative of a function for Ubc13 and RNF8 in the downstream UV&#x02013;DDR. RNF8 is targeted to damaged DNA through an interaction with the double-strand break (DSB)&#x02013;DDR scaffold protein MDC1, establishing a novel function for MDC1. RNF8 is recruited to sites of UV damage in a cell cycle&#x02013;independent fashion that requires NER-generated, single-stranded repair intermediates and ataxia telangiectasia&#x02013;mutated and Rad3-related protein. Our results reveal a conserved pathway of DNA damage&#x02013;induced H2A ubiquitination for both DSBs and UV lesions, including the recruitment of 53BP1 and Brca1. Although both lesions are processed by independent repair pathways and trigger signaling responses by distinct kinases, they eventually generate the same epigenetic mark, possibly functioning in DNA damage signal amplification.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endogenous and environmental agents continuously damage DNA, compromise its normal functioning, and are associated with accelerated ageing and malignant transformation. DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms, including diverse repair and cell cycle control pathways, protect organisms against the adverse effects of genomic insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoeijmakers, 2001</xref>). DDR-associated chromatin modifications play an important role in regulating both DNA repair and checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Harper, 2008</xref>), as illustrated by the involvement of the ataxia telangiectasia&#x02013;mutated (ATM) kinase in DNA double-strand break (DSB)&#x02013;induced DDR. ATM is the upstream kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of H2AX on serine 193 (&#x003b3;H2AX) in response to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rogakou et al., 1998</xref>). This early damage marker subsequently recruits MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1), which is an important step for the subsequent recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1 at the damaged chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stucki et al., 2005</xref>), thereby mediating the checkpoint signaling toward the effector kinases CHK1 and CHK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Chen, 2008</xref>). Additional ATM recruitment results in enhanced accumulation of DNA repair factors. The collective association of a large number of diverse DDR factors at the damaged chromatin results in microscopically detectable structures referred to as ionizing radiation (IR)&#x02013;induced foci (IRIF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>UV-induced DNA damage results in helix-distorting DNA lesions predominantly consisting of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs). In mammals, these DNA damages are removed by nucleotide excision repair (NER) that eliminates a wide spectrum of helix-distorting lesions in a multistep &#x0201c;cut and patch&#x0201d;&#x02013;type reaction. The damage is excised as a 25&#x02013;30 oligonucleotide DNA fragment followed by gap filling through DNA repair synthesis and restoration of an intact DNA duplex by a final ligation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoeijmakers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gillet and Sch&#x000e4;rer, 2006</xref>). Although the function of the various proteins essential for the core DNA repair process is well understood, its connection with the UV-induced DNA damage signaling is less well characterized. In contrast to DSB repair, NER does not take place in subnuclear structures like IRIF. These IRIF are linked with DNA damage&#x02013;induced large-scale chromatin modifications. Although a variety of chromatin modifications have been associated with NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dinant et al., 2008</xref>), the biological significance of these changes is poorly understood. However, the best-described UV-induced damage signaling, involving RAD17, the 9-1-1 complex, ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), and Chk1, is linked to replication stress rather than to the repair process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niida and Nakanishi, 2006</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giannattasio et al. (2004)</xref> identified a clear NER-dependent signaling pathway in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giannattasio et al., 2004</xref>). One of the currently best-known players in the UV-induced DDR is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ATR, which is activated upon UV-induced replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Falck et al., 2005</xref>). This activation is caused through recruitment of ATR by ATR-interacting protein to replication protein A (RPA)&#x02013;coated single-stranded DNA, which occurs at stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cortez et al., 2001</xref>). It has recently become clear that UV damage also induces ATR activation and &#x003b3;H2AX in a cell cycle&#x02013;independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Driscoll et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanasoge and Ljungman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stiff et al., 2008</xref>), which may trigger similar large-scale chromatin modification as observed after DSB. Similar to the observed NER-dependent Chk1 activation, this activation is also dependent on active NER. During NER, single-stranded DNA repair intermediates are responsible for RPA recruitment, resulting in ATR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanasoge and Ljungman, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we have identified a novel UV-induced, NER-dependent chromatin modification, ubiquitination of H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergink et al., 2006</xref>), although the molecular mechanism and its function in UV&#x02013; remain elusive. These findings were recently confirmed in another study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al. (2009)</xref>. In addition, other core histones are also ubiquitinated upon UV damage like H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robzyk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giannattasio et al., 2005</xref>), H3, and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), although to a much lower extent in absolute number of histone molecules being modified. A similar chromatin mark on H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicassio et al., 2007</xref>) and H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ikura et al., 2007</xref>) was later identified in response to DSB. In contrast to DSB&#x02013;DDR, within UV-induced DDR, the connection between NER, chromatin modifications, and signaling is less well established. Next to the molecular mechanism and function of the observed UV-induced H2A ubiquitination, an appealing question is to which extent this epigenetic DDR is mechanistically conserved between these two types of DNA damage that are repaired by entirely different repair machineries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>UV-induced H2A ubiquitination is a continuous and dynamic process and depends on Ubc13 and RNF8</title><p>H2A ubiquitination can be visualized using antibodies recognizing specifically ubiquitinated H2A on Western blot or immunofluorescence (IF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baarends et al., 2005</xref>) or indirect in living cells studying GFP-ubiquitin (Ub; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dantuma et al., 2006</xref>). Previous experiments in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergink et al., 2006</xref>) have identified a UV-induced H2A ubiquitination as shown by IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>) and Western blot analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902150/DC1">Fig. S1 a</ext-link>). GFP-Ub was found to be accumulated after local UV damage (LUD) infliction at subnuclear regions that were enriched for Ub-H2A and colocalize with the core NER factors XPC (Xeroderma pigmentosum group C) and XPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>) and with the UV damage marker anti-CPD (antibody that specifically recognizes the major UV-induced DNA lesion, CPD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergink et al., 2006</xref>). These experiments indicate that GFP-Ub can be used as a sensitive live cell marker for DNA damage&#x02013;induced H2A ubiquitination. In this study, we analyzed the kinetics of this UV-induced H2A ubiquitination using cells stably expressing GFP-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergink et al., 2006</xref>). GFP-Ub accumulation at LUD slowly increases after irradiation and reaches a maximum after &#x0223c;3 h. Surprisingly, local recruitment of GFP-Ub remains detectable up to at least 24 h after UV when most NER proteins do not accumulate anymore at the site of damage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 f</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoogstraten et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that this histone modification represents a persisting chromatin mark. We tested the binding dynamics of Ub at LUD 3.5 h after irradiation. A swift recovery of GFP-Ub was observed upon photobleaching both at the damaged and nondamaged site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>). To test whether this is caused by exchange of histone H2A at the nucleosome or by a continuous cycle of ubiquitination and deubiquitination of H2A while residing in the nucleosome, we compared the mobility of GFP-tagged H2A with the mobility of GFP-Ub (Fig. S1 b). Although GFP-Ub is fully recovered within 12 min after photobleaching (both within and outside of the LUD), only a minor part of GFP-H2A is recovered within 12 min, suggesting that H2A is constantly ubiquitinated and deubiquitinated within the context of an intact nucleosome. These data indicate that local UV-induced H2A ubiquitination is a dynamic process and further suggest that Ub ligases are constantly targeted to chromatin containing damage to maintain the UV-induced H2A ubiquitination up to 24 h after the initial damage.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>RNF8 and Ubc13 knockdown inhibits the continuous UV-induced H2A ubiquitination.</bold> (a) GPF-Ub&#x02013;expressing HeLa cells (left) or nontransfected HeLa cells were locally UV irradiated (60 J/m<sup>2</sup>) and stained with an antibody-recognizing Ub conjugated to H2A (uH2A). uH2A colocalizes with GFP-Ub (left) and with the damage markers XPC (middle) or XPA (right).

The GFP-Ub accumulation at LUD is visible up to 24 h. (c) The mobility of GFP-Ub in HeLa cells was determined by FRAP. 3.5 h after local UV exposure (60 J/m<sup>2</sup>), GFP-Ub&#x02013;expressing HeLa cells were subject to live cell imaging. A nucleus containing a local Ub accumulation was photobleached inside the indicated white box for three iterations at 100% of laser.

We tested whether these enzymes were also responsible for the GFP-Ub accumulation at LUD by depleting RNF8 or Ubc13 in GFP-Ub&#x02013;expressing HeLa cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of RNF8 and Ubc13, as confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. S1 c), resulted in a strongly decreased accumulation of GFP-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d</xref>) and ubiquitinated H2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 e</xref>) at LUD. These results were confirmed by immunostaining for endogenous conjugated Ub (Fig. S1 d). In mammalian nuclei, 5&#x02013;15% of H2A is monoubiquitinated, explaining the relative abundant nuclear localization of GFP-Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dantuma et al., 2006</xref>). Depletion of RNF8 does not affect the total pool of nuclear conjugated Ub (mainly H2A-Ub), suggesting that RNF8 is a DNA damage&#x02013;specific E3 ligase.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of RNF8 and Ubc13 in UV-induced DDR</title><p>We tested the involvement of RNF8 and Ubc13 in UV-induced DDR by determining the UV sensitivity of HeLa cells depleted for these proteins. RNF8- and Ubc13-depleted cells were more UV sensitive than control siRNA&#x02013;transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>) but not as sensitive as cells depleted for the essential NER endonucleases XPF or XPG. These results suggest that UV-induced H2A ubiquitination plays an important role in UV survival but is not as essential as depletion of the NER factors XPF or XPG. To further investigate the role of RNF8 and Ubc13 in NER, we measured the activity of the final step of the NER process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoeijmakers, 2001</xref>), the gap-filling DNA synthesis. This unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) was analyzed in cells treated with siRNA against XPF, RNF8, and Ubc13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>). In contrast to the severe UDS reduction by XPF depletion, knockdown of RNF8 or Ubc13 does not affect UDS despite their function in UV survival, as revealed by UV hypersensitivity in RNF8- or Ubc13-depleted cells. These results indicate that RNF8 and Ubc13 play a role in UV&#x02013;DDR but do not directly affect the core NER repair process.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>RNF8 and Ubc13 depletion sensitizes cells to UV.</bold> (a) UV survival using HeLa cells transiently transfected with siRNA targeting RNF8, Ubc13, XPF, XPG, or control siRNA.

UDS was quantified by counting autoradiographic grains in 50 nuclei, and the number of counts in control-transfected cells was set at 100%. RNF8 and Ubc13 have no effect on UDS.

The recruitment of these enzymes to LUD was tested in cells expressing full-length GFP-tagged RNF8 or Ubc13 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902150/DC1">Fig. S2 a</ext-link>). We found a clear accumulation of both GFP-RNF8 and GFP-Ubc13 at LUD, colocalizing with CPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 c</xref>) and Ub (Fig. S2 b). Endogenous RNF8 was also found to accumulate at UV lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 d</xref>) and remains, like Ub, 24 h after UV enriched at LUD. This supports a model of continuous H2A ubiquitination at DNA damage. Importantly, RNF8 recruitment to UV lesions occurs in a cell cycle&#x02013;independent manner, as shown by EdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</xref>) and cyclin A costaining (Fig. S2 c).</p><p>RNF8 harbors an N-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Plans et al., 2006</xref>), which is commonly implicated in phosphorylation-dependent protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammet et al., 2003</xref>), and a C-terminal RING finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Plans et al., 2006</xref>), which is known to interact with E2-conjugating enzymes and is essential for its Ub ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang and Weissman, 2004</xref>). We observed that the RING finger point mutant (C403S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>) localizes to LUD similar as wild-type RNF8, whereas the FHA domain point mutant (R42A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>) is unable to accumulate at lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>). These data suggest that RNF8 is recruited to UV-damaged DNA via a phospho-specific protein&#x02013;protein interaction involving its FHA domain. After IR, RNF8 is recruited to DSBs through binding of its FHA domain to phosphorylated MDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kolas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether the scaffold protein MDC1 is also involved in loading RNF8 and Ub to LUD using cells that stably express MDC1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902150/DC1">Fig. S3 a</ext-link>). In the absence of MDC1, both GFP-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>) and GFP-RNF8 (Fig. S3 b) failed to accumulate at LUD. These results were confirmed by immunostaining with an antibody specific for ubiquitinated H2A in cells transfected with siRNA targeting MDC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref>). Together, these data argue that MDC1 is required for UV-induced H2A ubiquitination. Surprisingly, thus far, MDC1 was only found to be implicated in DSB&#x02013;DDR, and its implication in UV&#x02013;DDR is unprecedented. To rule out the possibility that its recruitment during UV&#x02013;DDR was caused by replication stress&#x02013;induced DSBs after collapsed replication forks, we showed that MDC is recruited to LUD independent of replication using MDC1-GFP&#x02013;expressing cells in combination with staining for EdU incorporation (Fig. S3 c; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</xref>). Finally, in noncycling confluent primary fibroblasts confirmed by Ki-67 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 d</xref>), endogenous MDC1 accumulated at LUD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 e</xref>).

In contrast, H2A ubiquitination within UV&#x02013;DDR is a relatively slow process, reaching a maximum only &#x0223c;3 h after UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>), whereas lesion binding of UV damage&#x02013;recognizing NER proteins is very quick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luijsterburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoogstraten et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, depletion of the responsible E2-conjugating enzyme or E3 ligase does not directly affect NER efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>). Together, these data suggest that UV-induced H2A ubiquitination occurs late in UV&#x02013;DDR. To investigate at which point during UV&#x02013;DDR RNF8 becomes implicated, we monitored GFP-RNF8 binding to LUD in NER-deficient cells. We found that in two independent cell lines derived from Xeroderma pigmentosum patients mutated in the damage-recognizing and NER-initiating protein XPC, RNF8-GFP fails to bind to LUD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 a</xref>). This indicates that the RNF8 recruitment, similar to the subsequent GFP-Ub accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergink et al., 2006</xref>), is dependent on active NER. Surprisingly, both RNF8 and Ub accumulation to LUD was still visible 24 h after UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 d</xref>), whereas presence of NER factors at LUD faded within 4&#x02013;6 h after UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 f</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoogstraten et al., 2008</xref>). Within this time frame, the bulk of the UV-induced 6-4PPs are removed by the NER machinery (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902150/DC1">Fig. S4 a</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoogstraten et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that detectable accumulation of NER factors at LUD follows the repair kinetics of 6-4PP. This triggers the question of why this epigenetic mark remains far beyond removal of 6-4PP but still requires functional NER. However, it should be noted that in the majority of UV-induced lesions, CPDs (&#x0223c;60%) are slowly repaired by NER, and a significant fraction remains unrepaired even 24 h after UV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mitchell et al., 1985</xref>). To test whether the repair of photolesions in general causes this chromatin response after UV, we removed these lesions by photoreactivation. We expressed GFP-Ub in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from a transgenic mouse model expressing both 6-4PP and CPD photolyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jans et al., 2005</xref>). These photolyases directly reverse photolesions after exposure to visible light (Fig. S4 b) independent of NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jans et al., 2005</xref>). In photoreactivated cells, no accumulation of GFP-Ub at LUD could be detected 6 h after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 b</xref>, right), whereas in nonphotoreactivated control cells, GFP-Ub clearly accumulated at LUD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 b</xref>, left). These data indicate that H2A is continuously ubiquitinated as long as DNA lesions, including the poorly repaired CPDs, are present.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>NER intermediates trigger RNF8 accumulation in a DNA damage&#x02013; and ATR-dependent manner.</bold> (a) RNF8-GFP stably expressing NER-proficient (MRC5) or NER-deficient (XPC-negative cell lines XP20MA and XP4PA) were locally UV exposed (60 J/m<sup>2</sup>). 2 h later, damaged cells were immunostained for CPDs.

After UV lesion removal, GFP-Ub does not accumulate at LUD. (c) ATR hypomorphic human cells (Seckel) and C5RO cells with a wild-type ATR status were locally UV irradiated (25 J/m<sup>2</sup>) and immunostained after 2 h with antibodies recognizing MDC1 or conjugated Ub (FKII). XPA was used as a damage marker, indicating that MDC1 and Ub accumulate in an ATR-dependent manner.

Within DSB&#x02013;DDR, H2A ubiquitination depends on the DNA damage signaling kinase ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>). However, ATM does not become directly activated by UV irradiation in nonreplicating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stiff et al., 2006</xref>). Thus far, the best-characterized damage signaling kinase in UV&#x02013;DDR is ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanasoge and Ljungman, 2007</xref>). We found that in fibroblasts carrying a hypomorphic ATR mutation that causes severely reduced ATR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Driscoll et al., 2003</xref>), both endogenous MDC1 and conjugated Ub accumulation at LUD were significantly attenuated as compared with wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 c</xref>). In addition, we found that when UV-irradiated cells were treated with the ATM- and DNA-PK&#x02013;specific inhibitors (KU-55933 and KU-57788, respectively), MDC1 and RNF8 loading to LUD was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 d</xref>). Addition of both inhibitors to cells exposed to IR completely abolished H2AX phosphorylation and formation of MDC1 or RNF8 foci, indicating that the inhibitors efficiently down-regulated the activity of both kinases. These results indicate that the UV-induced MDC1 and RNF8 recruitment depends on ATR.</p><p>Besides the involvement of different kinases, a clear difference also exists in the time of RNF8 pathway activation between DSB&#x02013; and UV&#x02013;DDR. The RNF8 pathway is activated before DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>); however, after UV damage, it is activated as a consequence of NER. This implies that ATR becomes activated in an NER-dependent fashion. It is established that ATR activation after UV damage is caused by replication stress that creates single-stranded DNA, which is a substrate for RPA/ATR-interacting protein, resulting in the subsequent ATR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shechter et al., 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, we found that MDC1 and RNF8 binding also occurs outside S phase. It was recently described that in non&#x02013;S phase cells, single-stranded repair intermediates generated during NER by the excision of the damaged strand activate ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanasoge and Ljungman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stiff et al., 2008</xref>). To study whether these NER-mediated repair intermediates are responsible for the observed RNF8 pathway activation, we increased the amount of single-stranded NER intermediates (and consequently increased ATR activation) by blocking the DNA repair synthesis using the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin. To visualize a possible increase of RNF8 activation, we exposed the cells to a relative low dose of local UV damage (20 J/m<sup>2</sup>) and shortly after UV (1.5 h) as compared with the previously used conditions, i.e., suboptimal conditions for visualizing H2A-Ub and GFP-RNF8 accumulation at LUD. As expected, without repair replication inhibition, only a faint accumulation could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 e</xref>, left). However, a very clear LUD accumulation of GFP-RNF8 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 e</xref>, right) in cells treated with aphidicolin for 1 h.</p><p>This indicates that MDC1, RNF8, and the subsequent GFP-Ub accumulation are relatively late events triggered by the DNA repair intermediates, which subsequently activate ATR. This would suggest that the MDC1&#x02013;RNF8 pathway is activated at a hierarchical step in the UV&#x02013;DDR, occurring after the initial incision step mediated by the core NER machinery. To test this hypothesis in more detail, we have analyzed the time-dependent accumulation of several proteins involved in different steps during UV&#x02013;DDR by IF at different time points after LUD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 f</xref> and Fig. S4 e). Core NER factors like the damage-recognizing protein XPC or the DNA helicase of the TFIIH complex XPB completely colocalize with the used damage markers 15 min after UV damage. This colocalization remains for a few hours and gradually decreases to background levels at 4 h after UV damage, basically after the repair kinetics of 6-4PPs. In contrast, RPA, which is known to interact with single-stranded DNA repair intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>), followed an entirely different kinetic profile. Shortly after LUD, only &#x0223c;20% colocalized with a damage marker and reached a maximum of almost-full colocalization &#x0223c;4 h after LUD that persisted until 8 h after UV. Similar kinetic profiles were found for phosphorylated H2AX, MDC1, and Ub, indicating that these events represent late, postincision events of the UV&#x02013;DDR pathway. To further analyze the order of accumulation, we have measured the real-time live cell accumulation of XCP-GFP, RPAp70-GFP, and Ub-GFP by confocal imaging. After applying LUD using a UV-C laser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dinant et al., 2007</xref>), we measured the assembly kinetics of GFP-tagged proteins at LUD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 g</xref>). A striking difference in the assembly kinetics was observed between these proteins in which XPC reaches equilibrium the fastest, representative for an early event (damage detecting), followed by the recruitment of RPA, which represents the formation of single-stranded DNA repair intermediates, and finally GFP-Ub, which reaches its plateau much later. Together, these data provide insight into the hierarchy of the UV&#x02013;DDR response: (1) initiation of the NER machinery results in (2) repair intermediates that finally activate the (3) MDC1&#x02013;RNF8 pathway, resulting in the recruitment of Ub at the LUD.</p></sec><sec><title>RNF8 is essential for 53BP1 and BRCA1 accumulation after UV damage</title><p>Despite important mechanistic and kinetic differences, our data suggest that both DSB and UV lesions trigger a similar epigenetic mark, H2A ubiquitination. During DSB&#x02013;DDR, the RNF8-dependent H2A or H2AX ubiquitination eventually promotes the recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to chromatin near breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kolas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>). It is suggested that ubiquitinated H2A/H2AX is recognized by the Ub-interacting motifs of RAP80, which through its interaction with CCDC98 recruits BRCA1/BARD1 to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sobhian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). It is currently unknown how 53BP1 is recruited in an RNF8- and MDC1-dependent way. To study whether the observed UV-induced H2A ubiquitination also triggers the recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1, we tested whether these thus-far DSB-specific factors also accumulate at LUD. Both endogenous 53BP1 and BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, a and b</xref>) accumulate at LUD in an RNF8- and MDC1-dependent fashion. As in the DSB response, the UV damage&#x02013;induced accumulation of BRCA1 at LUD most likely occurs via its interaction with RAP80, which also accumulates at UV-induced LUD, colocalizing with CPD or H2AX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902150/DC1">Fig. S5 a</ext-link>). Both the accumulation of 53BP1 and conjugated Ub also take place in nonproliferating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 c</xref>), ruling out the possibility that these proteins accumulate at DSBs originating from stalled replication forks. The 53BP1 accumulation in primary nonproliferating cells was further studied using different UV doses. Even at a relative low dose of 5 J/m<sup>2</sup>, the 53BP1 colocalization with CPD was still clearly visible (Fig. S5 b). Together, these results show that like DSBs, UV-induced DNA damage results in a strong increase in local concentration of checkpoint mediators like MDC1, RNF8, and ubiquitinated H2A, suggesting that this robust epigenetic mark is a conserved DNA damage signal&#x02013;amplifying process between DSB processing and NER.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>53BP1 and BRCA1 accumulate at LUD in an RNF8- and MDC1-dependent manner.</bold> (a and b) U2OS cells conditionally expressing doxycycline (Dox)-inducible shRNA targeting RNF8 were induced or not with doxycycline for 48 h, and cells stably expressing shRNA targeting MDC1 were locally UV damaged and stained for 53BP1 and CPD (a) or for BRCA1 and XPA (b).

(e) Model for the UV-induced DDR. UV-induced lesions are repaired by the core NER machinery, thereby generating single-stranded DNA repair intermediates, which subsequently activate ATR. This results in recruitment of MDC1 at the chromatin, which is essential for the RNF8 accumulation at the DNA damage. In concert with Ubc13, RNF8 ubiquitinates H2A, which triggers the recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1. From MDC1 recruitment onwards, the IR- and UV-induced DDR are similar.

Our data show that after UV damage, the Ub E3 ligase RNF8, in concert with the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc13, is essential for the NER-dependent Ub modification of histone H2A. In a previous study, we reported that UV-induced ubiquitination of histone H2A required Ring2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergink et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, Ring2 knockdown also results in a severe reduction of basal H2A ubiquitination as well as the nuclear Ub pool. Thus, Ring2 knockdown is likely to disturb the cellular Ub equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groothuis et al., 2006</xref>) and may affect downstream-specific ubiquitination reactions such as the RNF8-dependent H2A ubiquitination. In contrast, RNF8 knockdown inhibits only UV-induced and not basal H2A ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, we show that RNF8 is recruited to the damaged DNA, suggesting that RNF8 is the DNA damage&#x02013;specific H2A E3 ligase.</p><p>Intriguingly, a significant proportion of Ubc13 was found to accumulate at the site of DNA damage, indicating that a large part of the pool of Ubc13 proteins plays a role during UV-induced DNA repair. Recently, it was also observed that a large part of the total amount of Ubc13 is involved during the DSB-induced DDR, as was shown by the accumulation of Ubc13 at laser-induced DSB damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ikura et al., 2007</xref>). This indicates that Ubc13 plays an important role during DNA repair in addition to its involvement in many other biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pickart, 2000</xref>). Because RNF8 recruitment to damaged DNA is independent on Ubc13 (unpublished data), we assume that Ubc13 depends on RNF8 recruitment, which is in line with the described interaction of Ubc13 with the RING finger domain of RNF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Plans et al., 2006</xref>). The strong accumulation of Ubc13 at the site of damage, which is surprising for such a usually less-specific functioning, E2-conjugating enzyme (in contrast to the more substrate-specific E3 ligases), indicates its important role during UV-induced DDR. Ubc13 is, for the majority, not involved in the core NER machinery because Ubc13 depletion has no detectable effect on UDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>) or XPA accumulation (Fig. S1 d). Most likely, Ubc13 plays a role in the downstream UV-induced DDR together with RNF8.</p><p>Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 e</xref>) show that the molecular mechanism that induces ubiquitination of H2A after genotoxic stress, including the recruitment of downstream factors 53BP1 and BRCA1, is highly conserved between DSB- and UV-induced DDR. This is remarkable considering the important mechanistic differences between DSB and UV damage repair, which may explain the variation in observed timing. MDC1 and RNF8 recruitment are early events in the DSB-induced DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>), although it is a relatively late event after UV-induced DNA damage. It is possible that this difference is caused by a much faster processing of DSB breaks, resulting in a fast ATM activation compared with a slower ATR activation by UV lesion processing.</p><p>Importantly, we found factors (e.g., MDC1, 53BP1, and Brca1) to be recruited to UV-damaged DNA that were previously known only to play a role in the DSB response. Until now, their involvement in UV&#x02013;DDR was unanticipated, although recently, some were found to be phosphorylated by ATR after UV damage, such as MDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>), RAP80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2008</xref>), and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jowsey et al., 2007</xref>). Although these proteins are maximally phosphorylated within minutes upon IR via ATM, after UV, their phosphorylation becomes apparent after 60 min and keeps increasing in time, showing that the UV&#x02013;DDR response via this RNF8 pathway has indeed slower kinetics.</p><p>The question of why these DSB&#x02013;DDR factors (including MDC1, 53BP1, and Brca1) are also recruited to chromatin after UV damage is more difficult to answer. Genetic insults may ring a &#x0201c;general alarm bell,&#x0201d; resulting in the assembly of a toolbox of diverse DDR proteins near the lesion irrespective of the type of DNA damage. This enables the cell to facilitate different response pathways, but only a specific subset will be used if needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper and Elledge, 2007</xref>). This might also explain why RNF8 is observed to accumulate at stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakasai and Tibbetts, 2008</xref>). The recruitment of the DDR proteins such as MDC1, 53BP1, and BRCA1 may represent an extra line of defense against the UV-induced damage. Normally, only the NER-specialized DNA repair enzymes will be used. However, in the rare event that a DSB originates from a UV lesion during replication, the DSB-involved proteins that were present &#x0201c;just in case&#x0201d; at the damaged chromatin can swiftly be used.</p><p>Alternatively, the same pathways, and thus the same proteins, are used as cells use similar crisis management strategies triggered by different repair machineries. H2A ubiquitination increases the local concentration of 53BP1 and BRCA1 that enhances activation of the cell cycle checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stucki and Jackson, 2006</xref>). siRNA-mediated down-regulation of MDC1 results in a lower UV-induced Chk1 phosphorylation, indicating that this pathway is involved in the checkpoint induction and maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 d</xref>). Chk1 and Chk2 play a crucial role in DDR by, for example, regulating the S to G2 and G2/M checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niida and Nakanishi, 2006</xref>).

DNA transfections were performed using Fugene (Roche).</p></sec><sec><title>IF microscopy and Western blotting</title><p>Cells were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rademakers et al., 2003</xref>). For uH2A staining, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Immunofluorescent images were obtained using the Aristoplan Flu (134795; Leitz) or confocal microscope (LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with a 63&#x000d7; 1.4 NA Plan Apochromat oil immersion lens (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). LSM image browser acquisition software (version 4.0; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was used. The following antibodies were used: anti-MDC1 (Abcam), anti-RNF8 (Abcam), anti-53BP1 (H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-BRCA1 (D9; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Ub (FK2; BIOMOL International L.P.), anti&#x02013;cyclin A (GNS; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-&#x003b3;H2AX (07-164; Millipore), anti&#x02013;Ki-67 (Abcam), anti-XPB (clone IB3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giglia-Mari et al., 2006</xref>), anti-RPA32 (clone 9H8; Abcam), anti-ubiquitinated H2A (uH2A; Abcam), RAP80 (rabbit polyclonal; Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.), phospho&#x02013;S317-Chk1 (Western blotting, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.; IF, Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-GFP (rabbit polyclonal; Abcam) in combination with the corresponding secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 350, 488, or 594 as indicated (Invitrogen; The Jackson Laboratory). DNA was stained using DAPI Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). As marker for detecting LUD, anti-hXPA (rabbit polyclonal anti&#x02013;human XPA) or mouse anti-CPD (TDM-2; MBL International) were used, depending on the species in which the other used antibody was raised in. Colocalization was quantified by counting at least 50 cells per experiment in different fields. Colocalization was defined as a more than twofold increase in intensity at the LUD defined by the presence of the used damage marker (XPA or CPD). EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) incorporation was visualized using Click-iT Alexa Fluor 594 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed with the indicated primary antibody according to the manufacturer's protocol. Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti&#x02013;mouse or &#x02013;rabbit (Invitrogen) were used to visualize the Western blotting using an infrared imaging system (Odyssey; LI-COR Biosciences). H2A ubiquitination after UV damage was studied using HeLa cells stably expressing His-tagged Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choudhury et al., 2004</xref>).

Repair capacity was quantified by counting autoradiographic grains. Cellular survival of HeLa cells was determined using a colony assay. Cells were plated in 6-cm dishes at various dilutions. After 16 h, cells were exposed to different doses of UV-C (254 nm; TUV lamp; Phillips) and left to grow for 7 d, fixed, and stained, and colonies were counted to assess the colony-forming ability.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows the UV-induced H2A ubiquitination, the mobility of H2A-GFP, and the siRNA-mediated knockdown efficiency of RNF8 and Ubc13.
