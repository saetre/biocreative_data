Since complement bridges both the innate and adaptive immune systems and has been implicated in defence against influenza, the role of the complement regulator CD59a in modulating the response to influenza was explored. For this purpose, immune responses to influenza virus, strain E61-13-H17, in mice deficient in the complement regulator protein CD59a (Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice) were compared to those in wild-type mice. The severity of lung inflammation was significantly enhanced in the lungs of Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice with increased numbers of infiltrating neutrophils and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. When complement was inhibited using soluble complement receptor1, the frequency of lung-infiltrating neutrophils in influenza-infected Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice was much reduced whilst numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells remained unchanged. These results demonstrate that CD59a, previously defined as a complement regulator, modulates both the innate and adaptive immune response to influenza virus by both complement-dependent and-independent mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Lung</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza virus infection represents a major health problem, causing high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Studies of mouse models have revealed that the pathology resulting from influenza infection reflects both direct virus-induced damage as well as indirect effects of the immune response stimulated following infection. Cells of the innate and adaptive immune system have been implicated in virus-induced lung pathology and the extent of cellular infiltration, including neutrophils, eosinophils and T cells, has been shown to correlate with the degree of lung damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]. These cells migrate to the lungs, leading to disruption and occlusion of airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. Release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by both infected and immune cells further promotes influenza-induced pathology through direct effects on lung tissue and by further recruitment of inflammatory cells and T cells to the site of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. The involvement of the immune system in lung pathology is also corroborated by histological studies of lung biopsies of humans with influenza pneumonia, which revealed the presence of lymphocytic infiltrates in the injured tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>].</p><p>The complement system bridges both innate and adaptive immunity and promotes migration of immune cells into lungs. Administration of cobra venom factor, a potent activator of the complement system, has been used to induce lung injury in a mouse model. Complement activation products, generated as consequence of systemic complement activation by cobra venom factor, caused neutrophil migration and sequestration in lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Moreover, complement is known to influence both virus-specific immune responses in the lung and lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. In particular, mice deficient in complement component C3, the lynchpin of the complement cascade, display reduced influenza virus-specific T cell responses in infected lungs, implying that complement activation plays an important role in T cell activation and/or recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. Collectively, these studies imply that activation of the complement system markedly influences the extent of cellular infiltration into the lungs of influenza-infected mice and, as a consequence, the degree of lung damage.</p><p>We reasoned that defects in complement regulation would also influence the clinical course of influenza infection by permitting enhanced complement activation. In order to test this hypothesis, wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking CD59a, the membrane regulator of complement membrane attack complex (MAC) formation, were infected with influenza virus. A comparison of the degree of cellular infiltration into the lungs of both mouse groups revealed an enhanced infiltration of neutrophils, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD4/CD8 double-positive (DP) cells in the lungs of the Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice. This was accompanied by an increase in lung pathology, observed by histology, in the mice lacking Cd59a. Thus, our results demonstrate that clinical disease following influenza infection is enhanced in the absence of CD59a, and that severity correlated with the infiltration of neutrophils and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into the lungs of the infected mice. Analysis of the role of complement in the enhanced injury and inflammation in the lungs of influenza-infected Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice revealed that increased neutrophil infiltration was dependent on complement activation whilst enhancement of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response was complement-independent. These results demonstrate that CD59a modulates the immune response to influenza virus by both complement-dependent and-independent mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cd59a<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit increased lung pathology compared to WT mice</title><p>Experimental influenza infection results in significant lung injury that can be detected by histological study of infected lungs. Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> and WT mice were infected with influenza virus (H17, H3N2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>] intranasally (i.n.) and lungs were evaluated 8days post-infection by analysing H&#x00026;E-stained sections of influenza-infected lungs. Stringent scoring of histological sections was performed by two independent investigators blinded to the various treatment regimes and mice used. Influenza-infected WT mice showed a moderate increase in leukocyte infiltration compared to uninfected mice (representative sections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>]A&#x02013;C). There was no significant difference in lung pathology between naive WT and Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice. In contrast, Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice showed pronounced and significant elevation in all parameters indicative of pulmonary injury resulting from influenza infection, namely, the degree of haemorrhage, interstitial leukocyte infiltration and perivascular lymphoid aggregation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>]). Interestingly, mild fibrosis was also noted in the Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice but was absent in all WT mice (data not shown)</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(A&#x02013;C) Histological analysis of lung sections taken from Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup>, WT and age-matched WT controls.

In contrast, numbers of infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells remained unchanged after sCR1 administration, indicating that modulation of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response by CD59a in experimental influenza infection is complement-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The immune response to influenza virus represents a double-edged sword; mounting an adequate response is crucial for virus clearance, but over-exuberant recruitment of immune cells into the lung can result in tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. Indeed, the extent of the innate and adaptive immune response to influenza virus infection in experimental mouse models correlates with the extent of lung injury, weight loss and mortality. Complement bridges both the innate and adaptive immune systems, is known to cause activation and migration of leukocytes, and has been implicated in defence against influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. Roles of complement regulators in modulating the response to influenza have not previously been explored.</p><p>Here we analysed whether the complement regulator CD59a influences the immune response to influenza virus. Histological studies of lung sections revealed increased lung injury in influenza-infected mice lacking CD59a. This was accompanied by an enhanced infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes into the lungs of infected mice that may contribute to lung injury through direct cytotoxicity and/or the release of immune mediators that further amplify the inflammatory infiltrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>]. A parallel study in Balb/c mice indicated that Balb/c mice lacking CD59a showed increased disease, monitored by cellular infiltration of the lungs and weight loss following infection, when compared with WT Balb/c controls.</p><p>In order to establish the role of complement, we treated Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> and WT mice with the soluble complement inhibitor sCR1 over the course of infection. Treatment with sCR1 did not significantly alter influenza-induced neutrophil infiltration in WT mice but markedly reduced neutrophil influx in Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice, reaching levels similar to those found in WT mice. These findings show that the augmented neutrophil response in Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice was due to enhanced complement activation. Absence of CD59a, by rendering cells more susceptible to MAC-mediated damage or killing, might indirectly cause enhanced local complement activation and generation of complement activation products such as the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Both C3a and C5a have been shown previously to act as chemoattractants for neutrophils and may be responsible for directing the migration of neutrophils into influenza-infected lungs ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>]). In addition, it has been demonstrated that MAC formation can indirectly influence the recruitment of inflammatory cells. For example, deposition of sub-lytic amounts of MAC on human endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>promotes production of IL-8 and MCP-1, chemokines for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>]. Inhibition of complement had no effect on neutrophil numbers in WT mice, probably due to the efficient natural regulation of complement activation in these mice.</p><p>Higher numbers of lung-infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed in influenza virus-infected Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice compared to WT mice on days3 and8 post-infection, but by day12 this difference no longer existed. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from both groups of mice produced equal amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; on a per cell basis, but the greatly increased numbers of lung-infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice resulted in higher total levels of the cytokine, which is known to have direct anti-viral effects, at the site of virus replication. Mice were infected with low doses of the H17 virus and virus levels were undetectable in Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> and WT mice at day8, a time point described as the peak of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>], indicating that both groups of mice efficiently controlled the virus.</p><p>Since it has previously been reported that complement activation promotes the activity of influenza-specific T cells in the lungs, it was possible that the effect of CD59a on T cell activity was an indirect effect attributable to increased complement activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>]. However, inhibition of complement activity using sCR1 did not alter the enhancement of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses observed in the Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice, indicating that the effect of CD59a deficiency on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activity was complement-independent. These data support our previous finding from studies of vaccinia virus infection that CD59a expression down-modulates the activity of anti-viral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in a complement-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>]. The precise mechanism through which CD59a down-modulates T cell activity is not yet known but evidence suggests that a negative signal is delivered to the T cell as a result of CD59a binding to an as yet unidentified ligand on APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of cells infiltrating the lungs of influenza-infected WT and Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice revealed a population of CD4/CD8 DP cells appearing early in the course of infection. Higher numbers were observed in the lungs of Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice compared to WT mice, and DP cells were found in the draining lymph nodes only in Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice. Phenotypic examination indicated that these cells resembled immature DP T cells isolated from thymus. Thymic origin was confirmed by showing that DP cells were not found in mice thymectomised prior to influenza infection. CD4/CD8 DP cells have been found previously in mice infected with influenza virus in the NIH/S mouse strain. These cells were found in the lung within days of infection, and were CD4<sup>intermediate</sup> CD8<sup>high</sup> DP cells that did not express TCR and did not produce IFN-&#x003b3; upon stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>]. These findings correlate with our findings and suggest that these cells play no role in anti-viral immunity and do not impinge upon the course of infection or pathology. The increased incidence of DP cells in influenza-infected Cd59a<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice compared to WT mice is most likely a consequence of the more profound inflammatory response to influenza virus observed in these mice.</p><p>Overall, the results of experiments described in this study indicate that influenza-induced immunopathology is exacerbated in mice lacking CD59a. Increased pathology correlated with higher numbers of lung-infiltrating neutrophils and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Whilst a robust immune response is clearly critical for virus clearance and survival of the host, it is also important that the immune system is kept in check since over-exuberant immune responses can result in deleterious effects on the host leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Our findings identify the complement regulator CD59a as a regulator of the host response to influenza infection both by impinging on complement-driven responses and by directly down-modulating antiviral T cells. If human CD59 is shown to have a similar role in modulating human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells it is possible that targeted use of recombinant CD59 may be useful for limiting immunopathology at sites of inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>B6 (H-2<sup>b</sup>) mice (WT) were obtained from Harlan (Oxford, UK).
