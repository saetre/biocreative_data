Human studies have demonstrated elevated circulating levels of inflammatory markers in obese diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Furthermore, blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) in the obese state are also in a proinflammatory state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). The discovery of macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue of obese rodents and humans revealed a potentially important source of inflammatory molecules in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). Activated macrophages are well known to secrete a variety of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which impair insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Dysregulation of lipolysis by increased expression of adipose cytokines is an important factor for causing systemic insulin resistance through elevated circulating free fatty acid (FFA) levels. Elevation of circulating FFAs has also been reported to induce inflammation in MNCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Decreased adipose macrophage infiltration in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice deficient in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and its major receptor CCR2, accompanied by decreased adipose expression of cytokines and lowered circulating FFA levels, has been associated with improved systemic insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). Transgenic mice overexpressing MCP-1 in adipose tissue, with increased adipose macrophage content and elevated circulating FFA levels, are insulin resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). However, the role of MCP-1 in adipose macrophage infiltration in obesity is controversial because a recent study showed that MCP-1&#x02013;deficient mice have unchanged adipose macrophage content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Decreased macrophage infiltration and reduction of inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue have also been associated with weight loss in obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Thiazolidinediones, a class of insulin-sensitizing drugs that mainly improve adipose insulin sensitivity of type 2 diabetic patients, also have potent anti-inflammatory effects, suppress adipose macrophage gene expression in vitro and in vivo, and inhibit proinflammatory MNCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). DIO mice treated with CCR2 antagonist have a 28&#x00025; reduction in adipose macrophage content and have improved hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). These results indicate that eliminating macrophage extravasation into fat in obesity may be beneficial for improving whole-body insulin sensitivity.</p><p>MCP-1 has been a controversial candidate chemokine for recruiting macrophages into WAT in obesity, indicating involvement of other chemokines. In the present study, we examined the entire murine chemokine superfamily for their expression and regulation in adipose tissue of obese mice. Six chemokines were found to be significantly increased in obese adipose tissue. We revealed for the first time that elevation of chemokines in obese adipose tissue is predominantly in adipocytes and that FFAs are inducers for specific upregulation of the aforementioned six chemokines in cultured adipocytes. Although JNK has been demonstrated to mediate FFA-induced MCP-1 expression in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>), inhibitor of &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B) kinase-&#x003b2; (IKK&#x003b2;) is the main mediator of FFA-induced upregulation of multiple chemokines in adipocytes.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells, reagents, and treatments.</title><p>3T3-L1 cells were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture Collection. 3T3-L1 cell sublines stably expressing short hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) against Toll-like receptor 4 (shTLR4) or scramble shRNA were established as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). 3T3-L1 CAR cells, a 3T3-L1 subline stably expressing the truncated adenovirus receptor, were provided by Dr. David Orlicky (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). 3T3-L1 CAR cells have dramatically improved adenovirus infection efficiency compared with regular 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). For differentiation, preadipocytes were grown to confluency and induced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10&#x00025; cosmic calf serum (CCS), 1 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin, 0.5 mmol/l isobutylmethyl xanthine, and 1 &#x003bc;mol/l dexamethasone for 3 days. After induction, cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10&#x00025; CCS and 1 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin for 7 more days. FFA mixture, dexamethasone, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. For FFA treatment, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 0.5 mmol/l FFA mixture in the presence of BSA at the molar ratio of 4:1. NADPH, nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), and JNK inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. Rosiglitazone was purchased from BioMol International.

These mice were fed standard chow and killed at 9 weeks of age for tissue collection. For DIO mice, C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory at 3 weeks of age, acclaimed for a week, and fed on either a chow diet (5&#x00025; kcal from fat) or a high-fat diet (60&#x00025; kcal from fat; D12492; Research Diets) for 20 weeks. For rosiglitazone treatment, 9-week-old <italic>ob/ob</italic> male mice were orally gavaged once a day at the dose of 15 mg/kg for 28 consecutive days. At the end of the study, mice were killed by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, and epididymal fat pads were excised for RNA extraction.

NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor was applied to adipocytes 1 h before FFA treatment and also added during FFA treatment. For luciferase assay, transfected cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles, and centrifuged at 10,000<italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C to remove cellular debris. Firefly luciferase activity was measured by mixing 20 &#x003bc;l cell extract with 100 &#x003bc;l luciferase assay buffer containing firefly luciferase substrate.

We analyzed the expression and regulation of murine chemokines in adipose tissue from both <italic>ob/ob</italic> and DIO mice by transcriptional profiling and real-time PCR analysis. We selected 9-week-old <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice and 24-week-old DIO mice fed on a high-fat diet for 20 weeks because of their comparable adiposity. The metabolic parameters of these mice are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. Six CC and one CXC chemokines were found to be significantly upregulated in WAT of both <italic>ob/ob</italic> and DIO mice. These CC chemokines include <italic>MCP-1</italic>, <italic>MCP-2</italic>, <italic>MCP-3</italic>, <italic>MIP-1</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>MRP-1</italic>, and <italic>MRP-2</italic> (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). CXC chemokine <italic>MIP-2</italic> was also significantly upregulated in WAT of both <italic>ob/ob</italic> and DIO mice; <italic>MIP-1</italic>&#x003b2; was significantly upregulated in WAT of <italic>ob/ob</italic> but not DIO mice; <italic>MIP-2&#x003b3;</italic> was significantly upregulated in WAT of DIO but not <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. Interestingly, all six upregulated CC chemokines have monocyte chemotactic capabilities. Separation of adipocytes and stromal vascular cells indicate that these CC chemokines are mainly increased in primary adipocytes (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1&#x003b1;, and MRP-2 have been previously reported to increase at the mRNA level in whole adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). Our study not only adds MRP-1 to the list but also points out that elevation of chemokine expression mainly occurs in adipocytes. The protein levels of MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MRP-1, and MRP-2 were significantly increased by 402, 213, 604, 92, and 190&#x00025;, respectively, in WAT of DIO mice with the protein level of MCP-2 unchanged (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). The protein levels of MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MRP-1, and MRP-2 were significantly increased by 85, 16, 134, 134, 21, and 60&#x00025;, respectively, in WAT of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). The circulating levels of MCP-1, MCP-3, MRP-1, and MRP-2 were significantly increased by 160, 254, 41, and 17&#x00025;, respectively, in plasma of DIO mice (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). The circulating levels of MCP-1 and MCP-3 were also significantly increased by 345 and 71&#x00025;, respectively, in plasma of <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Circulating levels of MCP-2 did not change in either DIO mice or <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. Circulating levels of MRP-1 and MRP-2 only increased in DIO mice but remained unchanged in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice. Circulating level of MIP-1&#x003b1; was undetectable in either <italic>ob/ob</italic> or DIO mice. To understand when these chemokines start to increase, a high-fat diet was applied to 4-week-old C57BL/6J mice for a short period of time. The protein level of MCP-1 rapidly increased 1 day after high-fat diet and continued to increase at 3 and 7 days on high-fat diet (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). The protein levels of MCP-2 and MCP-3 trended up 1 day on high-fat diet and the elevation became significant at 3 and 7 days on high-fat diet. The protein level of MRP-2 significantly increased at 7 days on high-fat diet. However, MIP-1&#x003b1; and MRP-1 protein levels did not significantly increase within 1 week of high-fat diet. These results indicate that MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MRP-2 might be more important in the initial macrophage extravasation into adipose tissue compared with MIP-1&#x003b1; and MRP-1, which probably play a role in attracting macrophage into adipose tissue in a later stage of obesity development. To determine whether elevation of chemokine expression in adipose tissue occurs before macrophage infiltration, we evaluated the kinetics of macrophage infiltration by comparing adiposity and macrophage number in DIO mice versus lean controls 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks on high-fat diet (supplementary Table 1, available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1344">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1344</ext-link>). Our results clearly show that fat pad enlargement, increase of adipocyte number, and elevation of expression of monocyte chemotactic factors occur as early as 1 week on high-fat diet, but adipose macrophage content did not significantly increase until 12 weeks on high-fat diet. A recent study reported that F4/80 and CD11C double positive cells are mainly responsible for macrophage-mediated inflammatory activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). We therefore analyzed the adipose macrophage content by counting F4/80 and CD11C double positive cells.</p></sec><sec><title>FFAs are potent inducers for chemokine expression.</title><p>Massive expansion of adipose tissue reflects the need for the body to store excessive amount of energy in the form of triglyceride, which is synthesized using FFAs and glycerol as substrates. The effects of FFAs and glycerol on chemokine production in adipocytes have not been documented. To determine whether a surplus of FFAs and/or glycerol could be the stimuli for increased chemokine production, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with a mixture of either 0.5 mmol/l FFA/BSA or 0.5 mmol/l glycerol. We chose to use a mixture of 0.5 mmol/l saturated (lauric and myristic acid) and unsaturated (oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acid) FFAs for stimulation. FFAs dramatically upregulated <italic>MCP-1</italic> expression, whereas glycerol had no effect (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Further experiments indicated that FFAs are also able to upregulate <italic>MCP-2</italic>, <italic>MCP-3</italic>, <italic>MIP</italic>-1&#x003b1;, <italic>MRP-1</italic>, and <italic>MRP-2</italic> in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). As a negative control, expression of <italic>eotaxin 2</italic>, which is not upregulated in obese adipose tissue, was examined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and was found not to be increased by FFA treatment (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). The upregulation of mRNA level of the above chemokines by FFA treatment is accompanied by increased protein secretion into conditioned medium (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). FFA-stimulated chemokine production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is dose (data not shown) and time dependent (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Detailed chemokine expression time course revealed that the peak expression of <italic>MCP-1</italic>, <italic>MCP-2</italic>, <italic>MCP-3</italic>, and <italic>MIP-1</italic>&#x003b1; is &#x0223c;3 h after treatment (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, FFA-stimulated upregulation of <italic>MRP-1</italic> and <italic>MRP-2</italic> is due to delayed decrease rather than increase of the actual mRNA levels compared with vehicle-treated cells (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Experiments using individual FFAs indicate that the effect is most likely attributed to unsaturated FFAs (supplementary Fig. 1, available in the online appendix).</p></sec><sec><title>Role of TLR4 in FFA-induced chemokine expression.</title><p>TLR4 plays an important role in innate immunity. Recently, TLR4 has been demonstrated to mediate fatty acid&#x02013;induced activation of inflammatory pathways and attenuation of insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). To investigate whether TLR4 plays a role in FFA-induced chemokine expression in adipocytes, we treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes stably expressing scramble shRNA or shTLR4 with FFAs. Consistent with a previous report, reduction of <italic>TLR4</italic> expression in adipocytes significantly reduced FFA-induced <italic>IL-6</italic> expression (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). FFA-induced expression of <italic>MCP-1</italic>, <italic>MCP-3</italic>, <italic>MIP-1</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>MRP-1</italic>, and <italic>MRP-2</italic> was also reduced (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, the basal levels of <italic>MCP-1</italic>, <italic>MRP-1</italic>, and <italic>MRP-2</italic> were also decreased (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). However, TLR4 knockdown did not have any effect on <italic>MCP-2</italic> expression in either basal or FFA-stimulated condition. These results indicate that TLR4 is partially responsible for FFA-induced chemokine expression and that an alternative pathway(s) also exists.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of FFA-induced chemokine expression.</title><p>To further explore the mechanism of FFA-induced chemokine expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we tested whether the regulation is dependent on transcription and/or protein synthesis. The upregulation of <italic>MCP-1</italic>, <italic>MCP-2</italic>, <italic>MCP-3</italic>, and <italic>MIP-1</italic>&#x003b1; mRNA in response to FFAs is transcription dependent because the effect can be blocked by actinomycin D treatment (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, the upregulation of <italic>MRP-1</italic> and <italic>MRP-2</italic> mRNA is posttranscriptional (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Only FFA-stimulated <italic>MIP-1</italic>&#x003b1; expression requires protein synthesis because it is blocked by cycloheximide treatment (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, blockage of protein synthesis significantly further increased expression of <italic>MCP-1</italic> and <italic>MCP-3</italic> (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>FFAs have been reported to induce production of hydrogen peroxide in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). Despite the fact that high concentration of hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mmol/l) can mildly induce MCP-1 mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes 24 h after treatment, we found that 0.5 mmol/l hydrogen peroxide did not significantly upregulate these six chemokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes 3 h after treatment (data not shown). In addition, treatment with 500 &#x003bc;mol/l NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin could not repress FFA-induced chemokine production but did effectively abolish production of hydrogen peroxide caused by FFA treatment (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). FFAs are also known to activate both NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Therefore, we tested the possibility of whether FFA-induced chemokine expression is due to activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and/or JNK pathways. NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activation inhibitor was used to treat 3T3-L1 adipocytes at 200 &#x003bc;mol/l, which inhibited FFA-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation by 99.8&#x00025; (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Significant repression on FFA-induced chemokine expression by NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor was observed for all six chemokines (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). JNK inhibitor II (SP600125) was applied to assess the role of JNK in FFA-induced expression of chemokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. FFA-induced expression of <italic>MCP-1</italic> and <italic>MCP-3</italic> was significantly reduced in SP600125-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). The efficacy of SP600125 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was confirmed by reduction of JNK phosphorylation (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). To confirm the role of NF-&#x003ba;B in FFA-induced chemokine expression by a biological approach, we reduced the expression of IKK&#x003b2; by RNA interference (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). Consistent with our results with NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor, reduction of IKK&#x003b2; expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by RNA interference also reduced FFA-induced upregulation of all six CC chemokines (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). The inhibitory effect of JNK inhibitor on FFA-induced MCP-1 and MCP-3 expression was also confirmed by RNA interference (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). In addition, overexpression of both wild type and the constitutively active form of IKK&#x003b2; in 3T3-L1 CAR adipocytes via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer can significantly increase expression of MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1&#x003b1;, and MRP-2 (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) but, surprisingly, not MRP-1 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of rosiglitazone on expression of monocyte chemotactic factors in vitro and in vivo.</title><p>Thiazolidinediones have been reported to have potent anti-inflammatory activity and suppress NF-&#x003ba;B activity in MNCs and lower plasma MCP-1 level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). To address whether thiazolidinediones can repress FFA-induced expression of chemokines in adipocytes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with rosiglitazone for 24 h before stimulation with FFAs. Pretreatment with rosiglitazone significantly and dose dependently reduced expression of <italic>MCP-1</italic>, <italic>MCP-3</italic>, <italic>MIP-1</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>MRP-1</italic>, and <italic>MRP-2</italic>, but not <italic>MCP-2</italic>, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (supplementary Fig. 2, available in the online appendix). Obese mice treated with thiazolidinediones have been reported to have reduced expression of MCP-1, MCP-3, and MIP-1&#x003b1; but unchanged MCP-2 expression in adipose tissue; and obese humans treated with pioglitazone have reduced expression of MCP-1 in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). However, potential regulation of MRP-1 and MRP-2 in adipose tissue by thiazolidinediones has never been examined. We treated <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice with rosiglitazone for 4 weeks and evaluated the expression of all six chemokines upregulated in obese fat. Consistent with previous reports, expression of <italic>MCP-1</italic>, <italic>MCP-3</italic>, and <italic>MIP-1</italic>&#x003b1; was repressed but <italic>MCP-2</italic> remains unchanged (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>). Surprisingly, rosiglitazone can only reduce expression of <italic>MRP-1</italic> and <italic>MRP-2</italic> in vitro but not in vivo, suggesting that these two chemokines might be regulated by an additional mechanism in vivo compared with in vitro.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Obesity-related adipose tissue macrophage accumulation has been demonstrated to contribute to systemic insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). To understand the responsible chemotactic factors in addition to MCP-1, we systematically analyzed the expression and regulation of murine chemokines in adipose tissue of male <italic>ob/ob</italic> and DIO mice. Totally, five additional monocyte chemokines were found to be upregulated at both mRNA and protein level in WAT of <italic>ob/ob</italic> and DIO mice, indicating that macrophage extravasation into adipose tissue in the obese state might be very complicated. A recent publication showed that another monocyte chemokine MIP-2&#x003b3; is upregulated at the mRNA level in WAT of both <italic>ob/ob</italic> and DIO mice, whereas we only detected mild upregulation in WAT of DIO but not <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). The discrepancy is likely due to gender difference. In that report, MIP-2&#x003b3; has been shown to play an important role in WAT macrophage infiltration in female but not male DIO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). In our study, we only followed up on the six CC chemokines that are upregulated in WAT of both <italic>ob/ob</italic> and DIO male mice. Isolation of primary adipocytes proves that aforementioned chemokines are predominantly increased in adipocytes, supporting the hypothesis that adipocyte-derived chemokines might play important roles in initial macrophage infiltration. Acute high-fat diet study showed rapid increase of MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MRP-2 in fat within a week, at which time point circulating levels of these chemokines did not change. Our kinetic study with DIO mice indicates that fat mass enlargement precedes increase of macrophage content and further supports that adipocytes may play an important role in initiating macrophage infiltration by secreting chemokines.</p><p>Elevated level of FFAs, a well-known factor contributing to systemic insulin resistance and inflammation in MNCs in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), was found to potently induce expression of monocyte chemotactic factors in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, accompanied by increased protein secretion into conditioned medium. FFA-stimulated expression of monocyte chemotactic factors is dose and time dependent, and unsaturated fatty acids are mainly responsible for this effect. The extent and duration of chemokine induction by FFAs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes vary among chemokines. Because these chemokines start to elevate in adipose tissue at different time points on high-fat diet, it is likely that they play unequal roles in attracting monocytes. Why so many monocyte chemotactic factors increase in the obese state is not clear. Genetic models deficient in these chemokines individually or in combination will provide more information regarding their relative importance for adipose tissue macrophage attraction. In addition to potential macrophage recruiting capability, whether these chemokines have other biological functions, such as impairing insulin sensitivity in insulin target cells, like MCP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>), remains to be investigated.</p><p>Interestingly, not all of the upregulated chemokines are due to the actual increase of mRNA. In the cases of MRP-1 and MRP-2, the mRNA levels decreased rapidly in vehicle-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas delayed reduction of mRNA was observed in FFA-treated cells, suggesting that FFAs might protect mRNA stability of MRP-1 and MRP-2. For MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MIP-1&#x003b1;, mRNA levels were induced by FFA treatment via a transcription-dependent mechanism. TLR4 has been recently demonstrated to be an important receptor for mediating the effects of FFAs on activation of inflammatory pathways. We found that TLR4 is also partially responsible for FFA-induced upregulation of MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MRP-1, and MRP-2. FFAs are known to activate both NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK pathways, the important intracellular pathways that are activated by inflammatory stimuli. The IKK&#x003b2;/NF-&#x003ba;B axis has been demonstrated to be the molecular target for the hypoglycemic actions of salicylates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). IKK&#x003b2; selectively phosphorylates the I&#x003ba;B protein inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B, which triggers degradation of I&#x003ba;B and releases NF-&#x003ba;B for translocation into the nucleus to transcribe many target genes that are related to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>). By application of the NF-&#x003ba;B activation inhibitor, reduction of IKK&#x003b2; expression via RNA interference, and IKK&#x003b2; overexpression, we showed that the IKK/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway has a broad effect on FFA-induced chemokine expression. JNK is a stress kinase that is involved in insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). Animals deficient in JNK-1 are protected from developing insulin resistance on a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). In addition, JNK has also been demonstrated to be a major contributor to FFA-induced cellular insulin resistance using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). In our study, inhibition of the JNK pathway partially reduced FFA-induced upregulation of MCP-1 and MCP-3. Because upregulation of MCP-1 and MCP-3 by FFA treatment is due to increased transcription, JNK-involved chemokine expression is most likely through activation of c-Jun. AP-1 sites have been reported to exist in the promoters of MCP-1 and MCP-3. Our data provide further evidence to demonstrate that JNK is not only important for mediating FFA-induced insulin resistance but also involved in FFA-induced expression of monocyte chemotactic factors in adipocytes.</p><p>Among the current therapeutic agents for treating type 2 diabetes, thiazolidinediones mainly improve adipose insulin sensitivity. Existing evidence indicates that thiazolidinediones have a potent anti-inflammation effect through repressing NF-&#x003ba;B activity at least in MNCs, suggesting that improved insulin sensitivity might be partially through its anti-inflammatory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). Rosiglitazone not only significantly reduced MCP-1, MCP-3, and MIP-1&#x003b1; expression in adipose tissue, it can also repress FFA-induced expression of the aforementioned chemokines around the peak expression time in adipocytes. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of thiazolidinediones is likely through both macrophages and adipocytes. Surprisingly, rosiglitazone only represses FFA-induced expression of MRP-1 and MRP-2 in vitro but not in vivo. Whether expression of MRP-1 and MRP-2 in vivo is under a different control mechanism compared with in vitro remains to be studied. Upregulation of multiple monocyte chemotactic factors via different mechanisms in obesity may render it difficult to completely deplete adipose macrophages through targeting an individual chemokine or receptor. It is noteworthy to point out that improvement of systemic insulin resistance has been observed in MCP-1, MIP-2&#x003b3;, and CCR2-deficient mice and in mice treated with a CCR2 antagonist, although adipose tissue macrophage content was only partially reduced. These results not only demonstrate that adipose tissue&#x02013;infiltrated macrophages play an important role for the development of obesity-related insulin resistance but also imply that reduction of adipose macrophage to a higher extent might be more beneficial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db07-1344_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db07-1344_db07-1344[1].suppl.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>H.X. has received a scientist development grant from the American Heart Association.</p><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.</p><p>We thank Dr. Jeffrey S.
