The FGFR protein structure is composed of three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The second and third immunoglobulin-like domains are the primary binding sites for ligands, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. There are 22 known FGFs that bind to the FGFRs to control the balance among migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival of a wide variety of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Normally, mesenchymal ligands FGF7 and FGF10 activate the FGFR2 IIIb isoform, whereas epithelial FGFs -2, -4, -6, -8, and -9 activate the FGFR2 IIIc isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>FGF binding to FGFR stimulates receptor dimerization, tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of signal transduction pathways. Activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38, ERK1/2, PI3 kinase-AKT pathway, PLC&#x003b3; pathway and other pathways vary depending on the cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. P38 as well as ERK1/2 play an important role in osteoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Raucci showed that AKT activation correlates with osteoblast differentiation. ERK1/2 and AKT have distinct effects in FGF-induced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. ERK1/2 is a primary mediator of FGF-induced proliferation and differentiation, while AKT is important for osteoblast survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It was also found that the PKC pathway mediates proliferation, differentiation, as well as cell-cell adhesion among osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Ossification of the majority of neurocranial sutures is an intramembranous process. The two major midline sutures in mice are the interfrontal (corresponding to the human metopic suture) between the frontal bones and the sagittal between the parietal bones. The two major transverse sutures include the coronal sutures between the frontal and parietal bones and the lambdoid sutures between the parietal and the interparietal (corresponding to the human squamous occipital) bones. These sutures have different tissue origins because the frontal bones are neural crest-derived and the parietal bones are mesoderm-derived with a tongue of neural crest between the two parietal bones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The normal growth and morphogenesis of calvarial sutures is dependent upon a balance between proliferation of osteogenic precursors within the sutural mesenchyme and differentiation to osteoblasts at the osteogenic fronts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Ossification of most of the cranial base and the long bones is an endochondral process. Mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes to form a cartilaginous template, which is replaced by osteoblast differentiation and bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The mouse cranial base consists of several bones including the presphenoid, basisphenoid, basioccipital, the ethmoid and the tympanic bullae of the temporal bones. The basioccipital and petrous portion of the temporal bones lack a neural crest contribution and are derived from mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. During both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, FGF/FGFR signaling regulates cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In humans, Apert syndrome is caused by gain of function mutations of FGFR2. Apert syndrome [MIM #101200] is a congenital condition characterized by craniosynostosis involving the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, midfacial hypoplasia and syndactyly of hands and feet. Among the calvarial sutures affected in the Apert syndrome patients, the coronal suture is most commonly involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Almost all cases of Apert syndrome are due to one of two mutations, each an amino acid substitution in adjacent residues, Ser252Trp (S252W) and Pro253Arg (P253R) of FGFR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Both mutations affect the highly conserved linker region between the immunoglobulin-like II and III domains and result in increased affinity and altered specificity of FGF ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. <italic>In vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>studies of fetal and postnatal sutural cells from Apert patients with craniosynostosis and either mutation demonstrated perturbations of proliferation, differentiation, and/or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Two mouse models of Apert syndrome containing the Fgfr2 +/S252W mutation, one outbred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and one inbred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and one outbred mouse model containing the Fgfr2+/P253R mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] have been reported. These mutant mice showed skull malformations with premature closure of sutures associated with abnormal osteogenic proliferation, differentiation and/or cell apoptosis. Their skull base and long bones showed growth retardation with abnormal proliferating and/or hypertrophic zone(s). The FGF/FGFR2 signaling pathway was studied in the outbred Apert mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

We compared the two mutant inbred mice on the same genetic background so that their phenotypes might more clearly exhibit the differential effects of the mutations without the added variation produced by varying backgrounds. Standard cellular and molecular techniques have been combined with precise 3D measures of craniofacial anatomy captured by HRCT to provide nonparametric statistical evaluation and qualitative comparisons of various aspects of the two models.</p><p>All surviving <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice were small in size at postnatal stages and had anomalies including abnormal domed-shaped skulls with decreased rostro-caudal length, increased height, and craniosynostosis. Synostosis of the coronal suture was commonly present in the mutant mice. These phenotypic features were in agreement with those in previously reported <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice that were outbred and generated from TC1 ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], which had a genetic background different from the R1 ES cells used to create the mice reported here. In our <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice, we noted additional abnormalities in the neurocranium with premature fusions of zygomatic process of the maxilla and the zygomatic bones, and fusion of the premaxillary-maxillary sutures. The inter-premaxillary suture, on the other hand, was patent at P0 in mutants and closed in the majority of wild-type mice. This may indicate a localized delay in the fusion of some sutures in <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice. Similar results were obtained for our <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>and <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice showed most of the characteristic skull features associated with Apert syndrome (MIM #101200). For example, the coronal suture closure, as presented in these mice, is the most common skeletal phenotype in Apert syndrome patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, similar to humans with Apert syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], the skulls of <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>and <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice are typically brachycephalic, relatively short along the anteroposterior axis and relatively wide. In addition, the midfacial retrusion and maxillary hypoplasia described in humans with Apert syndrome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] also occurs in Apert mice as measured by statistically significant reductions in all facial and palatal distances in the mutant mice relative to their littermate controls. Early fusion of the zygomatic-maxillary and the premaxilla-maxillary sutures most likely contributes to the midfacial retrusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Differences in the craniofacial phenotype of mice with Fgfr2 P253R and S252W mutations</title><p>Although the craniofacial phenotypes of the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>and <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice are generally similar, there were differences in the craniofacial region between our sample of <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>and the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice. <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mutant mice had less reduction of the maxilla and therefore demonstrated less midface hypoplasia and mandibular prognathism relative to <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mutant mice. The <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice also showed 50% less reduction of the total palate length compared to the affected palates of <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice. Further the suture between the horizontal plate of the palatine bone and the palatal shelf of the maxilla was patent in most of the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice and in at least half of the controls, but was prematurely fused in most of the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice.</p><p>These results are generally consistent with human studies showing differences that have been characterized as less severe craniofacial features in patients with the +/P253R mutation than in patients with the +/S252W mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Slaney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] analyzed 70 unrelated Apert syndrome patients with 25 having the P253R mutation and 45 with the S252W mutation and found that cleft palates were significantly less common in patients with the former mutation. They also quantified the severity of the craniofacial phenotype including maxillary hypoplasia by using a five-point preoperative severity score. The mean score was higher for the heterozygous S252W group than for the P253R group, although this difference was not significant. Yet, they found that all three very mildly affected patients had the P253R mutation, whereas the two most severely affected patients both had the S252W mutation. Von Gernet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] studied 21 patients, six with the P253R mutation and 15 with the S252W mutation. The craniofacial appearance of their patients with the dominant P253R mutation following surgery was better than those with the S252W mutations who had more pronounced midfacial and dental findings. Park et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] reported on 35 patients, nine with the P253R mutation and 26 with the S252W mutation, and showed that the cleft palates were less common among patient with the P253R mutation, but no statistical significance was demonstrated for other craniofacial features. The consistency of the craniofacial phenotypic differences between these two mutations in humans and mice suggest that the functional effects of the two mutations are indeed different. However, further morphological studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results.</p><p>Importantly, we found a few features including the lengths of nasal region and the anterior cranial base that were significantly more affected in the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>as compared to <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice. In a few cases of patients with Apert syndrome, the nasal and cranial base lengths were also noted to be reduced in radiographs, but their mutations were not analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. These results indicate that each mutation has differential effects on certain anatomical structures resulting in varying localized phenotypic differences between the two mouse mutants rather than one mutation causing generally more severe phenotypes. Differences in the maxilla, palate, nasal region, and anterior cranial base between the two mutant mice may be due to specific tissue origins or localized variations in expression of FGF/FGFRs with autocrine signaling, their differential binding to their receptors and activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Abnormal osteogenesis at the calvarial sutures and long bones in Fgfr2 P253R and S252W mice</title><p>Previous studies of human calvaria suggested abnormal proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts causes the Apert syndrome phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Some of these studies focused on postnatal suture samples from Apert syndrome patients with the P253R mutation. Fragale et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] observed that mutant osteoblasts had a lower proliferation rate, high alkaline phosphatase activity, increased mineralization and expression of noncollagenous matrix proteins. Baroni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] found abnormal differentiation with osteocalcin mRNA down-regulated and FGF2 secretion increased. Other studies were performed from cells derived from patients with the S252W mutation. Lomri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] showed normal cell proliferation and increased differentiation with elevated expression of alkaline phosphatase and type 1 collagen in calvaria cells derived from Apert infants and fetuses. Abnormal apoptosis has also been found in human osteoblasts with the FGFR2 S252W mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Premature apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes was found in the mutant compared to normal fetal suture of a 26 week fetus. Some of these findings are not consistent perhaps because of differences of culture conditions and difficulty in obtaining appropriate human samples from early embryonic studies.</p><p>In our <italic>in vivo </italic>mouse models, we observed consistent presynostosis or synostosis of the coronal sutures during development in both our <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>and <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice [present study and 34]. We found decreased proliferation, increased osteoblastic differentiation, accelerated bone formation and no obvious difference in apoptosis in mutant coronal sutures at late embryonic stages as compared to controls. At the osteogenic fronts, there are different cell types which perform different processes, our results showed that at the coronal suture, the numbers of BrdU labeled, proliferating cells are decreased, whereas the preosteoblasts marked by ALP and Runx2 staining are increased in the mutants, indicating the shift towards more advanced osteoblast differentiation and imbalance between proliferation and differentiation at E17.5 in the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup><italic>P253R</italic>/+ </sup>suture. Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and Holmes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] studied the coronal suture in the same <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Chen observed increased apoptosis from P1 to P8, postnatal stages. Because no significant changes in proliferation and differentiation were detected from E16.5 to P18, they suggested that the increased cell death/apoptosis might account for the premature fusion of the coronal sutures in the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Holmes reassessed coronal suture fusion in the same mouse model, they found that at E16.5 apoptotic cells appeared in the mutant coronal sutures, but were strictly limited to sites of osteoid contact between the frontal and parietal bones, but above this area they saw decreased proliferation in a more extended region. They suggested that apoptosis appeared to be a consequence rather than a cause of sutural fusion in <italic>Fgfr</italic><sup><italic>S252W</italic>/+ </sup>mice. Earlier at E12.5 they also examined the proliferation, and found a modest increase in the coronal suture. From E13.5 to E14.5 ectopic proliferation was observed in the basal area of the coronal suture, but not in the osteogenic fronts above this. They further found that, as fusion continues in the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup><italic>S252W</italic>/+ </sup>osteogenic fronts in the more apical area of the suture at E16.5, there is a significant decrease in proliferation possibly secondary to greater osteoblast maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Yin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] studied the coronal suture in their <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice. They showed increased osteoblast differentiation at late embryonic stages E16.5 and 17.5, but cell proliferation and apoptosis were not examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>We suggest, by combining our findings and those in the literature, that abnormal proliferation and differentiation in the coronal suture occurs primarily during the early embryonic stages and is followed by apoptosis at late embryonic and postnatal stages in both mutants, although there can be <italic>in vivo </italic>variation. We also found that long bone development was affected by abnormal osteogenesis at late embryonic stages in our two mouse models. Yin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] had observed abnormal chondrogenesis in the skeleton of <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>and <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice, respectively. We conclude that during prenatal stages, abnormal proliferation and increased differentiation of mesenchyme and the osteoblast/chondrocyte lineages in the developing coronal suture and limb are important in the mechanism leading to postnatal synostosis at sutures with apoptosis and to shortening of the limbs.</p><p>Our previously published study of <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice focused on the midline interfrontal defect and sagittal sutures from E16.5 to P1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We found increased proliferating cells and abnormal expression of the osteogenic markers. We did not find an obvious midline interfrontal defect in the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice at P0 as indicated by examination of micro-CT scan and histology, but Yin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] found a patent posterior frontal suture at P17. It is possible that this defect becomes more apparent with age or different genetic backgrounds. We found increased or abnormal cartilage formation in the mutant sagittal suture in our <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice, as did Yin et al. for their <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and in our <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These observations further support the fact that both Fgfr2 +/P253R and +/S252W mutations affect chondrogenesis in Apert syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Also notable is the dissimilarity in the pathogenesis between the developing mutant midline and coronal sutures, which may in part be caused by alterations in ligand availability and signaling pathways involved local to specific sutures of different tissue origin.</p></sec><sec><title>Abnormal signaling in osteogenesis of the skull in mice with Fgfr2 P253R mutation</title><p>Molecular studies using Apert mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] found enhanced expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in visceral tissues and increased level of phosphorylated AKT and p38 in calvarial tissues of <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice. In <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice, ERK1/2 was the only activated pathway reported in the bone marrow cell cultures from long bones. Given that calvarial sutures and the cranial base have different bone ossification processes of intramembranous or endochondral bone formation, respectively, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the neurocranium and base and compared these results with those published for the bone marrow cells of the long bones from the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice. Our studies showed increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 in the skull, particularly in the neurocranium of the <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice. These results indicate that in both intramembranous and endochondral bone ossification in Apert syndrome, the activation of MAPK pathways, in particular p38, may play an important role in the abnormal proliferation and differentiation in craniosynostosis of <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice. Yin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] revealed that inhibition of ERK1/2 activity partly prevented the premature closure of coronal sutures and recovered the retarded endochondral ossification of cultured mutant femurs. They speculated that some other pathways may also be involved in the pathogenesis of the skeleton phenotypes resulting from the Fgfr2 mutation. Based on the consistent finding of activation of the p38 pathway in calvarial tissues of our <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice and in <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], we propose that the p38, as well as ERK1/2 pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of skeletal abnormalities induced by the Fgfr2 P253R mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>Insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying craniosynostosis models</title><p>The cellular mechanisms underlying craniosynostosis have been investigated using other mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

Detailed descriptions of these landmarks are provided on the landmark collection page at the Richtsmeier laboratory website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.getahead.psu.edu/landmarks_new.html">http://www.getahead.psu.edu/landmarks_new.html</ext-link>. Previous analyses by our lab have demonstrated the accuracy and precision of this data collection method for CT scans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. To minimize measurement error, two data collection trials were completed for the images of each specimen and the averages of those trials were used for analyses.</p><p>Differences in skull shape were evaluated using the 3D landmark coordinate data and Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis or EDMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] that converts 3D landmark data into a matrix of all possible linear distances between unique landmark pairs. For each sample, an average form is estimated using the linear distance data and differences in three-dimensional size and shape are statistically compared as a matrix of ratios of all like linear distances in the two samples. For our study, three statistical comparisons of shape and size were completed. The first two comparisons assessed the intra-model differences, comparing mutant mice within each model with their normal littermates, that is <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>mice with normal littermates and <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup>mice with normal littermates. The third comparison evaluated inter-model differences obtained in the two intra model comparisons. This was accomplished by statistically comparing <italic>Fgfr2 </italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>-with-wild-type littermate contrasts to <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W </italic></sup><italic>-</italic>with- wild-type littermate contrasts using already established methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. The null hypothesis for each comparison is that there is no difference in shape between groups (or no difference in shape contrasts). For each linear distance, a ratio between the average value of that distance in each group is computed. A value of 1 indicates that the two groups are similar for that measure; whereas a value significantly greater or less than 1 shows that they are different. Confidence intervals for the null hypothesis of similarity in shape are estimated from 100,000 pseudo-samples generated from the data using a non-parametric bootstrapping algorithm. For each linear distance the null hypothesis is rejected if the 90% confidence interval produced from the bootstrapping method does not include 1.0. Rejection of the null hypothesis enables localization of differences to specific landmarks and linear distances.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical, TUNEL, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assays</title><p>For 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, pregnant mice were injected with a 10 mg/ml solution of BrdU (Sigma) at 100 &#x003bc;g/g body weight 2 hours before sacrifice. Skull sutures and long bones, sectioned as above, were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series. The immunohistochemical assays for BrdU were performed using the BrdU In-Situ Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) and VECTOR M.O.M Immunodetection Kit (Vector Laboratories). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Cell proliferation was analyzed by counting the number of BrdU-positive cells to total cells with hematoxylin-stained nuclei in a defined area, including the osteogenic fronts and intervening sutural mesenchyme from four mutant and four littermate controls of at least two litters. The ratios in mutant and wild-type embryos were compared by Wilcoxon test. Immunohistochemical staining for Runx2 was performed using rabbit anti-Runx2 antibody (Sigma). The TUNEL assay was done using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (Roche Applied Science) to detect apoptotic cell death by light microscopy. ALP staining was carried out as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

The plasmids were linearized and antisense and sense single-stranded RNA probes were generated using T7, T3 or SP6 RNA polymerase with digoxigenin (Roche).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein preparation and western blotting</title><p>Calvaria skull and skull base were separately isolated by microdissection from E17.5 embryos from at least three different litters of each mutant <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>P253R </italic></sup>and <italic>Fgfr2</italic><sup>+/<italic>S252W</italic></sup>. These tissue samples were homogenized in T-PER<sup>R </sup>Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific) using a pellet pestle motor homogenizer (Kontes). Protein concentration was determined with Pre-Diluted Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Freshly isolated protein was loaded in equal amounts and resolved on a 4-15% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were electrotransferred to PVDF membrane (Biorad), incubated with the specific antibodies, and were visualized by ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (Amersham). To assure consistency in technique, western blot analysis was performed independently at least twice for each protein sample. The antibodies used were against Fgfr2 (SC-122; Santa Cruz); phospho-ERK1/2 (#9101, Cell Signaling Technology), total ERK (#9102), phospho-AKT (#9217), total AKT (#9272), phospho-p38 (#9211), total p38 (#9212), phospho-PKC&#x003b1; (#9375, Cell Signaling Technology), total PKC&#x003b1; (#610107, BD Transduction Laboratories&#x02122;); and &#x003b2;-actin (Sigma). The levels of protein expression were quantified using the Alpha Innotech Image Analysis System and normalized relative to the expression of the control, &#x003b2;-actin. The comparison of protein levels were calculated by taking a ratio of the normalized phosphorylated protein level to total protein level of the mutant to wild-type. To compare the median phosphorylation ratio of mutant samples to wild-type (ratio = 1), the one-sample Wilcoxon test was used. Statistical significance was assigned at P &#x0003c; 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS/STAT software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
