Swimming motility consists of individual cell movement in liquid medium or soft semisolid agar, whereas swarming is a coordinated cellular behaviour leading to a collective movement on semisolid surfaces. It is known that swimming motility can be influenced by several types of environmental stress. In nature, environmentally induced DNA damage (e.g. UV irradiation) is one of the most common types of stress. One of the key proteins involved in the response to DNA damage is RecA, a multifunctional protein required for maintaining genome integrity and the generation of genetic variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The ability of <italic>E. coli </italic>cells to develop swarming migration on semisolid surfaces was suppressed in the absence of RecA. However, swimming motility was not affected. The swarming defect of a &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>strain was fully complemented by a plasmid-borne <italic>recA </italic>gene. Although the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells grown on semisolidsurfaces exhibited flagellar production, they also presented impaired individual movement as well as a fully inactive collective swarming migration. Both the comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells grown on a semisolid surface and the motility of <italic>lexA</italic>1 [Ind-] mutant cells demonstrated that the RecA effect on swarming does not require induction of the SOS response. By using a RecA-GFP fusion protein we were able to segregate the effect of RecA on swarming from its other functions. This protein fusion failed to regulate the induction of the SOS response, the recombinational DNA repair of UV-treated cells and the genetic recombination, however, it was efficient in rescuing the swarming motility defect of the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>mutant. The RecA-GFP protein retains a residual ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity but does not perform DNA strand exchange.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The experimental evidence presented in this work supports a novel role for RecA: the promotion of swarming motility. The defective swarming migration of &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells does not appear to be associated with defective flagellar production; rather, it seems to be associated with an abnormal flagellar propulsion function. Our results strongly suggest that the RecA effect on swarming motility does not require an extensive canonical RecA nucleofilament formation. RecA is the first reported cellular factor specifically affecting swarming but not swimming motility in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The integration of two apparently disconnected biologically important processes, such as the maintenance of genome integrity and motility in a unique protein, may have important evolutive consequences.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Motility is an important bacterial niche colonization factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], thus many bacterial species are motile by flagellar rotation. In <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>flagella propel bacteria swimming in liquid medium or in semisolid agar media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In response to chemotactic external signals, <italic>E. coli </italic>is able to direct its swimming movement towards a microenvironment that is optimal for its growth and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. When the conditions for swimming become adverse <italic>E. coli </italic>develops a different program for swarming motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In many bacterial species this flagella-driven coordinated motility is mediated by cell-cell communication mechanisms such as quorum sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, this bacterial migration activity is an intrinsically surface-linked phenomenon, leading to a change from an individual to a collective "social" behavior that allows the rapid exploration and colonization of surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Several environmental and nutritional factors promoting swarming behavior in some bacterial species such as <italic>Proteus mirabilis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>Serratia liquefaciens </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>Serovar Thyphimurium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] have been described. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, however, the chemical and physical factors involved in swarming migration are still to be characterized. By contrast, although the relationship between several types of environmental stress and bacterial motility has been well studied in swimming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], their effect on swarming motility has been poorly explored.</p><p>Bacteria need to cope with different types of stress in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], environmentally induced DNA damage (e.g. UV irradiation) being a common one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The relationship between DNA damage and colonial motility has not been previously addressed. RecA is a protein with a central role in DNA stability and repair under stress conditions leading to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. RecA has multiple functions affecting different cellular processes, such as genetic recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the rescue of stalled or collapsed replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and the replication of damaged DNA through translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) by DNA polymerase V (pol V) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Moreover, it is a key component for LexA self-cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These processes require the interaction of RecA with single-stranded (ss)-DNA forming a helical nucleoprotein filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we describe a previously unsuspected role for RecA in swarming, but not swimming motility in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The RecA control of swarming motility represents a novel basic RecA role under proliferating conditions beyond its pivotal activities in situations that lead to DNA damage. Our results indicate that this RecA effect on collective swarming migration is possibly mediated through an operative RecA mode requiring neither SOS-induction nor extensive canonical RecA-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>RecA is required for <italic>E. coli </italic>swarming but not swimming motility</title><p><italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 MG1655 strain growing on LB-glucose harnessed with 0.5% Difco agar exhibits a vigorous flagella-driven swarming migration, developing a robust colonial pattern associated to this type of motile collective behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). While performing experiments designed to study the response of <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 to DNA-damage stress, we unexpectedly observed that <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 deleted for the <italic>recA </italic>gene was impaired in its ability for swarming migration. This prompted us to study other <italic>recA</italic>-defective strains and we observed that all of them showed identical behaviour. The isogenic MG1655 strains lacking the <italic>recA </italic>gene, JMG1655 &#x00394;(<italic>srlR-recA</italic>)<italic>306</italic>::Tn<italic>10 </italic>(here, &#x00394;<italic>recA306</italic>) or JMG518 &#x00394;<italic>recA-518::kan </italic>(here, &#x00394;<italic>recA518</italic>), were severely impaired in their ability to migrate over semisolid agar surfaces, with a defective outward colonial expansion. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> shows the swarming colonial pattern of the JMG1655 (&#x00394;<italic>recA306</italic>) strain. To learn whether the absence of RecA was responsible for the defective swarming migration, we carried out complementation experiments. The plasmid pRecA-Htg, harboring an <italic>E. coli recA </italic>wild-type gene that encodes an N-terminal histidine-tagged RecA protein (termed here as RecA-Htg variant), and the empty vector (pCA24N, vector control without <italic>recA</italic>) were introduced by transformation into the wild-type and both &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>(&#x00394;<italic>recA306 </italic>and &#x00394;<italic>recA518</italic>) strains. Similar results were obtained with MG1655 &#x00394;<italic>recA306 </italic>or &#x00394;<italic>recA518 </italic>derivate strains, hence the results are only shown for one of them: the &#x00394;<italic>recA306 </italic>derivative. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows that the swarming motility of the JMG1655 &#x00394;<italic>recA306 </italic>strain harboring the plasmid pRecA-Htg formed a colonial pattern similar to that of the wild-type MG1655 strain. By contrast, the strain harboring the pCA24N vector was severely impaired in swarming. The ability of the RecA-Htg variant to complement the swarming defect indicates that the lack of RecA is the sole cause of the motility defect in the <italic>recA </italic>mutant strain. This result also demonstrated that the engineered RecA variant (RecA-Htg) protein used in our experiments was capable of promoting the swarming motility process.</p><p>Swimming motility is another well-known <italic>E. coli </italic>flagella-driven motility mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. To test whether RecA is also involved in the control of this individual motility process, we examined the swimming ability of the JMG1655 &#x00394;<italic>recA306 </italic>(pCA24N) and JMG1655 &#x00394;<italic>recA306 </italic>(pRecA-Htg) strains. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> shows that the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>mutant only had a slightly reduced swimming colony size. This small difference may be due to the additional time that the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>mutant takes at the start of swimming colony expansion, compared to the wild-type strain. However, the speed of the swimming advance was similar in both strains (data not shown). This is consistent with normal flagellation, cellular size, and the individual movement of both swimming cell types (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that RecA is unnecessary for swimming, although it is absolutely essential for swarming motility.</p></sec><sec><title>The RecA effect on swarming motility is not restricted to the <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 strain</title><p>The ability of <italic>E. coli </italic>strains to swarm on semisolid surfaces was initially described by Harshey and Matsuyama in 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and has been studied intensively in the RP437 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To know whether the effect of RecA on swarming motility was specific to the strain MG1655, both the swarming and swimming motility behaviour of the RP437 and RP437 &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] strains were assayed. The swarming capacity of the RP437 &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>strain was severely impaired when compared to the wild-type RP437 strain. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> shows that the negative effect produced by the <italic>recA </italic>deletion on the swarming motility of the RP437 strain was almost fully restored by the introduction of the pRecA-Htg plasmid. As in the case of JMG1655 &#x00394;<italic>recA306</italic>, swimming motility was not affected by the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These findings indicate that the effect of RecA on swarming motility on "Difco" semisolid surfaces is not restricted to MG1655. Examination of the swarming colonial patterns of JMG1655 (pRecA-Htg) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and RP437 &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>(pRecA-Htg) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) also revealed that, under our experimental conditions, swarming of strain RP437 was not as active as that of strain MG1655. In addition, we also observed that when RP437 and MG1655 strains were inoculated together on swarming plates, the MG1655 swarming migration overtook the RP437 swarming ability on semisolid Difco agar surfaces, under the conditions employed in this study (G&#x000f3;mez-G&#x000f3;mez and Bl&#x000e1;zquez, unpublished results). On the basis of these observations, we decided to use the MG1655 strain as a model for the study of the RecA effect on swarming motility in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Finally, by a simple visual observation of the colony advance edge of both the wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>strains, we can rule out any effect of RecA on the production of slime because the slime that normally surrounds the colony periphery was, apparently, similar in both cases (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The RecA effect on swarming motility does not require SOS induction</title><p>RecA functions as a key component of the regulatory system controlling the induction of the SOS response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The <italic>E.coli </italic>LexA protein represses the transcription of over 40 "SOS response genes", the SOS regulon, including <italic>lexA </italic>itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The RecA interaction with ss-DNA unveils its coprotease activity (RecA*) that facilitates self-cleavage of the LexA repressor, with a subsequent deregulation of the SOS response genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in an exquisite proportionally-tuned response adjusted to the level of DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>To address whether one or more components of the SOS system could be the direct effector(s) promoting swarming motility, comparative transcriptome expressions between the <italic>recA+ </italic>and &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells, sampled from the edge of colonies grown on swarming plates, were performed by DNA microarray analysis. The obtained results (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) indicated that the transcriptional profile of genes belonging to the SOS regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] were identical in both cases. In addition, an MG1655 derivative, harboring the chromosomal <italic>lexA1 </italic>[Ind-] allele, encoding a well characterized LexA protein resistant to the RecA stimulated LexA self-proteolysis, thus preventing the induction of the SOS response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], was found to be fully proficient in swarming motility (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the ability of <italic>E. coli </italic>to perform swarming migration on semi-solid surfaces does not require the induction of the SOS response.</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>strain grown on swarming agar does synthesize flagella yet shows a non-motile colony leading edge without any swarming motion</title><p>Optical microscopy was used to determine whether &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells showed defective individual and/or collective movements. Wild-type cells extracted from the swarming colony edge showed a vigorous and rapid individual movement when suspended in an LB liquid drop. However, &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells showed a very slow movement. Direct observation of the leading edge of the swarming colonies indicated that the wild-type colony edge exhibited a vigorous and very rapid convective and collective cell movement, with swirling patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast, the leading edge of the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>swarming colonies presented a completely resting edge colony (see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). This deficient collective movement of the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>strain, leading to a defective colony pattern development, could possibly be due to the absence or damage of the flagella. To test this hypothesis, flagella were stained in both the wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells. A total of 200 cells from each strain (10 to 20 different fields) were visualized (see Methods). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> shows a typical wild-type swarming cell with five or six peritrichous flagella. A total of 159 (79.5%) MG1655 <italic>recA</italic>+ cells and 150 (75%) MG1655 &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>(pRecA-Htg) cells were similar to the one shown in the figure. The &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>preparations contained abundant flagella, yet appeared disconnected from the cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), thereby indicating that &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells have the ability to synthesize flagella. More than 99% (199 out of 200) of the MG1655 &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>(pCA24N) cells were similar to those shown in the figure.</p><p>This result is additionally supported by a comparative DNA microarray analysis between the <italic>recA</italic>+ and &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells grown on semisolid surfaces. This analysis showed that both chemotaxis and flagellar genes related with <italic>E. coli </italic>motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] had similar expression levels in both genetic backgrounds (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the impaired production of flagella is not responsible for the lack of swarming motility of &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells. All together these results suggest that the non-motile behavior of the individual &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells may be due to the impaired flagellar propulsion function necessary to drive the swarming migration process.</p></sec><sec><title>RecA-GFP complementation assays under different proliferating conditions: segregation of RecA functions</title><p>RecA is a multifunctional protein that is involved in DNA recombination, DNA double-strand break repair, induction of the SOS response, SOS mutagenesis and the repair of stalled replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These are, in all cases, functions that depend on RecA-ssDNA nucleofilament formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To gain further insight into the involvement of RecA in swarming motility, we took advantage of the construction of a RecA-green fluorescent protein fusion (RecA-GFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our reasoning was that this fusion protein could lose its ability to generate the RecA filament formation because of the bulky GFP portion. The ability of the RecA-GFP chimera to complement the defects of the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>strain in growth, viability, SOS induction, UV sensibility, genetic recombination and swarming motility was compared to that of the RecA-Htg variant. No significant differences between MG1655 <italic>recA</italic>+ harboring pRecA-Htg, pRecA-GFP or pCA24N (empty vector) in growth, UV survival, viability and genetic recombination were observed. Thus, for simplicity, the complementation behavior of plasmids pCA24N, pRecA-Htg and pRecA-GFP in the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>background refers to the strain MG1655 <italic>recA</italic>+ (pCA24N) as a wild-type control. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> show the results of these rescue experiments with both protein variants and several important results can be extracted from them.</p></sec><sec><title>Swarming motility</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> shows that the RecA-GFP variant was able to complement the swarming motility defect of &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>cells to a level similar to the one obtained with the RecA-Htg variant. Direct observation of the swarming colonies' leading edge (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) additionally demonstrated that this variant restored the collective movement completely to a level similar to the wild-type strain (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Several observations rule out any effect of the GFP moiety of the RecA-GFP protein fusion in swarming motility. Firstly, the pCA24N plasmid, employed as a control vector in our experiments, encodes the GFP protein; however it did not complement the swarming defect of the <italic>recA </italic>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Secondly, another different RecA-GFP protein fusion construction encoded in the chromosome of the <italic>E. coli </italic>SS3041 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], which retains an important residual activity promoting UV survival, genetic recombination, and SOS induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], showed defective swarming, although normal swimming motility was observed under our conditions (data not shown). Thus, although the biochemical activities associated to the RecA-GFP protein constructed by Renzette <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] remain to be studied, it seems that: (1) the GFP moiety of the RecA-GFP protein is not involved in the rescue of the swarming defect, and (2) the plasmid-borne RecA-GFP employed in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and the RecA-GFP protein fusion harbored in the <italic>E. coli </italic>SS3041 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] were different with respect to its effect on swarming motility, suggesting a structural difference between both fusion proteins. However, the possibility that the differential behaviour in swarming motility is due to a gene dosage effect cannot be ruled out.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic recombination</title><p>RecA is essential for genetic recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

However, the RecA-GFP protein was unable to complement the defect in SOS induction. By contrast, the RecA-GFP protein was fully inactive in rescuing the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>antibiotic sensitivity phenotype, as the size of the norfloxacin inhibition halo for the GW1030 &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>(pRecA-GFP) strain (4.0 &#x000b1; 0.2 cm) was as large as that corresponding to GW1030 &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>(pCA24N) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).</p><p>Thus, by using the RecA-GFP fusion protein we have been able to segregate the RecA function on swarming promotion from the other RecA functions.

The RecA-Htg and RecA-GFP proteins were purified and biochemically characterized. ATP binding induces RecA assembly on ssDNA and ADP induces RecA disassembly from DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, ATP hydrolysis is an indirect measure of RecA protein binding to ssDNA, and under most condition the rate of ATP hydrolysis correlates to the amount of RecA bound to ssDNA. The RecA, RecA-Htg or RecA-GFP catalyzed ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis was assayed using half-saturating protein concentrations (1 monomer/10 nucleotides) in buffer C containing 20 mM NaCl and 2 mM ATP (see Methods). The rate of RecA and RecA-Htg-mediated ATP hydrolysis increased during the first 30 min after binding to ssDNA, reaching levels similar to those observed in the wild-type RecA protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In the absence of ssDNA, ATP hydrolysis by wild-type RecA, RecA-Htg or RecA-GFP was just above the background (data not shown).</p><p>The ATPase activity of the RecA-GFP variant was 8 to 10-fold lower when compared to the RecA-Htg variant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) or wild-type RecA protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The presence of increasing concentrations of RecA-GFP slightly enhanced ATPase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). A modification of the pH in the reaction mixture exerted either a negative effect (1.8-fold reduction) at pH 8.0 or a positive effect (1.5-fold increase) at pH 6.0 where RecA binds double stranded (ds) DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (data not shown). The ATPase activity of RecA-Htg or RecA-GFP variants was strongly inhibited by prebound SSB to ssDNA (data not shown). Therefore, it is improbable that we are measuring the activity of a possibly contaminating ssDNA-dependent ATPase.</p><p>If long nucleoprotein filaments are to be formed, the inherent rate of extension of the RecA filaments during assembly should be faster than the end-dependent disassembly. We have shown that RecA-GFP catalyzes ATP hydrolysis less efficiently than RecA-Htg or wild-type RecA protein and assumed that RecA-GFP might promote end-dependent disassembly at a very low rate and perhaps, under these conditions, long nucleoprotein filaments could be formed. To address this hypothesis, the wild-type RecA or the variants RecA-Htg or RecA-GFP (1 &#x003bc;M) were incubated with circular ssDNA in the presence of 1 mM ATP&#x003b3;S and the reaction visualized by electron microscopy. As observed for RecA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], the RecA-Htg-ssDNA complex shows an extended helical conformation in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Under standard conditions, using 1 &#x003bc;M RecA-Htg, 8&#x02013;16 nucleoprotein filaments per field were observed (data not shown). However, under identical conditions, we have failed to detect long RecA-GFP nucleoprotein filaments on circular ssDNA in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S after analysing more than 20 different fields (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). Only RecA-GFP blobs were observed even in the presence of 4 &#x003bc;M RecA-GFP (C. M. and R. Lurz, unpublished results). Therefore, we can conclude that quite probably the GFP moiety inhibited the RecA nucleation step in RecA-GFP filament formation.</p><p>Under typical assay conditions, ATP acts in combination with RecA or its RecA-Htg variant to promote pairing and strand exchanges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. RecA-GFP, however, failed to promote strand exchange when using a circular ssDNA and a <italic>Kpn</italic>I-linearized homologous dsDNA.</p><p>Overall these biochemical data are consistent with the results obtained from <italic>in vivo </italic>genetic recombination experiments (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In combination, the results of genetic complementation and biochemical assays presented in the previous sections strongly support the notion that the RecA-GFP protein, although proficient in promoting swarming motility, does not have the capacity to promote both SOS induction and homologous recombination, activities requiring an extensive canonical RecA-ssDNA filament formation. However, the possibility that a residual localized RecA-GFP short filament unable to reach a sufficient level to induce the SOS could be responsible for this activity in swarming cells cannot be ruled out. A short RecA-GFP filament formation could explain the residual <italic>in vivo </italic>genetic recombination observed in the &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>(pRecA-GFP) strain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we present experimental evidence supporting the fact that the RecA protein, described as the prototypic member of the evolutionarily-conserved RecA/RAD51 family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], is required for <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 swarming but not swimming motility. The RecA protein plays a key role in recombinational DNA repair and genetic recombination processes via its biochemical activity of pairing and exchanging DNA between two homologous chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. By forming an active filament on ssDNA, RecA controls the induction of the SOS response, promotes the generation of the SOS-induced DNA polymerase V (polV) active complex (UmuD'<sub>2</sub>C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and furthermore the RecA filament has the ability to interact with polV in <italic>trans </italic>to stimulate its activity on translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), a SOS mutagenesis pathway, in response to chronic DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The results presented here expand on our knowledge of the physiological processes affected by this important protein and reveal a hitherto unknown role for RecA in the <italic>E. coli </italic>physiology: the promotion of swarming motility. Although it has been described that <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>Serovar Typhimurium mutant strains with LPS defects are differentially affected in their abilities to swarm and swim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], RecA is the first reported cellular factor that specifically affects swarming but not swarming motility in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>At least two models could explain the RecA requirement for swarming motility. In the first one, RecA interacts with one or several cellular component(s) expressed (or activated) during the swarming differentiation process, but not during swimming motility. This model implies that RecA could influence the expression of a certain gene(s) in swarming cells, however, the results of our transcriptome analysis indicated that the expression of a hypothetical component(s) in swarming cells seems to be a RecA-independent process, because RecA does not influence gene expression in swarming cells. This is consistent with the observation that RecA-GFP fails to induce the SOS response, although it does promote swarming motility. In the second model, RecA may undergo a "modification" (e.g posttranslational) to reach an activated form that allows swarming motility.</p><p>Regardless of the molecular mechanism behind RecA-dependent swarming motility, RecA must interact with an unknown cellular target(s) to promote this motility. Recent global protein interaction network experiments in <italic>E. coli </italic>revealed a direct physical interaction between the RecA and the CheW protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The CheW protein is a cytoplasmic linker of the chemotactic signal transduction system that couples the membrane chemoreceptors to the intracellular cytoplasmic phosphorylation cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This cascade controls the direction of flagellar motor rotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which is an essential component in the mechanical control of the chemotaxis system on swarming motility in <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serovar Typhimutium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that a RecA-CheW physical interaction, active in swarming but not in swimming cells, could be the direct link between RecA and swarming motility.</p><p>All functions so far described for the RecA protein are related to their fundamental biological role in the maintenance of genome integrity and variability. These functions require the formation of an extensive RecA-ssDNA nucleofilament complex as a central molecular scaffold that drives the RecA activities in homologous recombination, SOS induction and SOS mutagenesis. The RecA-ssDNA nucleofilament formation is a very orchestrated, dynamic and precise molecular process during DNA strand exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In addition, the cells have several molecular modulators, such as the SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, RecFOR proteins, DinI, RecX and RdgC influencing RecA's filament extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It is widely accepted that under most conditions the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the RecA protein correlates with the amounts of RecA bound to ssDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Although the RecA-GFP protein used in our studies retained a residual ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity, it completely lost its DNA strand exchange ability, a process requiring an extensive RecA-ssDNA nucleofilament formation. Despite this impaired <italic>in vitro </italic>biochemical activity, RecA-GFP is proficient in complementing the defective swarming motility of a &#x00394;<italic>recA </italic>mutant. We consider that the segregation of the RecA effect on swarming motility from those that require the formation of long canonical RecA-ssDNA (or RecA-dsDNA) nucleoprotein filaments, favor the hypothesis that the formation of these long filaments is not strictly necessary for swarming motility. Alternative models, including a RecA activity independent of any DNA interaction cannot, however, be discarded.</p><p>The integration of two, apparently disconnected, biological processes, such as the maintenance of genome integrity and motility in a unique protein, may have important evolutive consequences. Adaptive biological evolution, relying upon the existence of genetic variability in a population of organisms generated by mutation and recombination and upon the natural selection of genotypes with better fitness, also depends on the capacity of the fittest to colonize the niche. The existence of a molecule able to receive signals informing on the status of genome stability and transmitting them to cellular systems, which in turn permit rapid spatial migration, could be an important factor for improving the colonization of a new ecological niche. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the RecA protein could be the molecule that links those apparently independent molecular processes, permitting bacteria to manage the different cellular processes in a coordinated manner, influencing their adaptive capacity.</p><p>An important goal in future research will be to determine the ultimate molecular entity and the operative molecular mechanism through which RecA allows swarming motility in <italic>E. coli </italic>to proceed.

Fractions containing RecA-Htg protein were recovered and loaded onto a Hydroxyapatite (HA) column (BioRad, Hercules, CA) equilibrated with the same buffer containing 200 mM NaCl. The column was washed with buffer A and eluted with a linear 100 to 200 mM K<sup>+ </sup>phosphate gradient containing 200 mM NaCl. Fractions containing RecA-Htg were recovered and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 50% glycerol) containing 200 mM NaCl and stored at -20&#x000b0;C. <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 cells bearing pRecA-GFP plasmid were grown to middle exponential phase at 30&#x000b0;C and expression of the RecA-GFP protein was induced for 200 min by adding IPTG. Cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer A (50 mM K<sup>+ </sup>phosphate pH 7.5, 10 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) containing 1 M NaCl, disrupted by sonication and centrifuged. The fraction of the RecA-GFP protein found in the supernatant was loaded onto a Niquel column equilibrated with the same buffer containing 1 M NaCl. The Niquel column was washed with a 10-column volume of buffer A containing 1 M NaCl and 20 mM imidazol and eluted with buffer A containing 1 M NaCl and a 50 to 80 mM imidazol gradient. Fractions containing the RecA-GFP protein were dialyzed against buffer B containing 1 M NaCl and loaded onto a HA column equilibrated with the same buffer. The RecA-GFP was eluted with buffer B containing 50 mM potassium phosphate and 1 M NaCl. Fractions containing RecA-GFP were recovered and dialyzed against buffer B containing 150 mM NaCl and stored at -20&#x000b0;C. The wild-type RecA protein was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (GE, Sweden). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method and expressed as mol of protein monomers.</p></sec><sec><title>ATPase activity measurement</title><p>Standard reactions were incubated for an indicated time at 37&#x000b0;C in buffer C (50 mM (Tris-HCl pH7.5, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 5% glycerol) containing 20 mM NaCl with circular 3,199-nucleotide pGEM ss-DNA (10 &#x003bc;M in nucleotides) and the indicated amounts of RecA-Htg or RecA-GFP proteins in a volume of 20 &#x003bc;l.
