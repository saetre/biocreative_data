Using a large collection of engineered mutations in this system, we show that these genes are required both for the growth of the kidneys and for their proper organization, such that mutations in some genes reduce the size of the organs, whereas mutations in others induce polycystic kidneys.

In the mouse, these <italic>Hox</italic> genes are organized in four separate chromosomal clusters and are expressed along the body axis in a spatio-temporal manner that corresponds to their physical positions along the clusters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Because these four clusters were generated by large-scale duplications, <italic>Hox</italic> genes are classified into thirteen groups of paralogy, based on both sequence similarities and respective positions along the clusters. These genes have long been recognized as important regulators of developmental processes, in particular due to their function in specifying regional identities along the anterior to posterior body axis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In the course of tetrapod evolution, <italic>Hox</italic> gene functions were co-opted in a number of developmental processes including the patterning of the limb bud and the formation of several organ systems, where they positively or negatively regulate the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation, adhesion, proliferation and apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The intricate overlapping expression patterns and structural homology of these gene products underlie many instances of pleiotropy and functional redundancy, phenomena that have substantially complicated their functional analysis. Further untangling of this complex genetic system is expected to yield novel insight into important developmental mechanisms. For example, in the developing mammalian urogenital system, simultaneous expression of about thirty <italic>Hox</italic> genes has been reported, and some traces of colinear regulation became apparent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The early molecular events underlying kidney morphogenesis are functionally well described, and are initiated by reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal signaling interactions between the epithelium of the ureteric bud (UB) and the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. In mouse, the UB forms during embryonic day 10 (E10) as an epithelial protrusion in the more posterior part of the Wolffian duct. The nearby mesenchyme (future MM) condenses and signals to induce branching morphogenesis of the UB, whereas signals emanating from the UB in turn promote MM survival and activate nephrogenesis. The induced MM expands, becomes a polarized epithelium through the intriguing process of mesenchyme to epithelium transition and forms vesicles that elongate and differentiate to form the nephrons. Molecular genetic analyses in mice have revealed a complex network of regulatory interactions that control kidney organogenesis, involving transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins and secreted molecules &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In this context, few studies have addressed the function of <italic>Hox</italic> genes during kidney morphogenesis, except for paralogy group 11; while single mutations in any of the <italic>Hox11</italic> group gene results in normal nephrogenesis, double or triple mutations lead to either absent, or rudimentary kidneys, with a severely reduced number of nephrons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

We show that the most striking kidney defect at birth is a failure of UB branching morphogenesis, leading to kidney hypoplasia associated with early postnatal death. This defect correlates with a gain of expression of the posterior <italic>Hoxd12</italic> gene in developing kidneys. Interestingly however, defects reminiscent of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) were also observed, yet exclusively in mutant mice carrying a deletion of more anterior <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes like <italic>Hoxd9</italic> and <italic>Hoxd8</italic>. Finally, the distinct functions of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes in kidneys correlate well with their specific expression in the MM or UB, respectively. In this context, we use some additional mutant strains to provide evidence for the presence of putative global enhancer and silencer elements, which define and coordinate the expression pattern of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes in developing kidneys.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Multiple Kidney Defects in <italic>HoxD</italic> Cluster Deficiency</title><p>As several <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes are expressed during kidney development, multiple modes of functional redundancy or compensatory mechanisms may remain easily hidden in single gene inactivation experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

On the other hand, the absence of anterior gene functions, including that of <italic>Hoxd9</italic> and <italic>Hoxd8</italic>, lead to the development of polycystic kidneys, likely resulting from the activation of the BMP/GDF apoptotic signaling pathway in epithelial tubules. Finally, this work suggests a model whereby global regulatory sequences, located on the same side of the cluster, define the allocation of particular <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes either to mesenchymal cells, or to epithelial parts of the developing kidney, due to their respective genomic position within the gene cluster.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Posterior <italic>Hox</italic> Genes Are Important Regulators of Kidney Morphogenesis</title><p>A high proportion of <italic>Hox</italic> genes are expressed in both human and mouse kidneys &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030232-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; and several reports have pointed to an important role for these genes during renal development.
