The first causative gene identified encodes microcephalin (MCPH1), a protein implicated in DNA damage signaling via ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jackson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alderton et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, the clinical features of MCPH1 syndrome patients resemble those of Seckel syndrome, another microcephalic disorder that can be caused by mutations in <italic>ATR</italic> or defective ATR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O'Driscoll et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderton et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that mutations in <italic>pericentrin</italic> (<italic>PCNT</italic>), resulting in the loss of PCNT from the centrosome, also cause Seckel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Griffith et al., 2008</xref>). PCNT-Seckel cells, like ATR-Seckel cells, show defects in ATR-dependent G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint control. This finding is further supported by the recent description of <italic>PCNT</italic> mutations in microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II), a microcephalic disorder in which growth restriction is thought to be the consequence of mitotic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rauch et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, it has been shown that MCPH1 prevents premature entry into mitosis and speculated that loss of PCNT might prevent centrosomal recruitment of the checkpoint kinase Chk1, an ATR target that controls initial activation of cyclin B&#x02013;Cdk1 at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alderton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">L&#x000f6;ffler et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Griffith et al., 2008</xref>). Activation of cyclin B&#x02013;Cdk1 is the key event required for the initiation of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nurse, 1990</xref>). Cdk1 and cyclin B accumulate at the centrosome during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailly et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">1992</xref>), where initial activation of the cyclin B&#x02013;Cdk1 complex occurs in late prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jackman et al., 2003</xref>). The accumulation of active cyclin B&#x02013;Cdk1 within the nucleus shortly thereafter irreversibly commits the cell to mitosis. Therefore, regulation of cyclin B&#x02013;Cdk1 activity at the centrosome is critical for controlling both cytoplasmic and nuclear mitotic events. During unperturbed cell cycles, activation of cyclin B&#x02013;Cdk1 at the centrosome is mediated by Cdc25B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Souza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., 2004</xref>), which itself is positively regulated by phosphorylation at S353 by aurora A and inhibited by Chk1-mediated S230 phosphorylation at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutertre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">L&#x000f6;ffler et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schmitt et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To directly address whether loss of Chk1 from centrosomes constitutes a mechanism for premature entry into mitosis in microcephaly syndromes, we examined both primary patient-derived cells from individuals with <italic>MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup></italic> (MCPH1 syndrome) and <italic>PCNT<sup>3109G&#x0003e;T</sup></italic> (MOPD II) mutations as well as cells treated with MCPH1- and PCNT-specific siRNAs, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Chk1 is lost from centrosomes in both MCPH1- and PCNT-deficient cells</title><p>First, we analyzed whether deficiency of either MCPH1 or PCNT impacts on the abundance of Chk1 at centrosomes in human cells. Although immunofluorescence microscopy analysis with a monoclonal antibody against Chk1 revealed a pronounced centrosomal staining in both U2OS and control lymphoblastoid cells (LBCs), Chk1 levels were reduced at centrosomes in MCPH1 and PCNT siRNA&#x02013;treated U2OS cells as well as in primary MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup> and PCNT<sup>3109G&#x0003e;T</sup> cells from patients with primary microcephaly or MOPD II, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810159/DC1">Fig. S1, A&#x02013;C</ext-link>). This effect was independent from the cell cycle stage, as Chk1 levels were reduced to a similar extent in both cells containing a single centrosome, reflecting G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase, and two centrosomes, reflecting S/G<sub>2</sub> phase, respectively (Fig. S1 C). Virtually identical results were obtained when a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Chk1 was used (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Chk1 levels are reduced at centrosomes in both MCPH1- and PCNT-deficient cells.</bold> (A) Normal, MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup>, and PCNT<sup>3109G&#x0003e;T</sup> LBCs as well as U2OS cells transfected with luciferase- (as control [siLUC]), MCPH1-, or PCNT-specific siRNA were costained with mouse anti-Chk1 (red) and rabbit anti&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin (green) antibodies and analyzed by confocal microscopy.

Although comparable protein amounts were loaded, the centrosome preparations from MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup> and PCNT<sup>3109G&#x0003e;T</sup> cells contained reduced levels of Chk1 as compared with centrosomes from control LBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The loss of Chk1 from centrosomes in MCPH1- and PCNT-deficient cells was not attributable to a general shortage of cellular Chk1 in these cells, as whole cell lysates from control and MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup> or PCNT<sup>3109G&#x0003e;T</sup> LBCs contained almost identical Chk1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Likewise, we have described previously that Chk1 is lost from centrosomes during mitosis, although total cellular Chk1 levels are not reduced during this phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., 2004</xref>). On the basis of these combined in situ and biochemical analyses, we conclude that in MCPH1- and PCNT-deficient cells, Chk1 is lost from centrosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>MCPH1 targets Chk1 to the centrosome</title><p>How Chk1 is recruited to interphase centrosomes during unperturbed cell cycles remains unknown.

To test for this possibility, we first confirmed that endogenous human MCPH1 localizes to interphase centrosomes in control but not MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup> LBCs or MCPH1 siRNA&#x02013;treated U2OS cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody raised against an N-terminal fragment (1&#x02013;267 aa) of MCPH1 (CCU.M1; see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and Fig. S1 D). Also, in contrast to MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup> LBCs, MCPH1 was detectable in centrosome preparations from control LBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

Similarly, immunoprecipitation of GFP-MCPH1 using an anti-GFP antibody led to coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous Chk1. In contrast to the loss of centrosomal Chk1 in MCPH1-deficient cells, the centrosomal levels of MCPH1 remained virtually unchanged in U2OS cells transfected with Chk1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>), which is analogous to what has been reported for Chk1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeffers et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we conclude that MCPH1 and Chk1 interact with each other and that MCPH1 targets Chk1 to the centrosome.</p></sec><sec><title>MCPH1-dependent recruitment of Chk1 to centrosomes is mediated by PCNT</title><p>As PCNT has an established role in targeting regulatory proteins to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diviani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2004</xref>), direct or indirect binding of Chk1 by PCNT might mediate the centrosomal localization of Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Griffith et al., 2008</xref>). To determine whether the loss of Chk1 from centrosomes in MCPH1-deficient cells is a consequence of a shortage of centrosomal PCNT, control and MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup> LBCs were immunostained for PCNT. In contrast to control LBCs, centrosomal PCNT signals were diminished in MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810159/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). Immunostaining of MCPH1 siRNA&#x02013; and mock siRNA&#x02013;treated U2OS cells with antibodies to PCNT led to similar results. Consistently, centrosome preparations from MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup> cells contained less PCNT as compared with control LBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Also, GFP-MCPH1 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous PCNT when transiently expressed in U2OS cells (Fig. S2 B).

Similar to immunofluorescence stainings, reduced levels of P-Y15-Cdk1 at centrosomes in MCPH1- and PCNT-deficient cells were not attributable to a general shortage of centrosomal Cdk1 in these cells, as centrosome preparations from control and MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup> or PCNT<sup>3109G&#x0003e;T</sup> LBCs contained almost identical Cdk1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>).</p><p>These findings suggest that MCPH1 or PCNT depletion&#x02013;induced loss of Chk1 from centrosomes leads to reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of both centrosomal Cdc25B at S230 and Cdk1 at Y15 and therefore to premature entry into mitosis. In agreement with these findings, it has been reported recently that human and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> MCPH1-deficient cells have low levels of total P-Y15-Cdk1 in S and G<sub>2</sub> phases, resulting in accelerated mitotic entry in MCPH1<sup>427insA</sup> LBCs and premature centrosome separation in <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alderton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunk et al., 2007</xref>).

After transfection with MCPH1-specific siRNA, PCC cells have an intact nuclear membrane as judged by lamin A staining, are P-S10&#x02013;histone H3 negative, and show no nuclear cyclin B1 accumulation, thereby demonstrating that they exhibit G<sub>2</sub> rather than mitotic characteristics.

After PCNT siRNA treatment, the frequency of cells dying out of mitosis was increased as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Forced immobilization of Chk1 at centrosomes leads to accumulation of MCPH1-deficient cells with premature chromosome condensation (PCC) in G<sub>2</sub> phase</title><p>MCPH1 deficiency leads to a striking elevation in G<sub>2</sub> phase&#x02013;like cells with PCC mediated by deregulated activity of nuclear condensin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Trimborn et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alderton et al., 2006</xref>). If MCPH1 indeed functions to locally regulate activation of Cdk1 via centrosomal targeting of Chk1, then specific interference with centrosome-associated Chk1 should alter the impact of MCPH1 depletion on the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition. To address this issue, we took advantage of a U2OS clone conditionally expressing GFP-Chk1 fused to the PCNT-AKAP450 centrosomal-targeting (PACT) domain of AKAP450, an immobile protein of the pericentriolar matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gillingham and Munro, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., 2004</xref>). In these cells, forced immobilization of wild-type Chk1 to centrosomes impairs activation of centrosome-associated Cdk1 and thereby entry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kr&#x000e4;mer et al., 2004</xref>). When parental U2OS cells as well as wild-type and kinase-dead versions of GFP-Chk1-PACT&#x02013;expressing cells were treated with an MCPH1-specific siRNA, 34.0 &#x000b1; 5.5% of wild-type but only 14.2 &#x000b1; 3.9% of kinase-dead GFP-Chk1-PACT&#x02013;expressing cells and 16.2 &#x000b1; 2.3% of parental U2OS cells showed a PCC phenotype 72 h after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>). These findings suggest that down-regulation of MCPH1 induces premature entry into mitosis via depletion of the centrosomal pool of Chk1. Forced immobilization of Chk1 at the centrosome prevents cell cycle progression into mitosis, leading to accumulation of cells with PCC in G<sub>2</sub> phase.</p><p>In addition to <italic>MCPH1</italic>, three other primary microcephaly genes have been identified, <italic>ASPM</italic>, <italic>CENPJ</italic>, and <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bond et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bond and Woods, 2006</xref>). Their protein products have a centrosomal localization in common and are required for centrosomal function. Therefore, a unifying theme for primary microcephaly of genes functioning in the process of cell division has been proposed. However, in contrast to mutations in <italic>ATR</italic>, <italic>MCPH1</italic>, and <italic>PCNT</italic>, which can reduce both body and brain size, effects of <italic>ASPM</italic>, <italic>CENPJ</italic>, and <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic> mutations are restricted to the brain, presumably by acting specifically on neurogenic mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bond et al., 2005</xref>). Our data provide evidence that the recruitment of Chk1 to centrosomes depends on both MCPH1 and PCNT during unperturbed cell cycle progression. In MCPH1 syndrome and MOPD II, which result from mutations in <italic>MCPH1</italic> and <italic>PCNT</italic>, respectively, loss of Chk1 from centrosomes leads to unscheduled entry into mitosis. Consequently, loss of regulatory restraints on the initial activation of cyclin B&#x02013;Cdk1 at the centrosome might be a common final path in microcephalic disorders with reduced body size, thereby explaining for the first time why seemingly unrelated genetic defects result in a common human disease phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>U2OS were maintained in DME with 10% FCS.
