In addition it is essential for bacterial viability since mutations in it result in a cold-sensitivity phenotype for growth. We have previously cloned the nusB gene and shown it to code for a 14,500-Mr protein. Here we present the primary DNA sequence of the nusB gene. From the sequence we deduce that it codes for a slightly basic protein (21 basic as opposed to 20 acidic amino acids) composed of 139 amino acids with a cumulative 15,689-Mr. The predicted N-terminal amino acid sequence as well as the overall amino acid composition agrees well with that of the purified protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4977"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4978"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4979"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0176.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4980"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4981"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4982"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4983"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4984"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4985"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
