These two isoforms are produced through differential splicing, but their regulation has not been investigated. In this study, we show that rat <italic>Nkg2d</italic> has the same splicing pattern as that of the mouse, and we mapped transcriptional start sites in both species. We found that the splice forms arise from alternative promoters and that the NKG2D-L promoter is derived from a rodent B1 retrotransposon that inserted before mouse&#x02013;rat divergence. This B1 insertion is associated with loss of a nearby splice acceptor site that subsequently allowed creation of the short NKG2D isoform found in mouse but not human. Transient reporter assays indicate that the B1 element is a strong promoter with no inherent lymphoid tissue-specificity. We have also identified different binding sites for the ETS family member GABP within both the mouse and rat B1 elements that are necessary for high-promoter activity and for full <italic>Nkg2d-L</italic> expression. These findings demonstrate that a retroelement insertion has led to gene-regulatory change and functional diversification of rodent NKG2D.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The activity of natural killer (NK) cells against potential target cells is regulated by a balance of inhibitory and activating receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). One of the most well-studied activating receptors is NKG2D, which recognizes ligands often upregulated in response to stress, such as during virus infection or malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A recent study using NKG2D deficient mice has demonstrated that expression of this receptor inhibits some types of cancer in spontaneous tumour models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), indicating a significant role for NKG2D in tumour surveillance. The importance of NKG2D is also indicated by the existence of specific viral evasion mechanisms directed against it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>In the mouse, NKG2D is expressed on NK cells, activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, NKT cells, &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cells and activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Alternative splicing produces two different isoforms of NKG2D in mouse, one of which contains 13 extra amino acids at its N terminus (NKG2D-L) compared to the shorter isoform (NKG2D-S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). NKG2D-S can bind and signal through the adapters DAP10 and DAP12, while NKG2D-L can only bind DAP10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Due to differential downstream pathways, DAP12 is capable of initiating cytotoxic as well as cytokine release responses while DAP10 can only activate an NK cell to kill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express only DAP10, whereas NK cells express both DAP10 and DAP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Resting mouse NK cells express very little NKG2D-S, but expression of this isoform is induced upon NK cell activation, enabling signalling through NKG2D-L/DAP10, NKG2D-S/DAP10 and NKG2D-S/DAP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). These expression patterns of DAP10/12 and of mouse NKG2D isoforms result in functional diversification of this receptor. In mouse NK cells, NKG2D is strongly activatory, stimulating NK cells to attack bound targets. However, in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, NKG2D serves only a co-stimulatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The situation in human is slightly different. The single human NKG2D isoform resembles mouse NKG2D-L and also only binds DAP10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). Not surprisingly, NKG2D stimulation using monoclonal antibodies in human NK cells initiates a cytotoxic response but not cytokine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). As in the mouse, NKG2D/DAP10 only acts in a co-stimulatory manner in human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>While many studies have concentrated on the function of NKG2D, surprisingly little is known about its transcriptional regulation. Here we show that the spliced isoforms of mouse NKG2D arise from the use of alternative promoters. We focus on the promoter for mouse NKG2D-L and show it to be derived from a rodent-specific B1 retrotransposon with a functional binding site for GABP, a member of the ETS family. We propose that insertion of this retrotransposon, through unusual donation of a polymerase II promoter, led to the alternative splicing patterns maintained in both mouse and rat that, in turn, result in functionally distinct NKG2D isoforms. These results document an intriguing example of how retrotransposons can affect the evolution of host gene expression and, more specifically, lend insight into the transcriptional regulation of NKG2D.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>LNK (mouse NK cell line), EL4 (mouse T cell line) and RNK16 (rat NK cell line) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100&#x02009;U/ml penicillin, 100&#x02009;U/ml streptomycin, 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M 2-ME and 2&#x02009;mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine.

An orthologous SINE element is found in the rat (termed B1Mur3) but not in the human, <italic>NKG2D</italic> gene. The two B1 elements differ by a 5&#x02032; 3-bp deletion in the mouse B1 and an internal 30-bp insertion in the rat B1, but are otherwise 84.4% identical (aligned using MAFFT, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/online/server/index.html">http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/online/server/index.html</ext-link>). Although annotated differently in mouse and rat by Repbase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.girinst.org/repbase/index.html">http://www.girinst.org/repbase/index.html</ext-link>), these B1 elements represent the same ancestral insertion. To avoid confusion, we will refer to the mouse element as mB1 and the rat element as rB1. While there are two mouse NKG2D isoforms arising from transcripts that alternatively encode exon 1a or 1b, there is only one human NKG2D protein from transcripts that always include exon 2, which is homologous to mouse exon 1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The situation in rat is less clear. A rat mRNA initiating near the region homologous to mouse exon 1b has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, a rat genomic sequence that is highly similar to mouse exon 1a is found upstream of this initiation exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). To see if rat <italic>Nkg2d</italic> splicing patterns resemble those of the mouse, we undertook RT&#x02013;PCR on Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rat splenic total RNA. Primers were designed in rat sequences orthologous to mouse exons 1a and 4. Sequencing of the amplified product shows that a rat transcript indeed includes the region orthologous to mouse exon 1a and splices out the previously reported exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Furthermore, the splice sites used are the same as that of the mouse. We herein designate the exon found by RT&#x02013;PCR as rat exon 1a and the alternative exon as rat exon 1b. As was done with the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), we also designate the isoform arising from exon 1a as rNKG2D-S and the isoform arising from exon 1b as rNKG2D-L. These results suggest that the <italic>Nkg2d</italic> splicing pattern in rat is identical to that of the mouse and that both species harbour a SINE element at the 3&#x02032; end of intron 1. In comparison, human does not have the SINE element and splicing of <italic>NKG2D</italic> always gives rise to one protein. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><italic>NKG2D</italic> genomic organization and splicing pattern.

Primers were designed in mouse exon 6 and rat exons 4 and 6. We found two start sites within the mB1 element using C57BL/6 splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Two additional sites were found using LNK, a mouse NK cell line that expresses both NKG2D isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Surprisingly, while one was located in the SINE element, the other lies downstream of the ATG1 start codon. Theoretically, this transcript could still be translated into NKG2D-S using the ATG2 start codon in exon 2. Further experiments are needed to verify this possibility. With RNA from Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rat spleen, we found a dispersed pattern of TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C).

To examine this possibility, we tested the mouse and rat SINE elements and the upstream region in luciferase reporter assays. Various fragments including and excluding mB1 and rB1 were cloned into pGL4B. These constructs were transiently transfected into LNK cells and promoter activity was measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, both mB1 and rB1 elements by themselves display promoter activity. A fragment 391-bp upstream of mB1 shows no appreciable activity. Paradoxically, when this upstream region combined with mB1 was tested, the promoter activity was abolished. However, if this fragment was separated from mB1 in the same construct, only a small decrease in promoter activity was observed compared to a construct with mB1 alone. These results demonstrate that transcription not only starts within the SINE elements, but also that they contain polymerase II promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>The mouse B1 element contributes a functional GABP-binding site</title><p>Transposable elements harbouring functional enhancer sites are not uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

Curated results containing only mouse-specific, hematopoietic or lymphocyte-related transcription factors are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A. To determine which of these sites contribute functional regulatory elements, luciferase reporter assays were carried out using truncated fragments of mB1 in pGL4B, transiently transfected in LNK cells. Surprisingly, fragments that truncate the 3&#x02032; end of mB1 display much higher activity than the entire 109-bp mB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). A 77-bp fragment that eliminates the predicted TCF1, CEBP&#x003b2; and YY1-binding sites at the 3&#x02032; end shows 40-fold activity over basal. Of note, this piece removes an ATG at the +78 position. When the 77-bp segment was further 3&#x02032; truncated to 50&#x02009;bp, eliminating two more TCF1 and one GATA3 binding site, 97-fold activity over basal was observed. Luciferase activity only dropped to 3-fold over basal when 20&#x02009;bp were deleted at the 5&#x02032; end of the 50-bp segment. This construct deletes a GABP, an AP1 and a GATA3-binding site. These results suggest that the essential transcription factor-binding sites are within the first 20&#x02009;bp of mB1. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Identification of transcription factor binding sites that contribute to <italic>Nkg2d-L</italic> regulation.

To determine if GABP is indeed binding to this mB1 element, EMSA were performed. When a DNA oligomer spanning the 5&#x02032; end of mB1 was incubated with LNK nuclear extracts, two complexes are clearly visible in EMSAs, labelled I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Complex I contains GABP, since it can be supershifted by anti-GABP&#x003b1; antibody. This complex is decreased or abolished using wild-type unlabelled oligomers in a dose-dependent manner (10-, 25-, 50- and 100-fold excess). Complex I is still clearly visible when unlabelled oligomers containing a mutated GABP site or with mutations in both the GABP and AP1 sites were used as competitors. The fact that these signals are lower compared to complex I without competitors is likely the result of non-specific competition at 100-fold excess. In agreement with the previous experiments, the oligomer did not seem to bind AP1. A competition assay using unlabelled oligomers with a mutated AP1 site did not produce any complexes. In addition, anti-AP1 antibody did not induce a supershift. The identity of complex II is currently unknown. It is possible that this complex contains GATA3, since the oligomer spans a GATA3-binding site. Furthermore, all mutant competitors were equally effective at abolishing this complex and neither anti-GABP nor anti-AP1 antibodies supershifted the complex. Taken together, these results suggest that GABP, but not AP1, is an important factor in transcription from mB1. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>GABP forms protein&#x02013;DNA complex within mB1 in EMSA.

Nonetheless, we wondered how many B1 elements in the mouse genome contain such sites and if there is evidence of these elements contributing to a regulatory network as has been revealed recently for other repetitive elements (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section). A bioinformatics scan of all potential GABP-binding motifs to see how many are located in B1 elements is impractical since the core binding sequence is short. We opted instead to compare the prevalence of GABP-site-containing B1 elements throughout the genome and those near promoters. A survey of all B1 elements (252&#x02009;832) in the mouse genome revealed that 4877 (1.93%) contain at least one GABP-binding site. For the elements (70&#x02009;804) that lie in a 10&#x02009;kb window centred around TSSs of all mouse RefSeq genes, we found 1240 (1.75%) to have at least one GABP-binding site.

To investigate this issue, we tested a 3&#x02032; truncated fragment of mB1 in pGL4B using the EL4 and NIH 3T3 cell lines. EL4 is a mouse T-lymphoblastoid cell line and NIH 3T3 is a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line. Neither cell lines express NKG2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The promoter activity of this construct in EL4 is comparable to that of LNK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).

The promoter for mouse and rat <italic>Nkg2d-L</italic> is a SINE retrotransposon with a functional GABP-binding site. Comparative genomics data suggest a complex evolutionary model. Since guinea pigs lack the orthologous SINE element, we believe the B1 inserted after the divergence of guinea pig from the mouse and rat subclade. The identified GABP-binding site in the mouse is not found in the consensus B1 sequence, likely emerging through mutation. This novel regulatory element may have allowed the SINE to mediate transcription of the long isoform of <italic>Nkg2d</italic> directly from exon 1b, lifting the selection pressure to maintain a splice acceptor signal at the intron1&#x02013;exon1b junction. The mutation of this splice acceptor site forces the transcript starting from exon 1a to splice directly to exon 2, thus creating NKG2D-S. The mutation and its consequences on splicing we have just described may apply to both mouse and rat. The only difference between the two species is the position of the acquired GABP-binding site. Thus, this study presents an interesting example of convergent evolution to achieve the same means in animals that share similar niches.</p><p>The 13 amino-acid difference at the N-terminus of the two isoforms results in differential adapter affinities: NKG2D-L binds only DAP10 while NKG2D-S binds both DAP10 and DAP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Signal cascades of these two adapters are reviewed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In essence, DAP12-coupled Syk and ZAP70 signalling are strongly stimulatory and initiate cytotoxic and cytokine release pathways. On the other hand, DAP10 signalling resembles co-stimulatory pathways of CD28 in T cells. While DAP10 can initiate NK killing response through Grb2/Vav1, it cannot trigger cytokine release. This is shown in the inability of anti-NKG2D treated, DAP12 knockout mouse NK cells to produce IFN&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Malarkannan <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) also showed that DAP12/Syk/ZAP70-dependent activation of PLC&#x003b3;2 leading to the Bcl10/NF&#x003ba;B pathway is absolutely essential to mouse NK cytokine production. Diefenbach <italic>et al</italic>. reported that while the long form of NKG2D is always expressed, the short form is only expressed after NK priming with IL-2 or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the two differentially expressed, signalling divergent splice forms provide the mouse and rat with beneficial functional flexibility in a context-dependent manner. In our model, we also believe that the losses of ATG1 in guinea pig and in cow are separate events of convergent evolution. The <italic>Nkg2d</italic> genes in these two animals likely produce only the short protein form. Indeed, Fikiri <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) has reported the characterization of a short NKG2D form in cow. Although the flexibility of signalling made possible to mouse and rat may not be present in guinea pigs and cows, NKG2D in the latter two can at least signal through DAP12 and may therefore be beneficial. Last, the loss of ATG1 in guinea pigs may also have lifted selection pressure for retention of the splice acceptor site, allowing it to mutate away.</p><p>Our results that repetitive elements aid in the regulation of an NK receptor gene resonate with findings that link an AluSx and a LINE L1M5 element to the regulation of a human NK inhibitory receptor: <italic>KIR3DL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Of particular interest is the fact that this AluSx SINE element also contains a binding site for an ETS member, ELK1. Removal of this SINE element abolished <italic>KIR3DL1</italic> distal promoter activity. The enrichment of transposable elements within immune genes has been noted before as a possible mechanism of rapid evolution and functional diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Our findings fit this model. While an Alu element may have contributed to the evolution of <italic>KIR3DL1</italic> by supplying the gene with regulatory elements, a B1 has managed to both provide regulatory signals and aid in the formation of a second, functionally distinct isoform of NKG2D in mouse and rat.</p><p>Recent ChIP-sequencing studies have shown that some classes of repetitive elements bind specific transcription factors and establish transcription regulatory networks on a genome-wide basis. Binding for the transcription factor p53 was shown to be enriched in LTR10 and MER61 elements of the endogenous retrovirus ERV1 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Bourque <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) further showed that ESR1, POU5F1-SOX2 and CTCF-binding sites are pervasive in MIR, ERVK and B2 repeats, respectively. Finally, Roman <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) described a new subclass of B1 element that harbours functional AhR and Slug-binding sites. Thus some classes of transposable elements are postulated to disperse specific control elements and drive regulatory expansion. We therefore questioned if B1 elements in the mouse genome may also be involved in the regulatory network of GABP. Since only human GABP ChIP-sequencing data is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and B1 is a rodent-specific SINE element, we took an <italic>in silico</italic> approach. Genomic distribution and GO analysis did not reveal signs of selective retention of B1 elements with GABP sites near promoters of any gene classes. Thus, there is presently no evidence for this transposon family acting as the foundation of GABP-regulatory networks. However, it is possible that other B1 elements do bind GABP <italic>in vivo</italic> and could regulate genes. A ChIP-sequencing experiment in mouse would be needed to address this possibility directly.</p><p>B1 elements evolved from the 7SL RNA gene, a small non-coding RNA species. As such, they are thought to be transcribed through an internal polymerase III promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The B1 element identified that regulates mouse and rat <italic>Nkg2d</italic> represents a novel source of polymerase II promoter signals. B2 elements, a close relative of B1 that evolved from tRNA, have been found to provide a polymerase II promoter to the mouse gene <italic>lama3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first instance that B1 elements are shown to also contain polymerase II promoters.</p><p>Presently, we cannot explain why promoter activity decreases when the mB1 element is combined with 391&#x02009;bp of upstream region. At least two non-mutually exclusive explanations are possible. First, the 391-bp fragment may contain an uncharacterized repressor. A search using TESS locates multiple transcription factor-binding sites. It remains to be seen if any of these are functional and bind negative regulators. However, the promoter activity of a construct containing mB1 decreases only slightly if the 391-bp fragment was inserted downstream of the reporter gene. This suggests that any repressor present on the fragment would be position dependent. The other possibility is that of chromatin effects. The reporter assays were conducted using a transiently transfected plasmid. This experimental system does not take into account the three-dimensional conformations or the degree of histone packaging of the DNA fragment in the context of the <italic>Nkg2d</italic> gene. It is possible that the suppressive effect of the 391-bp segment is not seen in the endogenous context.</p><p>The mechanisms that underlie the increased promoter activity with 3&#x02032; truncated mB1 are also unclear. Again, it is possible that the truncations removed repressor-binding sites. At least four sites found via TESS in the truncated regions bind transcription factors known to be both activating and repressing. Two sites can bind TCF1, a factor that is activating when bound to &#x003b2;-catenin but repressive when interacting with Groucho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). YY1 is a repressor when not interacting with E1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), while E12/E47 has been shown to act as a repressor to E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Whether any of these sites are functional remains to be shown. An additional possibility is the presence of an ATG sequence that is removed in all 3&#x02032; truncation constructs. Others have noted the possibility that ATG start codons can compete with reporter gene start codon and decrease reporter signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>The ETS member GABP was first implicated to regulate a range of house-keeping genes such as ribosomal protein genes and a cytochrome c oxidase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36">34&#x02013;36</xref>). GABP has also been linked to critical S-phase genes and cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Recently, a string of reports have shown that GABP plays an important role in immune functions. In the myeloid lineage, GABP is known to regulate the genes for integrin <italic>CD18</italic> as well as IgA Fc receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The effect of GABP in lymphocyte biology is even more prominent. GABP was recently shown to regulate Fc receptor &#x003b3; using monocyte, basophile and T cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In T cells, GABP bridges JNK/SAPK signalling and enhanced IL-2 expression when artificially stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). GABP is also known to enhance transcription of Fas, IL-16 and IL7 receptor &#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42 B43 B44">42&#x02013;44</xref>). Last, GABP deficiency leads to defective B cell development, presumably because GABP binds to regulatory regions of <italic>Pax5</italic> and <italic>CD79a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In this report, we link GABP directly to NK cells by showing its positive regulatory effects on mouse and rat <italic>Nkg2d</italic>.</p><p>ETS family members share highly similar binding sites. In a genome wide study, Hollenhorst <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) reported widespread co-occupancy of GABP, ETS1 and ELF1&#x02009;at promoters of human genes. We cannot rule out the possibility that the binding site we discovered bind these factors as well. GABP may compete with ETS1 or ELF1 for binding while all three may act synergistically to enhance <italic>Nkg2d-L</italic> transcription. This would reflect the <italic>CD18</italic> example, where GABP and PU.1 compete for binding sites but cooperatively activate the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Alternatively, these ETS members may not be competing but rather forming a complex in mB1. Physical interaction between the three GABP, ETS or ELF1 has not been described, but GABP has been shown to bind two other ETS members, ER71 and ER81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>).</p><p>While EMSA experiments showed robust binding of GABP to the B1 elements, knocking down <italic>Gabp&#x003b1;</italic> showed only a moderate decrease in <italic>Nkg2d-L</italic> transcript levels. This could be due to an incomplete knockdown of the transcription factor. We only achieved &#x0223c;70% silencing. The remaining GABP may be enough to sustain the observed <italic>Nkg2d-L</italic> expression. Another possibility is that GABP augments but is not absolutely required for <italic>Nkg2d-L</italic> expression. Other transcription factors that bind the B1 promoter may need to be silenced to see a more dramatic decrease to <italic>Nkg2d-L</italic> mRNA levels. Finally, similar ETS family binding motifs may allow other ETS members to bind the B1 element and compensate for the loss of GABP.</p><p>In mouse, NKG2D is known to be expressed only on NK cells, activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and some NKT and &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The fact that the mB1 promoter is capable of inducing reporter gene expression in NK, T and embryonic fibroblast cell lines leaves the question of NKG2D tissue-specific expression open. This is perhaps not surprising since GABP is a factor expressed in a broad range of tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). We can think of at least two ways that specificity of <italic>Nkg2d-L</italic> expression can be achieved. There could be additional enhancer sites that bind tissue-specific transcription factors we have not uncovered. Another possibility is epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation and histone modifications. Although the upstream regions of <italic>Nkg2d</italic> exons 1a and 1b are CpG poor, the expression of <italic>Ly49a</italic>, another NK receptor gene, was shown to correlate with methylation at a CpG poor promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). The expression of other NK receptor genes within the NK complex, <italic>Ly49g</italic> and <italic>Nkg2a</italic>, have also been linked to CpG methylation or histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). In addition, Santourlidis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) suggests in a recent report that euchromatic histone marks open up the KIR loci early in development but use DNA methylation to silence specific KIR members and establish clonal expression later on.</p><p>As more studies emerge, the differences between human and mouse NK cells are starting to be appreciated. While mouse NKG2D-L is the isoform that more closely mimics human NKG2D, there are notable discrepancies. NKG2D is expressed on human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells regardless of activation status in human, but only on activated mouse CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The receptor is also found on &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cells of intestinal intraepithelial origin in human but not mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Since human NKG2D does not harbour a SINE element at the same position as the mouse, the mode of regulation is unknown and likely different from mouse. Furthermore, nothing is known about the regulation of the mouse short isoform, which responds to IL-2 and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Dissecting the genomic and epigenetic factors that control these processes have therapeutic potential since it may allow the manipulation of an important NK-activating receptor involved in cancer immunosurveillance, viral clearance and autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Canadian Institutes of Health Research [15082 and 10825] and the Cancer Research Society, BC Cancer Agency; University of British Columbia Graduate Fellowship (to C.B.L.); Alexander Graham Bell Graduate Scholarship, The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (to Y.Z.).
