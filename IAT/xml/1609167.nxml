Upon recognition of specific avirulence factors the Pto kinase activates multiple signal transduction pathways culminating in induction of pathogen defense. The soluble cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase Pti1 is one target of Pto phosphorylation and is involved in the hypersensitive response (HR) reaction. However, a clear role of Pti1 in plant pathogen resistance is uncertain. So far, no Pti1 homologues from monocotyledonous species have been studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we report the identification and molecular analysis of four Pti1-like kinases from maize (ZmPti1a, -b, -c, -d). These kinase genes showed tissue-specific expression and their corresponding proteins were targeted to different cellular compartments. Sequence similarity, expression pattern and cellular localization of ZmPti1b suggested that this gene is a putative orthologue of Pti1 from tomato. In contrast, ZmPti1a was specifically expressed in pollen and sequestered to the plasma membrane, evidently owing to N-terminal modification by myristoylation and/or S-acylation. The ZmPti1a:GFP fusion protein was not evenly distributed at the pollen plasma membrane but accumulated as an annulus-like structure which co-localized with callose (1,3-&#x003b2;-glucan) deposition. In addition, co-localization of ZmPti1a and callose was observed during stages of pollen mitosis I and pollen tube germination. Maize plants in which ZmPti1a expression was silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) produced pollen with decreased competitive ability. Hence, our data provide evidence that ZmPti1a plays an important part in a signalling pathway that accelerates pollen performance and male fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>ZmPti1a from maize is involved in pollen-specific processes during the progamic phase of reproduction, probably in crucial signalling processes associated with regions of callose deposition. Pollen-sporophyte interactions and pathogen induced HR show certain similarities. For example, HR has been shown to be associated with cell wall reinforcement through callose deposition. Hence, it is hypothesized that Pti1 kinases from maize act as general components in evolutionary conserved signalling processes associated with callose, however during different developmental programs and in different tissue types.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Protein kinases in plants have been found to be involved in basic features of plant defense and plant fertilization. Increasing knowledge about the underlying molecular mechanisms suggests several parallels between both processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Plant-pathogen recognition has been studied extensively in tomato in which gene for gene resistance against certain <italic>Pseudomonas syringae </italic>pv. <italic>tomato </italic>strains is conferred by the serine/threonine kinase Pto. Upon recognition of bacterial avirulence factors, Pto acts in concert with the Prf protein resulting in the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways culminating in the induction of defense responses including HR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Several <underline>Pt</underline>o-<underline>i</underline>nteracting (Pti) proteins were identified to act in Pto-mediated signal transduction including the protein kinase Pti1 and three transcription factors (Pti4/5/6), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Pti1 (here referred to as SlPti1 for clarity reasons) is a cytoplasmic protein kinase capable of autophosphorylation <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and moreover also be phosphorylated by Pto. Tobacco plants over-expressing S1Pti show enhanced HR in leaves in response to avirulence factor treatment indicating a functional role of SlPti1 in Pto-mediated disease response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, a precise role of SlPti1 in plant pathogen resistance has remained unclear, owing to functional redundancy of different/additional Pti1 kinases. Three SlPti1 homologous kinases have been cloned from soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], sPti1a, sPti1b and GmPti1. The former two do not display <italic>in vitro </italic>autophosphorylation activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], whereas the latter, GmPti1, possesses autophosphorylation activity. <italic>GmPti1 </italic>gene expression was found to accelerate in response to wounding and salicylic acid treatment in seedling leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These findings suggest different Pti1-like kinases to possess different properties and biological functions in plants.</p><p>Cell-cell recognition and signal response reactions during plant-pathogen interaction are thought to be molecularly related to certain steps of plant reproduction, e.g. pollen-pistil recognition, compatibility reactions, and pollen tube growth. In studies of the genetic and molecular basis of pollen development and function more than 150 pollen-expressed genes from more than 28 species have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Classification of pollen expressed genes identified a high number of genes which are involved in signal transduction. Many of these genes encode putative protein kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Accordingly, leucine-<underline>r</underline>ich <underline>r</underline>epeat (LRR) Ser/Thr-type <underline>p</underline>lant <underline>r</underline>eceptor <underline>k</underline>inases (PRK) LePRK1 to 3 from tomato and several interacting proteins like KPP, LAT52 and LeSHY have already been attributed to signaling processes during pollen tube growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Mutations of a number of such gametophytically important genes often result in altered Mendelian segregation ratios due to an abolished or reduced transmission of a linked marker through pollen. Such genes include SEC8, ROP2, LIMPET POLLEN and TTD genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Most of these mutations cause obvious defects in the pollen grain and affect early stages of pollen development. In contrast, only few mutations are known that are transmitted through the male at low frequencies but cause no obvious defects in pollen morphology. These genes appear to affect more pollen competitiveness rather than development, e.g. TTD41 and ROP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study we report the identification and molecular analyses of four Pti1 kinases from maize (ZmPti1a, -b, -c, -d). The genes were expressed in different tissues and showed different subcellular localizations. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of three conserved Pti1 kinase subgroups in higher plants. Based on its sequence similarity, expression profile and subcellular localization ZmPti1b was suggested to be a putative SlPti1 ortholog. In contrast, the functional kinase ZmPti1a was specific to pollen and targeted to the plasma membrane, evidently owing to N-terminal acylation. ZmPti1a co-localizes with regions of callose deposition at stages of pollen maturation and germination. Silencing of the ZmPti1a gene resulted in a significant decrease in the competitive ability of pollen. These findings provide evidences of ZmPti1a to play an important role in influencing pollen fitness.</p><p>Our data further suggest that Pti1 kinases from maize act in various tissues and in different but mechanistically conserved plant response pathways which likely involve similar signals and/or signal transduction molecules.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Pti1-like kinases of maize</title><p>A 217 bp partial cDNA of <italic>ZmPti1a </italic>was cloned in a molecular approach with the aim to identify genes that are specifically expressed in maize pollen. Using this clone as a hybridization probe, two nearly identical 1.6 kb full-length cDNAs [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY554281">AY554281</ext-link>, GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY554282">AY554282</ext-link>] were isolated from a &#x003bb;-cDNA library of <italic>in vitro </italic>germinated pollen from <italic>white pollen </italic>(<italic>whp</italic>) plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] expressing the <italic>c2 </italic>gene. Both cDNAs probably represent different alleles of the same gene. The cDNA clone <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY554281">AY554281</ext-link> was further analyzed in this study. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY554281">AY554281</ext-link> contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 1122 bp, a 207 bp 5' untranslated region and a 304 bp 3' untranslated region including a poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>tail. The putative protein of <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY554281">AY554281</ext-link> is 374 amino acids (aa) in length with a molecular mass of 40.8 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

Therefore the cloned gene was named <italic><underline>Z</underline>ea <underline>m</underline>ays Pti1a (ZmPti1a)</italic>. The putative catalytic kinase domain of ZmPti1a starts approximately 75 aa after the first methionine and contains 11 canonical subdomains that are typical of serine/threonine kinases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). Out of the 15 invariant amino acid residues common to the majority of protein kinases, 13 were found to be conserved in ZmPti1a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A glutamine in subdomain III is substituted with a glutamate at position 115 and a conserved glycine in subdomain VII is substituted with an aspartate at position 222. Identical substitutions are present in the kinase SlPti1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] suggesting that <italic>ZmPti1a </italic>is also a functional kinase. A corresponding full-length genomic clone [Genbank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY554283">AY554283</ext-link>] spanning the entire transcribed region as well as 2.2 kb of the promoter of <italic>ZmPti1a </italic>was isolated from a &#x003bb;-phage library of the maize inbred LC by plaque screening and inverse PCR. The gene consists of 8 exons and 7 introns (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The nucleotide sequence of the deduced transcribed region was found to be nearly identical to the previously cloned cDNAs with the exception of line specific single nucleotide polymorphisms that changed three aa in less conserved regions of the deduced protein. An insertion of 9 bp resulted in the addition of three alanine residues in the c-terminus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The proposed translation start is located in exon 2. Hybridizing bands in genomic Southern analyses with probes specific for the promoter, 5'-UTR, ORF, and 3'-UTR of <italic>ZmPti1a </italic>correlated well with the predicted restriction patterns of the cloned gene and suggested that <italic>ZmPti1a </italic>is a single copy gene (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Similarity and predicted genomic structure of ZmPti1a</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Alignment of Pti1 kinases from maize with SlPti1 from tomato.

These sequences were found to be well conserved at the nucleotide level (41 to 52%), and even more conserved at the the protein level (71 to 78%). Corresponding ORF and 3' UTRs were amplified by RT-PCR from lines A188 and LC, respectively. All cloned sequences were identical to their corresponding EST with the exception of few line specific SNPs. Accordingly, these sequences were named <italic>ZmPti1b </italic>[Genbank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ647388">DQ647388</ext-link>], <italic>ZmPti1c </italic>[Genbank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ647389">DQ647389</ext-link>], and <italic>ZmPti1d </italic>[Genbank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ647390">DQ647390</ext-link>], respectively. An EST clone [Genbank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY708048">AY708048</ext-link>] which resembles <italic>ZmPti1c </italic>was annotated previously as a salt-inducible putative serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase (Zou <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data). Data mining of genomic BAC and MAGI sequences containing <italic>ZmPti1b </italic>and -<italic>d </italic>indicated that the corresponding genes possess nearly identical exon/intron structures as compared to <italic>ZmPti1a </italic>(data not shown). This indicates that the maize <italic>Pti1 </italic>gene family most likely originates from a single ancestor gene. Out of the four putative ZmPti1 kinases, ZmPti1b showed highest protein similarity to Pti1 from tomato (77% identity, 85% similarity). All ZmPti1 proteins possess conserved kinase catalytic domains. However, their N &#x02013; and C-terminal regions are highly variable and only some Pti1 kinases, including ZmPti1a, were predicted to contain a putative myristoylation signal at their N-termini. Such protein modifications in which the saturated fatty acid myristate is covalently but reversibly attached to an N-terminal Gly after co-translational cleavage of the first Met residue can fulfill several functions, e.g. mediating membrane association.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic relationship of ZmPti kinases</title><p>Phylogenetic comparison of ZmPti1 proteins from maize and putative Pti1 kinases from other plants indicated three major Pti1 subgroups in angiosperms (I, II &#x00026; III) with the known maize proteins belonging to subgroups II and III, respectively (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Each subfamily possesses a conserved N-terminal domain with a specific consensus sequence and consists of proteins from mono &#x02013; as well as dicotyledonous species. The N-terminal domains are rich in polar or aromatic residues and contain at least two conserved cysteines. Some of the kinases, e.g. ZmPti1a, sPti1a, sPti1b and At3g17410 are predicted to contain a putative N-terminal myristoylation signal. Gene organization of most of the Pti1 kinases from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>were found to be similar to that of <italic>ZmPti1a</italic>, i.e. 8 exons and a predicted translation start in exon 2 (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic analysis of ZmPti1 kinases</bold>.

Thus, it is feasible to speculate that the conserved N-terminal motifs of the different Pti1 subfamilies were retained during evolution because of specific relevant biological functions.</p></sec><sec><title>ZmPti1 proteins localize to different subcellular compartments</title><p>To investigate the subcellular localization of ZmPti1 proteins <italic>in situ</italic>, we transiently expressed in-frame coding sequences of ZmPti1 kinases fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in onion epidermal cells and in <italic>in vitro </italic>germinating pollen, respectively. When expressed under control of the ubiquitin promoter, ZmPti1a:GFP was targeted to the cell periphery suggesting ZmPti1a to localize to the plasma membrane (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This pattern was clearly different from that observed when GFP was expressed alone (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Association of ZmPti1a:GFP with the plasma membrane was also proven by confocal laser scanning microscopy (data not shown). Twenty-four amino acids of the ZmPti1a N-terminus were found to be sufficient to target GFP entirely to the cell periphery (Myr:GFP, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Truncation of twenty amino acids at the N-terminus of ZmPti1a abolished cell periphery targeting coinciding with cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of the fusion protein (&#x00394;ZmPti1a, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Identical results were observed for these three ZmPti1a fusion constructs when expressed ectopically in stably transformed maize plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and data not shown). These findings are in agreement with the assumption that ZmPti1a is targeted to the plasma membrane by N-terminal acylation, likely myristoylation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Transient expression of GFP fusion constructs</bold>.

Conjugation of myristate to proteins is absolutely dependent on a glycine residue at position 2.</p><p>Exchange of Gly2 or Cys3 with Ala prevented targeting of the ZmPt1a:GFP fusion to the cell periphery. Instead, GFP fluorescence appeared in the nucleus and as small cytoplasmic granules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref> and data not shown). The same GFP pattern was seen when both, Cys3 and Cys6, were replaced by Ala (data not shown).</p><p>Combined replacement of the adjacent amino acids Gly2 and Cys3 with Ala residues also caused nuclear localization. However, GFP fluorescence was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and no granules were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>).

This localization pattern might reflect an imperfect targeting or mistargeting of mutated ZmPti1a to membranes. Combined replacement of both adjacent residues in either one of the two motifs seems to strengthen mistargeting and completely prevents ZmPti1a membrane association.</p><p>ZmPti1b, c and d from maize and SlPti1 from tomato naturally lack a Gly2 residue that would serve as a potential target site of myristoylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

Expression of a SlPti1:GFP fusion protein confirmed the theoretical prediction however, additionally revealed a nuclear localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). A similar localization pattern was observed for the GFP fusion of ZmPti1b, which is the closest SlPti1-homologue from maize (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>).

Both of these sub-group III proteins contain a conserved N-terminal pair of arginine residues instead of a myristoylation signal. Taken together, ZmPti1 family members show a differential competence for plasma membrane association, evidently owing to their varying susceptibility to N-terminal myristoylation and/or S-acylation.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>ZmPti1 </italic>genes are expressed in different maize tissues</title><p>Gene regulation of the four identified members of the <italic>ZmPti1 </italic>family was studied during sporophytic and gametophytic development of maize.

In each case, pollen was harvested between 8 days before anthesis (dba) and anthesis from at least four independent transgenic lines.

Similar localization patterns were also observed in other tissues of the respective transgenic lines (data not shown). These results are consistent with the transient localization studies in onion epidermal cells. However, ZmPTI1a-GFP was not evenly distributed over the plasma membrane but accumulated in a specific region of the pollen. This pattern was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (data not shown) and was found to be present in pollen analyzed from all plants of the four independent transgenic lines. The pollen from plants over-expressing the Myr-GFP construct showed the same pattern as seen with the ZmPTI1a-GFP construct, however to a much weaker extent with a more even distribution of the protein. This indicated that the myristoylation signal along with the additional amino acids at the N-terminus can somewhat trigger this phenomenon. However, the entire ZmPTI1a protein seems to be essential for strong protein accumulation in a specific region of the pollen. A more detailed study of the morphology of this uneven localization of ZmPTI1a-GFP revealed that ZmPTI1a-GFP accumulation is closely associated with the pollen aperture (pore). GFP fluorescence was observed below the intine surface as an annulus-ring structure which has a stronger fluorescence in the inner ring of the annulus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D, E</xref>). It appeared to be localized either adjacent to or surrounding the pollen pore, the former case being more predominantly observed. The position of the adjacent annulus was found to be highly conserved at a 45&#x000b0; angle with respect to the pollen pore.</p><p>In search for an explanation of this pattern, we investigated the possibility of ZmPti1a:GFP being associated with (1,3)-&#x003b2;-glucan (callose) by conducting co-localization studies with aniline blue stained transgenic pollen. ZmPti1a:GFP pollen stained for callose showed a clear co-localization of callose and GFP with the same intensity pattern, i.e. having stronger fluorescence in the inner ring of the annulus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>). There was no co-localization of GFP with the callose plug present in the center of the pollen aperture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>). Identical (1,3)-&#x003b2;-glucan annulus-ring structures were observed in pollen from several wild type lines proving that the ring structure is not an artifact because of ectopic ZmPti1a:GFP expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J</xref> and data not shown). Some pollen showed distinct GFP localization in granules, plates and rings which also co-localized with (1,3)-&#x003b2;-glucan (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>).</p><p>Transgenic ZmPti1a:GFP pollen germinated on silks as well as on PGM. In germinating transgenic pollen the fusion protein was still sequestered at the plasma membrane adjacent to the pore with only a marginal fluorescence observed in the elongating tube. However, in rare cases, stronger fluorescence signals appeared in the pollen tube bordering callose plugs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6K</xref>). Plugs are regularly produced behind the tip as tubes elongate to isolate the cytoplasmic contents of the tube from the now empty pollen grain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6L</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ZmPti1a:GFP co-localizes with callose during pollen mitosis I</title><p>Various stages of pollen development were studied to further investigate the co-localization of callose and ZmPti1a:GFP.</p><p>The first indication of cell plate deposition in the equatorial region of the phragmoplast appeared soon after telophase during pollen mitosis I (PMI), taking the normal formation of a flattened aggregate of unit-membrane bounded vesicles. From the earliest presence of these vesicles, the equatorial zone reveals callose fluorescence. This is called the "Pre-callose stage". Thereafter, the equatorial zone continued to spread at the margins, following the out-spreading phragmoplast, until it forms a complete hemisphere. After the cell-plate formation, callose forms an arch-shaped layer which gradually reached the pollen wall, thus completely separating the generative nucleus from the vegetative nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> stage I; A, B). During the time interval when the generative cell abuts against the wall, callose occurs at the boundary of the cell, however, only on the side adjacent to the vegetative cell. This is called the "Callose stage" (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). Following this stage, a rather compact callose stage is observed which is further defining this cell-cell boundary (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> stage II; D, E). Soon after, the generative cell gradually changes from a lens-like to a spherical shape and moves towards the centre of the pollen grain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> stage III; G, H). This is the "Circular shaped prophase generative nucleus with nucleolus stage". In the "Spindle shaped prophase generative nucleus with nucleolus stage" it becomes spindle shaped (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> stage IV; J, K) following the disappearance of callose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Because ZmPti1a was found to be associated with callose deposition, pollen from heterozygous and homozygous T<sub>2 </sub>RNAi plants was stained for (1,3)-&#x003b2;-glucan.

Although ZmPti1 kinases from maize do not display high similarity at the nucleotide sequence level, the translated protein sequences are well conserved and the kinase domains maintain all functionally important residues. Accordingly, <italic>ZmPti1a </italic>was proven to encode a functional kinase capable of autophosphorylation and to be an <italic>in vitro </italic>target of kinase activities present in pollen and silk tissue. The presence of several Pti1-like kinases in maize is consistent with the observations of <italic>Pti1</italic>-genes belonging to a gene family in tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and three <italic>Pti1</italic>-related genes identified in <italic>Glycine max </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a wide diversity of Pti1 homologues in the plant kingdom, appearing to segregate into three sub-families mainly based on different N-terminal sequences of the kinases. These sequence regions were not only specific to the maize Pti1-kinases but were also highly conserved in putative Pti1 kinases of other monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. This gives rise to the conclusion that conserved N-termini in different Pti1 sub-families are evolutionary conserved indicating the functional relevance of this protein domain for proper biological function. Accordingly, studies with GFP fusions suggest that the variable N-termini are critical for different targeting properties of the four maize Pti1 kinases.</p><p>ZmPti1a contains an N-terminal putative myristoylation motif essential for plasma membrane targeting. N-myristoylation is known to confer reversible membrane association by enhancement of hydrophobic membrane-protein interactions. Such membrane associations are known to be further stabilized by reversible S-palmitoylation of Cys residues on positions 3 to 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. N-terminal Gly2 and S-palmitoylation at Cys4 and Cys5 of OsCPK2 has been shown to occur <italic>in vivo </italic>in maize leaf protoplasts with both acylations contributing to full membrane association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. ZmPti1a contains Cys residues in position 3, 6 and 7. Hence, it is likely that these motifs are subjects of fatty acylation and are necessary for proper plasma membrane targeting. Indeed, site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding residues partially abolished plasma membrane targeting of ZmPti1a:GFP.</p><p>Interestingly, dual S-acylation was shown to influence protein compartmentalization to specialized plasmalemmal microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that microdomain association is also responsible for the unequal distribution of ZmPti1a in the pollen plasma membrane.</p><p>N-terminal myristoylation is not only required for membrane targeting but could also participate in intra- or intermolecular interactions with proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. For instance, intermolecular myristate-protein interactions were shown to facilitate interaction between calmodulin and several proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Therefore, ZmPti1a plasma membrane targeting could also be achieved indirectly by interacting proteins. Evidence for ZmPti1a interacting proteins is provided by the magnetocapture interaction assays which suggested the existence of ZmPti1a phosphorylating kinases that bind and phosphorylate ZmPti1a <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Mutation of single amino acids which are putatively relevant for myristoylation or acylation results in partial nuclear location of ZmPti1a. Partial nuclear targeting was also observed for ZmPti1b and SlPti1. In both proteins Gly2 is naturally substituted by Ser2. Chehab <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] demonstrated that the N-terminally myristoylated calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) McCPK1 from <italic>Mesembrynathemum chrystallinum </italic>undergoes a reversible change in subcellular localization from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and actin microfilaments in response to reduction in humidity. Proteins of the CDPK family also contain variable N-termini and exhibit diverse subcellular localization patterns which reflect their participation in a variety of signaling pathways including HR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Reversible translocation and activity-dependent localization was also shown for other myristoylated proteins e.g. for the calcium-myristoyl switch proteins VILIP1 and VILIP3 in neurons and the flagellar calcium-binding protein FCaBP in <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus, it will be of profound interest to investigate if ZmPti1a can respond to specific signals by changing its subcellular localization and if putative downstream targets of ZmPti1a signaling reside inside the vegetative nucleus of pollen.</p><p>ZmPti1c and ZmPti1d did not contain myristoylation signals but conserved N-terminal pairs of arginine residues. GFP fusions of these sub-group III Pti1 proteins showed neither membrane nor nuclear targeting. This is in agreement with studies showing that arginine residues favor cytoplasmic displacement and reduce protein-lipid or protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>ZmPti1a co-localizes with plasma membrane regions responsible for callose deposition during pollen development and tube growth. Callose is a (1,3)-&#x003b2;-glucan with some 1,6 branches which not only is the major component of the pollen grain and pollen-tube wall but also plays a key role in pollen viability. Callose is deposited in the inner wall layer behind the growing pollen tube tip as well as in regularly formed plugs inside the pollen-tube. Callose is not specific to the male gametophyte but widely distributed among various cells and tissues. In sporophytic tissue, synthesis of callose is evidently achieved <italic>via </italic>a plasma membrane bound multi-subunit enzyme that is usually activated temporally by specific signals such as wounding, infection or other stress. Twelve callose synthase (CalS) isoenzymes have been identified in <italic>Arabidopis </italic>and each may be tissue-specific and/or regulated under different physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Putative regulatory subunits of the CalS complex are ROP1 GTPase, UGT1, annexin-like proteins (ANN) and sucrose synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, subunit composition and regulation of CalS complexes is far from being understood. Remarkably, Arthur <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] showed that ROP2, one of 9 known ROP GTPases from maize, also provides a competitive advantage to the male gametophyte. Heterozygous <italic>rop2::Mu </italic>mutants show a reduced transgene transmission by pollen similarly to what was observed with <italic>ZmPti1a </italic>RNAi plants. Although there is no experimental evidence yet, a biological link between ROP GTPases, CalS complexes and ZmPti1a may be speculated for pollen.</p><p>In accordance with the presence of multiple CalS complexes in plants, callose deposition is not only known to be involved in pollen development, pollen-tube growth and self-incompatibility but also in cytokinesis and pathogen defence. For instance, hypersensitive cell death induced in plants thwarts further advance of the pathogen is seen to correlate with callose deposition at and around the site of HR. This strengthens the cell wall to attenuate pathogen invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In tomato, SlPto and SlPti1 were shown to be involved in gene-for-gene resistance against <italic>Pseudomonas syringae </italic>pv <italic>tomato </italic>strains. Based on protein similarity and subcellular localization ZmPti1b was identified as a likely functional ortholog of SlPti1 in maize. A putative function of ZmPti1b in pathogene defense was supported by the observed induction of ZmPti1b transcript in <italic>Fusarium </italic>spec. infected kernels.</p><p>The diversity of callose function exemplified increasing evidence that plant responses such as male fertility, self-incompatibility, pathogenesis, symbiosis and wounding are based on highly related molecules and have evolutionary conserved signalling mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Our analyses of Pti1 kinases from maize support this model and suggested Pti kinases as conserved components of these different but related signal cascades in plants. Current studies are aimed at further elucidating the function of ZmPti1 genes in maize and in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we cloned and characterized four novel Pti1 kinases from maize. Expression patterns and subcellular targeting of the proteins were investigated. ZmPti1a encodes a functional serine/threonine kinase specific to pollen and is associated with plasma membrane regions responsible for callose deposition. ZmPti1a expression provides a competitive advantage to pollen. Thus its activity seems to be important for the proper biological function of pollen. In contrast, ZmPti1b is likely to be involved in maize pathogen responses. Considering the fact that pollen-sporophyte interaction and pathogen induced HR show certain similarities e.g. callose deposition and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx, members of the Pti1 kinase family are hypothesized to act as general components in evolutionary conserved signalling processes during different developmental programs and in different tissue types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and cultivation conditions</title><p>The maize lines used in this study were inbred lines LC (a color converted W22 line), A188, H99, and a flavonol-deficient conditionally male-sterile line "<italic>white pollen</italic>" (genotype: <italic>whp/whp</italic>, <italic>c2/c2</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]) and its corresponding fertile wild type line (<italic>whp/whp</italic>, <italic>C2/C2 </italic>or <italic>whp/whp</italic>, <italic>C2/c2</italic>).
