This process depends on the local production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other angiogenic factors. VEGF, a potent activator of angiogenesis, enhances collateral vessel formation and increases the permeability of the microvasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. VEGF expression is induced by high glucose levels and by hypoxia, and this growth factor plays important roles in both normal and abnormal angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Its levels markedly increase in the vitreous and aqueous fluids in the eyes of patients with PDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress is defined as a condition in which tissue damage results from an imbalance between an excessive generation of oxidant compounds and inadequate antioxidant defense mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. In diabetic eye disease, oxidative stress clearly plays a key role in the initial insult, and there is a strong relationship between oxidative stress and hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Oxidative stress has been correlated with an increased production of VEGF under in vitro conditions, and is thought to be involved in the upregulation of VEGF expression that occurs during diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. In addition, several studies involving animal and tissue culture models have indicated that oxidative stress is also a critical mediator in the transduction of the mitogenic effects of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>].</p><p>Antioxidant systems occur naturally within mammalian tissues, where they serve to protect against the harmful side effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by counteracting free radical reactions. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD), one of the SOD family enzymes, has the scavenging capacity of superoxide anion. The heparin-binding domain of EC-SOD anchors the protein to endothelial cell surfaces and to the extracellular matrix of blood vessels. Fattman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] have shown that EC-SOD activity is decreased in both anterior and posterior tibial arteries of diabetic patients. However, the relationship between the concentration of EC-SOD and its function in the vitreous body on PDR remains unclear.</p><p>The aim of our study was to investigate the alteration of EC-SOD concentration in the vitreous and serum from PDR patients. Macular hole (MH) patients served as controls. We also measured the levels of VEGF in vitreous body and serum samples obtained from patients with PDR. The function of EC-SOD as an angiogenesis antagonist was also investigated by examining the effects of EC-SOD in VEGF-induced proliferation, and wound healing assays in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVECs). Moreover, we investigated the effect of EC-SOD using in vitro tube formation in HUVECs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of vitreous body and serum samples</title><p>This study was conducted according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the institutional review committee of Osaka Medical College. Informed consent was obtained from all patients after an explanation of the purpose and procedures of the study.</p><p>A total of 12 PDR patients and 14 MH patients were recruited. The PDR patients included five men and seven women, who were 52.9&#x000b1;10.6 years old (mean&#x000b1;standard deviation, SD). The MH patients consisted of one man and 13 women, who were 63.5&#x000b1;10.6 years old. Undiluted vitreous samples were collected from 28 eyes of 26 individuals from 14 PDR patients and 14 MH patients, who were undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and other retinal disorders at Osaka Medical College Hospital. Samples with repeat vitrectomy were excluded. Simultaneously, serum samples were collected from nine PDR patients and nine MH patients. The vitreous and serum samples were collected by same patients with PDR and MH. PDR patients with or without macular edema and traction membrane were included. MH patients without neovascular disease and vitreous hemorrhage were used as controls, because this disorder is caused by vitreomacular traction occurring before a posterior vitreous detachment and exhibits no signs of ischemia, proliferation or inflammation. Therefore, we believe that vitreous body from patients with MH is the most similar in constitution to normal eyes that can be obtained.

The intravitreal concentrations of EC-SOD and VEGF were significantly higher in PDR patients than in MH patients, and showed a positive correlation with each other (in the whole patient group). However, there were no significant differences between PDR and MH in the serum concentrations of either EC-SOD or VEGF. To investigate possible role performed by the increased intravitreal EC-SOD in PDR, we evaluated the effect of EC-SOD using an in vitro angiogenesis model. We found that EC-SOD significantly suppressed VEGF-induced cell proliferation in HUVECs and HRMVECs, and in vitro tube formation in HUVECs.</p><p>In this study, intravitreal EC-SOD and VEGF were significantly higher in PDR patients than in MH patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the two factors did not correlate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). These results suggest that the increase of EC-SOD and VEGF were separately regulated in vitreous body in PDR patients. So, why was EC-SOD increased in the vitreous body in PDR patients? Expression of EC-SOD has been localized to specific cells and tissues, with the highest expression occurring in lung, heart, kidney, and vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Since new vessel formation is promoted in ocular tissue in PDR patients compared with MH patients, upregulation of EC-SOD in ocular tissue is to be expected. However, Coral et al. noted intravitreal levels of homocysteine, a metabolite of methionine, are increased in PDR patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. It has been reported that homocysteine suppresses heparin binding activity of EC-SOD connected with vascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. These results indicate that upregulation of EC-SOD is to be expected in the solution of ocular tissue in PDR patients via increment of newly vessels formation and decrement of heparin binding activity of EC-SOD.</p><p>Neovascularization of the retina is a diagnostic feature of PDR and is well correlated with the intravitreal level of VEGF, although the serum VEGF does not change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Our data in the present study are in agreement with these previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. The details of the mechanism responsible for the hundredfold elevation of intravitreal VEGF levels in PDR patients compared to nondiabetic controls remain unclear, but it is certain that this type of increase in VEGF in the vitreous body is related to the development of PDR.</p><p>A strong relationship exists between diabetic retinopathy and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Verdejo et al. reported that lipid peroxidation markers (malondialdehyde-like metabolites and 4-hydroxynonenal) are increased in the vitreous body of the PDR patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Oxidative stress is known to be regulated by various redox enzymes (e.g., SOD, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase) and antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>). In the present study, we detected a twofold increase in EC-SOD levels in the vitreous of PDR patients (versus MH). From this result, we hypothesized about the possible role played by the elevated intravitreal level of EC-SOD in PDR, as follows: 1) increased EC-SOD may serve to maintain the equilibrium between oxidative stress and antioxidative activity, a condition in which there is upregulation of lipid oxides in the vitreous body in PDR; or 2) EC-SOD may serve as a inhibitor of angiogenesis. Wheeler et al. noted that overexpression of EC-SOD suppressed implanted B16-F1 tumor cell growth and tumor vascularization in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. In the present study, EC-SOD suppressed VEGF-induced in vitro angiogenesis by inhibiting cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). The effects were confirmed not only in HUVECs but also in HMVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). It is known that VEGF-induced angiogenesis is mediated by ROS, and various antioxidants suppress the angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Taken together, EC-SOD may suppress ROS generation playing the signal pathway, but the detailed mechanism is unclear.</p><p>In the present study, external application of EC-SOD at 100 ng/ml partially suppressed VEGF-induced tube formation (both joint and path parameters) in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), and proliferation in HUVECs and HMVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). EC-SOD at 100 ng/ml exhibits angiostatic effect in an in vitro experiment, the concentration of which consistents with the intravitreal concentration in PDR patients (20 to 100 ng/ml). Hence, the angiostatic effect of EC-SOD was weak, but the effect may reflect the acute intravitreal environment of PDR patients.</p><p>The loss of EC-SOD from the vasculature of diabetic patients may have implications with regard to the interaction of superoxide and nitric oxide (NO) in blood vessels. Although glycation of EC-SOD does not affect enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], glycation does inhibit the activity of the CuZn-SOD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Heparin affinity of EC-SOD can be reduced in diabetic conditions, because of high blood glucose, through nonenzymatic glycation of EC-SOD at lysine residues located in the heparin-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Our present study revealed that intravitreal levels of EC-SOD were increased in PDR compared with nondiabetic MH patients. This increase may reflect the alteration of EC-SOD from the extracellular matrix to the interstitium in the diabetic condition.</p><p>The mediating roles that oxidants play between VEGF overexpression and diabetic retinopathy are well established. Substances that decrease ROS levels may well prove to be useful in treating diabetic retinopathy. For example, low molecular weight SOD and catalase mimetics are highly effective at catalyzing the transformation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]; however, tempol, a SOD mimetic, can reverse endothelial dysfunction in diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>], and FP15, a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, has been reported to protect against both leukocyte adhesion within retinal vessels and vascular dysfunction in diabetic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. As ocular tissues may be heavily exposed to free radicals in diabetic and nondiabetic conditions, treatment aimed at increasing antioxidative activity may have beneficial effects against diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>NO promotes cell migration in endothelial cells. NO reacts at an almost diffusion-controlled rate with superoxide resulting in loss of NO bioactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Hence, EC-SOD may be important role for maintaining the NO bioactivity. In the present study, EC-SOD suppressed VEGF-induced cell proliferation and tube formation, but not migration, in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). At the present time it is unclear why EC-SOD did not affect VEGF-induced migration in HUVECs and HRMVECs, and thus further investigations are warranted.</p><p>In the present study, we measured the intravitreal concentrations of VEGF in PDR patients. Some patients with PDR also experienced vitreous hemorrhage. To investigate the effects of vitreous hemorrhage, we compared intravitreal levels of VEGF from PDR patients with or without the hemorrhage condition. However, we found no significant differences between hemorrhage and nonhemorrhage groups. Similarly, intravitreal levels of EC-SOD did not differ significantly between the hemorrhage and non-hemorrhage groups (data not shown). Hence, intravitreal levels of VEGF and EC-SOD were not influenced by vitreous hemorrhage in PDR patients.</p><p>In conclusion, our clinical study revealed that EC-SOD and VEGF were increased in the vitreous body from PDR patients. EC-SOD may be related to upregulation of VEGF levels in the vitreous body during PDR, suggesting that EC-SOD may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of angiogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Mr. Nozomu Matsunaga (Gifu Pharmaceutical University) for technical
