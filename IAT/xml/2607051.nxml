The pro-apoptotic role of ATM and p53 in response to ionizing radiation (IR) has been widely investigated. Much less is known about the control of apoptosis following DNA replication stress. Recent work indicates that Chk1, the downstream phosphorylation target of ATR, protects cells from apoptosis induced by DNA replication inhibitors as well as IR. The aim of the work reported here was to determine the roles of ATM- and ATR-protein kinase cascades in the control of apoptosis following replication stress and the relationship between Chk1-suppressed apoptotic pathways responding to replication stress or IR. ATM and ATR/Chk1 signalling pathways were manipulated using siRNA-mediated depletions or specific inhibitors in two tumour cell lines or fibroblasts derived from patients with inherited mutations. We show that depletion of ATM or its downstream phosphorylation targets, NBS1 and BID, has relatively little effect on apoptosis induced by DNA replication inhibitors, while ATR or Chk1 depletion strongly enhances cell death induced by such agents in all cells tested. Furthermore, early events occurring after the disruption of DNA replication (accumulation of RPA foci and RPA34 hyperphosphorylation) in ATR- or Chk1-depleted cells committed to apoptosis are not detected in ATM-depleted cells. Unlike the Chk1-suppressed pathway responding to IR, the replication stress-triggered apoptotic pathway did not require ATM and is characterized by activation of caspase 3 in both p53-proficient and -deficient cells. Taken together, our results show that the ATR-Chk1 signalling pathway plays a major role in the regulation of death in response to DNA replication stress and that the Chk1-suppressed pathway protecting cells from replication stress is clearly distinguishable from that protecting cells from IR.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The integrity of the genetic information in cells is protected by elaborate mechanisms that ensure that an accurate DNA copy is passed from generation to generation. These mechanisms repair errors in DNA sequence or stop growth if DNA structure is compromised. However, if the level of DNA damage is too severe, cells may also respond by inducing death rather than attempt repair. Relatively little is known about how cells decide whether to repair damage or commit to death. The purpose of our work was to identify genes that control this decision-making process while cells are duplicating DNA. We show that two genes play a major role in this process; however, our work also suggests considerable complexity in this death response as different death pathways are triggered in response to different forms of DNA damage. Since DNA replication inhibitors are used widely in the treatment of cancer, our work may enable us to more effectively kill cancer cells in treatment protocols employing these agents.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells respond to DNA damage by triggering cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or death.

ATM is central to the DNA double-strand break (DSB) response.

These observations indicate that both ATM-dependent and independent pathways regulate the induction of apoptosis by IR. Chk2 may be particularly important for the ATM-independent pathway as mouse cells with knockouts of both Chk2 and ATM show levels of apoptosis similar to those found in p53&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Stracker1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>ATR and its downstream phosphorylation target, Chk1, are generally activated in response to UV and agents that stall DNA replication forks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Cha1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Ward1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Activated Chk1 coordinates many of the cellular responses to replication fork stress. More specifically, it prevents the inappropriate firing of late replication origins, the abandonment of replication forks, and premature chromosome condensation following disruption of replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Feijoo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-MayaMendoza1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to the proapoptotic role of the ATM-mediated protein kinase cascade in the response to IR, Chk1 has an anti-apoptotic effect in the cellular response to replication inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Zachos1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Cho1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Xiao1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> as well as IR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Sidi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. SiRNA mediated ablation of Chk1 (but not Chk2) causes cells arrested in S-phase by a range of replication inhibitors to undergo apoptosis. This death response is p53 independent, but cells that lack both Chk1 and p21 show a more robust death response and reduced cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Rodriguez1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus the Chk1 pathway plays a key role in protecting S-phase cells from apoptosis during replication stress and p21 mediates this role, presumably by preventing entry into S-phase. Intriguingly depletion of the replication helicase cofactor Cdc45 that plays an essential role in DNA replication origin firing and fork elongation protects cells lacking Chk1 from undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that the role of Chk1 in controlling origin firing and maintaining fork integrity is key to its anti-apoptotic effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Rodriguez2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A role for Chk1 in the suppression of apoptosis in response to IR was revealed in a zebrafish embryo-based screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Sidi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The novel death pathway triggered in p53 mutant embryos in the absence of Chk1 required ATM, ATR and caspase 2 but not other caspases. It was further shown that this response was not limited to Zebrafish as IR triggered a caspase-2 dependent apoptotic response in cultured p53-deficient human tumour cells treated with a Chk1 inhibitor. Taken together these reports establish a major role for Chk1 in the protection of cells from apoptosis in response to a wide range of DNA damage.</p><p>While the role of the ATM signalling cascade in the induction of apoptosis following IR is well established, relatively little is known concerning the contribution of this signalling pathway in response to replication fork stress. DNA replication inhibitors trigger a rapid ATM autophosphorylation and ATM-dependent phosphorylations of Chk2, NBS1 and p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Bolderson1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. More recent work has implicated BID as a downstream ATM phosphorylation target and a suppressor of apoptosis in response to DNA replication inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Zinkel1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In the work reported here we compared the effects of ATM, NBS1 or BID deficiency on apoptosis with those obtained following siRNA-mediated depletion of ATR or Chk1. We show that depletion or loss of ATM, NBS1 or BID has little or no significant effect on the induction of apoptosis in two human tumour cell lines or immortalized human fibroblasts treated with DNA replication inhibitors, even though depletion of ATR or Chk1 in these cells led to high levels of cell death. Furthermore, unlike the Chk1 suppressed pathway responding to IR identified in Zebrafish embryos, the pathway regulated by Chk1 in response to replication inhibitors was triggered in both p53 proficient and deficient cell lines, did not require ATM or ATR, and was primarily characterized by caspase-3 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Effects of ATM, ATR, or Chk1 Depletion on the Induction of Apoptosis Following Replication Stress</title><p>To determine the role of ATM or ATR relative to Chk1 in the regulation of apoptosis in response to DNA replication stress, HCT116 cells were treated with control, ATM, ATR, or Chk1 siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000324-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) for 24 hours before treatment with thymidine or HU.

The role of ATM in promoting apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation is well established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Westphal1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Xu1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggest that it plays little or no role in tumour cell lines in response to DNA replication fork stress relative to the ATR-Chk1 pathway. SiRNA mediated depletion of ATM and downstream ATM phosphorylation targets NBS1 and BID had little or no significant effect on the level of apoptotic cells in response to the replication inhibitors in the tumour cell lines tested. We previously reported that Chk2 depletion did not affect the level of apoptotic cells induced by replication inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Rodriguez1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition early events occurring after the disruption of DNA replication (accumulation of RPA foci and RPA34 hyperphosphorylation) in ATR- or Chk1-depleted cells committed to apoptosis are not detected in ATM-depleted cells. In immortalized fibroblast lines derived from patients with inherited defects in ATM or NBS1, there was no difference in the apoptotic response of mutant cells to replication inhibitors relative to the corrected lines while depletion of Chk1 or ATR gave robust apoptotic responses in all cell types. The only exception to this pattern was NBS1&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells that showed an elevated level of apoptosis following Chk1 depletion in the absence of the replication inhibitor. Since thymidine or HU treatment of these cells did not further increase the level of apoptosis, we speculate that the synthetic lethality observed in these conditions may be a consequence of some disruption of replication in these cells.</p><p>Depletion of ATR or Chk1 leads to a consistent robust apoptotic response to replication inhibitors in both tumour and immortalized fibroblast cell lines. The response of the ATR-Chk1 pathway is largely directed at the stabilization of DNA replication following stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Kastan1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and it does not appear to be required to activate downstream proapoptotic proteins. The precise event that initiates the death response in the absence of this signalling pathway is not yet clear. Previous work showing that the replication helicase cofactor Cdc45 is required for the Chk1 suppressed apoptotic response suggests that the role of this signalling pathway in maintaining replication fork integrity and preventing firing of new origins following the disruption of DNA replication is critical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Rodriguez2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Co-depletion of proteins involved in ATR and ATM signalling pathways does not enhance or inhibit the apoptotic response to replication inhibitors indicating that the ATM signalling pathway is not required for the death response. Interestingly, ATR- and ATM-mediated signalling cascades overlap in response to many forms of DNA damage. For example, both pathways stimulate Cdc25A degradation following activation by DNA damage through the action of the Chk1 and Chk2 checkpoint kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Falck1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Mailand1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus activation of either pathway can produce S-phase arrest that, in turn, should favour the anti-apoptotic repair of damaged DNA. However, in the absence of Chk1 or ATR, the ATM-mediated response does not appear to be sufficient to protect cells from apoptosis.</p><p>It has been reported that the pro-apoptotic protein BID participates in ATM-mediated protein kinase cascade to regulate entry into S-phase and prevent death in response to DNA replication inhibitors. BID showed nuclear localization and was phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner following DNA damage in myeloid progenitor cells derived from wild type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Zinkel1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

More recently these observations were disputed as several cell types from BID&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice generated on a different genetic background failed to show any significant change in S-phase arrest, survival, or apoptosis relative to BID&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Kaufmann2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In our knockdowns of BID in the human colon cancer cell line HCT116, no significant increase in the frequency of apoptotic cells was observed. However, BID depleted cells treated with thymidine accumulated in mid S-phase, suggesting that transition through S-phase was delayed relative to cells treated with the control siRNA.</p><p>The data reported here show that the apoptotic pathway suppressed by Chk1 in response to replication inhibitors is clearly distinguishable from both the classical intrinsic death pathway and the Chk1-suppressed IR death response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000324-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Unlike the intrinsic pathway, the Chk1 suppressed response to replication inhibitors does not require p53 or Chk2. The Chk1 suppressed death pathway responding to IR is not triggered following depletion of ATR and it requires ATM, ATR and caspase 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Sidi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this pathway was identified in screen of p53 deficient zebrafish, p53 deficient human tumour cells treated with Chk1 inhibitors also show caspase 2 cleavage and caspase 2 dependent apoptosis in response to IR. In p53 proficient tumour cells, the cleaved caspase 2 is not detected but caspase 3 is activated under these conditions. In contrast both ATR and Chk1 depleted cells undergo apoptosis in response to replication inhibitors regardless of p53 status and ATM is not required for death. Caspase 3 is clearly activated in both p53 proficient and deficient cell lines. Cleaved caspase 2 is not detected in p53 proficient HCT116 cells and is only weakly induced in the p53 deficient cells. Thus while Chk1 is required for the suppression of apoptosis in response to DNA structural alterations induced by IR or replication stress, the pathways suppressed are distinctly different.</p><fig id="pgen-1000324-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000324.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model of apoptotic pathways suppressed by Chk1 following IR or DNA replication stress.</title><p>Replication stress developing as a result of DSB formation or processing triggers the ATR/Chk1 protein kinase cascade that suppresses an ATM- and ATR-dependent cleavage of caspase 2 and cell death (left, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000324-Sidi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>).
