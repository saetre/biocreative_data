The protection was not due to the absence of the LDLR in the knock-out mouse strain, but to a direct effect of hyperlipoproteinemia. The beneficial effect of lipoproteins was exerted by blocking the interaction of <italic>Salmonella</italic> with host cells, including endothelial cells and monocytes, which led to inhibition of organ invasion. This resulted in an altered distribution of the microorganism to the organs of the host, and increased survival.</p><p>It has previously been shown that lipoproteins bind and neutralize LPS, with beneficial effects in Gram-negative infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Read1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Netea1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Indeed, LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were less susceptible to <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection, but this was not due to blunted cytokine production, as we observed undetectable or low cytokine circulating concentrations during the infection in the LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; and LDLR&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; mice. In addition, the expression of cytokine mRNA was similar in the organs of LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; and LDLR&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; mice. Thus, the cytokine response is not responsible for the mortality due to systemic <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection in this model, and the major difference is the almost complete absence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the organs of the LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.</p><p>The low circulating cytokine response during systemic <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection may be attributed to the facultative intracellular nature of the organism. It should be noted that at later time points during the infection, the LDLR&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; mice exhibited a greater cytokine response than did LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, and this is likely due to the 1000-fold greater bacterial burden in the control mice, leading to substantial stimulation of the host response.</p><p>We hypothesized that the decreased bacterial growth in the LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice may be a result of enhanced phagocytosis and intracellular killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic> organisms in these mice. However, this proved not to be the case: phagocytosis and subsequent intracellular killing of the organisms by both neutrophils and macrophages did not differ between LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; and LDLR&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; mice. Another reason for protection could have been the absence of the LDL receptor in the knock-out mice. <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is known to use the host LDLR for cholesterol acquisition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Coppens1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas penetration of cells by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> exotoxin A is mediated through LDLR-related protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Smith1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Laithwaite1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, use of the LDLR by <italic>Salmonella</italic> during organ invasion could be envisaged, but was ruled out by the observation that hyperlipoproteinemic ApoE&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, which have an intact LDLR, also were resistant to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. In addition, LDL affected the adhesion of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> to LDLR-bearing endothelial cells. This demonstrates that elevated lipoprotein concentrations, and not the lack of LDLR itself, are responsible from the resistance of mice against <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection.</p><p>Theoretically, there are several mechanisms that could account for the beneficial effects of the lipoproteins on <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Firstly, a direct effect of lipoproteins on the growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic> could be envisaged. In this respect, it is of interest that HDL has been found to be cidal against <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Smith1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the growth of <italic>Salmonella</italic> was similar in the plasma of LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212;, ApoE&#x02212;/&#x02212; and control mice, excluding a direct antimicrobial effect of LDL. Secondly, lipoproteins may interact with <italic>Salmonella</italic>, putatively with its LPS component, and thus block bacterial binding and internalization by host cells. As LPS is crucial for the internalization of <italic>Salmonella</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Freudenberg2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, blocking the interaction between LPS and host cells may prevent subsequent tissue invasion. Indeed, preincubation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> with LDL led to reduced cytokine production, demonstrating that lipoproteins are able to inhibit the interaction of <italic>Salmonella</italic> with monocytes. Even more relevant for tissue invasion, preincubation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> with LDL significantly reduced its attachment to endothelial cells. This protective mechanism in which lipoproteins block <italic>Salmonella</italic> interaction with endothelial cells by their blockade of LPS represents the same type of mechanism as previously shown by the blockade of MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> by naturally occurring antibodies, resulting in the inhibition of staphylococcal adhesion to endothelial cell and reduced tissue invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Patti1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Interaction of <italic>Salmonella</italic> with host cells likely is an important early step in the pathogenesis of invasive infection. The ability to infect tissue macrophages has been described as an invasive trait of intracellular bacteria such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Wijburg1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, and attachment to endothelial cells is the first step in organ invasion by <italic>Salmonella</italic> from the bloodstream. The hypothesis that lipoproteins are able to directly modify organ invasion by <italic>Salmonella</italic>, was tested by assessing early distribution of <italic>Salmonella</italic> organisms in LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; and LDLR&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; mice after i.v. injection of a large bacterial load. Indeed, we observed that invasion of <italic>Salmonella</italic> organisms into the liver and spleen of LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice was markedly lower than that in control mice. The difference in clearance of bacteria between the two strains of mice was already apparent within 30 minutes after injection. In this early phase of infection, the numerical balance between bacterial burden and host defense mechanisms in the tissues will determine the outcome of infection, and the LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice start with a substantial advantage over control animals. In contrast to the LDLR&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; mice, the vast majority of <italic>Salmonella</italic> organisms in the LDLR&#x02212;/&#x02212; remain sequestrated in the circulation, where are eliminated by complement and neutrophils, known to efficiently clear <italic>Salmonella</italic> from the bloodstream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Fierer1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

The exact nature of the lipoprotein particle responsible for interaction with <italic>Salmonella</italic> has yet to be identified. Phospholipids have been shown to mediate LPS neutralization, but protein components, such as apolipoprotein E, have also been reported to bind LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-VanOosten1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings in the apoE- and LDLR-deficient mice, which are also protected against salmonellosis, however, point to a binding site other than apoE. In addition to TLR4, the macrophage scavenger receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-vanOosten1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004237-Lyczak2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> are probably involved in the entry of <italic>Salmonella</italic> into cells. Whether the interaction of these receptors with <italic>Salmonella</italic> is also influenced by lipoproteins remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In conclusion, plasma lipoproteins appear to be an important host defense mechanism against invasive <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. A direct and rapid interaction between lipoproteins and <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the bloodstream occurs, preventing the invasion of the microorganisms from the bloodstream into the organs. These new insights improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, and could ultimately lead to the design of new therapeutic
