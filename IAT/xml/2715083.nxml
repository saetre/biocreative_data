Antigen-activated T cell apoptosis in the waning phase of the immune response is thought to be triggered by depletion of cytokines from the microenvironment. T cell apoptosis resulting from cytokine deprivation is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), but their source and position in the apoptotic cascade is poorly understood. RNA interference approaches implicated the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in neglect-induced apoptosis in T cells. Using mice deficient for the catalytic subunit gp91<sup>phox</sup> to characterize the molecular link to activated T cell apoptosis, we show that gp91<sup>phox</sup>-deficient T (T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) cells generated mitochondrial superoxide but had diminished hydrogen peroxide production in response to neglect, which, in turn, regulated Jun N-terminal kinase&#x02013;dependent Bax activation and apoptosis. Activated T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells were distinguished by improved survival after activation by superantigens in vivo, adoptive transfers into congenic hosts, and higher recall responses after immunization. Thus, the NADPH oxidase may regulate adaptive immunity in addition to its previously well-characterized role in the innate response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The regulated deletion of T cells is critical for the maintenance of homeostasis in the mammalian immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldrath and Bevan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Plas et al., 2002</xref>). Two pathways of cell death have been well characterized in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hengartner, 2000</xref>): the extrinsic pathway, which is triggered by death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998</xref>), and the intrinsic pathway, which culminates in the release of apoptotic intermediates from mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang, 2001</xref>). The Bcl-2 family proteins are key intermediates in the latter because their activities principally converge on the regulation of mitochondrial integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Youle and Strasser, 2008</xref>).</p><p>T cell apoptosis not only shapes the immune repertoire but is essential for immune responses to new and repeated antigenic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldrath and Bevan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Plas et al., 2002</xref>). Apoptosis of excess T cells after antigen clearance provides the immune system functionality to manage multiple encounters with infectious organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldrath and Bevan, 1999</xref>). The undesired activation of autoreactive T cells accompanying this event is curtailed by Fas&#x02013;Fas ligand-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lenardo et al., 1999</xref>). Although emerging evidence suggests that aspects of initial antigenic encounter may regulate the timing of T cell contraction, activated T cell death in many systems correlates with the depletion of cytokines after antigenic clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vella et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Strasser and Pellegrini, 2004</xref>). Activated T cell apoptosis during contraction is independent of both caspases and death receptor signaling and is rescued by exogenous cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vella et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nussbaum and Whitton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yajima et al., 2006</xref>). However, only some effectors of T cell apoptosis are well characterized, and molecular interactions linking cytokine signaling to the regulation of Bax/Bak-BIM&#x02013;mediated mitochondrial damage remain unresolved. In this context, the identification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the effectors of activated T cell apoptosis acquired considerable significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hildeman et al., 1999</xref>), but the absence of identified ROS sources precluded a detailed understanding of this process. In this paper, we address this gap in the understanding of the molecular cascade that regulates activated T cell persistence. We present evidence for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase as a critical regulator of T cell function.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Activated T cell neglect-induced death in vitro</title><p>T cells activated in vitro using antibodies to CD3-CD28 as surrogate antigen were maintained in culture with the cytokine IL-2. IL-2 withdrawal (neglect) triggered cell death, which was characterized by apoptotic nuclear damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), was inhibited by the broad-spectrum antioxidant Mn(III)tetrakis (4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP), and was FasL independent (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082851/DC1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>). Several derivatives of superoxide accumulate in T cells undergoing neglect-induced death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hildeman, 2004</xref>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive reagent CM-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA (referred to as DCFDA) revealed a temporally regulated increase in levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in T cells cultured without IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). ROS accumulation peaked between 6 and 8 h (with some variation between mice), before eventual decline by 10 h, preceding nuclear damage by several hours (unpublished data). The surge was suppressed by MnTBAP or diphenyliodonium, a noncompetitive inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). NADPH oxidase is a multisubunit complex that includes catalytic and regulatory subunits forming core elements of a complex that also includes adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lambeth, 2004</xref>). Confocal imaging verified that the catalytic (gp91<sup>phox</sup>) and regulatory (p67<sup>phox</sup>) subunits are expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>) and can be immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>) from activated T cells, confirming a recent result showing this complex in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jackson et al., 2004</xref>).

In both backgrounds, apoptosis was low in the V&#x003b2;6<sup>+</sup> subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Consistently, apoptosis of V&#x003b2;3<sup>+</sup> was inhibited in WT mice injected with SEA and MnTBAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Similarly, in both genotypes, CD4<sup>+</sup>V&#x003b2;8<sup>+</sup> cells showed a comparable increase in response to SEB injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, F and G</xref>). However, this subset persisted in greater numbers in gp91<sup>phox&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on day 4 at a time when numbers had begun to show a decline in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, F and G</xref>). Again, there were no accompanying changes in the V&#x003b2;6<sup>+</sup> subset in either genotype (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells have improved recall response to antigen</title><p>After antigen clearance, the majority of antigen-reactive T cells are deleted with a small proportion set aside to form T cell memory. Although challenged by recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaech et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badovinac et al., 2004</xref>), contraction of activated T cells is thought to be triggered by competition for limiting amounts of cytokine in the waning phase of the immune response. Because gp91<sup>phox</sup> regulated activated T cell apoptosis, its absence should manifest in the persistence of antigen-reactive cells, as T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells would progress in greater numbers to making memory. To test this, T cell recall responses were assessed after immunization.</p><p>gp91<sup>phox&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT mice were immunized with maleylated ovalbumin (mOVA) and recall responses assessed 12&#x02013;15 d later using different assays of proliferation. Basal response to antigen was negligible in unimmunized animals of either genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>, triangles). Antigen-specific proliferative responses, using WST-1 or BrdU uptake, were consistently elevated in T cells from draining LN of gp91<sup>phox&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, H and I</xref>). Tracking dilution of the CFSE label in T cells loaded with dye before culture with antigen revealed higher numbers of CFSE<sup>+</sup> T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells in every division cycle. We also noted a small but consistent increase in the number of T cells entering division in null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 J</xref>). These data are in concordance with the survival of a higher number of mOVA responder T cells in mutant mice. The initial representation of effector-memory cells (CD44<sup>high</sup> CD62L<sup>low</sup> CD25<sup>neg</sup>) in input populations was comparable in WT and mutant mice (unpublished data).</p><p>NADPH oxidase is a central well characterized component of the innate immune response against fungal and bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bjorgvinsdottir et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchard et al., 2003</xref>). In this paper, we characterize an apoptotic cascade triggered by NADPH oxidase in activated T cells. Cytokine deprivation&#x02013;induced activated T cell apoptosis in vitro mimics several features of activated T cell death in vivo, permitting analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hildeman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vig et al., 2004</xref>). Using this approach, we describe a mechanism linking ROS and Bcl-2 family proteins. We propose that NADPH oxidase is the interacting redox partner responsive to cytokine-dependent survival cues in activated T cells because cytokine withdrawal triggered a gp91<sup>phox</sup>-associated ROS surge. Investigations into the spatiotemporal organization of gp91<sup>phox</sup> and its regulation by cytokines in T cells are ongoing. We report a specific defect in the generation of hydrogen peroxide (indicated by DCFDA oxidation) in response to cytokine deprivation, although mitochondrial superoxide production was not inhibited in T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Although it may be argued that mitochondrial superoxide is not required in this pathway, it is also possible that the two oxidative systems interact functionally, with mitochondrial superoxide serving to propagate the apoptotic cascade. However, selective perturbation of the mitochondrial oxidative system and detailed dissection of the underlying mechanism is linked to the development of more specific ROS indicators and inhibitors. Comparable TCR stimulation-induced oxidation of DCFDA in primary T cells and DHE and MitoSOX red in activated T cells established that T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells do not have a generalized defect in ROS production.</p><p>shRNA-mediated disruptions supported a role for NADPH oxidase in this death pathway and allayed concerns that resistance of gp91<sup>phox&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells to apoptosis resulted from the altered development of these cells. Thus, shRNA-mediated depletion of gp91<sup>phox</sup>, the activator p67<sup>phox</sup>, or the adaptor p40<sup>phox</sup> inhibited neglect-induced death in activated T cells. Activated T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells displayed improved survival after adoptive transfer into immune-competent hosts or after in vivo activation by bacterial superantigens in assays where cells were not manipulated in culture. Furthermore, increased viability and proliferation of T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells relative to WT cells, in the recall response to antigen, was consistent with compromised contraction of T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells in vivo. Notably, primary responses to immunization were not elevated in mutant mice. Ongoing experiments are designed to assess if antigen reactivity is maintained in mutant animals at extended intervals after the first immunization.</p><p>Activated T cell death requires Bax-Bak and BH3-only proteins to disrupt mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rathmell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fischer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Youle and Strasser, 2008</xref>). Bax activation and loss of MTP were inhibited in T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. We propose that JNK is the redox-sensitive intermediate, as its sustained activation was prevented by the synthetic antioxidant MnTBAP and blunted in T<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, and inhibiting JNK activity blocked Bax activation and apoptosis.</p><p>Although the role of the NADPH oxidase in the regulation of the innate response is well characterized, these data offer new insight into a novel role for this oxidase in the coordination of the adaptive immune response. A more comprehensive analysis of the organization of this complex in T cells is needed to understand its response to cytokine-dependent cues and recruitment for activated T cell attrition at the end of the immune response.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Animals.</title><p>C57BL/6J, B6/SJL, gp91<sup>phox&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (B6.129S6-<italic>Cybb<sup>tm1Din</sup></italic>/J), p47<sup>phox&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (B6(Cg)-<italic>Ncf1<sup>m1J</sup></italic>/J), and B6Smn.C3-<italic>Fasl<sup>gld</sup></italic>/J mice strains were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.
