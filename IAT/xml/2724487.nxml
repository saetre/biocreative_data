YY2 is a zinc finger protein that shares 56% sequence homology with YY1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Especially, the C-terminal DNA-binding zinc finger is highly conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and mediates a similar binding specificity to the 5'-(A/c/g)(A/t)NATG(G/a/t)(C/a)(G/c/t)-3' DNA consensus motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], suggesting synergistic or competitive functions, if both factors act within the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The biological significance of yy1 is highlighted by early embryonic lethality of mice with homozygous <italic>yy1 </italic>deletion. In addition, mice with heterozygous <italic>yy1 </italic>ablation show growth retardation and defects in neurulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of <italic>yy2 </italic>ablation has not been reported, yet. The intron lacking <italic>yy2 </italic>gene is extraordinarily positioned between exons 5 and 6 of another X-chromosomally located gene encoding mbtps2 (membrane bound transcription factor protease site 2). First expression analyses by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization in testis, ovaries and brain from adult mice suggested a shared control of <italic>yy2 </italic>and <italic>mbtps2 </italic>gene activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, our data indicate that the upstream region of the human <italic>YY2 </italic>gene mediates significant promoter activity independently from <italic>MBTPS2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>To gain more information on the biology of yy2, we established whole mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization. In parallel, real-time PCR was used to quantify <italic>yy2 </italic>mRNA expression in various organs of developing and adult mice more precisely. Herein, we demonstrate that the <italic>yy2 </italic>mRNA expression pattern differs from that of <italic>yy1 </italic>and <italic>mbtsp2</italic>. Importantly, <italic>yy2 </italic>expression underlies significant changes during development, particularly in various areas of the brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of <italic>yy2 </italic>in mouse embryos</title><p>Since there are only limited data available on the organ-specific <italic>yy2 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we established the whole mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization technique. First experiments with DIG-labeled riboprobes showed wide spread signals of <italic>yy2 </italic>transcripts on the entire E11.5 embryo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), suggesting ubiquitous expression similar as described for <italic>yy1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The specificity of the antisense riboprobe staining is underlined by the negative control, where the embryo was incubated with the corresponding sense riboprobe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To analyze the <italic>yy2 </italic>expression pattern more precisely, we subsequently performed TaqMan real-time PCR in selected organs and tissue specimens of developing and adult mice.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of <italic>yy2 </italic>in developing mice</bold>.

Since, <italic>yy2 </italic>is broadly, possibly ubiquitously expressed in embryonic mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), we conducted extensive real-time PCR analyses indicating a tissue-specific expression pattern that is in part developmentally regulated. Thereby, our experiments were especially focused on the cardiopulmonary and central nervous system.</p><p>Expression of <italic>yy1</italic>, <italic>yy2 </italic>and <italic>mbtps2 </italic>could be detected in all analyzed organs, tissues and cells [see also additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. While their expression levels did not change significantly during development of heart and lung, the specimens from the brain revealed a more dynamic expression pattern. The relative high amount of <italic>yy1 </italic>transcripts in the cerebellum, neocortex and hippocampus underlines the broad implication of yy1 in the brain at all stages of mice development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In fact, its functional role in the nervous system has been demonstrated by analyses of heterozygous <italic>yy1 </italic>knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and conditional ablation of <italic>yy1 </italic>in oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. By contrast, the amount of <italic>yy2 </italic>showed tissue-specific variations throughout brain development (summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In the cerebellum, <italic>yy2 </italic>expression increased significantly from early postnatal to adult. During this time period cerebellum undergoes dramatic morphological changes, including active neurogenesis, neuronal migration and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In cortical samples <italic>yy2 </italic>expression revealed a u-shaped progression with a minimum starting at birth. At this time point neurogenesis and neuronal migration are completed in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Here, it has to be noted that cerebellum and cortex have specific parallel neuronal connections between each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. For example, neurons from the motor cortex project to the cerebellum. The hippocampus, however, involved in learning and memory processes, exhibited a constant low level of <italic>yy2 </italic>transcripts throughout development. Further analyses of yy2 protein localization at the cellular level could help to understand whether yy2 could be involved in controlling axon formation, migration, or dendritogenesis. This issue cannot be examined so far, because currently no appropriate antibody against murine yy2 is available.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of <italic>yy2 </italic>expression in different brain regions</bold>.

In contrast to microglia cells and astrocytes, neurons express almost no <italic>yy2</italic>. The neuronal data suggest that yy2 could be required for proliferation, since neurons, in contrast to astrocytes and microglia cells, cannot divide anymore. Ongoing experiments may verify this hypothesis.</p><p>Comparing all real-time PCR results it becomes obvious that the expression of <italic>yy2 </italic>and <italic>mbtps2</italic>, respectively, is individually regulated depending upon the analyzed organ, tissue or cell type. While both genes seem to be co-regulated <italic>via </italic>the same promoter in heart and lung as well as in microglia and astrocytes, however, the data from primary neurons and all three brain tissues indicate an alternative transcriptional activity. Currently, two different possibilities of <italic>yy2 </italic>and <italic>mbtps2 </italic>gene regulation are discussed: (a) both genes are under the control of the <italic>mbtps2 </italic>promoter, and (b) <italic>yy2 </italic>transcription is mediated by its own adjacent promoter, located upstream of its coding sequence, a model that we favour according to own data on the regulation of the human <italic>YY2 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Of note, only the <italic>yy2 </italic>promoter shows a significant sensitivity against DNA-(de)methylation, strengthening the implication of yy2 in developmental processes. Our observations presented in this manuscript emphasize that in fact both promoter regions seem to be utilized in a tissue- or cell type-specific manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results from the real-time PCR experiments confirm that <italic>yy2 </italic>is differentially expressed in the lung, heart and brain, indicating a stringent spatial regulation and function.

For digoxygenin (DIG)-labeling, 12 &#x003bc;l of linearized plasmid (EcoRI: anti-sense or BamHI: sense) were combined with 2 &#x003bc;l 10-fold buffer (Roche; Mannheim, Germany), 1 &#x003bc;l RNAsin, 2 &#x003bc;l T3 (for anti-sense synthesis) or T7 (for sense synthesis) RNA polymerase and 2 &#x003bc;l labeling mix containing 7.1 &#x003bc;l ATP, 7.1 &#x003bc;l CTP, 7.1 &#x003bc;l GTP, 4.6 &#x003bc;l UTP, 20.5 &#x003bc;l RNase free water, and 25 &#x003bc;l DIG-11-UTP (Roche; Cat.-No.: 1209256) in order to conduct <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription for 2 h (37&#x000b0;C). Afterwards, the freshly prepared probe was diluted by adding 70 &#x003bc;l RNase free water and 10 &#x003bc;l 0.1 M DTT. The embryos were dissected in ice-cold PBS, followed by overnight fixation in 4% PFA, 3 washes in PBS with 1% Tween 20 (PBT) for 5 minutes, and dehydration in rising methanol concentrations. Next, specimens were rehydrated with decreasing methanol concentrations. For increasing permeability and signal detection, embryos were incubated in 6% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>for 1 h and subsequently treated with proteinase K for 15 min with 3 washing steps (5 min each) in PBT. Digestion was stopped in 2 mg/ml glycine in PBT for 20 min and 2 washing steps in PBT followed by post fixation in 4% PFA (in PBT) for 20 min at room temperature. PFA was removed by 3 washing steps in PBT. After incubation in hybridization solution containing 50% deionized formamide, 5&#x000d7; SSC [pH 4.5], 1% SDS, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml tRNA and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml heparin at 65&#x000b0;C for 1 h, 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;l denaturized DIG-labeled probes (2 min at 90&#x000b0;C) were added and hybridized at 65&#x000b0;C overnight. Finally, embryos were washed 3 times for 1 h in solution I (50% formamide, 5 &#x000d7; SSC [pH 4.5], 1% SDS) at 65&#x000b0;C followed by 3 washing steps for 1 hour in solution II (50% formamide, 2 &#x000d7; SSC [pH 4.5], 1% Tween 20) at 60&#x000b0;C and washing 3 times in TBST for 5 min each. Before the embryos were treated with anti-DIG antibody (1:2000) in 1% sheep serum/TBST overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, we conducted a blocking step in 10% heat-inactivated sheep serum/TBST with 0.1% blocking reagent (Roche; Cat.-No.: 11112589001) for 1 h at room temperature. After performing post-antibody washes (3 times 10 min and 5 times 1 h in TBST), samples were hybridized in fresh prepared NTMT [pH 9.5] solution containing 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 9.5), 50 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.1% Tween 20. For signal detection, NTMT solution was removed and reaction mix (NTMT with 125 &#x003bc;g/ml BCIP and 250 &#x003bc;g/ml NBT) was added. To stop the staining process, samples were washed 3 times in PBT, followed by post-fixation in 4% PFA. The embryos were analyzed with a Leica MZ 9.5 stereo microscope (Wetzlar, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of cDNA</title><p>Mouse organs were immediately snap-frozen following their collection from 3 sets of 6 animals of each age. Primary mouse brain cells from 3 independent preparations of 3 pregnant animals or mouse organs were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the total RNA was purified according the TRIzol protocol. RNA concentrations were determined by using a UV-Visible Spectrophotometer (Biomate 3 spectrometer, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
