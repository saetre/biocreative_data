Activated PDGFR&#x003b2; undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequently interacts with various signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine 739/750 residues in mice, and thus regulates actin polymerization and cell movement.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Principal Findings</title><p>In this study, we found disorganized actin in the form of membrane ruffling and enhanced cell migration in LRP1-deficient (<italic>LRP1&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic>) SMCs. Marfan syndrome-like phenotypes such as tortuous aortas, disrupted elastic layers and abnormally activated transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF&#x003b2;) signaling are present in smooth muscle-specific LRP1 knockout (<italic>smLRP1&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic>) mice.

Spontaneous atherosclerosis was significantly reduced in the absence of hypercholesterolemia in these mice compared to <italic>smLRP1&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> animals that express wild type PDGFR. Normal actin organization was restored and spontaneous SMC migration as well as PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis was dramatically reduced, despite continued overactivation of TGF&#x003b2; signaling, as indicated by high levels of nuclear phospho-Smad2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Significance</title><p>Our data suggest that LRP1 regulates actin organization and cell migration by controlling PDGFR&#x003b2;-dependent activation of PI3K. TGF&#x003b2; activation alone is not sufficient for the expression of the Marfan-like vascular phenotype. Thus, regulation of PI3 Kinase by PDGFR&#x003b2; is essential for maintaining vascular integrity, and for the prevention of atherosclerosis as well as Marfan syndrome.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional member of the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene family with a unique capacity of binding over 40 distinct ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006922-Herz1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Suppression of PI3K activation by PDGFR&#x003b2; prevents the Marfan-like phenotypic changes in the vascular wall in the presence of unabated TGF&#x003b2; signaling, suggesting a pivotal role of LRP1-controlled and PDGFR&#x003b2;-dependent PI3K activation in the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome. Selective elimination of PDGFR&#x003b2;-dependent PI3K activation thus could be a potential therapeutic target for both atherosclerosis and Marfan syndrome.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study reveals a novel PI3K-dependent mechanism by which LRP1 is essential for controlling the integrity of the vascular wall, and by which this multifunctional receptor potently protects against atherosclerosis and Marfan syndrome. The findings we have presented here shed new light on the molecular mechanisms that control cellular growth and migration, and which are thereby essential to the remodeling and repair of the vascular wall and for slowing or preventing degenerative disorders of the vascular wall.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of the mouse strains</title><p>All experimental mice were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6/129 background.
