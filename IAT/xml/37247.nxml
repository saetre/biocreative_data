The mechanism of EB inhibition of RNase III is not known nor is there information on EB-binding sites in RNase III substrates. We show here that EB is a reversible, apparently competitive inhibitor of RNase III cleavage of small model substrates <italic>in vitro</italic>. Inhibition is due to intercalation, since (i) the inhibitory concentrations of EB are similar to measured EB intercalation affinities; (ii) substrate cleavage is not affected by actinomycin D, an intercalating agent that does not bind dsRNA; (iii) the EB concentration dependence of inhibition is a function of substrate structure. In contrast, EB does not strongly inhibit the ability of RNase III to bind substrate. EB also does not block substrate binding by the C-terminal dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of RNase III, indicating that EB perturbs substrate recognition by the N-terminal catalytic domain. Laser photocleavage experiments revealed two ethidium-binding sites in the substrate R1.1 RNA. One site is in the internal loop, adjacent to the scissile bond, while the second site is in the lower stem. Both sites consist of an A-A pair stacked on a CG pair, a motif which apparently provides a particularly favorable environment for intercalation. These results indicate an inhibitory mechanism in which EB site-specifically binds substrate, creating a cleavage-resistant complex that can compete with free substrate for RNase III. This study also shows that RNase III recognition and cleavage of substrate can be uncoupled and supports an enzymatic mechanism of dsRNA cleavage involving cooperative but not obligatorily linked actions of the dsRBD and the catalytic domain.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Double-helical RNA is a target for recognition by diverse cellular and viral proteins involved in the processing, modification, transport, translation and degradation of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c4">4</xref>).

The protein kinase PKR and members of the 2-5A synthetase family are activated by dsRNA during the mammalian antiviral response. As a countermeasure, specific viral proteins can bind and sequester dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c3">3</xref>). The recently characterized phenomena of RNA interference (RNAi) and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) also involve the synthesis, recognition and processing of dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c12">12</xref>).</p><p> Members of the ribonuclease III (RNase III) family specifically recognize and cleave dsRNA and are involved in a variety of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. RNase III is highly conserved in the bacteria and orthologs occur in fungi, plants, animals and even a virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c14">14</xref>). The most studied member of the family is RNase III of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EC 3.1.24) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c18">18</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III cleaves the primary transcript of the rRNA operons, creating the immediate precursors of 16S, 23S and 5S rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c19">19</xref>). Recent studies indicate that rRNA processing is a conserved role for RNase III family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c22">22</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III also converts cellular and viral mRNA precursors to their translationally most active forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c25">25</xref>) and can cleave within mRNA coding sequences, causing translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c26">26</xref>). RNase III participates in antisense (AS) RNA action by cleaving duplex structures produced by AS RNA binding to target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c27">27</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III also autoregulates its expression through cleavage of a double-stranded element within the 5&#x02032;-leader of its message, which promotes rapid subsequent decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c30">30</xref>).</p><p><italic> Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III is active as a homodimer and requires a divalent metal ion (preferably Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) to hydrolyze phosphodiesters, providing 5&#x02032;-phosphate and 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl product termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c16">16</xref>). RNase III processing reactions can be faithfully reconstructed <italic>in vitro</italic> using small model substrates containing the requisite reactivity epitopes and using physiologically relevant salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c33">33</xref>). In low salt and&#x0002f;or in the presence of Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> additional cleavages occur at secondary sites, which are not normally recognized <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c35">35</xref>). The C-terminal portion of the RNase III polypeptide contains a dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c36">36</xref>), a motif present in many other dsRNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c5">5</xref>), which is important for substrate recognition <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (A.K.Amarasinghe, S.Su, W.Sun, R.W.Simons and A.W.Nicholson, manuscript in preparation). The N-terminal portion of the RNase III polypeptide contains the catalytic (nuclease) domain, which exhibits an array of conserved residues, at least one of which (Glu117) has been shown to be important for cleavage but not for substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c38">38</xref>). Although it is now generally accepted that the RNase III mechanism of action requires the participation of both the dsRBD and the catalytic domain, the fundamental steps in dsRNA recognition and cleavage by RNase III have not been defined.</p><p> One approach to determine the RNase III mechanism of action is to examine the effect of small molecule inhibitors. Such compounds include substrate mimics and transition state analogs and have been informative probes of other RNases (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c40">40</xref>).

Although inhibition was assumed to reflect EB intercalation into 30S RNA, the mechanism of inhibition was not determined nor was the drug binding site(s) identified. The <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> RNase III ortholog Pac1p is also inhibited by low (micromolar) concentrations of EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c13">13</xref>). We show here that EB is a reversible, apparently competitive inhibitor of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III. We demonstrate that an ethidium-dependent change in RNA structure can uncouple RNase III binding and cleavage of substrate, indicating a RNase III mechanism of action involving cooperative but not obligatorily linked actions of the dsRBD and the catalytic domain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Water was deionized and distilled.

The &#x0223c;5500 nt 30S RNA most likely contains many EB-binding sites which, along with the large size of the RNA, would complicate a biochemical analysis of the mechanism of inhibition. We instead examined the ability of EB to inhibit cleavage of a small substrate encoded by bacteriophage T7.

The reaction time was chosen to allow only limited cleavage of substrate, so as to provide maximum sensitivity to any inhibitory effect of EB. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f2">2</xref>A shows that EB blocks cleavage of R1.1 RNA, with a half-maximal inhibition observed at &#x0223c;8 &#x000b5;M EB and no cleavage detected at 40 &#x000b5;M EB. Essentially the same inhibitory profile is obtained if EB is added after RNase III but prior to Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> addition (data not shown). The ethidium cation is the inhibitory agent, since cleavage is unaffected by adding equivalent amounts of sodium bromide (data not shown). We also examined the effect of EB on RNase III cleavage of R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA. The results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f2">2</xref>B) show that EB also inhibits cleavage of R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of &#x0223c;4 &#x000b5;M. The different shapes of the EB inhibition curves for R1.1 RNA and R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f2">2</xref>D) suggest that RNA, rather than RNase III, is the target for EB. As a further test to determine whether RNA is the site of ethidium action, AD was substituted for EB in a cleavage reaction. AD is an intercalating agent that binds DNA but not dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c56">56</xref>). Thus, an inhibitory effect of AD would suggest the presence of a binding site on RNase III for planar, apolar compounds. The assay results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f2">2</xref>C) reveal that cleavage of R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA is not inhibited by AD, even at 40 &#x000b5;M concentration. We also&#x000a0;carried out cleavage assays using two additional RNase III&#x000a0;substrates: T7 R4.7 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c23">23</xref>) and the <italic>rrn</italic>B operon T1 transcription terminator hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c59">59</xref>). The assay results (data not shown) reveal that EB in the low micromolar concentration range is a general inhibitor of RNase III.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethidium is a reversible, apparently competitive inhibitor of RNase III</title><p>Ethidium intercalation into double-helical structures is a reversible process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c60">60</xref>). It would be expected that EB inhibition of RNase III is also reversible and that derepression of cleavage would occur following addition of a nucleic acid that can competitively bind EB but which does not interact with RNase III. One such species is tRNA, which contains an EB-binding site in the acceptor helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c62">62</xref>; see also below) and does not significantly affect RNase III action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c15">15</xref>). Adding increasing amounts of tRNA to a cleavage reaction containing R1.1 RNA and 20 &#x000b5;M EB causes a corresponding increase in the fraction of substrate cleaved, such that at the highest concentration of tRNA (38 &#x000b5;M) the extent of R1.1 RNA cleavage was the same in the presence or absence of EB (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke295tb1">1</xref>). In other experiments (data not shown) either increasing the reaction time or the RNase III concentration at a fixed EB concentration also provides an increasing amount of substrate cleavage. In summary, these results indicate the reversibility of ethidium inhibition.</p><p> To determine the kinetic parameters for EB inhibition the initial rate of R1.1 RNA cleavage was measured as a function of substrate concentration at two EB concentrations (10 and 15&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M), as well as in the absence of EB. To provide steady-state conditions, substrate was in excess of enzyme. The dependence of initial rate on substrate and inhibitor concentrations was assessed by a double reciprocal analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f3">3</xref>), which shows that apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> increases with increasing amounts of EB, while <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> is unaffected. This behavior indicates an apparent competitive inhibition by EB. The calculated <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> for EB (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f3">3</xref> legend) is 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x000b5;M. We show below that the apparent competitive inhibition is due to formation of an ethidium&#x02013;substrate complex that is resistant to cleavage but which can compete with free substrate for RNase III.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethidium uncouples RNase III binding and cleavage of substrate</title><p>Intercalation can block protein&#x02013;RNA recognition (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c63">63</xref>). To determine whether EB inhibits RNase III binding to substrate 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA was combined with specific amounts of EB, followed by RNase III and the RNA&#x02013;protein complex resolved by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. So that the assay would be maximally sensitive to EB inhibition, the RNase III concentration was chosen to provide only partial binding of substrate. In addition, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was replaced with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, which promotes substrate binding while preventing cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c37">37</xref>). The results of a representative assay are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f4">4</xref>A, which reveals that increasing the EB concentration to 100 &#x000b5;M causes only a minor inhibition of RNase III binding to R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA. Essentially the same result was obtained using 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled R1.1 RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f4">4</xref>B).</p><p> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f5">5</xref> presents a quantitative analysis of EB inhibition of RNase III binding and cleavage of R1.1 RNA and R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA. For both substrates there occurred a strong suppression of cleavage with only a slight inhibition of binding. The binding inhibition can be attributed to a non-specific effect of the salt, since the same minor drop in binding was observed when EB was replaced by sodium bromide (dotted line in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f5">5</xref>). Protein titration&#x02013;gel shift experiments were performed to obtain the apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for RNase III binding to R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA in the presence of EB. In this experiment the RNase III&#x0005b;Glu117Gln&#x0005d; mutant was used, which can bind substrate in the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> but cannot catalyze cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c47">47</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value in the absence of EB was 14.4 &#x000b1; 6.6 &#x000b5;M, while in the presence of 40 &#x000b5;M EB it was 20.7 &#x000b1; 0.9 &#x000b5;M (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke295tb2">2</xref>). We conclude that EB has only a minor destabilizing effect on the RNase III&#x02013;R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA complex. Interestingly, an EB concentration of 5 &#x000b5;M stimulates RNase III binding to R1.1 RNA, which is not observed with R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f5">5</xref>). We believe that this enhancement of RNase III binding is due to EB binding to a site in the R1.1 RNA internal loop (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA binding by the RNase III dsRBD is not inhibited by ethidium</title><p>The dsRBD of RNase III is important for substrate binding <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (A.K.Amarasinghe, S.Su, W.Sun, R.W.Simons and A.W.Nicholson, manuscript in preparation). One possibility is that the EB resistance of the RNase III&#x02013;substrate complex reflects the behavior of the dsRBD. To test this the dsRBD was purified as an &#x0223c;10 kDa polypeptide and gel shift assays were performed using 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA. To provide maximum sensitivity to any inhibitory effect of EB the amount of dsRBD was chosen to provide only a partial shift of substrate. The assay results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f6">6</xref>) show that dsRBD binding to R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA is resistant to EB, up to 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M concentration. We conclude that the EB resistance of the RNase III&#x02013;substrate complex in part reflects a sustained interaction of the dsRBD with substrate in the presence of the drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Photochemical mapping of ethidium-binding sites in R1.1 RNA</title><p>The substrate cleavage assays point to RNA as the target for EB inhibition. To map the ethidium-binding site(s) we took advantage of the ability of photoexcited ethidium to cleave nucleic acid chains at intercalation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c53">53</xref>). Although the mechanism of cleavage is not fully understood, the process probably involves hydrogen atom abstraction from the ribose sugar by the photoexcited ethidium, followed by loss of the base and chain breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c53">53</xref>). The light source was a 532 nm laser line and RT&#x02013;PE was used to identify the cleavage sites (see Materials and Methods). Using this assay an ethidium-binding site was identified by an RT stop which was both EB and light dependent.</p><p> Since RT&#x02013;PE has not been used previously to map sites of ethidium-dependent photocleavage, we first applied the assay to a well-characterized RNA which contains a known binding site for ethidium. NMR spectroscopic studies have shown that <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Val</sup> contains a single ethidium intercalation site near the base of the acceptor helix, between base pairs A6&#x02013;U67 and U7&#x02013;A66 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c62">62</xref>). We prepared an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcript of <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Val</sup>, combined it with EB and irradiated the complex with 532 nm light. RT&#x02013;PE analysis of the experiment reveals an RT stop at U67, which maps to the primary intercalation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c61">61</xref>). A second RT stop occurs at U64, which is engaged in a U-G wobble pair in the T stem and therefore probably represents a second intercalation site. A third RT stop was also observed at A58, which may represent non-intercalative cleavage within the T loop, which has also been seen in another RNA stem&#x02013;hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c51">51</xref>). Given the concordance of RT&#x02013;PE with the NMR characterization of the ethidium-binding site in the tRNA<sup>Val</sup> acceptor stem, we conclude that RT&#x02013;PE is a valid approach to map EB intercalation sites.</p><p> We next identified the EB-binding sites in R1.1 RNA. The transcript contains a 3&#x02032; sequence extension in order to allow binding of the RT primer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f7">7</xref>B). The additional sequence does not affect RNase III cleavage of the RNA (data not shown). RT&#x02013;PE analysis of an irradiation experiment indicates the presence of two specific ethidium-binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f7">7</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4). One site occurs in the lower stem between nucleotides A62 and G61 and a second site is between A58 and G57, which is within the internal loop and adjacent to the scissile bond (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f7">7</xref>B). The occurrence of an ethidium-binding site adjacent to the scissile phosphodiester suggests a mechanism for cleavage inhibition (see Discussion). Each ethidium-binding site is formed by a CG pair stacked on an A-A mismatch and for both sites the base that is lost upon irradiation is a purine (G). The preferential loss of a purine during irradiation of EB&#x02013;nucleic acid complexes has been noted elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c52">52</xref>). In summary, the laser photocleavage experiments show that ethidium binds to a RNase III substrate in a site-specific manner and also identify a RNA motif preferentially recognized by ethidium.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This report has described the inhibitory action of EB on <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III cleavage of small model substrates <italic>in</italic><italic>vitro</italic>. RNA is the target for EB inhibition and intercalation is the mode of binding, since the EB concentration which confers half-maximal inhibition is similar to the dissociation constants of other well-characterized EB&#x02013;RNA intercalation complexes, which are in the low micromolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c65">65</xref>). However, we cannot rigorously rule out an interaction of ethidium with RNase III. In this regard it was reported that propidium, an intercalating agent structurally similar to ethidium, inhibits pancreatic RNase by binding to a non-specific, apolar site on the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c66">66</xref>). However, if such a site were present on RNase III the inhibitory action of ethidium would be insensitive to substrate structure and AD most likely would have inhibited cleavage, neither of which were observed. Ethidium intercalation creates a substrate&#x02013;inhibitor (S&#x000b7;I) complex which can bind RNase III but which is resistant to cleavage. The behavior of the S&#x000b7;I complex rationalizes the apparent competitive inhibitory kinetics. Thus, it is the S&#x000b7;I complex rather than ethidium which competes with free substrate for RNase III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f8">8</xref>). As the substrate concentration was increased at fixed EB concentration the S&#x000b7;I concentration became small relative to free substrate and the same <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> was obtained.</p><p> The two ethidium-binding sites in R1.1 RNA are formed by a CG pair stacked on an A&#x000b7;A pair (a 5&#x02032;-purine&#x02013;pyrimidine-3&#x02032; motif). In contrast, structural analyses of dinucleoside monophosphate&#x02013;ethidium complexes suggest a preference of ethidium for 5&#x02032;-pyrimidine&#x02013;purine-3&#x02032; Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair dinucleotide &#x02018;steps&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c68">68</xref>). Why does the AC&#x0002f;GA motif apparently provide a preferred binding site? First, the A&#x000b7;A mismatch may locally destabilize the helix and lessen the thermodynamic cost of intercalation. In this regard it was shown that bulged nucleotides in model RNA hairpins significantly enhance ethidium binding and it was proposed that the additional sugar&#x02013;phosphate linkage provided by the bulged nucleotide can accommodate the torsional strain accompanying ethidium binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c52">52</xref>). Secondly, the CG pair provides an energetically optimal stacking interaction with the bound ethidium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c68">68</xref>). We also found that low concentrations of ethidium can stimulate RNase III binding to R1.1 RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke295f4">4</xref>). An imino proton NMR analysis of R1.1 RNA revealed that the internal loop C27 and G57 residues are not engaged in a Watson&#x02013;Crick pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c57">57</xref>). Ethidium binding may promote formation of this Watson&#x02013;Crick pair, which in turn would confer greater double-helical character to the internal loop and enhance RNase III binding. In this regard it is known that RNase III binds more tightly to an R1.1 RNA variant containing a fully Watson&#x02013;Crick base paired internal loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c37">37</xref>).</p><p> This study has shown that RNase III binding and cleavage of substrate can be uncoupled by a ligand-induced alteration in RNA structure. Although it is not known whether inhibition requires ethidium binding to both sites in R1.1 RNA, we note that the two sites are far enough apart not to be constrained by the nearest neighbor exclusion principle for intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c69">69</xref>). We believe that ethidium binding to the R1.1 internal loop site is sufficient to cause uncoupling. First, the lower stem of R1.1 RNA can be substantially shortened without strongly affecting substrate reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c57">57</xref>). The dispensibility of the lower stem would, therefore, indicate the functional inconsequence of ethidium binding to the lower stem site. Secondly, ethidium binding to the internal loop places the drug adjacent to the scissile bond and, therefore, also at (or near) the enzyme active site. The bound ethidium could block placement of the scissile phosphodiester in the active site or inhibit a conformational change in the E&#x000b7;S complex required to reach the transition state. The first mechanism corresponds to inhibition of a &#x02018;lock and key&#x02019; interaction, while the second mechanism would correspond to inhibition of an &#x02018;induced fit&#x02019; process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c53">53</xref>). A precise description of how EB inhibits RNase III awaits a structural analysis of the E&#x000b7;S&#x000b7;I complex, however, the ability of intercalated ethidium to reduce local helical motion and increase helical stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c70">70</xref>) provides a basis for inhibition of either mechanism.</p><p> Although it is known that specific mutations in RNase III can block cleavage without affecting substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c38">38</xref>), speculation has persisted whether catalytically active RNase III can act as a RNA-binding protein. A genetic study suggested that RNase III can bind RNA without concomitant cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c71">71</xref>), however, there was no confirmatory biochemical evidence. The ability of a small, RNA-directed ligand to uncouple RNase III action suggests that specific RNA structures may exist which can &#x02018;redirect&#x02019; RNase III as a RNA-binding protein and provide an alternative mechanism of gene regulation. Based on these results, we predict that EB inhibits cleavage of the bacterial 30S rRNA precursor by allowing RNase III recognition of the 16S and 23S processing sites but blocking the cleavage step. The known ability of EB to block <italic>in vivo</italic> maturation of a eukaryotic pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c72">72</xref>) could also reflect inhibition of a RNase III-dependent step. In this regard we have determined (I.Calin-Jageman and A.W.Nicholson, unpublished results) that EB blocks yeast RNase III (Rnt1p) cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> of the cognate 35S pre-rRNA processing signal, which is present within the 3&#x02032;-ETS. Since the obligatory first step in the yeast rRNA maturation pathway is performed by RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c74">74</xref>), ethidium may also block all downstream processing reactions. How ethidium inhibits eukaryotic rRNA maturation awaits further analyses of eukaryotic RNase III homolog interactions with their cognate substrates.</p><p> The sustained ability of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III to bind substrate in the presence of EB is reflected by the behavior of the dsRBD. Thus, even though ethidium intercalation causes partial unwinding, lengthening and localized structural distortion of the double helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c56">56</xref>), these changes are tolerated by the dsRBD. This is perhaps not unexpected, as it has been shown that the dsRBDs of other proteins can recognize dsRNA structures containing base mismatches, bulges, loops and coaxially stacked helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c75">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c77">77</xref>). The behavior of the dsRBD may be relevant to the effect of EB on other dsRBD-containing proteins. It was reported that EB inhibits the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c78">78</xref>). However, EB did not block the ability of pre-activated (i.e. autophosphorylated) PKR to phosphorylate eIF2. Although this is consistent with the proposal that EB blocks dsRNA binding by PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c77">77</xref>), an alternative possibility is that EB allows PKR binding to dsRNA but instead blocks autophosphorylation. Since PKR recognizes dsRNA by employing a tandem dsRBD set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke295c4">4</xref>), the latter mechanism would be consistent with the ethidium insensitivity of the dsRBD.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke295f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Structure of EB.

The concentration of RNase III was chosen to provide only a partial shift, in order to provide maximal sensitivity to any inhibitory effect of EB. Higher concentrations of RNase III provide a complete shift of the free RNA to the bound form (data not shown). CaCl<sub>2</sub> (10 mM) was included in the binding reactions and gel and electrophoresis buffers. The positions of bound and free R1.1&#x0005b;WC&#x0005d; RNA are indicated.
