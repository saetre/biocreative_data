Here we show that chromatin-associated protein HMGB1 (a member of the large family of HMG-box proteins with possible functions in DNA replication, transcription, recombination and DNA repair) promotes topo II&#x003b1;-mediated catenation of circular DNA, relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA and decatenation of kinetoplast DNA. HMGB1 interacts with topo II&#x003b1; and this interaction, like the stimulation of the catalytic activity of the enzyme, requires both HMG-box domains of HMGB1. A mutant of HMGB1, which cannot change DNA topology stimulates DNA decatenation by topo II&#x003b1; indistinguishably from the wild-type protein. Although HMGB1 stimulates ATP hydrolysis by topo II&#x003b1;, the DNA cleavage is much more enhanced. The observed abilities of HMGB1 to interact with topo II&#x003b1; and promote topo II&#x003b1; binding to DNA suggest a mechanism by which HMGB1 stimulates the catalytic activity of the enzyme via enhancement of DNA cleavage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) is an essential and ubiquitous enzyme for proliferation of eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). It can alter the topological state of DNA and untangle DNA knots and catenanes (interlocked rings) via ATP-dependent passing of an intact double helix through a transient double-stranded break generated in a separate DNA segment, followed by religation and enzyme turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In mammalian cells, topo II exists in two isoforms, &#x003b1; (170&#x02009;kDa) and &#x003b2; (180&#x02009;kDa), both having similar primary structure and almost identical catalytic properties, but differing in their production during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Topo II is the primary target of a number of active agents currently used in the treatment of human cancers, such as epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide and teniposide), anthracyclines (doxorubicin and daunorubicin) and mitoxantrone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These drugs (also termed topo II poisons) can stabilize the covalent enzyme-associated complexes and shift the DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium of the enzyme reaction toward the cleavage state, converting biological intermediates of topo II activity into lethal ones ultimately leading to triggering of programmed cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>HMGB1 is an abundant, ubiquitous and evolutionarily highly conserved non-histone chromatin-associated protein in mammals, which functions in a number of fundamental cellular processes such as transcription, replication, DNA repair and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). HMGB1 is associated with chromosomes in mitosis and due to its extreme mobility in the cell, the protein is continuously exchanged between nucleus and cytoplasm (5 and references therein). HMGB1 also exhibits an important extracellular function in mediation of inflammation mechanisms, tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). HMGB1 binds relatively weakly to B-form DNA, but displays a high affinity for distorted DNA conformations [e.g. four-way DNA junction, DNA minicircles, hemicatenated DNA loops and cisplatin-modified DNA; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">7&#x02013;12</xref>)]. Binding of HMGB1 to DNA causes local distortions by bending/looping or changes of DNA topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). HMGB1 also interacts weakly with a number of proteins, including transcription factors, site-specific recombination and DNA repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The importance of HMGB1 for life is supported by the phenotype of the HMGB1 knockout mice, which die 24&#x02009;h after birth due to hypoglycemia and exhibit a defect in the transcriptional function of the glucocorticoid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we report a physical interaction between HMGB1 and human topo II&#x003b1; <italic>in vitro</italic>. We show that HMGB1 promotes topo II&#x003b1;-mediated catenation of circular DNA, enhances relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA and decatenation of kinetoplast DNA. Stimulation of the catalytic activity of topo II&#x003b1; by HMGB1 is mainly due to enhanced DNA binding and cleavage by the enzyme. Possible functioning of HMGB1 as a modulator of the cellular activity of topo II&#x003b1; is discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Enzymes and antibodies</title><p>Experiments were carried out either with human topoisomerase II&#x003b1; (topo II&#x003b1;) purchased from Topogen, or with recombinant human topo II&#x003b1; isolated from yeast strain JEL1&#x00394;top1 (the strain was kindly provided by John L.

Most experiments were carried out both with human topo II&#x003b1; purchased from Topogen and with recombinant human topo II&#x003b1; isolated from yeast (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods section&#x02019;). &#x02018;Catenation assay&#x02019; was carried out with either negatively supercoiled or relaxed closed-circular plasmids. The plasmid pTZ19R (&#x0223c;15&#x02009;nM) was pre-incubated on ice in a total volume of 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of topo II&#x003b1; assay buffer (50&#x02009;mM Tris-HC1 pH 8, 85&#x02009;mM KCl, 10&#x02009;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1&#x02009;mM ATP, 0.5&#x02009;mM dithiothreitol, 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml BSA) containing 0&#x02013;10% PEG (w/v) with different amounts of HMGB1 (as indicated in the figure legends) for 20&#x02009;min, followed by addition of topo II&#x003b1; (typically 5&#x02009;nM). The mixture was finally incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 40&#x02013;60&#x02009;min. &#x02018;Decatenation assay&#x02019; was performed in the topo II&#x003b1; assay buffer by incubation of 0.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) with topo II&#x003b1; (as indicated in the figure legends).

No PEG was present in the relaxation assay buffer. All other reaction conditions of the relaxation assay were identical to the catenation assay. The above topo II&#x003b1; activity assays were terminated by rapid addition of 460&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of 1&#x02009;M NaCl/1% SDS/10&#x02009;mM EDTA and 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of 2.5% linear polyacrylamide as carrier, followed by vortexing with an equal volume of chloroform&#x02013;isoamylalcohol (24:1, v/v). The mixtures were then centrifuged at room temperature at 10&#x02009;000&#x02009;g for 10&#x02009;min, and the clarified upper layers were precipitated with 1&#x02009;ml of absolute ethanol at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;min. The DNA precipitates were washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried and dissolved in 0.1&#x000d7; TE buffer. &#x02018;DNA cleavage assay&#x02019; was carried out by incubation of plasmid pBR322 (&#x0223c;4&#x02009;nM) with topo II&#x003b1; in DNA cleavage buffer (10&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50&#x02009;mM KCl, 50&#x02009;mM NaCl, 5&#x02009;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5% glycerol, 0.1&#x02009;mM EDTA, containing either 1&#x02009;mM ATP or 1&#x02009;mM non-hydrolyzable analog ANP-PNP, Sigma) in a total volume of 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;l at 37&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;min.

It has previously been shown that molecular crowding has a strong effect both on equilibrium and on the rate of reactions involving macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a volume excluding agent may imitate the conditions under which HMGB1 is able to facilitate (non-covalent) intermolecular associations of DNA helices with subsequent ligation by limiting amounts of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref> and this study). The observed interlinking of circular, covalently closed DNA molecules by topo II&#x003b1; in the presence of HMGB1 is likely a consequence of the PEG-mediated increase of local DNA and protein concentrations. Apart from increase of the DNA concentration, the presence of PEG obviously increases the concentration of HMGB1 in the catenation reaction (typically &#x0223c;1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M in the test tube) which may then approach the expected actual concentration of HMGB1 in the cell nucleus, &#x0223c;25&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (assuming &#x0223c;10<sup>6</sup> copies of HMGB1 per cell, the volume of the cell nucleus 6.5 &#x000d7; 10<bold><sup>&#x02212;</sup></bold><sup>11</sup>&#x02009;ml, and disregarding the contribution of nuclear crowding agents which would otherwise likely lead to even higher concentration of HMGB1 in the nucleus). As higher amounts of topo II&#x003b1; can promote DNA catenation in the absence of other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), there has been a possibility that the observed DNA catenation in the presence of HMGB1 might have had arisen solely as a consequence of a PEG-induced increase in the topo II&#x003b1; concentration. However, this seems unlikely as PEG itself does not promote DNA catenation by low amounts of topo II&#x003b1; when HMGB1 is absent. A variety of polycations, including spermidine and histone H1, promote catenation, and this is most likely due to compaction of the DNA substrate into aggregates with high local DNA concentration favoring the catenated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). HMGB1 can promote interlocking of DNA rings by topo II&#x003b1; only if a crowding agent is present in the course of the catenation reaction. This may reflect the fact that unlike DNA binding of the polyvalent cations, histone H1 or other nuclear proteins (such as nucleolin, DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref> and references therein), aggregation of HMGB1&#x02013;DNA complexes is much less apparent in diluted solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p><p>HMGB1 promotes not only topo II&#x003b1;-mediated catenation of circular DNA, but it can also enhance decatenation of kDNA and relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. The catalytic cycle of topo II&#x003b1; depends on a coordinate function of several catalytic steps of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). The first step includes binding of the enzyme to DNA (Step 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>) which has been demonstrated to be significantly enhanced by HMGB1. HMGB1 stimulates catalytic activity of topo II&#x003b1; by promoting DNA cleavage (Steps 3&#x02013;4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>), without affecting the pattern of specific cleavage sites on DNA (data not shown). Although both &#x02018;pre-strand&#x02019; and &#x02018;post-strand passage DNA cleavage&#x02019; steps (Steps 3 and 4, respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>) are stimulated by HMGB1, the stimulatory effect by HMGB1 is more prominent at the &#x02018;post-strand passage DNA cleavage&#x02019; step of the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. A possible explanation of the HMGB1-mediated stimulation of DNA cleavage by topo II&#x003b1; is enhanced binding of the enzyme to DNA. The latter may be a consequence of the reported ability of HMGB1 to act as a &#x02018;DNA chaperone&#x02019; [e.g. by bending DNA, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>)] and/or due to direct interaction of the protein with topo II&#x003b1;.</p><p>Topo II&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), like HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), can bind preferentially to supercoiled plasmid (including non B-DNA structures such as Z-DNA and four-way junctions) as compared to the linear B-DNA. Whether the reported preferential binding of HMGB1 to distorted or non B-type DNA structures contributes to recognition of topo II&#x003b1;-specific DNA-binding sites/structures remains to be established. HMGB1 has also been previously reported to change DNA topology by unwinding the double-helical DNA or introducing negative supercoils in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). However, the HMGB1-mediated enhancement of decatenation by human topo II&#x003b1; is similar when assayed using an HMGB1 mutant that does not affect DNA topology. In addition, the activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase IV, a prokaryotic type-II topoisomerase that has evolved independently from HMG-box proteins, is not influenced by changes in DNA topology induced by HMGB1. Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that the stimulatory effect of HMGB1 on the catalytic activity of the enzyme depends not only on DNA&#x02013;protein interactions but also on protein&#x02013;protein interactions. The fact that EMSA assay did not detect any ternary DNA&#x02013;topo II&#x003b1;&#x02013;HMGB1 complex does not necessarily mean the lack of existence of such a complex. It is possible that HMGB1 can &#x02018;deliver&#x02019; the topo II&#x003b1; to its binding/cleavage sites by forming a ternary complex which is transient and unstable. This idea is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating the ability of HMGB1 to enhance the binding a plethora of sequence-specific proteins to their cognate DNA sites without formation of ternary complexes, despite the detection of the corresponding protein&#x02013;protein interactions in pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>ICRF-193 inhibits Step 6 of the catalytic cycle of topo II&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>), the ATP hydrolysis, by trapping the enzyme on the DNA in the closed-clamp form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).

Although HMGB1 is expressed throughout the cell cycle with no significant variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), the protein is clearly over-expressed in most human tumors, including breast carcinoma, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, colon carcinomas and acute myeloblastic leukemia (48 and references therein). Further experiments are needed to clarify whether this over-expression affects the cellular activity and expression of topo II&#x003b1;, and if so, whether it contributes to the reported enhanced topo II&#x003b1; activity in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank John L.
