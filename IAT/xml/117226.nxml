Nearly all genes in this region show conserved synteny with genes on human Chr11p15.5. The extended imprinted region appears to have a bipartite structure in that it contains at least two separate imprinted sub-domains. Each of these subdomains is regulated by a distinct imprinting control element. These correspond to short differentially methylated DNA sequences (DMRs) &#x02013; one immediately upstream of the <italic>H19</italic> gene and another within an intron of the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> gene. These two elements control, respectively, the allele-specific expression of the <italic>H19/Igf2/Ins2</italic> gene cluster, and the second gene cluster containing <italic>Kcnq1,</italic> the antisense transcript<italic>Kcnq1ot1, p57</italic><sup><italic>Kip</italic>2</sup>/<italic>Cdkn1c, Slc22a1l, Ipl/Tssc3</italic> and possibly additional genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. There is good evidence assigning one border of the overall imprinted region to the DNA immediately downstream of <italic>H19 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, the other border, which must lie upstream of <italic>Ipl</italic> is less well-defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Here we show evidence for weak imprinting of a gene, <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>, which is located upstream of <italic>Ipl</italic> in mice, and which encodes a putative decoy receptor in the TNF receptor family. We also map the tissue distribution of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> mRNA and discuss the significance of our findings in terms of possible functions of this gene in placentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Maps of the chromosomal region containing <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> and <italic>Tnfrh2</italic> and the exons of these genes are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a,1b</xref>. These two genes have a similar intron/exon organization, suggesting that they arose by a local gene duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. They are also 95 percent identical in their cDNA sequences, with 84 percent overall amino acid identity (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The proteins encoded by <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> and <italic>Tnfrh2</italic> share a conserved arrangement of multiple cysteine residues, characteristic of the extracellular ligand-binding domains of other TNF receptor family members (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> and <italic>Tnfrh2</italic> lie ~350 kb distant from the KvDMR1 'imprinting center'. Two other genes, <italic>Cars</italic> and <italic>Nap1l4</italic>, lie between the strongly imprinted gene cluster regulated by this DMR and the <italic>Tnfrh1/Tnfrh2</italic> gene pair. The <italic>Cars</italic> gene is not functionally imprinted, and the <italic>Nap1l4</italic> gene shows a weak expression bias in some mouse tissues, but not in several human tissues examined to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The <italic>Obph1</italic> gene, which shows a strong allelic bias in mRNA expression in the placenta, but not in other tissues, is located upstream of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>. Since assessment of allelic bias in the placenta is complicated by the presence of maternal cells, it is not known with certainty whether <italic>Obph1</italic> is imprinted. Searches of the genomic and expressed sequence databases using the <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> nucleotide and protein sequences did not uncover any strongly similar genes in humans, and low stringency hybridization of Northern blots of human tissue RNAs with the <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> cDNA probe did not yield specific bands. Moreover, in the interval of the human genome between <italic>CARS</italic> and the human orthologue of <italic>Obph1</italic> (the <italic>OSBPL5</italic> gene), there were no sequences with detectable similarity to <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Genes and PCR strategies.</bold><bold>A,</bold> Map showing the positions of genes in the telomeric half of the distal mouse Chr7 imprinted domain. Direction of transcription is shown by the arrows, and imprinting is color-coded, with red indicating preferential expression of the maternal allele and blue indicating expression of the paternal allele. The <italic>Obph1</italic> gene is coded as orange, since it shows an allelic expression bias only in the placenta, which may indicate either imprinting or expression from maternal cells. Genes that do not show an allelic expression bias, or for which complete information is not available, are in black.

Genetic polymorphisms in <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> are indicated in violet (polymorphisms that distinguish CAST from BL/6) or maroon (polymorphisms that distinguish MOLD from BL/6). For analysis of allele-specific mRNA expression, we used primer pairs (1,2) or, alternatively (1,3). Estimation of relative expression from <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> vs. <italic>Tnfrh2</italic> by RT-PCR was done with primers 1, 4 and 5. Primers 1 and 6 were used to generate a <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>-specific cDNA probe.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-3-11-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acid sequence similarity between mouse <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> and <italic>Tnfrh2</italic> proteins and the extracellular domains of the prototypical TNF receptor family members TNFR and Fas/CD95.</bold> Amino acids with complete conservation are shaded, and the conserved cysteine residues are in bold.

Consistent with this, northern blotting using <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>-specific probes matching the relatively divergent 5' end of this gene showed easily detectable <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> mRNA transcripts in nearly all adult tissues, as well as in late fetal organs and structures (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, by far the strongest signals were seen in the pregnant uterus and whole placenta (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Measurements by PhosphorImaging showed that <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> mRNA in whole placenta was 5-fold more abundant than in the non-pregnant uterus, and 10-fold more abundant than in the whole fetus. Two classes of transcripts were present: the smaller transcript, which migrated at 1.7 kb based on other blots with size standards, matches the size predicted from the cDNA sequence. The larger transcript, which migrates at 3.7 kb, must contain additional sequences, but these have not yet been mapped. To evaluate the relative expression of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> and <italic>Tnfrh2</italic> in various organs and tissues, we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in multiplex reactions using a shared downstream primer and <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>- and <italic>Tnfrh2</italic>-specific upstream primers. This showed that both genes are expressed in most fetal and adult organs and structures, but that the expression in several structures including placenta and muscle is highly skewed in favor of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> in adult and fetal mouse tissues.</bold><italic>Tnfrh1</italic> mRNA is detected as two alternative transcripts, both of which are present in most tissues. Both transcripts are most abundant in the placenta. The <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> partial cDNA used to probe these blots has no detectable sequence identity with <italic>Tnfrh2</italic> over the 5'-most 65 nt, but has 91% identity with the <italic>Tnfrh2</italic> over the remaining 450 nt. Stripping and rehybridization at high stringency, with a smaller 5' probe with 72% overall sequence identity over 297 nt gave an identical pattern of bands.

The predicted sizes for the PCR products derived from each gene are indicated. Several organs and tissues, including whole placentas at 12.5 and 14.5 dpc (asterisks), show preferential expression of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-3-11-4"/></fig><p>The whole placenta, after dissection from the uterus in mid-gestation, contains both a fetal component (the placenta proper, consisting of the labyrinth, spongiotrophoblast and giant cell layers) and a maternal component (the decidua basalis, as well as maternal blood vessels). We were therefore interested to determine the precise localization of the <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>-positive cells in this organ. To this end we first dissected each of two frozen placentas, obtained at 12.5 dpc, into a superficial half, enriched in the superficial fetal components, and a deeper half, enriched in deep fetal and superficial maternal components, and extracted RNA from each half. This procedure crudely separates the labyrinthine trophoblast from all of the deeper tissues. Hybridizing the northern blot with a probe for Ipl mRNA (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) validated this procedure. <italic>Ipl</italic> is specifically expressed in the placental labyrinth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and this probe gave a strong signal only in RNA from the superficial halves. The same blot re-hybridized with the <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> cDNA probe gave the opposite pattern, clearly showing that <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> mRNA is restricted to layers of the placenta deep to the labyrinth (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Tnfrh1</italic> mRNA is restricted to the deep layers of the placenta.</bold> Two placentas from 12.5 dpc conceptuses were frozen and divided into superficial (fetal) and deep (maternal; mat) halves prior to RNA extraction. The Ipl cDNA probe is a specific marker for the labyrinthine trophoblast and therefore hybridizes to the lanes from the superficial halves of the placentas.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-3-11-5"/></fig><p>To determine whether <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> is expressed in the deep fetal component or, alternatively, in the maternal component of the placenta, we next carried out in situ hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> cDNA probe. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a,6b,6c</xref>, this gave a detectable signal only in a narrow band of cells, situated immediately deep to the trophoblast giant cell layer. This restricted distribution of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>-positive cells was observed both at 10.5 dpc, when the definitive placental layers have recently formed, and at 12.5 dpc, after these layers have begun to mature (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a,6b,6c</xref>). At high magnification, the <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>-positive cells were seen closely juxtaposed to trophoblast giant cells (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>). The morphology of these cells, and their location deep to the giant cell layer, suggested decidual parenchyma. These cells did not coincide with PAS-positive granulated uterine natural killer lymphocytes, or with CD3-positive infiltrating T-lymphocytes (data not shown). However, additional characterization will be necessary for a definitive assignment of cell type.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> is restricted to a discrete sub-population of cells near the fetal-maternal boundary.</bold><bold>A,</bold> low-magnification image of 10.5 dpc placenta subjected to ISH with the <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>-antisense probe, showing a band of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>-positive cells near the fetal-maternal junction.

Since <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> encodes a receptor in the TNFR family lacking a cytoplasmic domain (i.e., a decoy receptor), this gene might function to block the action of TNF-related ligands. A similar scenario has been proposed by Phillips et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] for another TNF ligand-receptor system, namely TRAIL and TRAIL receptors, which are expressed in human placentas. However, in their studies the major decoy receptor for TRAIL, DcR1, was found expressed in trophoblast, not in decidua, while another decoy receptor, DcR2, was expressed by placental macrophages. Fas ligand is also highly expressed by human and murine trophoblast, although its functional role in the placenta is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>To investigate potential imprinting of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> and <italic>Tnfrh2</italic>, we next searched for genetic polymorphisms in these genes that would allow us to distinguish maternal from paternal alleles in interspecific mouse crosses. We failed to identify polymorphisms in <italic>Tnfrh2</italic>, but we found multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> gene (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Using cDNAs from fetal and adult tissues derived from interspecific crosses, we amplified a region of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> containing several of these SNPs. The PCR strategies generated products that crossed either 4 or 5 exon-exon boundaries, thereby eliminating the possibility of genomic contamination (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Since one of the SNPs that distinguished the standard C57BL/6 laboratory strain from the divergent strain <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic> (CAST) created an <italic>Mbo</italic>II restriction site in the CAST sequence, we used RFLP analysis to assess allelic representation in cDNAs from F1 progeny of BL/6 &#x000d7; CAST and CAST &#x000d7; BL/6 reciprocal crosses. This indicated an obvious but partial maternal bias in the fetal liver, and a nearly complete bias towards the maternal allele in placenta (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This was confirmed by direct sequencing of the cDNAs, and the parent-of-origin dependence of this effect was emphasized by the opposite patterns observed in the reciprocal crosses (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The bias in fetal liver must reflect parental imprinting of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>, but based on the information from Northern blotting and ISH, the pattern seen in the placental cDNAs in these experiments reflects expression from maternal cells, not imprinting.</p><p>Other fetal and adult tissues were also assessed in these crosses, and showed a maternal expression bias, but weaker than that observed in fetal liver (data not shown). The parent-of-origin dependent allelic bias in <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> mRNA was superimposed on a 'baseline' bias towards hyper-expression of the BL/6 allele (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This most likely reflects the effects of polymorphisms in regulatory promoter and/or enhancer sequences. Indeed, sequencing of the BL/6 and CAST <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> promoter sequences revealed multiple SNPs in the region -200 to +100 relative to the transcriptional start site (data not shown). The alternative trivial explanation for the baseline bias, polymorphisms within primer binding sites, was excluded by direct sequencing of genomic DNAs.</p><p>We next repeated the imprinting analysis using cDNAs from reciprocal crosses between BL/6 and another divergent strain, <italic>M. m. mollosinus</italic> (MOLD). Since the polymorphisms present in MOLD do not affect restriction sites, this experiment was done using SSCP to distinguish the alleles. The results again showed an incomplete bias towards expression of the maternal allele in several fetal and adult tissues, reflecting parental imprinting, as well as a stronger bias in the placenta, reflecting expression from maternal cells (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Direct sequencing of cDNAs confirmed the SSCP data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). As was true of the BL/6 &#x000d7; CAST crosses, the parent-of-origin dependence of the allele-specific expression was superimposed on a baseline bias towards hyper-expression of the BL/6 allele. As was true of CAST, the MOLD <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> promoter region differed from BL/6 at several SNPs, thereby providing a possible explanation for this constitutive bias (data not shown).</p><p>As a control for these assays, we assessed the allele-specific expression of the <italic>Obph1</italic> gene, using the same cDNA preparations. Consistent with the previous report from Engemann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], this showed equal allelic representation in cDNAs from various fetal and adult tissues, and a strong maternal bias in the placenta (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). As mentioned above, additional work will be needed to determine whether the results in the placenta reflect imprinting of <italic>Obph1</italic>, or alternatively indicate expression from maternal cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Preferential expression of the maternal allele of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> in fetal liver from CAST &#x000d7; BL/6 reciprocal crosses.</bold><bold>A,</bold> Analysis of the <italic>Mbo</italic>II RFLP, in which the BL/6 allele is undigested and the CAST allele yields two fragments. There is a strong maternal allele bias in placenta, and a weaker but still obvious parent-of-origin dependent biases in fetal liver. This imprinting effect is superimposed on a non-imprinted bias for higher expression of the BL/6 allele. The allelic bias in placenta reflects expression from maternal cells, but the bias in fetal liver reflects parental imprinting. Similar results were obtained with multiple aliquots of cDNA (not shown). B=BL/6, C=CAST.

The absence of identifiable orthologues of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> and <italic>Tnfrh2</italic> in the human genome suggests that both of these genes arose subsequent to the divergence of placental mammals. This fact, together with our observation of preferential expression of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> mRNA in cells at the fetal-maternal boundary, highlights <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> as a potential example of the rapid evolution of genes with functions specific to the placenta, a process postulated to be driven by conflict between fetal and maternal alleles. Anecdotal examples, including pregnancy-associated glycoproteins, trophoblast interferons, the <italic>Pem</italic> and <italic>Psx</italic> homeobox genes, and the placental lactogen genes support the notion that 'placental genes' evolve rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but counter-examples can also be adduced. Two imprinted genes with placenta-specific expression and function, namely <italic>Ipl</italic> and <italic>Mash2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] are highly conserved. This contrasts with the lack of conservation of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>, and the species-specific imprinting of at least one placental lactogen gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Of more immediate interest is the biological function of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>, which will need to be determined by knockout experiments. Since the sequence of this gene predicts that it encodes a TNF decoy receptor, a likely possibility is that it acts to dampen immune responses to the fetal semi-allograft.</p><p>Imprinting of genes on mouse distal Chr7 is controlled by two DMRs, which act as 'imprinting centers'. Of these two control elements, the closest to <italic>Tnfrh1</italic> is KvDMR1, located in an intron of the <italic>Kcnq1</italic> gene and giving rise to the <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> non-translated RNA. This element, which is ~350 kb distant from <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>, is essential in cis for the imprinting of at least 4 genes, <italic>Kcnq1</italic>, <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>, <italic>Slc22a1l</italic> and <italic>Ipl/Tssc3</italic> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and M. Higgins, personal communication). All of these genes are relatively repressed on the paternal allele and active on the maternal allele. The simplest explanation for our finding of weak but consistent functional imprinting of <italic>Tnfrh1</italic>, with relative hyper-expression from the maternal allele, is that the KvDMR1 control element exerts distance-dependent effects. However, studies using KvDMR1-mutant mice will be necessary to confirm this.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Genomic and cDNA PCR</title><p>Trizol&#x02122; reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) was used to prepare total RNA from fetal and adult mouse tissues. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of total RNA using the Superscript Preamplification System (Life Technologies).
