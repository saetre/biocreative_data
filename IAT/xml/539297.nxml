The primary genetic defect (&#x0003e;80% disease chromosomes) leading to JNCL is a 1.02 kb genomic DNA deletion in the <italic>CLN3 </italic>gene, which eliminates exons 7 and 8 and surrounding intronic DNA, predicting a non-functional protein product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The pathological hallmark of JNCL is autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin deposits within autolysosomes that are enriched in subunit c of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Remarkably, these deposits are not only found in CNS neurons but are also abundant in non-neuronal cells outside of the nervous system. The relationship of subunit c deposits to the JNCL disease process, and the underlying reason for the neuronal specificity of the disease remain poorly understood.</p><p>The <italic>CLN3</italic>-encoded protein (battenin, also called CLN3 or cln3 p) is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed, multi-pass membrane protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] that localizes to the lysosome and other vesicular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Battenin function remains to be elucidated, although studies of <italic>btn1</italic>, the yeast <italic>CLN3 </italic>ortholog, have implicated battenin in lysosomal pH homeostasis and amino acid transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>To explore JNCL pathogenesis and battenin function, we previously generated a genetically precise JNCL mouse model. <italic>Cln3</italic><sup>&#x00394;ex7/8 </sup>knock-in mice harbor the ~1 kb common JNCL mutation and express a non-truncated mutant battenin isoform that is detectable with antibodies recognizing C-terminal epitopes.

These findings suggest that the major JNCL defect leads to abnormal turnover of mitochondrial subunit c, in a manner that selectively compromises CNS neurons.</p><p>Currently, there is no suitable neuronal cell system to investigate the impact of the common JNCL mutation on biological processes.

Homozygous Cb<italic>Cln3</italic><sup>&#x00394;ex7/8 </sup>cells express mutant battenin and JNCL-hallmark mitochondrial ATPase subunit c accumulation, upon aging of cells at confluency. Moreover, this is the first study to indicate recessive endosomal/lysosomal membrane trafficking defects and mitochondrial dysfunction that precedes subunit c deposition in an accurate JNCL model. Importantly, these defects are likely to be early events in the JNCL disease process and may particularly impact neuronal function.</p><p>Abnormal cathepsin D localization and processing in homozygous Cb<italic>Cln3</italic><sup>&#x00394;ex7/8 </sup>cells and <italic>Cln3</italic><sup>&#x00394;ex7/8 </sup>mice likely reflects altered vesicular trafficking and/or lysosomal pH, which is known to impact cathepsin D processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Indeed, <italic>CLN3 </italic>overexpression in HEK-293 cells altered lysosomal pH and cathepsin D processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and lysosomal pH homeostasis is disrupted in JNCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is noteworthy that cathepsin B and the CLN2-encoded enzyme, TPPI, are also altered in JNCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, despite the cathepsin D protein alterations that are observed in homozygous Cb<italic>Cln3</italic><sup>&#x00394;ex7/8 </sup>cells, cathepsin D enzymatic activity does not appear to be reduced. Thus, decreased cathepsin D activity is unlikely to account for subunit c accumulation in JNCL.</p><p>Aging of homozygous Cb<italic>Cln3</italic><sup>&#x00394;ex7/8 </sup>cells at confluency is necessary to induce significantly accumulated subunit c protein. However, membrane organelle disruptions precede subunit c accumulation in homozygous Cb<italic>Cln3</italic><sup>&#x00394;ex7/8 </sup>cells, since they are observed without aging at confluency. Lysosomal and endosomal size and distribution are altered, and mitochondria are abnormally elongated and functionally compromised in sub-confluent homozygous Cb<italic>Cln3</italic><sup>&#x00394;ex7/8 </sup>cultures. These observations argue that membrane trafficking defects do not result from excessive subunit c accumulation compromising the lysosome, but rather are early events in the disease process preceding subunit c accumulation. Mitochondrial abnormalities, which have also been reported in JNCL patients and other animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], may result from ineffective turnover by autophagy, a lysosomal-targeted pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Alternatively, or simultaneously, battenin deficiency may impact mitochondrial function upstream of turnover, affecting mitochondrial biogenesis and/or altered transport and processing of mitochondrial proteins.</p><p>In wild-type Cb<italic>Cln3 </italic>neuronal precursor cells battenin primarily co-localizes with early and late endosomes. Battenin immunostaining in homozygous Cb<italic>Cln3</italic><sup>&#x00394;ex7/8 </sup>neuronal precursors is significantly reduced in abundance, but mutant signal also co-localizes with endosomal markers suggesting mutant battenin protein with C-terminal epitopes is trafficked similar to wild-type protein. In other studies, CLN3/battenin protein localization has been reported to partially overlap with late endosomes and lysosomes in non-neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and to lysosomes, synaptosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] in neurons. These data jointly indicate that battenin resides in a subset of vesicular compartments linking multiple membrane trafficking pathways, perhaps functioning in vesicular transport and/or fusion. Endocytic and lysosomal-targeted pathways, including mitochondrial autophagy, are specifically implicated in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The membrane trafficking and mitochondrial deficits uncovered in homozygous Cb<italic>Cln3</italic><sup>&#x00394;ex7/8 </sup>cells are likely to particularly impact neuronal function.
