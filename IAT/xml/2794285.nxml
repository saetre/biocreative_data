Previous studies indicate that plant CNGCs are involved in the control of growth processes and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. According to their proposed function as cation entry pathways these channels contribute to cellular cation homeostasis, including calcium and sodium, as well as to stress-related signal transduction. Here, we studied the expression patterns and regulation of <italic>CNGC19 </italic>and <italic>CNGC20</italic>, which constitute one of the five CNGC subfamilies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>GUS, GFP and luciferase reporter assays were used to study the expression of <italic>CNGC19 </italic>and <italic>CNGC20 </italic>genes from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>in response to developmental cues and salt stress. <italic>CNGC19 </italic>and <italic>CNGC20 </italic>were differentially expressed in roots and shoots. The <italic>CNGC19 </italic>gene was predominantly active in roots already at early growth stages. Major expression was observed in the phloem. <italic>CNGC20 </italic>showed highest promoter activity in mesophyll cells surrounding the veins. Its expression increased during development and was maximal in mature and senescent leaves. Both genes were upregulated in the shoot in response to elevated NaCl but not mannitol concentrations. While in the root, <italic>CNGC19 </italic>did not respond to changes in the salt concentration, in the shoot it was strongly upregulated in the observed time frame (6-72 hours). Salt-induction of <italic>CNGC20 </italic>was also observed in the shoot, starting already one hour after stress treatment. It occurred with similar kinetics, irrespective of whether NaCl was applied to roots of intact plants or to the petiole of detached leaves. No differences in K and Na contents of the shoots were measured in homozygous T-DNA insertion lines for <italic>CNGC19 </italic>and <italic>CNGC20</italic>, respectively, which developed a growth phenotype in the presence of up to 75 mM NaCl similar to that of the wild type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Together, the results strongly suggest that both channels are involved in the salinity response of different cell types in the shoot.

Understanding the mechanisms, which enable growth under saline conditions is of high scientific and agricultural interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sodium uptake and distribution within the plant is a major determinant for the salt sensitivity of a plant. Sustained exposure to elevated salt concentrations leads to the transfer and accumulation of NaCl in the shoot tissue, where it can inhibit leaf growth. Prevention of Na<sup>+ </sup>entry into the root, transport to and allocation within the leaf, and sequestration into the vacuole are strategies with which plants cope with high salt environment. Accordingly, the overexpression of the vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>antiporter NHX1, for instance, improves salt-tolerance in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Within the shoot, ion allocation can vary between cell types as found in mesophyll and epidermis of barley and wheat, where differences for K<sup>+ </sup>and Cl<sup>- </sup>were measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Na<sup>+ </sup>can either be retained in older leaves reducing transport to young organs or translocated to petioles and leaf margins to protect the lamina from excessive entry of salt as described for <italic>Medicago citrine </italic>and <italic>Ricinus communis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Hence, control of Na<sup>+ </sup>and K<sup>+ </sup>fluxes on the whole plant level guarantees the maintenance of a high cytosolic K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup>-ratio, which is crucial for growth in saline soils. In Arabidopsis, transporters contributing to Na<sup>+ </sup>homeostasis include plasma membrane (SOS1) and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>antiporters (e.g. NHX1), and the plasma membrane uniporter HKT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p><italic>AtSOS1 </italic>is expressed in epidermal cells at the root tip and in xylem parenchyma cells of roots and shoots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Altogether, data showed that SOS1 controls Na<sup>+ </sup>extrusion out of the root and long-distance transport, limiting Na<sup>+ </sup>accumulation in plant cells. The ability of tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum) </italic>plants to retain Na<sup>+ </sup>in the stems, and thus to prevent Na<sup>+ </sup>from reaching the photosynthetic tissues, is largely dependent on the function of <italic>Sl</italic>SOS1, the functional homolog of <italic>At</italic>SOS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>While NHX1 and SOS1 export Na<sup>+ </sup>from the cytosol on the expense of the proton gradient, Na<sup>+ </sup>entry follows its electrochemical gradient. Members of two gene families, the high affinity K<sup>+ </sup>transporter family HKT, and the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel family, CNGC, have been shown to mediate Na<sup>+ </sup>uptake and regulation of long distance transport. Proteins belonging to the HKT family control Na<sup>+ </sup>unloading in the xylem of Arabidopsis, rice and wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and therefore control the long-distance transport of Na<sup>+ </sup>to the leaf. The Arabidopsis genome contains a single <italic>HKT </italic>homolog, <italic>AtHKT1</italic>, which belongs to the subfamily of HKT transporters that encode low affinity Na<sup>+ </sup>uniporters. Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>At</italic>HKT1 render plants Na<sup>+ </sup>hypersensitive and disturb the distribution of Na<sup>+ </sup>between roots and shoots.</p><p>Members of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) family belong to the group of nonselective cation channels and enable the uptake of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. CNG channels are assumed to activate upon binding of cellular cAMP or cGMP to the ligand-binding site. Within the C-terminus of the channel, a partially overlapping binding domain for calmodulin allows Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin binding and is proposed to destabilize the open state. Functional expression of plant CNG channels in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes or animal cell lines has not been reproducibly successful; hence a detailed biophysical characterization of these channels including their gating and permeation characteristics still remains to be performed. The Arabidopsis CNGC gene family comprises 20 members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Phenotypical analysis of loss-of-function mutants showed that members play a role in plant growth and the response to pathogen attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. CNGC10 is involved in Arabidopsis' tolerance towards salt. Mature plants of <italic>CNGC10 </italic>antisense lines were more sensitive to salt stress and contained higher Na<sup>+ </sup>concentrations in shoots compared with wild-type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, salt-grown seedlings of the antisense lines developed longer roots compared to the wild type. Likewise, <italic>cngc3 </italic>mutant seedlings showed slightly enhanced growth in the presence of elevated NaCl or KCl concentrations compared to wild type plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. So far, members tested have been localized in the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], suggesting a direct function in cation entry into the cell.</p><p>In this study, we show that both <italic>CNGC19 </italic>and <italic>CNGC20 </italic>respond to salinity with increased gene activity and accumulation of transcripts in the shoot. Salt treatment of roots or cut leaves induced the shoot regulation of <italic>CNGC20</italic>, suggesting that NaCl itself is the root-to-shoot signal. Although the loss of either channel did not lead to a salt-related growth phenotype, the strong upregulation by NaCl underlines their role in the salinity response, which is discussed on the basis of their distinct expression pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>We investigated the expression pattern and regulation by salt stress of the group IVA of Arabidopsis CNG channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], consisting of <italic>CNGC19 </italic>and <italic>CNGC20</italic>.

To investigate possible effects of salinity on <italic>CNGC19 </italic>and <italic>CNGC20</italic>, we monitored gene activities using reporter genes and quantitative RT-PCR. When plants transformed with <italic>CNGC19p:GUS </italic>were grown for one week on half-strength MS-agar in the absence or presence of 150 mM NaCl, GUS-staining of seedlings and whole plants revealed strong promoter activity in root tissue under both control and salt stress conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D, E</xref>). In the aerial parts of the plant, the staining intensity was increased in 65% (13 out of 20) of the plants tested after the salt stress period compared to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Salt regulation of <italic>CNGC19</italic></bold>.

Luciferase activities were determined after stress application at time points indicated.

The relative luciferase luminescence in 12-day old plants was higher in root than in shoot tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C, F</xref>). The same approach was used to monitor gene regulation by NaCl treatment. After application of 200 mM NaCl to the root, <italic>CNGC19 </italic>gene activity increased only in the shoot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) but not in the root (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). The increase continued during 72 hours of salt stress, corresponding to a steady upregulation of <italic>CNGC19 </italic>gene activity. In the presence of 300 mM mannitol, <italic>CNGC19 </italic>was not affected in the same manner, indicating that the response was specific and mainly due to the ionic rather than the osmotic component of the stress. These results are well in agreement with whole genome array data on cDNA isolated from 13-day old plants, which show a time-dependent accumulation of CNGC19 transcripts in the shoot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the root, transcript levels rose transiently within the first hour after salt treatment, but returned to control levels within 6 hours.</p><p>Kilian and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] did not detect a salt-dependent regulation of <italic>CNGC20</italic>. We therefore decided to test the salt-sensitivity at developmental stages, where <italic>CNGC20 </italic>is predominantly expressed. 6-week old plants expressing luciferase under control of the <italic>CNGC20 </italic>promoter reported indeed a salt-dependent increase in <italic>CNGC20 </italic>expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>). Application of 200 mM NaCl to roots led to a significant increase of luciferase in the leaves already within one hour, which then remained elevated during two days of constant salt stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). <italic>CNGC20 </italic>was not upregulated in control conditions or in the presence of 300 mM mannitol. Kinetics of the salt response of <italic>CNGC20 </italic>indicated that tissue not directly in contact with the stress responded rapidly. To test, whether this could be due to the uptake and translocation of salt to the shoot tissue, the stress was applied directly to the leaves by putting the petioles of detached leaves into the NaCl solution. As in the root treatment, <italic>CNGC20 </italic>in the shoot responded within one hour as indicated by the increase in relative luminescence, while control treatments had no effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Salt-dependent regulation of <italic>CNGC20 </italic>was supported by quantitative RT-PCR experiments. Transcript abundance was assessed in detached leaves, revealing a salt-dependent increase of <italic>CNGC20 </italic>transcript in the shoot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), which was significantly different from controls.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Salt regulation of <italic>CNGC20</italic></bold>.

Our data point to a physiological response to the accumulation of NaCl itself rather than to an osmotic shock response. The results show that salt treatment of the root triggers a response of <italic>CNGC20 </italic>in the leaf. Such long-distance signaling from root to shoot might be mediated by hormones, such as abscisic acid (ABA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, the response of isolated leaves demonstrated that salt perception and signal transduction can take place in the aerial parts of the plant. Thus, it appears likely that the regulation of <italic>CNGC20 </italic>depends on the direct transfer of NaCl to the shoot. It remains unclear in which cell types the signal perception takes place and whether this is the same for both genes. Since <italic>CNGC19 </italic>is expressed in phloem tissue and <italic>CNGC20 </italic>in mesophyll cells nearby the phloem, it is interesting to note that the <italic>CNGC20 </italic>induction kinetics saturates much earlier compared to that of <italic>CNGC19</italic>. Whether or not this is related to the time-dependent distribution of NaCl within the shoot remains to be clarified.</p><p>Salt stress, like many other abiotic stresses, can elicit a transient increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In Arabidopsis seedlings, cGMP levels increased rapidly (<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>5 s) and to different degrees after salt and osmotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, Donaldson and colleagues provided evidence that salt stress activates two cGMP signaling pathways - an osmotic, calcium-independent pathway and an ionic, calcium-dependent pathway. It is tempting to suggest that CNGC19 and CNGC20 might be suitable candidates taking part in these early responses, possibly linking cGMP- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling.</p><p>Increased expression of <italic>CNGC20 </italic>was detected quickly within one hour. <italic>CNGC19 </italic>responded a bit slower within 24 hours. The strong induction of the expression by NaCl implies a function in the adaptation to salinity. In this respect it is interesting that salt stress affects both genes mainly in the shoot, where most dramatic changes occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Control of Na<sup>+ </sup>accumulation in the shoot is of major importance for the adaptation to salt stress. As most sensitive plants display poor ability to sequester Na<sup>+ </sup>in leaf vacuoles, they have to rely on other mechanisms to cope with the Na<sup>+ </sup>delivered to leaf cells. Both CNGC19 and CNGC20 represent possible Na<sup>+ </sup>entry pathways into cells, and could participate in the Na<sup>+ </sup>distribution within the leaf. For instance, CNGC19 could participate in Na<sup>+ </sup>sequestration into phloem parenchyma cells and CNGC20 in Na<sup>+ </sup>sequestration into the mesophyll of petioles. A translocation of Na<sup>+ </sup>to petioles is known from species that tolerate salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but might occur to a certain extent also in Arabidopsis. Since Na<sup>+ </sup>is preferentially deposited in older leaves, a role in compartmentation is supported by the fact that <italic>CNGC20 </italic>is mainly expressed in older leaves.</p><p>Expression of <italic>CNGC19 </italic>was detected in the phloem, strengthening the hypothesis about a function in phloem loading and unloading. CNGC19 could be involved in Na<sup>+ </sup>recirculation from shoots to roots, where Na<sup>+ </sup>might be extruded, or at least in Na<sup>+ </sup>redistribution between tissues. In the upper parts of the roots and in the stem, a direct transfer of sodium ions from xylem to phloem tissues is thought to play a role in the control of Na<sup>+ </sup>translocation towards the shoot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This would require Na<sup>+ </sup>uptake into the phloem. Na<sup>+ </sup>assays of the phloem sap revealed high concentrations up to 80 mM in some species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but the physiological significance of such data was interpreted contradictorily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. According to the expression pattern and expected ion channel characteristics, it is tempting to hypothesize that CNGC19, similar to AKT2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], might play a role in membrane potential stabilization and therewith might indirectly affect phloem (re)loading of metabolites.</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotypical analysis of <italic>cngc19 </italic>and <italic>cngc20 </italic>mutants</title><p>Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines from the Salk collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] were investigated with T-DNA insertions in the first (Salk_027306, <italic>cngc19-1</italic>) and fourth exon (Salk_129133, <italic>cngc20-1</italic>), respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

Although <italic>CNGC19 </italic>is expressed in the root tissue of young seedlings, <italic>cngc19-1 </italic>displayed no root growth phenotype under control or saline (50 mM NaCl) conditions. The growth was also not affected by 10 &#x003bc;M ABA compared to the wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Similarly, the germination was indistinguishable from wild type in the presence of 50 mM NaCl or 10 &#x003bc;M ABA (data not shown). However, root growth is usually less affected than leaf growth during Na<sup>+ </sup>toxicity, and the root elongation rate recovers remarkably well after exposure to NaCl or other osmotica [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Regarding the whole plant, it is primarily the mature leaf where Na<sup>+ </sup>toxicity is manifested. As both <italic>CNGC19 </italic>and <italic>CNGC20 </italic>are upregulated in shoot tissue of salt-stressed plants, we compared the shoot growth of mutants and wild type. After a 5 day growth period on half-strength MS-agar, seedlings were transferred to agar plates containing 0, 25, 50, or 75 mM NaCl and grown for another twelve days. No salt-dependent phenotype could be observed for <italic>cngc19-1 </italic>and <italic>cngc20-1 </italic>mutants compared to the wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E, F</xref>).</p><p>To test if Na<sup>+ </sup>or K<sup>+ </sup>accumulation is affected in the mutants, contents were determined with ICP. Although the plants displayed a reduction of fresh weights with increasing NaCl content in the media (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>), the K:Na content ratio of wild type and mutant shoots of plants grown for twelve days on plates containing 0, 25, 50 or 75 mM NaCl did not differ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>). These findings suggest that both uptake of sodium/potassium and extrusion of Na<sup>+ </sup>are unaltered in the mutants.</p><p>Phenotypic characterization of loss-of-channel mutants does not allow deducing an explicit role of CNGC19 and CNGC20 during the nonselective uptake of Na<sup>+ </sup>during salt stress. Due to their expression pattern, they could be involved in salt stress-dependent signal transduction or distribution of sodium throughout the plant. In the mesophyll and the root cortex, the specific role of CNGC20 might be masked by the activity of other nonselective cation channels having partially redundant functions. <italic>CNGC20 </italic>and <italic>CNGC3</italic>, for instance, are both expressed in the root cortex. <italic>Cngc3 </italic>loss-of-function mutants grew slightly better in the presence of 40 to 80 mM NaCl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This together with short and long-term Na<sup>+ </sup>influx experiments led to the conclusion that CNGC3 is functioning in sodium (and potassium) influx. Only during initial stages of salt stress, CNGC3 contributed considerably to Na<sup>+ </sup>influx. Its participation in ion uptake in salinity-adapted plants seems to be limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In leaves, CNGC10 was located in the plasma membrane of mesophyll, palisade parenchyma and epidermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Mature plants of <italic>CNGC10 </italic>antisense lines were more sensitive towards salt stress and their shoots contained higher Na<sup>+ </sup>concentrations compared with wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. GUS staining showed that <italic>CNGC10 </italic>expression in leaves is patchy; it comprised vascular tissue and mesophyll (B. K&#x000f6;hler, unpublished results). Thus, at least a partially redundant function to CNGC20 appears possible.</p><p>Apart from pollen-specific CNGCs, the CNGCs investigated so far show a broad expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. By comparison, expression of <italic>CNGC19 </italic>is relatively confined. Thus, further cell-type specific functional assays are required to assess its physiological role <italic>in planta</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>CNGC19 </italic>is expressed in the phloem and <italic>CNGC20 </italic>in the epidermis and the mesophyll, mainly in petioles. Upon salinity, both genes are upregulated within hours in the shoot, where most dramatic changes happen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Salt-dependent regulation of <italic>CNGC20 </italic>occurred in the shoot, irrespective of whether NaCl was applied to the roots of intact plants or to the petioles of detached leaves. At first glance, it seems puzzling that a cell promotes the upregulation of genes encoding proteins that provide Na<sup>+ </sup>entry pathways and therefore would contribute to increase the cytosolic sodium levels. However, under severe salt stress, CNG channels represent a fast and effective way to redistribute sodium throughout the whole plant. The fact that both <italic>CNGC19 </italic>and <italic>CNGC20 </italic>were upregulated by salt rather than by osmolytes indicates a role in salt adaptation. Therefore we propose a distributive role for CNGC19 and CNGC20 enabling the plant to cope with toxic effects caused by salt stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>Col-0 ecotype and transgenic plants in Col-0 background were used.
