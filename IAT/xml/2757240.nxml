Binding to heparin increases the stability of FGF1 and is believed to be important in the formation of FGF1&#x000b7;fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) active complex. In order to reveal the function of heparin in FGF1&#x000b7;FGFR complex formation and signaling, we constructed several FGF1 variants with reduced affinity for heparin and with diverse stability. We determined their biophysical properties and biological activities as well as their ability to translocate across cellular membranes. Our study showed that increased thermodynamic stability of FGF1 nicely compensates for decreased binding of heparin in FGFR activation, induction of DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation. By stepwise introduction of stabilizing mutations into the K118E (K132E) FGF1 variant that shows reduced affinity for heparin and is inactive in stimulation of DNA synthesis, we were able to restore the full mitogenic activity of this mutant. Our results indicate that the main role of heparin in FGF-induced signaling is to protect this naturally unstable protein against heat and/or proteolytic degradation and that heparin is not essential for a direct FGF1-FGFR interaction and receptor activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>FGF1 (fibroblast growth factor 1) belongs to a family of polypeptide growth factors comprising in humans 22 structurally related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The signaling induced by the growth factor leads to a wide range of cellular responses during development as well as in adult life, such as growth regulation, differentiation, survival, stress response, migration, and proliferation of different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The biological activity of FGF1 is exerted through binding to four high affinity cell surface receptors (FGFR1&#x02013;4), resulting in receptor dimerization and transphosphorylation in its tyrosine kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The activated FGFR<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> induces cellular response by initiating several signaling cascades, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and phospholipase C-&#x003b3; (PLC-&#x003b3;) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>In addition to FGFRs, FGF1 binds to heparan sulfates (HS) associated with proteoglycans at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Among the physiological sugars, the highest affinity for FGF1 is shown by heparin, a widely used linear, highly sulfated polysaccharide composed of 2-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated iduronic acid and 6-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated, <italic>N</italic>-sulfated glucosamine units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Despite many years of research, there is still controversy regarding the molecular role of heparin/HS in FGF1- and FGF2-induced signaling. Thus, the question of whether or not the linkage of two molecules of the growth factor by heparin/HS is an absolute prerequisite for induction of FGFR dimerization is still open. Numerous studies have concluded that the presence of heparin/HS is obligatory for FGF signaling. It is widely believed that heparin/HS is directly involved in receptor dimerization and is critical for mitogenic response stimulated by the growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, several authors working on FGF1 and FGF2 have suggested that there is no mandatory requirement for heparin for the assembly and activation of the FGF&#x000b7;FGFR complex. They imply that heparin only plays a role in association of two molecules of the growth factor and therefore facilitates their binding to FGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). It has been reported that FGF1 and FGF2 can interact with the FGFR and trigger phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK and activation of other signaling pathways even in the absence of HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>The accepted role of heparin/HS in FGF1 signaling is to prevent the degradation of the growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The interaction with heparin or HS protects FGF1 against heat, acidic pH, and proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). HS also seems to regulate the activity of different FGFs by creating their local reservoir and generating a concentration gradient of the growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>The binding of FGF1 to heparin/HS is mediated by specific residues forming a positively charged patch on the protein surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The major contribution is made by Lys<sup>118</sup> (Lys<sup>132</sup> in the full-length numbering system), which was identified by Harper and Lobb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and Lys<sup>112</sup> and Arg<sup>122</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Additional residues of FGF1 involved in the interaction with heparin are the positively charged Lys<sup>113</sup>, Arg<sup>119</sup>, and Lys<sup>128</sup> and the polar Asn<sup>18</sup>, Asn<sup>114</sup>, and Gln<sup>127</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Site-directed mutagenesis and other studies have revealed the importance of Lys<sup>118</sup> not only in heparin binding but also for the biological function of FGF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). It was shown that the K118E (K132E) mutant is inactive in stimulation of DNA synthesis, although its affinity for FGFR and the ability to activate signaling cascades is not reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Despite extensive research, the reason for the lack of mitogenic potential of K118E FGF1 is still not clear.</p><p>In this paper, we verified the function of heparin in FGF1&#x000b7;FGFR complex formation and signaling by constructing several FGF1 mutants with reduced affinity for heparin. To recover the stability of these variants, which could no longer be stabilized by heparin, we supplemented them stepwise with stabilizing mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). We analyzed thoroughly their biological activity and their ability to translocate across cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).

None of the single lysine substitutions that reduced the affinity of FGF1 for heparin altered the affinity of the growth factor for the receptor, since there were no differences in the ability of the mutants to compete with the wild type [<sup>125</sup>I]FGF1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.001289/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>). This indicates that neither of the mutated residues is involved in the interactions with the high affinity receptor. However, variants containing the K112N/K118E double substitution were slightly less effective in competing out the labeled wild type FGF1. This discrepancy can be explained by the conditions of the experiment. For efficient <sup>125</sup>I-labeling of FGF1, the presence of heparin is required, which causes effective dimerization of the growth factor in solution. Therefore, during the course of the experiment, the kinetics of receptor binding favors the dimerized labeled wild type FGF1 over the monomeric mutants with strongly reduced ability to bind free heparin.</p><p>We also tested receptor dimerization monitored as autophoshorylation of the receptor upon stimulation by the wild type FGF1 or its mutants.

Since the mitogenic potential of FGF1 is responsible for one of the crucial functions of the growth factor, stimulation of cell proliferation, we first checked the ability of the mutants to stimulate DNA synthesis in the presence and absence of heparin. This assay can be considered a long term response experiment, since it requires the survival of the growth factor in the medium for an extended period of time, over 12 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of the wild type FGF1 or FGF1 mutants in the absence or presence of 10 units/ml heparin.

The K112N variant, which demonstrated the highest thermodynamic stability among the single mutants, was as mitogenically potent as the wild type in the presence of heparin. On the other hand, the K118N mutant, which was the least stable one, was also the least efficient in stimulating thymidine incorporation. The next in the rank was the K118E mutant, which had the most severely reduced affinity for heparin. In contrast to the wild type and the mutants that exhibited less affected heparin binding (K112N, K112A, K112E, and K118A), we did not observe any difference in the mitogenic activity in the absence and presence of heparin for the K118E mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>panel I</italic>). These results suggest that the significantly reduced ability of the growth factor to stimulate DNA synthesis could be mainly caused by the loss of the heparin protection.</p><p>To test this possibility, we constructed series of mutants containing the K112N and/or K118E mutations and stabilizing substitutions in different combinations. Introduction of the stabilizing mutations into the K118E variant compensated for the lack of heparin protection and recovered the ability of the growth factor to stimulate mitogenesis regardless of the presence of heparin at the level of the wild type in the presence of heparin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>panel II</italic>). All of the mutants with the K118E substitution behaved similarly in the presence and absence of heparin. We also observed a similar effect for a series of FGF1 variants containing the K112N mutation in the absence of heparin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>panel III</italic>). This single mutation did not reduce heparin affinity as strongly as the K118E substitution did. Nevertheless, the introduction of the stabilizing mutations was also able to improve the mitogenic potential of the K112N variant. We also tested mutants of different stability containing the double substitution (K112N/K118E) in the heparin-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>panel IV</italic>). These mutants exhibited strongly reduced affinity for heparin and could be considered as unable to bind to the cell surface heparans. All of them behaved similarly with respect to the mitogenic properties regardless of the presence of heparin. We also observed a stepwise effect of the stabilizing mutations on the mitogenic activity. However, even the most potent combination of stabilizing substitutions (Q40P, S47I, and H93G) could not elicit a mitogenic response comparable with that of the wild type FGF1 in the presence of heparin. The mutant 3x/K112N/K118E exhibited an approximately 5 times lower mitogenic activity than the wild type in the presence of heparin.</p><p>A possible explanation of these data is that in the absence of heparin, cell surface heparans can still enable growth factor dimerization, despite the fact that they are not able to assure protection of FGF1. This is strongly supported by the behavior of the wild type FGF1 in the absence of heparin and its highly (but not completely) reduced mitogenic activity. For the mutants with the K112N/K118E substitution, even when they are very stable, the lack of affinity for heparans can change the kinetics of receptor binding. In such a case, higher concentrations of the growth factor are necessary to induce full mitogenic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Proliferation of NIH 3T3 Cells in Response to Stimulation by FGF1 Mutants</title><p>As shown above, we observed considerable differences in the mitogenic activity of FGF1 mutants with the same heparin affinity but different stability. To further investigate the effect of stabilizing mutations on the biological activity of FGF1, we studied the ability of selected FGF1 variants to induce proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells. The cells were incubated for 72 h with 100 ng/ml FGF1 in the presence or absence of heparin; therefore, such an experiment can be considered a long term response assay. We found that the mutants with higher stability exhibited a prolonged ability to stimulate proliferation as compared with wild type FGF1, even when they had a reduced affinity for heparin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). The effect was particularly significant in the absence of heparin. The wild type induced almost no cell proliferation without heparin as compared with the control (non-stimulated cells). Introduction of the stabilizing mutations gradually enhanced the ability of FGF1 to stimulate cell proliferation. The most active variant in this assay was the 3x/K112N mutant, which stimulated the proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells without heparin almost twice as effectively as the wild type in the absence of heparin. The second in the rank among the mutants tested in the proliferation test was the 3x/K112N/K118E mutant, which was very stable but had an extremely reduced affinity for heparin. In this case, similarly to the 3x/K118E mutant, the extent of cell proliferation induced 72 h after the addition of the growth factor was the same in the presence and absence of heparin. Once again, for K112N/K118E, 2x/K112N/K118E, and 3x/K112N/K118E mutants, a stepwise compensation of the stabilizing mutations for the protective effect of heparin was visible.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Stimulation of cell proliferation by FGF1 mutants.</bold> Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml wild type or FGF1 mutant in the presence and absence of heparin.

The K112A, K112E, K118A, and K118E mutations did not seem to influence appreciably the susceptibility of FGF1 to proteolysis, similarly to its thermodynamic stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>).</p><p>The K112N and K112N/K118E mutants turned out to be more resistant to trypsin digestion than the wild type, and only after 30 min of incubation with the protease at a molar ratio 1:80 were they totally digested. As expected, introduction of the stabilizing mutations to the K112N and K118E variants increased gradually their resistance to enzymatic degradation in the absence of heparin. Combination of Q40P, S47I, and H93G substitutions dramatically slowed the proteolytic processing extending the protein half-life 15 times in the case of the 3x/K118E variant and over 25 times for the 3x/K112N mutant. We could observe a synergistic effect of the stabilizing mutations for the 2x/K112N/K118E and 3x/K112N/K118E variants, for which even after 1 h of trypsin digestion (at a molar ratio of 1:80) there was no distinct fragmentation, and the intensity of the band corresponding to the intact form of FGF1 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>). For a higher trypsin concentration (ratio of 1:20), all mutants demonstrated again a clear correlation between the conformational stability and resistance to protease action and a cumulative, protective effect of the stabilizing mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p><p>The presence of heparin strongly enhanced the resistance to proteolysis of the wild type and K112N FGF1, a mutant showing the least reduced heparin affinity of all of the analyzed mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>). For variants containing the K118E substitution, the presence of heparin only had a very slight enhancing effect on proteolytic resistance. Furthermore, all mutants with the both K118E and K112N substitutions had virtually identical protease susceptibility in the presence as well as in the absence of heparin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>). Because the binding of these mutants to heparin was strongly reduced, heparin did not exhibit any protective effect during the proteolytic degradation. This result fits very well with the thermodynamic data, since in the denaturation experiments, we observed a lack of protection by heparin during unfolding.</p></sec><sec><title>In Vivo FGF1 Degradation</title><p>To test <italic>in vivo</italic> the results obtained in the <italic>in vitro</italic> proteolytic digestion assay, we checked the processing of selected FGF1 mutants in NIH 3T3 cell culture at 37 &#x000b0;C.

The lack of degradation of the 3x/K112N/K118E mutant confirms the protective effect of the K112N mutation. Similar results were obtained for the cell lysates in the absence of heparin. There was no evident reduction in the amount of the mutants, whereas the degradation of the wild type protein was clearly visible after 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>A</italic>).</p><p>We observed almost no difference in <italic>in vivo</italic> processing in the presence and absence of heparin for the mutants tested. These results indicate that the stabilizing mutations significantly reduce <italic>in vivo</italic> degradation, slowing the rate of FGF1 proteolysis within the cell and in the medium to a similar extent as does the presence of heparin toward the wild type FGF1.</p><p>To further elucidate the mechanism of intracellular processing of FGF1, we performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> degradation experiment for the wild type without heparin in the absence or presence of several protein degradation inhibitors. Preincubation with lactacystin, a proteasome degradation inhibitor, showed no effect on degradation of internalized FGF1 in NIH 3T3 cells. In contrast, reduced degradation of FGF1 was observed when cells were pretreated with lysosomal degradation inhibitors, such as leupeptin, bafilomycin A1, chloroquine, and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which prevent endosomal acidification required for activity of lysomal proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>B</italic>). These data suggest that the degradation of endocytosed FGF1 is controlled by the lysosomal pathway and that proteasome is not required for this process. In the presence of the inhibitors, we also observed slight reduction of FGF1 degradation in the medium, which could be caused by the reduced amount of proteases released from the cell.</p><p>The observed effect of inhibitors was similar to the effect of stabilizing mutations, suggesting that low stability of FGF1 makes the protein more susceptible to lysosomal degradation. This, again, confirms that increased stability protects FGF1 inside and outside the cell against proteolytic processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Translocation of FGF Variants into Cells</title><p>FGF1, similarly to FGF2, is able to cross the cellular membrane and to be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).

In this way, translocation of exogenously added FGF1 to the cytosol and nucleus can be monitored independently of its <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation. NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with FGF1 variants for 6 h and then fractionated into cytosolic, nuclear, and membrane fractions, as described under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures.&#x0201d; The membrane fraction, which represents growth factor from intracellular vesicles, can be considered as a loading control. To verify the quality of the fractionation procedure, we analyzed lysates from each fraction using antibodies against marker proteins for different compartments (data not shown).</p><p>Both in the presence and absence of heparin, all FGF1 mutants tested were detected in all three fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>B</italic>). Interestingly, the wild type FGF1, which translocated nicely in the presence of heparin, was found neither in the cytosol nor in the nucleus in the absence of heparin, which was also seen using the phosphorylation method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). The presence of all of the mutants in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions indicates that reduced heparin binding not only does not disturb the translocation of the growth factor in the presence of heparin but also enables its entry into the cell in the absence of heparin.</p><p>In all of these experiments, translocation of FGF1 to the cytosol and nucleus could be blocked by bafilomycin A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>), which was used as a negative control.

The crystal structures of FGF1 and FGF2 complexes with FGFR solved in the presence of heparin clearly demonstrate its importance in complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Nevertheless, several reports question the direct requirement for heparin/HS in the assembly of a functional FGF&#x000b7;FGFR complex, stimulation of the signaling pathways, and generation of the mitogenic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Also, kinetic studies of FGF2&#x000b7;FGFR complex formation have revealed that in the presence of heparin, the dissociation rate constant is only 1 order of magnitude lower than in its absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we hypothesized that the main role of heparin is to protect FGF1 against heat and protease(s) under physiological conditions and that it is not required to form a functional FGF&#x000b7;FGFR complex. Free growth factor is a highly unstable protein with a denaturation temperature of about 40 &#x000b0;C at neutral pH, which means that a significant fraction of FGF1 is fully unfolded at physiological conditions and therefore prone to proteolysis. It is well documented that the addition of heparin effectively stabilizes the FGF1 molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Since the mitogenic potential of FGF1 is tested in assays taking at least 12 h, it is not clear whether the presence of heparin has a direct effect on the functional signaling complex or just a protective role. In our previous report, we showed that introduction of stabilizing mutation(s), either single or multiple, significantly improved the proteolytic resistance of free FGF1 and prolonged its biological action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Here, we applied the three most stabilizing mutations in combination, increasing the <italic>T</italic><sub>den</sub> of FGF1 by about 23 &#x000b0;C, to compensate for the absence of interaction with heparin, by providing the necessary protection against heat or protease(s).</p><p>We studied the biological and biophysical properties of a series of 17 variants of FGF1: six single mutants (substituting lysines at position 112 or 118 responsible for heparin binding with Ala, Glu, or Asn), one double lysine mutant (K112N/K118E), and 10 multiple mutants carrying mutations at position 112 and/or 118 together with different combinations of the three stabilizing mutations (Q40P, S47I, and H93G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). All FGF1 variants comprising mutation(s) at the heparin binding site exhibited reduced affinity for immobilized heparin as probed by the elution profile from a heparin-Sepharose column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). A stepwise introduction of the stabilizing mutations in these variants did not affect the respective elution profiles, in agreement with the crystal structure of the Q40P/S47I/H93G variant, which shows that the global conformation and the heparin binding site are not affected in the triple mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). As expected, in the case of all variants, the introduction of stabilizing mutations resulted in a significant shift in <italic>T</italic><sub>den</sub> values, up to 64.1 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>To verify the biological competence of the constructed mutants, we measured their activities in a series of experiments. Depending on the time scale of the test, we distinguish two classes of assays. In the short time response tests (time scale of minutes) we checked the ability of the mutants to bind to the receptor, activate it, and stimulate downstream signaling cascades. Long time response experiments (time scale of at least 12 h) included the stimulation of DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and <italic>in vivo</italic> degradation. As shown earlier, sensitivity to heat denaturation and/or proteolysis can be revealed only in long time response experiments that are performed at 37 &#x000b0;C in cell culture containing extracellular proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>All of the mutants containing single substitutions that reduced heparin affinity (with or without the stabilizing mutations) showed no differences in competitive receptor binding, co-localization of phosphorylated receptors with early endosomes, and activation of FGF1 signaling pathways, as compared with the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results indicate that none of the mutated residues are involved in the interactions with the high affinity receptor and that full short term activation of FGFR takes place even when the growth factor is defective in heparin binding.</p><p>However, in the case of the K112N/K118E mutants, the most defective ones in heparin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), a reduced signaling activation was observed at a low concentration (5 ng/ml) of the growth factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). As expected, this effect could be overcome by using a high concentration of the FGF1 mutants (50 ng/ml). In this case, there was no difference in the level of signaling between the mutants containing the double substitution K112N/K118E and the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>For all variants, we tested the most crucial activity of the growth factor, its mitogenic potential. It was shown that a maximal mitogenic response requires the presence of a stable FGF1&#x000b7;FGFR complex over 12 h and that short term activation of the signaling pathways is not sufficient for stimulation of DNA synthesis by FGF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). As is commonly done, we measured the ability of all of the mutants to stimulate cellular DNA synthesis after 24 h of incubation with the growth factor. All single mutants with reduced heparin affinity exhibited a significantly decreased ability to stimulate DNA synthesis. This could be due to the lack of protection of the growth factors provided by heparin and, in consequence, their higher susceptibility to proteases. Since we did not observe any difference in the activation of the signaling cascades in the case of the single mutants with reduced affinity for heparin, we concluded that the observed differences in the mitogenic potential of the variants were mainly due to differences in their stability and half-life.</p><p>This view is supported by the findings that full mitogenic activity could be restored to the K118E and K112N mutants when their stability was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Introduction of the stabilizing mutations protected the growth factor with reduced heparin affinity sufficiently to compensate for the deficiency in heparin binding and ensured the survival of the proteins for a long time. Also, in the case of mutants containing a double substitution in the heparin-binding site (K112N/K118E), we observed a stepwise effect of the stabilizing mutations on the DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>We also studied the effect of the heparin-binding site mutations in combination with the stabilizing substitutions on the ability of selected FGF1 variants to induce cell proliferation. In accordance with the effects on DNA synthesis, we found that increased stability provided prolonged ability to stimulate proliferation even when heparin affinity was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>The compensating effect of the stabilizing mutations for the handicapped heparin protection was further demonstrated by testing the susceptibility of the FGF1 mutants to <italic>in vitro</italic> proteolysis and <italic>in vivo</italic> degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figs. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The results of the trypsin digestion experiments were in excellent agreement with the thermodynamic stabilities and correlated nicely with the mitogenic activity assay and half-life experiments. This, again, confirms that the lack of mitogenic potential of the mutants with reduced heparin affinity reflects the lack of protection against heat/proteolysis and not their reduced functionality. We also observed that the degradation of endocytosed FGF1 was prevented by the lysosomal degradation inhibitors, which protect the growth factor in the absence of heparin to a similar extent as stabilizing mutations.</p><p>Our data showing a positive mitogenic effect of mutational stabilization of the K118E (K132E) variant are consistent with the results published by Klingenberg <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). They showed that the double mutant C131S/K132E, with a cysteine substitution increasing significantly the half-life of FGF1, showed a higher mitogenic activity than the single K132E mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Also, a recent paper of Imamura and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>) revealed that in BaF3 cells lacking the capacity to synthesize glycosaminoglycans, an FGF1:FGF2 chimeric protein (FGFC) was able to activate FGFR and induce cell proliferation in the absence of heparin. Similarly to our constructs, FGFC was more stable and resistant to protease digestion than FGF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).</p><p>Our results are also in good agreement with the many studies on FGF2 suggesting that, in the absence of heparin, active FGF2&#x000b7;FGFR complex can still be formed. Fannon and Nugent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) found that in Balb/c3T3 cells lacking HS due to complete inhibition of proteoglycan sulfation, FGF2 was able to bind to the receptor, induce the signaling, and stimulate DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. They clearly showed that HS worked by decreasing the rate of dissociation from FGFR but not altering the rate of FGF2 association and therefore had a stabilizing effect on the FGF2&#x000b7;FGFR complex. Also, Delehedde <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) showed that in sulfated glycosaminoglycan-deficient cells generated by sodium chlorate treatment, FGF2 was unable to stimulate DNA synthesis; however, it was able to trigger a transient phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK. Finally, several other studies have reported heparin/HS-independent binding of FGF2 to its receptor, showing that the expression of early genes upon FGF2 stimulation is induced to the same extent in the presence and absence of heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). It was also found that mutations in the heparin-binding region of FGF2 had no effect on its affinity for the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) and that in heparan sulfate-deficient Chinese hamster ovary 677 cells, FGF2 was not completely dependent on heparin/HS for activation of FGFR1 tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>The presented results are consistent with the symmetric &#x0201c;two-end&#x0201d; crystallographic model of FGF&#x000b7;FGFR interaction, which allows for receptor dimerization in the absence of heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). In this model, heparin promotes coupling of two FGF&#x000b7;FGFR halves, but the formation of the FGF&#x000b7;FGFR dimer is dependent on protein-protein contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>).</p><p>The presence of HS on the cell surface can affect the efficiency of receptor-mediated translocation of FGF1 into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Analysis of the cellular localization of wild type FGF1 and its mutants with reduced affinity for heparin showed striking differences in their behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). In the presence of heparin, wild type FGF1 and all of its variants were effectively translocated into the cell (to the cytosol and nucleus). However, in the absence of heparin, the wild type did not cross the cellular membrane barrier, in clear contrast to all of the mutants studied here.</p><p>In the absence of heparin, wild type FGF1 binds to FGFR but also to the abundant heparan sulfates on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Several reports show that in contrast to the binding of FGF1 to FGFR, its binding to cell surface heparans does not result in its functional translocation, instead directing the growth factor to the lysosome, where it is degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). The FGF1 mutants with low heparin affinity studied here can bind effectively only to FGFR and therefore can be efficiently translocated into the cytosol/nucleus. Because the affinity for heparin of wild type FGF1 is much higher than that for heparans, it seems that the increased level of heparin in specific stress conditions might be aiding efficient translocation of the growth factor. Such a mechanism may be important in regulating the intracellular fate of the growth factor. In this paper, we also confirmed that the translocation process is not influenced by FGF1 stability, which is in good agreement with our earlier studies. It was shown that stable, cross-linked FGF1 mutants were translocated to the cytosol and the nucleus equally well as the wild type FGF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). On the other hand, we have reported that several mutants with decreased stability can also be effectively translocated across the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>Surface heparans may play an important regulatory role by creating a local reservoir of FGF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Since the concentration of heparin in normal blood is very low, it is likely that any free growth factor tends to become bound to surface heparans on the cells close to the site of production, which prevents its diffusion far away. This can be crucial, since growth factors may have biological activities that should be limited to a defined location. An example is FGF8, which ensures correct localization of asymmetric organs and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). The fact that the growth factor is very sensitive to proteolysis when not bound to heparin or heparans may be a backup system ensuring that runaway molecules are destroyed before they can act at a wrong location. We conclude that an increased stability of FGF1 can compensate for reduced heparin binding and that the main role of heparin/HS is to protect FGF1 against proteolytic degradation and in this way prolong the signal from the FGF&#x000b7;FGFR complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_37_25388__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.001289_jbc.M109.001289-1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education Grant N N301 4192 33, by the Norwegian Cancer Society, by Raquel and Chr.
