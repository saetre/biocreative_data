We previously used a tetracycline-inducible stable mammalian cell line, HEK293S-TetR, for regulated high-level expression of G-protein coupled receptors. We here report successfully using this method for high-level expression of <italic>de novo</italic> oligo-DNA assembled human CD81 gene. CD81 is a member of the vital tetraspanin membrane protein family. It has recently been identified as the putative receptor for the Hepatitis C Virus envelope E2 glycoprotein (HCV-E2). In this study we used a single-step rho-1D4-affinity purification method to obtain &#x0003e;95&#x00025; purity from HEK293S-TetR-inducible stable cell lines. Using ELISA assay we determined that the affinity of the purified CD81 receptor for HCV-E2 protein is 3.8&#x000b1;1.2 nM. Using fluorescent confocal microscopy we showed that the inducibly overexpressed CD81 receptor in HEK293S-TetR cells is correctly located on the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that the combination of high-level expression of CD81 with efficient single-step immunoaffinity purification is a useful method for obtaining large quantities of CD81 membrane receptor suitable for detailed structural analyses of this elusive tetraspanin protein. Furthermore, this simple single-step immunoaffinity purification to high purity of membrane protein could be useful broadly for other membrane protein purifications, thus accelerating the determination of structures for large numbers of difficult-to-obtain membrane proteins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recently enormous advancement has been made in high-resolution protein structural determinations, there are more than 50,000 protein structures and protein-complexes currently available in the Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do</ext-link>).

One of the reasons of lacking membrane protein structures is largely due to the notoriously difficult steps to purify large quantity of stable and functional membrane proteins. In order to accelerate membrane protein structural studies, new and simple methods are crucial.</p><p>A very interesting and important class of integral membrane proteins is tetraspanins, which is a diverse family that comprises four transmembrane (TM) helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002314-Hemler1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002314-GarciaEspaa1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Hepatitis C Virus is one of the leading causes of chronic liver diseases. According to a World Health Organization report, &#x0223c;3&#x00025; of the human population is infected by HCV (WHO, 2002). Previously it has been shown that a recombinant soluble portion of CD81, designated CD81-LEL, binds to HCV-E2 with an affinity of 1.8 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002314-Pileri1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, structural information on members of the tetraspanin family is rather limited. Of the relevant two studies, one reported on a high-resolution crystal structure of the CD81-LEL soluble domain fragment at 1.6&#x000c5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002314-Kitadokoro1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, while a Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) study described a 6&#x000c5; resolution structure of the entire tetraspanin, uroplakin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002314-Min1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The cryo-EM study of uroplakin suggests that both the transmembrane and extracellular domains of uroplakins are involved in interaction with other transmembrane proteins of the tetraspanin network.</p><p>Lack of a high-resolution structure for an entire tetraspanin is due to the lack of an expression system for preparation of the integral membrane protein in large quantity required for structural studies using protein X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. We previously reported the use of a tetracycline-inducible stable mammalian cell line (HEK293S-TetR) system for high-level expression of two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) of rhodopsin and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002314-Reeves1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002314-Chelikani1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. We reasoned that we could use the same system to obtain large quantity of the elusive tetraspanin CD81. Here we report the successful use of this overexpression system with mammalian cell line for the high-level expression of CD81. We made a codon-optimized oligo-DNA/PCR synthesized gene, constructed a stable HEK293S-TetR cell line and inducibly expressed the gene. After high-level expression, we finally purified the CD81 protein using a single-step rho-1D4-affinity to near homogeneity. The yield of CD81 as visualized on immunoblots was &#x0223c;26 &#x000b5;g/3&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> cells per 15 cm tissue culture plate. By using an ELISA assay, the affinity of the purified CD81 receptor for HCV-E2 protein was estimated to be 3.8&#x000b1;1.2 nM. This simple assay, which involves in coating of the rho-1D4-antibody on ELISA plates followed by immobilization of CD81, will have applications for high-throughput screening (HTS) of libraries of small molecule inhibitors of CD81. Biochemical analysis of the purified CD81 showed no detectable post-translational modifications including N- and O-glycosylations that are normally found in other tetraspanin membrane proteins expressed in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Designed gene and mammalian overexpression</title><p>The codon optimized synthetic DNA corresponding to the human CD81 gene comprises 776 base-pairs of which 744 base-pair represents the open reading frame (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002314.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). The design and synthesis of this gene is described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> section. To ensure tightly regulated high-level expression of this potentially toxic CD81 gene, stable cell lines of CD81 were constructed using the HEK293S-TetR inducible system. A total of 32 independent clones were examined for the expression of CD81 using a dot-blot immuno-detection method. The cell line that showed the highest protein expression was selected for further studies. HEK293S-TetR cells expressing the synthetic CD81 gene were grown as monolayers in 15 cm tissue culture dishes. After induction with tetracycline and sodium butyrate for &#x0223c;44&#x02013;48 hours, the cells were collected by centrifugation and the cell pellet was quick-frozen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until purification.

The N-terminus of the purified protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing to have the amino acid sequence M/G, G/V, V/E, E/G, and G and since the C-terminus of the protein carried the rho-1D4 affinity tag, this confirmed the purified CD81 to be the full length protein.
