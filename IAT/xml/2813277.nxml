Detection of invading bacteria by the host leads to rapid activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B, followed by inflammation and eradication of the intruders. In response, some pathogens, including enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC), acquired means of blocking NF-&#x003ba;B activation. We show that inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation by EPEC involves the injection of NleE into the host cell. Importantly, we show that NleE inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B activation by preventing activation of IKK&#x003b2; and consequently the degradation of the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor, I&#x003ba;B. This NleE activity is enhanced by, but is not dependent on, a second injected effector, NleB. In conclusion, this study describes two effectors, NleB and NleE, with no similarity to other known proteins, used by pathogens to manipulate NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The innate immune system senses intruding pathogens and in response, mounts an inflammatory reaction.

These pathogens employ their type III protein secretion system (TTSS) to inject (translocate) toxic proteins (effectors) into the host cell. The injected effectors subvert normal host cell functions to benefit the bacteria (summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Dean1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). To date, 21 effectors or putative effector genes have been described for EPEC. Six of them are encoded in the LEE region that also encodes the TTSS structural genes, whereas the other 15 effector genes are distributed within three prophages and three insertion elements (IE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Iguchi1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Upon infection, bacterial PAMPs (<underline>p</underline>athogen-<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>m</underline>olecular <underline>p</underline>atterns) including LPS, flagellin, lipoproteins, and CpG DNA stimulate host cell Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the host cells, leading to a formidable immune response via the activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Doyle1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Kawai1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. NF-&#x003ba;B comprises a family of closely related transcription factors that play a key role in the expression of genes involved in inflammation, immune, and stress responses. NF-&#x003ba;B is a collective term used for homo- and heterodimeric complexes formed by the Rel/NF-&#x003ba;B proteins. In mammals, five of such proteins are known: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50 (NF-&#x003ba;B1), and p52 (NF-&#x003ba;B2). Under nonstimulating conditions, NF-&#x003ba;B is retained in the cytoplasm through its association with inhibitory proteins (I&#x003ba;Bs). A variety of signaling pathways activate I&#x003ba;B kinases (IKK) to phosphorylate I&#x003ba;B, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. This allows translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B to the nucleus, activation of NF-&#x003ba;B-regulated genes, and establishment of an inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Chen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Karin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previous reports have suggested that during infection, EPEC manipulate NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated inflammation. Initially, it was shown that EPEC activate NF-&#x003ba;B by a TTSS-dependent mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Savkovic1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Hecht1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, but later, it was reported that the TTSS is not required and that EPEC activate NF-&#x003ba;B via a TTSS-independent mechanism, presumably by activation of TLRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Berin1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Malladi1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Miyamoto1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Zhou1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken together, these reports suggest that EPEC first elicit NF-&#x003ba;B activation by a TTSS-independent mechanism and subsequently, it utilize the TTSS mechanism to mediate TTSS-dependent NF-&#x003ba;B-repression. However, the major gap in the above hypothesis is that the putative effector that presumably represses NF-&#x003ba;B activation has never been identified. In this report we confirm that EPEC block NF-&#x003ba;B activation via a TTSS-dependent mechanism and show that the NleE effector is necessary and sufficient to block NF-&#x003ba;B activation via inhibition of I&#x003ba;B phosphorylation and thus induces its stabilization. In addition, we show that a second effector, NleB, is required for better repression of NF-&#x003ba;B activation, suggesting that the function of NleB is related to that of NleE.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>EPEC inhibit I&#x003ba;B degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation by a TTSS-dependent mechanism</title><p>The ability of EPEC to either inhibit or induce NF-&#x003ba;B activation is controversial. Therefore, we re-examined this point using HeLa cells as host cells and I&#x003ba;B stability as a read-out for NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Importantly, TNF&#x003b1; treatment strongly stimulates I&#x003ba;B degradation in these cells, but under the used experimental conditions they exhibited minimal I&#x003ba;B degradation upon exposure to the PAMPs of the infecting EPEC. This allowed the uncoupling of infection and NF-&#x003ba;B activation. HeLa cells were infected with EPEC culture for 3 h, during which the bacteria injected the TTSS effectors into host cells. The infected cells were then treated with 10 ng/ml TNF&#x003b1; to activate NF-&#x003ba;B and at different time points post TNF&#x003b1;-induction, cellular lysates were subjected to western analysis.

To monitor NF-&#x003ba;B activation, we used a reporter cell line (AGS SIB02) stably expressing the NF-&#x003ba;B subunit p65 fused to GFP.

Based on this comparison, we constructed a set of 15 EPEC strains, each deleted of one EPEC-specific large chromosomal region (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000743-t001">Table 1</xref>). Altogether, 770 EPEC-specific ORFs were deleted. We then tested the capacity of each of the deleted strains to inhibit I&#x003ba;B degradation upon TNF&#x003b1; treatment. One of the strains, deleted of the IE6 region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000743-Iguchi1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, could not inhibit I&#x003ba;B degradation (data not shown).

We initially found that deletion of the IE6 region, but not of the IE2 region, caused deficiency in inhibition of I&#x003ba;B degradation (data not shown). However, the two proteins, NleE<sub>IE2</sub> and NleE<sub>IE6</sub>, are identical, apart from an internal deletion of 56 residues in NleE<sub>IE2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000743.s004">Fig. S1</xref>), and this similarity between the two proteins urged us to determine the activity of each of the two proteins. We first tested their ability to complement I&#x003ba;B destabilization in a strain deleted of <italic>nleE</italic><sub>IE6</sub>. To this end, we expressed each of them on a plasmid carrying an identical promoter and ribosomal binding site. Results showed that only NleE<sub>IE6</sub>, but not NleE<sub>IE2</sub>, was able to attenuate I&#x003ba;B degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000743-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). These results indicate that NleE<sub>IE2</sub> is either not active in the host cell or is not translocated into the host cell. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we used the above mentioned plasmid where both proteins were fused to the &#x003b2;-lactamase translocation reporter protein, BlaM. The plasmids were introduced into EPEC and the ability to translocate them into infected cells was tested. We found that both NleE<sub>IE2</sub>-BlaM and NleE<sub>IE6</sub>-BlaM were expressed at similar levels in the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000743-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Importantly, however, only NleE<sub>IE6</sub> was translocated into the host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000743-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), suggesting that NleE<sub>IE2</sub> is a cryptic effector. Cumulatively, these results define NleE<sub>IE6</sub>, but not NleE<sub>IE2</sub>, as the effector needed for inhibition of I&#x003ba;B degradation.

Briefly, HeLa cells were infected with different EPEC strains or remained uninfected. Then, cells were washed and treated for 3 h with TNF&#x003b1; and gentamycin, to kill the remaining bacteria.

Taken together these results show that (i) NleE is required for full inhibition of IL-8 expression, (ii) NleB also contributes to this repression and iii) a putative TTSS effector(s), other then NleB and NleE might function in parallel to inhibit IL-8 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>NleE is required to inhibit the EPEC-induced IL8 expression</title><p>The IL8 expression assay was found to be much more sensitive then testing translocation to the nucleus or the IkB degradation assay. This is probably since the latter are very transient events while the mRNA tends to accumulate, increasing the signal/noise ratio. Interestingly, using the IL8 expression assay we found that infection with the <italic>escV</italic> mutant was sufficient to induce IL8 expression in HeLa cells, albeit not as strong as that induced by TNF&#x003b1; (data not shown). This activation is possibly via the activity of flagellin, LPS or other PAMPs. We thus next asked whether NleE also inhibits the EPEC-induced IL8 expression. To this end we repeated the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000743-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, but TNF&#x003b1; was omitted. We found that even the non infected cells produce certain levels of IL8 mRNA, but upon infection with EPEC <italic>escV</italic> mutant we observed a &#x0223c;10 fold increase in IL8 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000743-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, the EPEC wild type (or the &#x00394;IE2 mutant) exhibited strong repression of the EPEC-induced IL8 expression. Importantly, the <italic>nleE</italic> mutant exhibited only a partial capacity to repress the self-induced IL8 expression. Similar results where observed when we used the double mutant <italic>nleBE</italic> instead of <italic>nleE</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000743.s006">Fig. S3</xref>).

Thus, we predict that additional putative effector might function in parallel to NleB and NleE to repress IL8 expression. In conclusion, our results clearly show that i) EPEC mediate a TTSS-dependent repression of self-induced IL8 expression; and ii) NleE is required for full repression of the EPEC-induced IL8 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>NleE, expressed by HeLa cells, inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B translocation to the nucleus</title><p>We next examined whether NleE is sufficient for inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation in the absence of the infecting bacteria and other putative effectors.

The TNF treatment induced strong migration of p65 to the nucleus in the untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000743-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), and in cells transfected with the negative control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000743-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> two upper panels and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000743-g005">5C</xref>).

We showed that an <italic>nleE</italic> mutant is deficient in blocking I&#x003ba;B phosphorylation and in preventing its degradation. Moreover, an <italic>nleE</italic> mutant was attenuated in blocking TNF&#x003b1;-induced NF-&#x003ba;B migration to the nucleus as well as in IL-8 expression and secretion.

Moreover, we adjusted the experimental conditions used in this study, so that the NF-&#x003ba;B activation by other bacterial PAMPs was insignificant. This facilitated the uncoupling of effector injection and NF-&#x003ba;B activation, which occurred only upon addition of TNF&#x003b1;. An alternative, although less likely explanation for the inconsistency between the two studies is that NleE functions differently in different types of cell or different cell lines.</p><p>Like EPEC, <italic>Yersinia</italic> also employs an injected effector, YopJ, to block I&#x003ba;B phosphorylation.

HeLa cells (8&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> per well, seeded in 24-well plate) were infected for 3h with different EPEC strains as indicated or remained uninfected (N/I). After 3.5 h, supernatants were replaced with 300 ul DMEM, 2&#x00025; FCS, and 50 &#x000b5;g/ml gentamycin with or without 10 ng/ml TNF&#x003b1;. After 16 h, 100 &#x000b5;l of cleared supernatant taken from each well was used for IL-8 measurements using Human CXCL8/IL-8 Quantikine immunoassay assay (R &#x00026; D), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PBS and IL-8 were used as negative and positive controls for the detection assay. The relative amounts of IL-8 are shown. The experiment was done twice in duplicates and typical results are shown. Standard errors are indicated by bars. In the case of &#x00394;<italic>escV</italic> (indicated by a vanishing colored bar), the signal was above the upper limit of the detection levels. Untreated and uninfected cells secreted &#x0223c;300 units of IL-8, whereas TNF&#x003b1; treatment induced a 10-fold increase in IL-8 secretion (&#x0223c;3000 units) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000743-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In contrast, pre-infection with wild-type EPEC or with the &#x00394;IE2 mutant (WT<sub>&#x00394;IE2</sub>), reduced IL-8 secretion below the detection levels, even upon TNF&#x003b1; treatment. Furthermore, the TTSS <italic>escV</italic> mutant was completely deficient in blocking IL-8 secretion. In conclusion, EPEC strongly reduces IL-8 secretion by a TTSS-dependent mechanism. Importantly, we found that the &#x00394;<italic>nleE</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>nleEB</italic> mutants were strongly deficient in blocking IL-8 secretion but not as deficient as the TTSS mutant (<italic>escV</italic>). These results show that (i) NleE is required for full inhibition of IL-8 secretion and (ii) other putative TTSS effector(s) might function in parallel to NleE to inhibit IL-8 expression and/or secretion.</p><p>(1.62 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000743.s005.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000743.s006"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>A mutant baring a deletion of <italic>nleBE</italic> is deficient in repressing self-activated, or TNF&#x003b1;-induced, IL8 repression.
