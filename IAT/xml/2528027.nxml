Two major EF-hand (E-helix-loop-F-helix-hand) calcium binding proteins in the retina, calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa, are important buffers of intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in neurons, and may also serve as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulators of enzymes and ion channels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study used immunohistochemistry to investigate the subcellular expression patterns of calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa, in the soma, dendrites, and the axonal compartment of rat retinal ganglion cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Antibodies for calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa labeled different cell populations in the retinal ganglion cell layer. In this layer, calretinin labeled a larger number of cells compared to calbindin-28 kDa, many, but not all, of which were displaced amacrine cells. The calbindin-28 kDa immunopositive neurons were distinct in that their somata were peripherally encircled by microtubule associated protein 1 (MAP-1) or neurofilament-200 kDa subunit (NF-200 kDa) immunofluorescence. Although somata of retinal ganglion cells contained these calcium binding proteins, neither protein was found in the dendrites or initial segments of the axons. However, both were expressed in the ganglion cell axons in nerve fiber layer. Calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa staining overlapped in some fibers and not in others. Calretinin immunofluorescence was concentrated in discrete axonal regions, which showed limited staining for calbindin-28 kDa or for NF200 kDa, suggesting its close proximity to the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>There is a clear compartmentalization of calbindin-28 kDa and calretinin distribution in retinal ganglion cells. This suggests that the two calcium binding proteins perform distinct functions in localized calcium signaling. It also indicates that rather than freely diffusing through the cytoplasm to attain a homogeneous distribution, calbindin-28 kDa and calretinin must be bound to cellular structures through interactions that are likely important for their functions.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the final output neurons of the retina, gather visual information from bipolar cells and amacrine cells by synaptic inputs from these neurons. They encode visual signals into Na+-dependent action-potentials that are transmitted along the optic nerve to higher visual centers in the brain. Both low-threshold and high-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels present in RGCs contribute to their responses (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]). Indirectly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K+ channels present in RGCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] can contribute to K+-dependent after-hyperpolarization following action potentials, which in turn can control excitability and firing patterns of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. In the dendrites of RGCs, synaptic currents have been found to activate T-type calcium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] which can augment and shape transient synaptic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can also modulate ion channels, signaling cascades, and neurotransmitter receptors locally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Impaired regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by calcium-binding proteins has been suggested to contribute to neurodegenerative processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>], and changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in RGCs have been proposed to play a role in excitatory neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], inactivation of calpain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] and other proteases, and in apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>].</p><p>Changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> are modulated by calcium binding proteins (CBPs) that act as Ca2+ buffers, and these buffers are the major determinants of the kinetics of fluctuations in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]). Calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa belong to a family of low molecular weight CBPs expressed in the retina and nervous system of vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. These proteins share approximately 59% sequence identity and 77% similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Each has six E-helix-loop-F-helix-hand (EF)-hand motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>), but only four are functional in calbindin-28 kDa and only five are active in calretinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>].</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa proteins and their sequence identity. <bold>A:</bold> Shown is a schematic representation of calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa proteins.

Structurally, they have disparate domain organizations of their EF-hand motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], and functionally, they interact with different partners in various cells. For example, in calcium signaling pathways, calbindin-28 kDa interacts with caspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>] whereas calretinin interacts with cytoskeletal components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>] and basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Under pathological conditions, such as in response to ischemia and reperfusion, their levels in RGCs are differentially altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Their distinctive functions are highlighted by their presence in distinct neuronal populations in the central nervous system (for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]), where they may serve unique roles.</p><p>The goal of the present study was to go beyond the previous studies that investigated the distribution of calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa in the rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>] and to examine the cellular and subcellular distributions of these proteins in the ganglion cell layer. This study shows that calbindin-28 kDa and calretinin have distinct compartmentalization in RGCs. This suggests that structurally certain intracellular quantities of these two CBPS must be bound to cellular structures. Functionally these bound proteins could influence subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and local Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals for immunohistochemical studies</title><p>Studies were performed using 16 1-1.5-year-old Brown Norway rats (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) and two three-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). All animals were maintained on a 12 h:12 h light-dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. Animals were light-adapted before euthanasia&#x02014;in room light that was rod saturating, at least 1 scot cd.m2. The Brown Norway rats were initially anesthetized using an intramuscular injection of 86 mg/kg ketamine and 6.5 mg/kg xylazine (Both drugs were from Vedco, St. Joseph, MO) and then euthanized by an intramuscular injection of 150&#x02013;200 mg/kg pentobarbital. The two Sprague-Dawley rats were used for immunoblotting, and were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. All animal procedures and protocols conformed to the United States Public Health Service and Institute for Laboratory Animal Research guidelines and were approved by both the University of Houston Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as well as the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation for immunohistochemistry</title><p>Following euthanasia, the eyes were rapidly excised from the orbit. A portion of the superior rectus muscle was left to indicate the superior pole of the globe. The corneas were slit with a razor blade, the lens was removed, and eyes were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. Following fixation, eyes were rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 1X PBS overnight.

The vitreous humor was removed, and relaxing cuts were made in the retinal margin to allow the retina to flatten.

In both cases, even in cells where they brightly stain the soma, staining is excluded from the dendritic arbors, with, in most cases, the CBP excluded even from the dendritic trunks closest to the soma. Similarly, although staining was found for both CBP on either side of the initial segments of RGC axons&#x02014;that is, in the somata and nerve fibers&#x02014;they were excluded from the initial segments. Thus even though the cytoplasmic staining for these CBP seems reasonably uniform, suggestive of freely diffusing soluble proteins, there are clearly mechanisms, which must involve either local binding sites or active transport, that exclude these CBP from certain regions of the cell and concentrate them in others. This phenomenon is particularly striking in the case of calretinin staining of RGC axons, which reveals punctate spots of high concentration superimposed on a diffuse background of what we presume to be cytoplasmic staining. These results have been summarized as a schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><fig id="f9" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Schematic summarizing the subcellular distribution of calbindin-28 kDa and calretinin in the different compartments of the retinal ganglion cell.

Both proteins are often regarded as contributing to shaping neuronal responses largely by serving as Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Such buffers can determine the kinetics of changes in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations; in the case of transient fluxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm through channels in the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, buffers can govern the amplitudes of such changes, as well as their time courses. The kinetics and buffering power are determined both by the intrinsic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding properties of the CBP (numbers of sites, kinetic and equilibrium constants for Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding), and by the local concentrations. Calcium binding kinetics for calretinin have not been fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>] but are expected to resemble calbindin-D28k for its relatively low-affinity buffering capacity and its fast calcium-binding kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>]. It is possible that calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa may have different binding properties to other proteins which enable it to be localized in distinct loci in the RGCs to influence local fluxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus it seems likely that the RGC dendrites and axonal initial segments either require lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity than the other regions of the cell, or that alternative CBPs serve to replace calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa in these regions. Clearly, the same must be true of those RGCs that do not contain either of these proteins in detectable amounts. It is important to note here that other calcium-binding proteins, such as parvalbumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>], are also known to be expressed in rat RGC&#x02019;s but these were not tested in this study.</p><p>In addition to simply buffering Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CBPs can be involved in direct regulation of signaling pathways by binding to and modifying the activities of cellular proteins in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent way. Whether calretinin and calbindin-28 kDa play such roles in RGCs is not known, but their irregular distribution can only be explained in terms of relatively high affinity binding to other proteins. It is possible that CBPs regulate these proteins, rather than simply being localized by them.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. David Sherry, University of Oklahoma Health Science Center, for the gracious sharing of the antibodies.
