One criterion was the protein sequence conservation between reference pathogenic genomes. A second criterion was that the corresponding gene in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>should be essential. Since thiamine pyrophosphate is an essential product involved in a variety of metabolic pathways, proteins responsible for its production satisfied these two criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report the enzymatic characterization and the crystallographic structure of the <italic>Candida albicans </italic>Thiamine pyrophosphokinase.

Together with the crystallographic structures of the enzyme/substrate complexes this suggests the existence of a secondary, less specific, nucleotide binding site in the <italic>Candida albicans </italic>thiamine pyrophosphokinase which could transiently serve during the release or the binding of ATP. The structures also highlight a conserved Glutamine residue (Q138) which could interact with the ATP &#x003b1;-phosphate and act as gatekeeper. Finally, the TPK/Thiamine-PNP complex is consistent with a one step mechanism of pyrophosphorylation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Our laboratory runs a structural genomics project (PROFUN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]) targeting fungal protein-coding genes in search of new anti-fungal targets. The main goal of this project is to quantitatively express the selected <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>Candida albicans </italic>genes products to characterize them functionally and structurally as well as explore their potential as new drug targets. The genes selected in <italic>Candida albicans </italic>are of two types: 1) they have orthologous genes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>that are essential or 2) they are conserved in pathogenic fungal genomes and can be absent from the non-pathogenic yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p><italic>Candida albicans </italic>is a diploid organism with eight sets of homologous chromosomes and a genome size of about 32 Mb. This pathogen is part of the normal microflora of the human gastrointestinal tract or oropharynx and is responsible for various nosocomial infections, potentially lethal in immunocompromised patients or patients in the intensive care unit. The CA1462 protein is encoded by a gene conserved across all known fungal genomes. It shares 36% sequence identity with <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>YOR143C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], a Thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK, EC 2.7.6.2) essential for fungus growth and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This enzyme is also essential in <italic>S. pombe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The production of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), catalyzed by TPK, is critical for both catabolic and anabolic cellular processes. In vertebrates, a deficiency in thiamine synthesis is linked to neurological diseases such as beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In all synthesizing organisms, thiamine (vitamin B1) is produced from phosphorylated HET (4-methyl-5-(&#x003b2;-hydroxymethyl)thiazole) and HMP (2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-pyrimidine) that are condensed into thiamine phosphate. In yeast, this thiamine phosphate is then hydrolyzed into thiamine before pyrophosphorylation by the TPK that catalyzes the transfer of a pyrophosphate (PPi) from ATP to thiamine, resulting in AMP and TPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>This article reports the enzymatic characterization as well as the structure determination of the <italic>Candida albicans </italic>CA1462 Thiamine pyrophosphokinase in complex with both thiamine and thiamine-PNP (TPNP). We also present a comparison of CA1462 with the structure of the mouse TPK ternary complex with pyrithiamine pyrophosphate and AMP (PDB id <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2F17">2F17</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], with the TPK <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>structure (PDB id <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1IG0">1IG0</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and with sequences from other species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>General cloning strategy</title><p>The cDNAs corresponding to the TPK genes were amplified by PCR from their respective genomic DNAs (CA1462: <italic>Candida albicans </italic>strain NIH 3147 ATCC number MYA-2876D; YOR143C:<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>strain NRRL Y-53 ATCC number 2601D-5). Gene cloning was performed using the ligation-independent cloning (LIC) method based on ligation of sticky ends generated by T4 DNA polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For the purpose of the PROFUN project, we constructed a specific expression vector, pSF-04 (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) Patent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], compatible with LIC cloning using the following procedure. The <italic>Eco</italic>RI+<italic>Bam</italic>HI region of PQE60 was inserted in pQE80L vector where <italic>Xho</italic>I, <italic>Nco</italic>I and <italic>Mfe</italic>I sites have been mutated.

This PCR product was inserted at the 3'end of the LacZ encoding gene into <italic>Xho</italic>I+<italic>Bam</italic>HI sites yielding the pSF-04 expression vector that expresses the GFP in C-terminal fusion with the targeted gene. <italic>Not</italic>1 restriction sites (GCGGCCGC) flanking the GFP encoding gene allows its removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning and expression screening of CA1462 and YOR143C TPK genes</title><p>PCR amplifications were performed using primers specific for CA1462 and YOR143C TPK genes preceded by 5'-CATCACCATCAATTG (Direct primer) and 5'-TCACCATCCAATTG (Reverse Primer) together with purified <italic>Candida albicans </italic>and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>genomic DNA as template. The PCR products were directly purified using the NucleoSpin Extract kit (Macherey Nagel). Then 0.2 pmol of the purified PCR product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of 2.5 mM of dCTP for 30 min. at 22&#x000b0;C before inactivating the enzyme by heating 20 min at 75&#x000b0;C. In a parallel procedure, the expression vector, pSF-04, was digested with the <italic>Mfe</italic>l restriction enzyme to excise the insert bearing the lacZ encoding sequence. pSF-04 was then purified on agarose gel using the NucleoSpin Extract kit (Macherey Nagel) and treated with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of 2.5 mM of dGTP for 30 min at 22&#x000b0;C before inactivating the enzyme by heating 20 min. at 75&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The cloning step of the two fungi TPK genes consisted in a hybridization reaction performed by mixing 0.01 pmol of pSF-04 and 0.02 pmol of the insert in a reaction volume of 3 &#x003bc;l and an incubation time of 5 min. at 22&#x000b0;C, 1 &#x003bc;l of 25 mM EDTA was then added to the reaction mixture. After a second incubation period of 5 min. at 22&#x000b0;C, the entire hybridization reaction was used to transform <italic>E. coli </italic>DH5&#x003b1;. Selection was performed on LB plates containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin, positive plasmids were then isolated. This cloning procedure allowed insertion of the gene of interest in frame with a sequence encoding the N-terminal (His)<sub>6 </sub>tag and a GHHHQL sequence corresponding to the translation of the forward primer sequence. An additional C-terminal fragment QLDGDLEAA corresponds to the translation of a linker between the gene of interest and the sequence encoding the GFP.</p><p>An expression screening was performed using our standard procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the GFP gene reporter was used to quantify the soluble expression through fluorescence measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in order to identify the best condition for the fungi TPK proteins soluble expression. Subsequent removal of the GFP encoding gene was achieved by digesting the plasmid by <italic>Not</italic>I followed by intra ligation.</p><p>As a result, the plasmids carrying the CA1462 gene were over-expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>Origami in 1L flasks containing SB medium cultured overnight at 17&#x000b0;C. Induction was performed using IPTG (500 &#x003bc;M) when the culture reached an OD<sub>600 nm </sub>of 0.5. The plasmids carrying the YOR143C gene were expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>Origami in 1L flasks containing 2YTG medium at 25&#x000b0;C after induction with IPTG (500 &#x003bc;M) when the culture reached an OD<sub>600 nm </sub>of 0.5. After centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl pH 8.0) with 5 % glycerol and 0.1 % Triton X-100 then sonicated and centrifuged again.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification</title><p>The cleared lysate was applied to a 5 ml HiTrap Chelating Column (GE Healthcare) loaded with Ni<sup>2+ </sup>and equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A, 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 25 mM Imidazole and 5 column volumes of buffer A containing 50 mM Imidazole at a flow rate of 1 ml.min<sup>-1</sup>. Elution was performed with a linear gradient over 7 column volumes from 50 mM to 500 mM Imidazole. The fractions corresponding to the elution of CA1462 and YOR143 TPK proteins with 150&#x02013;200 mM Imidazole were run on a desalting column (Fast Desalting Column HR 10/10, Pharmacia) and analyzed by mass spectroscopy and N-terminal Edman sequencing. After purification, the fractions contained at least 98% pure protein in Tris buffer 10 mM pH 8 (CA1462) and Tris buffer 20 mM, 100 mM NaCl pH 8 (YOR143). For the CA1462 protein, the isoelectrofocalisation revealed a band around 6.0 instead of the predicted pI of 5.4. Gel filtration of the purified TPK proteins on a Sephacryl S200 HR column indicated the final products were dimeric in solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymatic assays</title><p>In order to verify that our two <italic>C. albicans </italic>and <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>enzymes were active TPK we developed a protocol involving four consecutive reactions and different enzymes. The TPK activities were determined at room temperature using purified protein (10 &#x003bc;g.ml<sup>-1</sup>) in Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) in presence of 1 mM thiamine and 5 mM ATP. The reaction cascade was monitored through the NADH decrease in absorbance at &#x003bb; = 334 nm. The first reaction is catalyzed by the TPK and produces a TPP and an AMP. The myokinase then uses the produced AMP in the presence of ATP to produce 2 ADP molecules, each of them being used by the pyruvate kinase enzyme in presence of phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) to produce a pyruvate and an ATP molecule. The last step is catalyzed by the lactate dehydrogenase hydrolyzing pyruvate in the presence of NADH to produce L-lactate and NAD<sup>+</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Crystallisation</title><p>The <italic>C. albicans </italic>TPK recombinant protein was concentrated to 20.4 g/L in 10 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0 using a centrifugal filter device (Ultrafree Biomax 30 K, Millipore, Bedford MA, USA). Precipitation experiments were carried out at 293 K using various precipitating agents (i.e. AmSO<sub>4</sub>, PEG, NaCl, MPD) at various pHs (i.e. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) to determine the optimal protein concentration for crystallization. The screening for crystallization conditions was performed on 3 &#x000d7; 96-well crystallization plates (Greiner) loaded by an 8-needle dispensing robot (Tecan, WS 100/8 workstation modified for our needs), using a 1 &#x003bc;l sitting drop per condition at 293 K. The tested 576 crystallization conditions include in-house designed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and commercially available solution sets (MDL Structure-Screen, Wizard-Emerald BioSystems).</p><p>The TPK protein (10.2 g.l<sup>-1</sup>, buffer Tris 10 mM, pH 8.0) was then incubated with AMP-PNP (1 mM) and/or thiamine (5 mM) for few minutes and the best crystals of each protein/ligand complex were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with a 1 ml reservoir. Crystallization droplets were made of 0.5 &#x003bc;l of complex mixed with 0.5 &#x003bc;l of the reservoir solution made of 17.5 to 20 % PEG4000, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>0.2 M, Tris 0.1 M, 20 % Glycerol between pH 7.0 and 7.5. Crystals appeared within a few days.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Crystals of the TPK protein were collected in a Hampton Research 0.2 mm<sup>3 </sup>loop, flash frozen to 100 K in a cold nitrogen gas stream and subjected to X-rays.

The last coordination of this Mg<sup>2+ </sup>involves an oxygen atom from the free inorganic phosphate symmetrically positioned with regard to the AMP phosphate shown in the mouse ATP binding site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>, Mg<sup>2+ </sup>number 3).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Identification of a potential secondary binding site</title><p>Timm <italic>et al</italic>. described the 3D structure of the mouse thiamine pyrophosphokinase co-crystallized with AMP, pyrithiamine pyrophosphate (PPP) and magnesium ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Their results confirmed that the AMP (and maybe the ATP) is maintained in the protein by interactions with residues 57, 58, 77 to 79, 141 to 143, 199 to 203, 206 and 207. Although we did not obtain any nucleotide analogue in our structures along with the TPNP and magnesium ions, we have identified an inorganic phosphate in the structure located differently to the AMP molecule in the mouse TPK structure. This phosphate is diametrically opposed to the AMP phosphoryl group described by Timm <italic>et al</italic>. relative to the thiamine moiety (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and can have two distinct origins. First, AMP-PNP is known to be very unstable in acidic conditions and can hydrolyze into an equivalent phosphoramidate and inorganic phosphate (Sigma report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]). Our crystals have been obtained at pH 7.0 with a large excess of AMP-PNP, but a partial degradation of AMP-PNP cannot be excluded. Second, this phosphate may originate from the AMP used in the pyrophosphorylation of the thiamine. The co-crystallized inorganic phosphate highlights a very high symmetry in the active site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The residues involved in this phosphate stabilization are poorly conserved across the different known TPKs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The stabilization of the non-phosphate part of the AMP in this alternative site seems to be restricted to the ribose part of the nucleotide, which suggests the existence of a rather non specific binding site which could accommodate nucleotides other than ATP, namely GTP, UTP and TTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Alternatively, it could correspond to a transitional site for the AMP on its path out of the protein, or for the ATP on its way to the active site, and thus guide the motion of this product/substrate during the hydrolysis process.</p></sec><sec><title>Existence of a gatekeeper residue?</title><p>Mutational studies of the human TPK, sharing 29 % identity over 288 amino-acids with the C. albicans TPK, showed that residues D71, D73 and D100 (corresponding to D113A, D115A and D142A in C. albicans) play a crucial role in carrying out the catalytic process, that Q96 and D133 (corresponding to Q138A and D205A) are involved in the binding of thiamine, and that T99 and R131 (corresponding to N141A and R203A) interact with the ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In our structures, Q138A adopts two main conformations: one opened and one closed with respect to the active site access. The structure containing thiamine only exhibits the closed conformation, while both are present in the TPK/TPNP complex. As in other kinase structures, Q138A could play the role of a gatekeeper, one of the major determinants of the selectivity in these proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. If a secondary binding site exists in the protein, this residue could directly interact with the phosphoryl group of the AMP and both the ribosyl and pyrimidine part of the nucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), thus playing a role in the enzyme selectivity. In the event of a transitional site, Q138A could modulate the release of AMP or the entrance of ATP.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothesis on the pyrophosphorylation mechanism in <italic>C. albicans </italic>TPK</title><p>The mechanism of pyrophosphorylation is not well understood. Structural studies complemented by enzymatic assays and mutation experiments, could give us insight into this process conserved in a lot of species.</p><p>Baker <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] proposed that, in yeast TPK, the three aspartates corresponding to D78A, D113A, A142A could play the same role as in the HPPK (6-Hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydroprotein pyrophosphokinase). In this enzyme, the pyrophosphate (PPi) is transferred from an ATP to an HP (6-Hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydroprotein) through a one step pyrophosphorylation mechanism. The PPi is maintained in the proper conformation by two aspartates through the coordination of two Mg<sup>2+ </sup>ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>In an attempt to co-crystallize TPK with its two substrates or in an intermediate state, we used AMP-PNP and AMP-CPP, two ATP analogues. In the AMP-PNP, the bond between &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; phosphates is non-hydrolysable, excepted under acidic conditions, whereas in AMP-CPP it is the bond between &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; phosphates which is non-hydrolysable. Our attempts to co-crystallize AMP-CPP or AMP-PNP with the enzyme have failed. Nevertheless, using AMP-PNP, as suggested by the electronic density maps, the PNP group was transferred to the thiamine to form a thiamine-PNP. This observation is consistent with a one step PPi transfer. A steady-state kinetics study of the human TPK led to the proposal that the mechanism is a ping-pong reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] as proposed for yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. According to our results, and in agreement with Timm <italic>et al</italic>., the possibility to co-crystallize the two substrates at the same time is inconsistent with an ordered ping-pong mechanism where the thiamine binds the enzyme after ATP has been hydrolyzed and the AMP released. Moreover, the presence and position of a possible secondary AMP binding site is more likely to support a mechanism where the AMP is released after the PPi transfer and before the TPP molecule.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to report more than one magnesium ion in the TPK active site with one or two additional Mg<sup>2+ </sup>properly positioned to participate in the pyrophosphorylation process in a mechanism akin to the one proposed by Timm <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Where Timm <italic>et al</italic>. showed a water molecule, our structures exhibit a magnesium ion at a strategic location. After the binding of an ATP molecule, K145A, a strictly conserved lysine, could activate the thiamine hydroxyl extremity through the coordination of the first Mg<sup>2+</sup>. At the same time, the 4 aspartates (78A, 112A, 115A and 142A) could activate the PPi moiety of the ATP molecule. The transfer could then take place. Each <italic>C. albicans </italic>structure reveals new positions suggesting that 3 Mg<sup>2+ </sup>ions could be involved in the PPi transfer mechanism. The third Mg<sup>2+ </sup>could stabilize the PPi during the transfer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have determined the X-ray structure of the <italic>C. albicans </italic>thiamine pyrophosphokinase co-crystallized with the thiamine or the thiamine-PNP and an inorganic phosphate. These different structures allow us to describe several original features. The active site symmetry and the inorganic phosphate binding site suggest the presence of an alternative binding site in <italic>C. albicans </italic>TPK, or at least a transitional position of the substrate/product along the reaction pathway. This also suggests an enzymatic process where both products, TPP and AMP, are present at the same time in the protein with the release of the AMP molecule preceding the release of the TPP. We propose that the Q138A could interact with both substrates and products and work as a gatekeeper, modulating the activity of the enzyme (as observed in other kinases). The crystallization of thiamine-PNP at the TPK active site strongly suggests that the pyrophosphorylation process is a one step mechanism. K145A seems to be important in the catalytic process and substrate activation. The presence of two or three magnesium ions at the same time in the active site in these structures suggests a catalytic reaction similar to the one described for HPPK, also performing pyrophosphate transfer. The PPi transfer mechanism at work in thiamine pyrophosphokinases could be further explored by studies focusing on mimicking the transition state.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>TPK: thiamine pyrophosphokinase; TPP: thiamine pyrophosphate; PPi: Pyrophosphate; TPNP: thiamine-PNP; AMP-PNP: Adenosine 5'-(&#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-imido)triphosphate; PNP: (&#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-imido)diphosphate; HPPK: 6-Hydroxymethyl-7, 8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase; LIC: ligation-independent cloning; NCS: Non Crystallographic Symmetry.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SS performed research, analyzed data and wrote the paper.
