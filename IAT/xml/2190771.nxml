The regulation of chromatin conformation by specific structural proteins and their post-translational modifications have a major influence on transcription, repair, replication and recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Histones are important for chromatin organization and their residues are constantly targeted by modification enzymes. One of the modifications implicates acetylation of specific lysine residues in core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). By its ability to remodel chromatin, histone acetylation influences the transcriptional state of chromosomal regions by controlling the accessibility of underlying genes, directly linking this regulatory mechanism with gene activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Acetylation of histones is also involved in the deposition of free histones onto newly synthesized DNA [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]] and in the replacement of histones by protamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Because histone acetylases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) are associated with crucial regulatory roles, their dysregulation is often involved in diseases such as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>HATs are divided into 3 families: Gcn5/PCAF (general control of amino-acid synthesis 5/p300-CBP-associated factor), p300/CBP (Adenoviral E1A-associated protein/CREB-binding protein) and MYST. Among these families, MYST is more divergent and not as well characterized. This protein family is also different with regard to domain organization, multiprotein complex formation and biological function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. MYST is an acronym of its four founding members: human <underline>M</underline>OZ (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein), yeast <underline>Y</underline>bf2 (renamed Sas3, for something about silencing 3), yeast <underline>S</underline>as2, and mammalian <underline>T</underline>IP60 (HIV Tat-interacting 60 kDa protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. MYST4, also called MOZ2 or MORF (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein-related factor), is a member of the MYST family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies demonstrated that it preferentially acetylates free histones H2A, H3 and H4, as well as nucleosomal H3 and H4. Alternative splicing variants are found (MORF, MORF&#x003b1; and MORF&#x003b2;), but their expression, impact and function remain uncharacterized. The name MYST4 is now attributed to the longest of the splicing variant, MORF&#x003b2;. The sequences composing some of MYST4's domains are similar only to one other MYST family member, MOZ. Both MOZ and MYST4 are involved in leukemogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Chromosomal abnormalities found in leukemia patients reveal that <italic>MYST4 </italic>is rearranged and fused with the <italic>CBP </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], a translocation also associated with <italic>MOZ </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Additionally MYST4 can interact with RUNX1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1), a recurrent leukemia associated target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the mouse, its homologue Querkopf is thought to be implicated in cell differentiation in the cerebral cortex by regulating chromatin organization at some point during transcription. The malformations found in the cerebral cortex of mutant <italic>querkopf </italic>mice reveal that the gene is essential for normal embryonic neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Its involvement in gametogenesis and early embryogenesis is unknown, however preliminary mRNA studies revealed that <italic>MYST4 </italic>transcripts are present in high amounts in bovine oocytes (S. McGraw, unpublished results) compared to other HATs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Many members of the MYST family have distinct domains and diverse functions, including roles in epigenetic control, transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, DNA repair, chromatin assembly, cell cycle progression and cellular signalling (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]). It has been suggested that MYST4 may also perform some of those functions, although since it has unique domains it may act differently from other MYST members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Structural features found in MYST4 suggest that it could be a HAT with novel properties. However, most functions and characteristics attributed to MYST4 remain hypothetical and are only based on sequence analysis. The lack of proteomic and more thorough <italic>in vivo </italic>data are due to the absence of a functional MYST4 antibody.</p><p>In the study presented here, our aim was to characterize bovine <italic>MYST4 </italic>and the combination of all <italic>MYST4 </italic>splicing variants simultaneously (<italic>MORF</italic>, <italic>MORF&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>MORF&#x003b2;</italic>) in various tissues, but more specifically in reproductive tissues and gametes. The transcriptional study revealed that <italic>MYST4 </italic>was ubiquitously expressed in bovine somatic tissues. Unlike its mRNA, the MYST4 protein was present in some, but not all, of the eleven somatic tissues tested. In addition, MYST4 could be linked with important events that take place during folliculogenesis, embryo development, and spermatogenesis. <italic>MYST4 </italic>mRNA levels were assessed in oocytes and embryos, as were protein expression and localization. Valuable information was additionally obtained with the localization and expression of MYST4 protein in the ovary and testis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>MYST4 Sequence</title><p>Using polymerase chain reaction on oocyte cDNA, we obtained an amplified fragment of approximately 6600 bp (not shown). Sequencing revealed that it corresponded to the full-length bovine <italic>MYST4 </italic>gene. This splicing variant is the longest of the three MYST4 isoforms and encoded 2054 amino acid residues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The three splicing variants contained exactly the same sequences, except that MORF and MORF&#x003b1; are 292 aa and 109 aa shorter than MYST4 (MORF&#x003b2;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Alignment analysis also revealed that conservation between human and bovine MYST4 was nearly 95%. The human MYST4 sequence has 19 more amino acids, which can be found almost entirely in two glutamic acid-rich areas located in its acidic region. Bovine MYST4 contains various structural domains throughout its coding sequence. The most homologous domains were similar to those found in other proteins such as linker histones H1/H5, PHD zinc fingers and MYST histone acetylases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Additionally acidic and Ser/Met-rich regions were found. A transcriptional activation domain was also present in the C-terminal sequence of MYST4.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Representation of Bovine MYST4</bold>.

The same tissues that were used for mRNA transcript analysis were subjected to Western blotting. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, one positive protein band of about 230 kDa associated to MYST4 was predominantly present in the lung, spleen and ovary, whereas the same protein was also present but faintly detected in the brain, testis, uterus and oocytes. In the heart a single sharp band of about 200 kDa was detected. This protein is presumably the MORF isoform, which has a calculated molecular weight of 197 kDa. Peptide-blocking assays established that our MYST4 antibody was specific for the MYST4 peptide used for antibody production since the single distinct band disappeared (not shown). &#x003b2;-ACTIN was used as a loading control, but since some tissue extracts lacked this specific isoform, the samples were additionally probed with an anti-TUBULIN antibody.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Western blot analysis of MYST4 protein</bold>.

In these tissue sections, MYST4 expression was confined to follicles and to blood vessels, as there was no other signal within the stroma. A closer look at primordial follicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) revealed that MYST4 was intensely expressed in the cytoplasm of the oocyte, whereas the nucleus remained negative. MYST4 was also present in the cytoplasm of the simple squamous epithelium layer surrounding the oocyte, while cells in the proximity of the follicle wall were negative. In larger follicles, like those at the antral stage, granulosa cells adjacent to the oocyte and those covering the inside of the follicle strongly expressed MYST4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The oocytes contained within these follicles displayed MYST4 in both their cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In large follicles MYST4 was not only present in granulosa cells, but also on the other side of the basal lamina, in the theca cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). While essentially all granulosa cells expressed MYST4 in their cytoplasm, only a portion of theca cells expressed MYST4. Within the theca cell population positive for MYST4, the majority displayed a strong signal for this protein in their nucleus, however a faint signal was also observed in some cell cytoplasm. Additionally ovary sections revealed that cells composing blood vessels also expressed MYST4 in their cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Ovarian localization of MYST4 protein by immunohistochemistry</bold>.

These minimal levels were subsequently followed by a significant increase in transcripts at the blastocyst stage.</p></sec><sec><title>MYST4 Immunocytochemistry in Oocytes and Embryos</title><p>To evaluate the localization of MYST4 protein in bovine oocyte and embryo, immunolocalization experiments were performed on unfertilized bovine oocyte and throughout <italic>in vitro </italic>embryo development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The immature oocyte strongly expressed MYST4 in its germinal vesicle (oocyte nucleus) and uniformly in its ooplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). As the oocyte resumes its maturation, the GV breaks down (GVBD) and no nuclear membrane is noticeable at the metaphase I (MI) stage of meiosis. At that moment, MYST4 was not present on the chromatin but appeared to concentrate on the mitotic spindle and scattered in the ooplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In the <italic>in vitro </italic>matured oocyte (MII), MYST4 remained present throughout the ooplasm and along condensed chromosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>), but the first expulsed polar body did not reveal any staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). During the subsequent cleavage stages, in 2-, 4-, 8- and 16-cell embryos, MYST4 was clearly expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E, F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>). However, nuclear localization during that period in blastomeres was not as obvious compared to GV oocytes. Compact morula embryos exhibited a similar MYST4 expression profile in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6I</xref>). In early and expanding blastocysts, MYST4 was observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells composing the trophectoderm and inner cell mass (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6K</xref>). However, the staining intensities of the nuclei were not similar, with some showing strong signal whereas it was weaker or absent in others (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6K</xref>). For all stages, negative controls were performed with a peptide-blocking assay, of which an example is shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6L</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of MYST4 in oocyte and early embryo development</bold>.

In the first cross-section (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), MYST4 was only present in some seminiferous tubules whereas others did not show any staining. This strongly suggests that its expression is developmentally regulated and is stage-specific during spermatid differentiation (spermiogenesis). MYST4 appeared to localize in cells facing the lumen of the seminiferous tubules and was cell-specific during spermiogenesis. To investigate this hypothesis, seminiferous tubules at different stages of spermatogenesis were closely observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7K</xref>). The spermatid differentiation process in bovine is divided in 14 described steps that include round (steps 1&#x02013;7), elongating (steps 8&#x02013;12) or elongated spermatids (steps 12&#x02013;14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These various spermatids, from steps 1&#x02013;12, are distributed in a specific manner within the seminiferous tubules (additional file 1). The seminiferous tubules are also divided into classes, called stages (I to XII), accordingly to the seminiferous epithelium cycle. Additionally, diverse types of germ cells (spermatogonia and spermatocytes) are distributed inside the different stages of the seminiferous epithelium cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In seminiferous tubules containing primary spermatocytes and round spermatids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>), which correspond to stage VII of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, no MYST4 was detected. However, in seminiferous tubules cross-sections at stages VIII to XI, intense staining of the MYST4 protein was detected in elongating spermatids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>). At higher magnification, the image clearly revealed that only the heads (nucleus), and not the mid-sections, of elongating spermatids were stained by MYST4 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7G</xref>). In this section (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7G</xref>), MYST4 immunolocalization was clearly restricted to elongating spermatids, as no spermatocytes were stained. Further along spermatogenesis, in stages IV to VI of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, the elongated spermatids displayed no immunoreactivity to MYST4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7I</xref>).

Although it is established that MYST4 is a potent histone H3 and H4 acetylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the functional consequences of this enzymatic activity remain unknown. Its specific function as a HAT remains ambiguous, but its involvement in chromosomal abnormalities found in leukemia patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and its normal presence in neurogenesis development have already been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In this paper we aimed to characterize <italic>MYST4 </italic>and the combination of all <italic>MYST4 </italic>isoforms simultaneously (<italic>MORF, MORF&#x003b1;, MORF&#x003b2;</italic>) in various tissues, but more specifically in reproductive tissues and in gametes.</p><p>Based on its sequence, the bovine MYST4 protein is highly similar to its human counterpart, with almost 95% homology. Bovine MYST4 contains the same structural domains that make MYST4 so unique and therefore we can assume that bovine and human MYST4 take part in the same cellular processes.</p><sec><title>Expression of MYST4</title><p>A previous report revealed that human <italic>MORF </italic>is ubiquitously expressed in somatic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Transcript levels were high in tissues like heart, pancreas, testis and ovary, whereas they were barely detectable in the lung. In our study, we determined that the mRNA transcripts for the <italic>MYST4 </italic>gene as well as for all <italic>MYST4 </italic>isoforms were also ubiquitously present in all tissues tested, with different intensities.</p><p>Because the mRNA transcripts for the different splicing variants were present in each tissue tested, we thought they would parallel the protein levels. However, MYST4 protein detection was quite variable in the same tissues, ranging from high (lung, spleen and ovary) to undetectable (thymus, muscle, liver and kidney). Surprisingly, only one of the tissues (heart) revealed a specific band with a different molecular weight compared to the other tissues. Protein extracts from the heart displayed only one band which may be the shortest isoform, MORF.</p></sec><sec><title>MYST4 in female gametogenesis</title><p>Oocytes also expressed the MYST4 protein, albeit weakly, and thus could not account for the important levels found in the ovary extracts, suggesting that other cell types could express MYST4. Immunolocalization on ovary sections confirmed this by revealing that MYST4 was expressed in follicular cells (granulosa and theca) enclosing the oocyte, as well as in blood vessels. Although this is the first time that the MYST4 acetylase is associated with folliculogenesis, various acetylation events occur within granulosa and theca cells during follicle formation and growth. Numerous experiments using ChIP (Chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays on these cells revealed that specific histone acetylation events in the promoter region of ovarian genes are affected by the increase in reproductive hormones (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]). <italic>In vitro </italic>culture of rat granulosa cells treated with FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) enhances the transcriptional activation of the <italic>SGK </italic>(serum-glucocorticoid kinase) and the <italic>FOS </italic>(FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene) genes by increasing the acetylation of specific lysine residues on histone H3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition, granulosa cells obtained from monkeys treated with hCG and from human IVF (<italic>in vitro </italic>fertilization) patients also treated with hCG exhibited histone H3 acetylation in the regulatory regions of the <italic>StAR </italic>(steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, inhibition of HDACs in cultured human theca cells increased total histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels, along with mRNA transcription for CYP11A (cytochrome P450, family 11, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) and CYP17 (cytochrome P450, family 17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Given that the MYST4 proteins are restricted to certain specialized cells in the ovary and have a strong histone H3/H4 acetylation activity, they could regulate the transcription of specific genes during folliculogenesis. The functions of MYST4 in follicular cells may be somewhat distinctive since the protein is mainly nuclear in theca cells and cytoplasmic in granulosa cells. Dormant oocytes enclosed in primordial follicles also lacked MYST4 in their nucleus, but the oocytes contained in the larger follicles exhibited MYST4 in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Since dormant oocytes are deficient in transcription at this point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] they may not require this HAT in their nucleus for regulatory processes, whereas growing oocytes are in a transcriptionally active state and thus necessitate enzymes responsible for chromatin remodeling.</p><p>Related mRNA profiles in oocytes and throughout embryo development were observed between <italic>MYST4 </italic>and all-<italic>MYST4</italic>-iso. However, since higher levels of transcripts were measured with the all-<italic>MYST4</italic>-iso in oocytes compared to the subsequent embryo stages, whereas <italic>MYST4 </italic>was equally present in the first four stages, we assume that the splicing variants <italic>MORF </italic>and/or <italic>MORF&#x003b1; </italic>are more abundant in the GV and MII oocytes compared to other embryo stages. Globally, a significant amount of all-<italic>MYST4</italic>-iso transcripts was lost following each embryo division up to the 16-cell stage, followed by a slight increase in mRNA levels between morula and blastocyst embryos. High levels of transcripts in oocytes could be mRNA accumulated during oocyte growth and translated into protein in subsequent stages of development until the embryo is able to produce its own mRNA at the MET (maternal embryonic transition). However the immunolocalization study, although not quantitative, revealed that similar intensity of staining for cytoplasmic MYST4 was found throughout development. This could indicate that the protein has an extensive half-life or the transcripts produced by post-MET embryos are constantly being translated into new proteins and do not accumulate. Interestingly, GV oocytes contained the largest measured levels of <italic>MYST4 </italic>transcripts and had the highest accumulation of the protein in its nucleus. Since there is still some active transcription in GV oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], MYST4 may potentially be implicated in this permissive chromatin state by co-regulating transcriptional complexes via its transcriptional activation domain. Surprisingly, during oocyte maturation when chromosomes are lined up along the equator at the metaphase-1 stage, MYST4 was located in the vicinity of the meiotic spindle rather than on chromosomes. Interaction with chromatin is expected, since MYST4 contains a H1/H5 domain that mediates self-association and interaction with core histones and the nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Because there is no nuclear membrane during MI in meiosis, there was no barrier to retain MYST4 at this location. Therefore it may be implicated in the meiotic spindle action to separate the chromosomes or in other related mechanisms. It is unlikely that it acetylates histones H3 and H4 at that point, since histones are globally deacetylated in oocytes during meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and improper histone deacetylation in the course of meiosis is associated with aneuploidy and embryo death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Alternatively, the &#x003b1;-TUBULIN proteins composing the microtubules could perhaps be a target for MYST4, since they are acetylated at different points in meiotic and mitotic divisions in mouse oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; however, no studies have yet examined if MYST4 could acetylate &#x003b1;-TUBULIN. Although MYST4 appeared to be present in the nucleus from the 2-cell until the 16-cell stage embryo, no major accumulation was observed in the nucleus. In the morula and blastocyst stages, some nuclei appeared to have the same accumulation as that observed in oocytes. This nuclear accumulation may be associated to specific stages in the cell cycle and since there are more individual cells in those embryos, the chances of detecting this accumulation are increased. The presence of MYST4 in the nucleus also coincides with the activation of specific genes involved in the delineation of the blastocyst inner cell mass and trophectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>MYST4 in male gametogenesis</title><p>Since MYST4 was linked with reproductive cells in the ovary, we wondered if its presence in testis could have a similar function. Surprisingly, in this organ, MYST4 was restricted to specific cells. The antibody brightly stained only the nucleus of elongating spermatids found in stages VIII to XI of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, which normally enclose step-8 through -11 spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The spermatid differentiation process in bovine is divided in 14 described steps that include round (steps 1&#x02013;7), elongating (steps 8&#x02013;12) or elongated spermatids (steps 12&#x02013;14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The adjacent seminiferous tubules of the same testis section, containing spermatids at different stages of development, were not immunoreactive. Because there are various nuclear modification events that occur during spermiogenesis, MYST4 may be a key player in one of them. In the nucleus of elongating spermatids at different stages, important acetylation processes occur to ensure proper histone displacement for their replacement by transition proteins and protamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. During these processes, different residues of the core histones (H3, H4, H2A and H2B) are targets for acetylation. In mouse spermiogenesis, there are 16 reported steps, with steps 9 to 12 associated with the elongating spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Acetylation of histone H3 is limited to steps 10 and 11, whereas histone H4 is hyperacetylated from steps 8 to 11. For both H3 and H4, the intense staining seems homogeneously distributed over the nuclear region. Furthermore, the four potential sites of acetylation on histone H4 (Lys 5, 8, 12, and 16) were individually studied with specific antibodies and revealed to be all immunoreactive in steps 8 to 11 of the elongating spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Other acetylation events on histones H2A (steps 9 to 11) and H2B (steps 10 and 11) are also observed in elongating spermatids. To date, the only genes thought to be associated with histone H4 hyperacetylation in elongating spermatids prior to the histone-to-protamine exchange are all members of the Cdy (chromodomain protein, Y chromosome)-related family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the mouse, where two transcripts evolved for that gene, both <italic>cdyl </italic>(Cdy-like) and <italic>cdyl2 </italic>exhibit a ubiquitous, long transcript as well as a highly abundant, testis-specific short transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In human, members include the <italic>CDYL </italic>and <italic>CDYL2 </italic>genes which are ubiquitously express in tissues, and <italic>CDY </italic>which is an abundant testis-specific gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. <italic>CDY </italic>and its homologs encode a HAT that acetylates free histones H4 and H2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. By immunolocalization, it was shown that mouse Cdyl is abundantly expressed in the nuclei of elongating spermatids at the time histone H4 is hyperacetylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although our immunolocalization experiments were not performed on individual elongating step sections, we could clearly distinguish that MYST4 was also only present in elongating spermatids during spermatogenesis. Furthermore, MYST4 is not only able to acetylate free H2A, H3 and H4 when used as substrates, but can efficiently acetylate nucleosomal histones as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. With the new data obtained in our study added to previous reports on MYST4, strong evidence connects this protein with H2A, H3 and H4 acetylation during spermiogenesis. However, because some of the histone modifications mentioned above are also present at some other stages like spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes, histone acetylases other than those of the CDY and MYST4 families are likely to be involved in spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>MYST4 <italic>in vivo </italic>characteristics</title><p>Although MYST4 was discovered several years ago, it has never been linked to the formation of a stable multisubunit HAT complex. Recently, MYST4 and its close relative MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc finger) were characterized as part of a histone H3 specific HAT complex important for DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This HAT complex also includes a member of the tumor suppressor family (ING5, inhibitor of growth 5), proteins usually associated with chromatin (BRPF 1/2/3) and an uncharacterized protein homologous to a subunit of a yeast acetyltransferase (Eaf6, Esa1-associated factor-6). Since this complex was only able to acetylate H3K14 in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], it is unlikely to be involved in the acetylation of H4 in spermatids. However, transcripts from related BRFP family members are preferentially expressed within spermatocytes in the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and in oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], suggesting that BRFP proteins may be present and associated with MYST4 in other HAT complexes.</p><p>Although <italic>MYST4 </italic>knock-outs are not yet available to determine whether the gene is essential in reproduction or other important processes, a mutant mouse for its homolog <italic>querkopf </italic>exists. The homozygous <italic>querkopf </italic>mice display about 10% of the normal coding mRNA compared to wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These mutant mice show craniofacial abnormalities, retarded postnatal growth, defects in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and severe problems in adult neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These physiological failures are caused by the essential function attributed to Querkopf in neural stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and in bone formation through its involvement with RUNX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Because there is still partial expression of wild-type <italic>querkopf </italic>mRNA, these mice are still able to develop despite all their defects. However for the moment, no information about other malformations or problems in folliculogenesis, spermatogenesis or embryo development was reported for the homozygous mutant mice. Even though MYST4 and MOZ interact in different protein complexes, they specifically regulate diverse stem cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

The data and conclusions from bovine MYST4 will undoubtedly apply to the human protein since both sequences show extensive similarities. In addition to providing the first proteomic study of this poorly studied protein, this is the first report to link MYST4 with early gametogenesis. To our knowledge, MYST4 is the only HAT to be described in cells (elongating spermatids, oocyte, granulosa and theca cells) related to gamete formation in both male and female. The availability of a highly specific and functional antibody will now allow the use of techniques such as pull-down assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation, to identify protein complexes and isolate chromatin target sites associated with MYST4 in transcriptional regulation events in reproductive tissues and other specific cell types. This antibody will also provide a new tool to study the implication of MYST4 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all materials were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).</p><sec><title>Oocyte Recovery and <italic>In Vitro </italic>Embryo Production</title><p>The procedures for oocyte recovery and <italic>in vitro </italic>embryo production have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].

The fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG controls were used to set the background fluorescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Testis and ovary samples were fixed in Bouin fixation solution and mounted in paraffin blocks as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Briefly, non-specific sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. The slides were incubated for 2 hrs at RT in the presence of anti-MYST4 (1:500), and tissue sections were then covered with a goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to biotin for 1 hr at RT. After carefully washing the slide, streptavidin-HRP was deposited on tissues for 30 min at room temperature and the immune complex was then revealed using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB). The slides were mounted in mowiol (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and observed by light microscopy. For both ovary and testis, negative controls were carried out by peptide-blocking assay following the manufacturer's recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The level of mRNA for each gene subjected to statistical analysis was normalized using the <italic>GFP </italic>external control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The value obtained for each gene, within each pool of cDNA, was divided by the value obtained for GFP in the same cDNA pool. Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM. Statistically significant differences in mRNA levels between each developmental stage were calculated by protected ANOVA (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and treatment and replicate were included in the model. Differences were considered statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (P &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SM designed the experiments, performed most experimental work and wrote the manuscript.
