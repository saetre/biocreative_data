E1 is believed to mediate fusion while E2 has been shown to bind cellular receptors. It is clear that HCV uses a multi-receptor complex to gain entry into susceptible cells, however key elements of this complex remain elusive. In this study, the role of a highly conserved RGE/RGD motif of HCV E2 glycoprotein in viral entry was examined. The effect of each substitution mutation in this motif was tested by challenging susceptible cell lines with mutant HCV E1E2 pseudotyped viruses generated using a lentiviral system (HCVpp). In addition to assaying infectivity, producer cell expression and HCVpp incorporation of HCV E2 proteins, CD81 binding profiles, and conformation of mutants were examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Based on these characteristics, mutants either displayed wt characteristics (high infectivity [&#x02265; 90% of wt HCVpp], CD81 binding, E1E2 expression, and incorporation into viral particles and proper conformation) or very low infectivity (&#x02264; 20% of wt HCVpp). Only amino acid substitutions of the 3<sup>rd </sup>position (D or E) resulted in wt characteristics as long as the negative charge was maintained or a neutral alanine was introduced. A change in charge to a positive lysine, disrupted HCVpp infectivity at this position.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although most amino acid substitutions within this conserved motif displayed greatly reduced HCVpp infectivity, they retained soluble CD81 binding, proper E2 conformation, and incorporation into HCVpp. Our results suggest that although RGE/D is a well-defined integrin binding motif, in this case the role of these three hyperconserved amino acids does not appear to be integrin binding. As the extent of conservation of this region extends well beyond these three amino acids, we speculate that this region may play an important role in the structure of HCV E2 or in mediating the interaction with other factor(s) during viral entry.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>To complete its replication cycle, a virus needs to gain access to the cell cytoplasm by crossing the plasma membrane of a host cell. For enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), this entails binding at the cell surface, followed by endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Entry of HCV is an intricate process that is not fully understood. Evidence indicates that HCV requires multiple receptors to invade host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the key components that mediate susceptibility to HCV still remain elusive. It is known that the HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins mediate the tightly regulated process of cell binding and membrane fusion.</p><p>Several cellular surface molecules have been implicated in HCV entry, including: CD81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], Claudin-1, 6 and 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], dendritic-cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and Liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing integrin (L-SIGN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. While L-SIGN and DC-SIGN are not expressed on hepatocytes, it is believed that dendritic cells expressing these molecules facilitate persistent infection by capturing and delivering the virus to the liver. SR-BI is a multiligand receptor that binds several lipoproteins, including HDL, LDL and VLDL. It is primarily expressed in the liver and facilitates the uptake of lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>As the HCV E2 glycoprotein is exposed to so much selective pressure and the high error rate inherent in RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], regions conserved across genotypes suggest an important role in virus viability. Sequence alignment of E2 of several genotypes of HCV revealed a highly conserved RGE or RGD motif at amino acids 648&#x02013;650 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which is also flanked upstream and downstream by a large stretch of sequence conservation. The presence of RGD/RGE in HCV E2 led us to speculate that integrins might be involved in HCV binding to the target cells, as RGD and RGE have been identified as an integrin binding motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Integrins belong to a large family of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. They are responsible for cell and extracellular matrix interactions as well as cell-cell interactions. Unlike many other cell surface receptors, integrins bind with very low affinity, however they are present in much larger numbers than other receptors. The binding of integrins can be compared to Velcro&#x000ae;, low affinity but with many interaction sites. Integrins are heterodimeric receptors made up of an &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Conserved RGE or RGD motif of hepatitis C virus E2</bold>.

Based on the size of this conserved region, we speculate that it is of a structural/functional nature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of a highly conserved RGE/RGD motif</title><p>Sequence alignment of several genotypes of HCV E2 reveals all genotypes contain either a RGE or RGD motif upstream of the transmembrane domain of E2 (aa 648&#x02013;650) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Furthermore, a large region of sequence conservation around RGE/RGD is observed, suggesting a role(s) of this region in structure or/and function of E2.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of amino acid substitutions on the infectivity of hepatitis C virus pseudoparticles</title><p>To determine if the conserved RGE/RGD motif of HCV E2 is vital for mediating HCVpp entry, substitutions were generated within the context of H77 E2. Three types of substitutions were generated: (1) alanine substitutions, (2) amino acid changes that maintained charge characteristics and (3) mutations that changed the charge at that position. After sequence confirmation of the substitutions, HCVpp infectivity of permissive Huh7 cells was assessed by infecting cells with HIV pseudotyped with wt or the RGE/RGD motif substitutions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Infectivity was determined as a measure of luciferase activity and VSVG/HIV and EnvA/HIV were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.</p><p>The two amino acid substitutions generated at the first position, AGE and KGE, completely abrogated HCVpp infectivity, reducing luciferase levels down to 3 and 5% respective of wt. Changing the glycine to an alanine at the second position also reduced infectivity to 18%. As expected, changing RGE to RGD had no adverse affect on the viability of infection and resulted in 94% of wt. Interestingly, substituting the negatively charged aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E) to a neutral alanine (A) did not impair infectivity of HCVpp, however a positive lysine (K) at this position reduced HCVpp to 14% of wt. This suggests that a negative or neutral charge at this position is critical in maintaining HCV E2 interactions with susceptible cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acid substitutions within the conserved RGE motif of E2 dramatically affect hepatitis C virus pseudoparticle entry</bold>. 293 T cells were cotransfected with HIV-luc packaging vector along with HCV E1E2 mutant expression plasmids.

Cell lysates probed with anti-E2 antibody revealed a band of ~70 kDa for all wt and mutant glycoprotein transfected cells, corresponding to the size of the HCV E2 glycoprotein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

Four synthetic peptides were used: GRGDTP, GRGESP and a RGD or RGE peptide followed by 15 amino acids corresponding to the sequence of the H77 E2 sequence (RGD-E2 and RGE-E2 respectively). The short, six amino acid peptide GRGESP inhibited HCVpp entry approximately 80% at a concentration of 15 mM, however the RGE-E2 peptide did not inhibit HCVpp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This could be due to the larger peptides folding on themselves, masking the RGE sequence. Inhibition by the GRGESP peptide suggests a potential RGE-dependent interaction with the Huh7 cell, therefore blocking HCVpp with integrin antibodies was pursued.</p></sec><sec><title>Alpha integrin antibodies to do not block hepatitis C virus pseudoparticle entry</title><p>Seven monoclonal antibodies that functionally block the alpha subunit of integrins were incubated with Huh7 cells at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h prior to infection with HCVpp. Antibodies directed against alpha subunits 1&#x02013;6 and V were tested at a concentration of 20 &#x003bc;g/ml (data not shown).

Binding of HCV E1E2 proteins to a purified GST tag was used as a control. None of the amino acid substitutions interfered with CD81 and HCV E2 glycoprotein binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These results indicate that decrease in HCVpp infectivity is not due to a loss of CD81/E2 interaction.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Binding of hepatitis C virus E2 glycoproteins containing RGE substitutions to soluble CD81</bold>. 293 T cells transfected with HCV E1E2 wt of mutant expression vectors were lysed 24 h post-transfection.

As integrins are frequently used as receptors for various viral pathogens, and many integrins recognize RGD sequences, this highly conserved RGE or RGD motif in the HCV glycoprotein E2 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), led us to hypothesize that integrins might play a role in HCV binding and entry. While this three amino acid motif is suggestive of an integrin binding ligand, our data does not support this hypothesis. Rather, the large size of this conserved region is more likely indicative of a structural or other functional role for this region of the E2 glycoprotein.</p><p>Of the six amino acid substitutions introduced in this motif, only substitutions of the last position (aa 650) maintained infectivity when replaced with either an amino acid of the same, negative charge (substituting a glutamic acid with an aspartic acid) or with a neutral alanine. The E2 gene used in this study, derived from an H77 strain, contains an RGE at this position. Changing the glutamic acid to an aspartic acid, which is the other variation of this conserved motif, maintains infectivity levels 94% of RGE. A change in charge at this position to a positive amino acid (lysine) however, impaired infectivity significantly; dropping infection levels to only 14% of wt (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Changes in the first two positions of this motif reduced HCVpp entry to 3&#x02013;18%. Producer cell expression and viral particle incorporation of all of these substitutions were comparable to wt and could not account for the reduced HCVpp infectivity (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Mutational analysis of this highly conserved, three amino acid motif underlines its importance in maintaining HCVpp infectivity.</p><p>Receptor binding sites of E2 are not fully understood; therefore we sought to determine whether or not this conserved region is involved in binding to CD81. We assayed the soluble-CD81 binding properties of RGE/D amino acid substitutions. Mutant E2 protein was expressed in 293 T cells and then assayed for its binding of soluble CD81 bound to a GST tag. A GST protein alone was utilized as a negative control. All mutants bound CD81 at wt level, suggesting that whatever role this region plays in the HCV replication cycle, it does not appear to relate to CD81 binding (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Based on the conformational AR3A antibody analysis (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and soluble CD81 binding (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), we can conclude that the CD81 binding epitopes are intact.</p><p>The conserved RGE/D initially led us to speculate that integrins were involved in mediating viral entry of HCV. Integrins have been shown to mediate binding of several viruses, including adenovirus, echovirus and hantavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. There are 16 &#x003b1; subunits and 8 &#x003b2; subunits that can interact in numerous ways to generate receptors of differing ligand specificity. Approximately 24 different heterodimers of &#x003b1;&#x003b2; subunits have been identified, suggesting not all subunits are capable of interacting with one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We preincubated Huh7 cells with 1&#x02013;6 and V alpha integrin blocking antibodies prior to HCVpp challenge to asses if infectivity was impaired. The inability of these blocking antibodies to prevent HCVpp infectivity (data not shown) suggests that at least these alpha subunits, are not involved in HCV entry. This conclusion is consistent with the other results in this study, in particular the mutational analysis that demonstrates that RGA maintains HCVpp entry.</p><p>Peptides containing either an RGD or RGE motif were preincubated with Huh7 cells to determine if masking a potential ligand site on the cell surface could impact HCVpp infectivity. Of the four peptides generated, the short, six amino acid peptide GRGESP, reduced HCVpp infectivity by approximately 80% at 15 mM (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). If integrins were directly involved, we would expect to see the short RGD containing peptide having the same inhibitory effect on HCVpp entry, however it did not impair HCVpp entry. The other RGE containing peptide, RGE-E2, which is followed by 15 amino acids corresponding to the HCV E2 H77 strain, did not affect HCVpp entry. This could be due to the peptide folding on itself and masking the RGE sequence. Furthermore, addition of fibronectin prior to HCVpp challenge did not have a significant effect on inhibiting HCVpp entry (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) suggesting that the function of this region is not RGE/D dependent binding to integrins.</p><p>As sequence alignment demonstrates a much larger span of conservation than simply these three residues (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), we suspect this entire stretch of conserved amino acids is critical to HCV infection. It is possible that this conserved region, including the RGE/RGD motif of E2, is critical for the proper folding and structure of E2. Just downstream of this three amino acid motif is the transmembrane domain, which has been well defined in its involvement in entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Further investigation is needed to dissect the exact role of this highly conserved region of E2 in HCV entry, however this work clearly demonstrates it plays a key role in the HCV replication cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and antibodies</title><p>293 T human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum with penicillin, streptomycin.

The protein samples were spun down at 14 k for 10 min to clear cellular debris and transferred to fresh eppendorf tubes. SDS-PAGE loading dye was added to the protein samples, which were subsequently boiled for 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (PVDF). Membranes were then probed for HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 and actin, p24 or GST using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence reagent according to the supplier's protocol (SuperSignal West pico chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce). To determine incorporation of E1 and E2 into the pseudotyped viruses, 4 ml of pseudotyped virus was layered onto a 1 ml cushion of 20% sucrose in PBS and centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 45 min in a SW55Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 16&#x000b0;C. The pelleted pseudovirions were lysed in 50 &#x003bc;l of 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Bovine serum albumin and fibronectin blocking assay</title><p>Huh7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>per well one day prior to infection.
