At the outset of mouse testis development (12.5&#x02013;13.5 days post coitum &#x0005b;dpc&#x0005d;), male ICR methylation is absent and is re-established during subsequent developmental stages (14.5&#x02013;17.5 dpc) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

No specificity of DNA binding is exhibited by the Dnmt3 subunits &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, and therefore it is thought that the de novo methyltransferases are recruited to sites of DNA methylation through interaction with specific chromatin modifications or a bridging protein(s) recognizing specific chromatin modifications.</p><p>A potential candidate for Dnmt3 recruitment could be a post-translationally modified histone(s). Histones are known to be subject to a large variety of modifications including methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation, each of which can occur at numerous residues, thereby contributing to histone structural diversity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. These modifications constitute the &#x0201c;histone code,&#x0201d; which can then be translated by interacting proteins into specific conformational alterations and/or DNA methylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. The best example of this mechanism is recognition of trimethylated K9 histone H3 present in heterochromatic regions and subsequent Dnmt3 recruitment by HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A model for the acquisition of CpG methylation in ICR has been recently proposed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Recently, CTCFL/BORIS (CTCF like/brother of the regulator of imprinted sites; hereafter referred to as CTCFL), a testis-specific paralog of CTCF, has been characterized &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. CTCFL possesses an 11-zinc finger region that is highly homologous to that of CTCF (74&#x00025; identity), suggesting similar DNA recognition. The latter notion is supported by the demonstration of CTCFL binding in vitro to the FII element within the &#x003b2;-globin gene cluster, a characterized CTCF binding site &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. The amino acid sequence flanking the zinc finger region of CTCFL exhibits no significant homology with CTCF, suggesting a function distinct from that of CTCF.</p><p>These characteristics thus render CTCFL an interesting candidate to participate in ICR methylation re-establishment. In the present report, we have pursued the possible role of CTCFL in the methylation of the <italic>H19</italic> ICR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis indicates CTCFL association with two paternal ICRs, <italic>H19</italic> and <italic>Gtl2</italic>. Furthermore, the embryonic expression of CTCFL in the developing testis coincides with imprint re-establishment. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of CTCFL interacts with a protein methyltransferase, PRMT7, which methylates histones H2A and H4. Co-expression of CTCFL and PRMT7 and the de novo methyltransferases in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes by microinjection of expression plasmids results in significant methylation of a co-injected ICR plasmid. Taken together, these results suggest that CTCFL may play a role in male germline <italic>H19</italic> ICR methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression of CTCFL during Testis Development</title><p>Erasure and re-establishment of paternal ICR methylation takes place during embryonic testis development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

At 17.5 dpc, a few centrally located gonocytes and cells present at the periphery of the developing seminiferous tubules were positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Similar CTCFL localization was observed in newborn testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). At 15 d after birth, nuclei of spermatogonia expressed CTCFL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g001">Figure 1</xref>F), as did their counterparts in adult testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g001">Figure 1</xref>G).

To identify potential interacting proteins, CTCFL was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a mouse testis cDNA prey library. Thirteen different mRNAs were present in a total of 33 colonies. We retained a recently described protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; and a novel arginine-rich testis-specific histone H2A variant, observed two and seven times, respectively.</p><p>The cDNA sequence within PRMT7 prey clones encodes the carboxy-terminal 87 amino acids (aa) of the 692&#x02013;aa protein, downstream of two predicted methyltransferase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). To validate this putative interaction, a CMV-GST (cytomegalovirus&#x02013;glutathione S-transferase) PRMT7 (full length) was co-expressed in 293T cells with epitope-tagged CTCFL (N-terminal region and full length). Lysates were prepared and GST fusion proteins purified with glutathione beads. CTCFL was detected by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). A reciprocal assay with CMV-GST-CTCFL (N-terminal region and full length) and epitope-tagged PRMT7 was also performed. Both assays verified interaction between the N-terminal region of CTCFL and full-length PRMT7 in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The N-terminal region of CTCFL used in these experiments corresponds to the aa sequence preceding the zinc finger region, which is approximately 255 aa in length. Further evidence of CTCFL-PRMT7 interaction is provided by the presence of CTCFL in the immunoprecipitate of co-expressed PRMT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). An interaction assay with CTCF (CMV-GST-PRMT7 and epitope-tagged CTCF) did not detect any association with PRMT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g003">Figure 3</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>CTCFL Interacts with Histones H1, H2A, and H3</title><p>As mentioned in the previous section, a second CTCFL interaction candidate identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen was a novel testis-specific histone H2A variant.

Low methylation levels were also observed when either CTCFL or PRMT7 were co-injected with Dnmt3s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). This result further underscores the need for both CTCFL and PRMT7 in conjunction with the Dnmt3s to achieve significant ICR methylation. The sequence specificity of observed DNA methylation was assessed by co-injecting a control plasmid, without CTCF binding sites (ChIP control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g002">Figure 2</xref>), along with CTCFL, PRMT7, and Dnmt3s expression plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Only low levels of CpG methylation were observed when the control plasmid was injected, confirming the sequence specificity of CTCFL-mediated ICR methylation. Control experiments, replacing the CTCFL expression plasmid with one encoding CTCF, did not yield significant ICR methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

Omission of either Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b resulted in intermediate methylation levels after 72 h of incubation. This observation suggests that both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b can participate in ICR methylation in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system. When Dnmt3L was omitted from injected expression plasmids, no ICR CpG methylation was observed, highlighting its essential role. Replacing the Dnmt3 expression plasmids by one encoding Dnmt1 does not result in significant ICR methylation, consistent with a specific requirement for the de novo methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

Given the high copy number of ICR plasmid injected into oocytes during the above experiments (approximately 10<sup>6</sup>), we reasoned that if PRMT7 in association with CTCFL methylates R3 of histone H4, it would be detectable by analysis of total oocyte histones. To test this idea, histones were extracted from oocytes with sulfuric acid and the resulting Western blots were reacted with &#x003b1;-SYM-R3H4 antibody (directed against a GR<sub>Me2(sym)</sub>GKGGKG peptide) for detection of SYM-R3H4 (symmetrical dimethyl arginine 3 histone H4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). When ICR was co-injected with expression plasmids for both PRMT7 and CTCFL, an increase in SYM-R3H4 was observed. However, if the CTCFL expression plasmid was replaced with a CTCF expression plasmid or if the PRMT7 expression plasmid was omitted, the level of detectable SYM-R3H4 is lower. An &#x003b1;-histone H3 was used as a control for histone loading. No signal was detected when an &#x003b1;-asymmetrical dimethyl arginine H4 R3 antibody was used to probe the same Western blot (unpublished data). The observed increase in SYM-R3H4 in total oocyte histones suggests that PRMT7, in collaboration with CTCFL, methylates at least histone H4, consistent with in vitro observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Developmental Accumulation of SYM-R3H4 Parallels ICR Methylation</title><p>If SYM-R3H4 is functioning to signal recruitment of the de novo DNA methyltransferases, then one would anticipate developmental accumulation of this modification in testis, paralleling ICR methylation.

Subsequent developmental stages evidence a progressively stronger signal up to adult stages. The spermatogonia within the adult testis are positive for SYM-R3H4.

ChIP analysis demonstrates that CTCFL is associated in vivo with the <italic>H19</italic> ICR at 15.5 dpc. The binding of common regions by CTCF and CTCFL is consistent with the high homology between their zinc finger domains (74&#x00025; identity, 84&#x00025; positivity). The mutually exclusive expression in testis excludes competition for binding sites. CTCFL is detected in the male germline during testis development shortly after the erasure of methylation marks on ICR (14.5 dpc), and coincides with maximal expression of the de novo DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The expression of CTCFL during embryonic development and its association with the <italic>H19</italic> ICR would suggest that it associates with non-methylated ICR.</p><p>The observed interaction of CTCFL with PRMT7, and histones H1, H2A, and H3 provides additional insight into its role in imprinting.

The absence of detectable interaction of PRMT7 and histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) and the stimulation of in vitro methylation by CTCFL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g005">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that PRMT7 may rely upon CTCFL for efficient association with histones. The latter could be accomplished in a specific chromatin region due to the DNA binding specificity of CTCFL. The expression of PRMT7 in the embryonic testis is consistent with a role in <italic>H19</italic> ICR methylation.</p><p>Interaction between CTCFL and histones is of relevance from several viewpoints. The reported nucleosome positioning at the <italic>H19</italic> ICR places CTCF consensus sequences in the inter-nucleosome linker region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

CTCFL interaction with histone H2A, a PRMT7 substrate, has particularly interesting functional implications. Attempts to detect association of H2A with PRMT7 were unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), raising the possibility that CTCFL simultaneously interacts with histone H2A and PRMT7, thus presenting PRMT7 with its histone substrate for methylation. This notion is supported by the observed stimulation of PRMT7-mediated methylation of histone H2A by CTCFL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g005">5</xref>C). The present results on PRMT7 and its association with CTCFL are analogous to observations made on other PRMTs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. PRMT5 has been shown, for example, to form a complex with the hSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers BRG and BRM, and this association enhances PRMT5 methyltransferase activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. PRMT1 interacts with the transcription factor YY1 and is thereby targeted to specific promoters, where it catalyses adjacent histone H4 methylation in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.

These observations open the possibility that the PRMT7-dependent increase in SYM-R3H4 observed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes is occurring on nucleosomal histones adjacent to the <italic>H19</italic> ICR, when CTCFL is expressed. Results of SYM-R3H4 ChIP analysis with testis chromatin are supportive of this interpretation.</p><p>A consideration of the experiments carried out in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes should take into account the number of ICR plasmid copies present. Forty picograms of injected ICR plasmid corresponds to approximately 10<sup>6</sup> copies. This elevated copy number probably renders the system less sensitive to endogenous components. The ICR methylation observed in the oocyte experiments is occurring on a significant fraction of this large number of injected ICR plasmid molecules. Secondly, the dependence on the injected expression plasmids for methylation to occur is probably due to the large number of templates. This does not rule out that endogenous factors may participate, yet the primary players in the reaction are likely to be those encoded by the co-injected expression plasmids.</p><p>Symmetrical dimethylation of R3 in histone H4 by PRMT7 was observed to increase when PRMT7 and CTCFL are co-expressed along with ICR in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. This augmentation is dependent on both proteins in that no increase in SYM-R3H4 methylation is observed when CTCF is expressed in place of CTCFL. Furthermore, omission of PRMT7 also evidences no increase in R3H4 methylation. In addition, the progressive accumulation of SYM-R3H4 in developing testis parallels expression of CTCFL and PRMT7. The dependence of ICR methylation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte experiments on co-expression of PRMT7 and CTCFL and the observed in vitro interaction of CTCFL with histones are consistent with such activity. The results of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte microinjections indicate that expression of both proteins is necessary for efficient <italic>H19</italic> ICR methylation. In addition, ChIP analysis of adult testis indicated that SYM-R3H4 is present within <italic>H19</italic> ICR chromatin. The sequence specificity of the observed ICR methylation is supported by the lack of significant methylation when a control plasmid lacking CTCF consensus sequences was injected in place of <italic>H19</italic> ICR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g006">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>Knockout mouse models of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L have shown that both are necessary for appropriate maternal and paternal imprinting &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Results obtained with the heterologous <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte system are consistent with these observations. No CpG methylation was observed when Dnmt3L was omitted from the injected expression plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). In contrast, Dnmt3b knockout mice do not exhibit any deficiencies in ICR methylation in the male germline &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that expression of Dnmt3b is not critical for this event. Nonetheless, examination of Dnmt3b RNA/protein expression during the developmental interval of ICR methylation indicates that there is significant expression of a splice variant, Dnmt3b2, in testis from 14.5dpc to 17.5dpc &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, Dnmt3b may participate in ICR methylation, but is not absolutely essential. Our results would be supportive of such a view. Dnmt1 expression is unable to compensate for the de novo methyltransferase expression, supportive of the specificity of ICR methylation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g006">Figure 6</xref> ).</p><p>Several recent reports have indicated that the mutation of the four characterized CTCF binding sites, m1&#x02013;m4, does not alter the establishment of <italic>H19</italic> ICR imprints in the male germline or the non-methylated status of the ICR in the female germline &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. The created mutations were demonstrated in vitro to drastically alter CTCF binding. However, no in vivo confirmation of altered CTCF binding was presented, leaving open the possibility that alternative binding sites for CTCF exist within the 1.8-kilobase ICR sequence. In the present report, we demonstrate in vivo binding of CTCFL to the <italic>H19</italic> ICR, however, we have not investigated the precise sequence to which it binds. In order to reconcile the CTCF binding site mutant studies with the present results, one must consider the possibility that the sequence recognition of CTCFL is similar to, but distinct, from that of CTCF. Closer inspection of the sequence homology of the individual zinc fingers is consistent with such an interpretation. Two zinc fingers (fingers 1 and 11) of CTCFL show no significant homology with CTCF (two-sequence alignment), whereas the other fingers range from 54&#x00025; to 95&#x00025; amino acid homology (average, 67&#x00025; identity).</p><p>A question that arises from the present results concerns the nature of recruitment of the Dnmt3s to <italic>H19</italic> ICR. Clearly the de novo DNA methyltransferases are efficiently recruited, given the level of specific methylation observed, yet the mechanism remains undefined.

Alternatively, there is a bridging protein(s) present in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes that is responsible for the recognition of the dimethyl arginine histones, and interaction with this protein(s) recruits the Dnmt3s.</p><p>A recent publication by Vatolin et al. describes partial demethylation of the MAGE-A1 promoter either following treatment of cells with 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine or upon over-expression of CTCFL &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

The initial event is recognition and binding of the ICR chromatin by the zinc finger region of CTCFL, which then recruits PRMT7 to the chromatin site by interaction via its N-terminal region. Subsequently, PRMT7 catalyses the methylation of arginine residues in the GRG motif present in adjacent histones H2A and H4. The latter event is stimulated by the ICR-bound CTCFL scaffold. Following disengagement of the CTCFL-PRMT7 complex, the de novo DNA methyltransferases are recruited to the ICR chromatin region, possibly through recognition of dimethylated arginine residues by the PWWP domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b or by a bridging protein provided by the oocyte.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>&#x003b1;-CTCFL antibody preparation and characterization.</title><p>Immunization of rabbits with GST N-terminal CTCFL (1&#x02013;229 aa) fusion protein was done in collaboration with Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium).

A total of 50 &#x003bc;l of glutathione-sepharose beads (G-4510; Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) were added to GST fusion protein lysates and incubated for 2 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. The immobilized GST fusion proteins were washed four times in lysis buffer plus 0.5&#x00025; Triton X-100 and stored at 4 &#x000b0;C until use. A similar protocol of extraction and purification was followed for GST fusion proteins expressed in bacteria with different sonication conditions (5 &#x000d7; 10 s at 50&#x00025; power). Histones were extracted from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes by incubation on ice with in 0.4 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for 1 h. Proteins in the resulting supernatant were precipitated with ten volumes of acetone overnight at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Protein interaction assays.</title><p>GST pull-downs with fusion proteins expressed in bacteria were performed according to standard procedures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Co-transfection of CMV-GST fusion (bait) and epitope-tagged (prey) constructs in 293T cells are referred to as in situ GST interaction assays. In situ GST pull-down reactions were done overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C.

The reactions with separate histones H2A and H2B (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) were done as follows. V5- or myc- immunopurified PRMT7 and CTCFL were eluted using epitope peptides V5 and myc, respectively. Equivalent amounts of PRMT7 were used in histone methyltransferase reactions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; with or without CTCFL using C<sup>14</sup> methyl S-adenosyl methionine (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). Reactions were incubated overnight at 30 &#x000b0;C. Following the reactions, proteins were separated on 15&#x00025; PAGE, embedded with 18&#x00025; sodium salicylate, dried, and then exposed for fluorography. PRMT7 and CTCFL were co-immunoprecipitated using &#x003b1;-V5 antibody for methyltransferase reactions with total histones (Roche).</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Nuclear microinjection into <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes.</title><p>Nuclear microinjection into stage VI oocytes was done as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040355-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d; with minor modifications. Injections into the nucleus were performed without prior centrifugation. The DNAs injected per oocyte were: 40 pg of target DNA (ICR or non-ICR), 200 pg of each expression plasmid with CMV or EF-1a promoters (CTCFL, PRMT7, DnmT3a, DnmT3b, and DnmT3L) and 200-pg pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). Injected oocytes were incubated at 19 &#x000b0;C for 48 or 72 h. The total amount of plasmid DNA injected thus depended upon the precise experiment carried out, yet gave a total amount of 1,240 pg maximally when six expression plasmids were injected. No carrier plasmid was used to normalize total injected plasmid DNA between experiments. Western analysis of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b expression indicated no perturbation of expression of either protein when expressed alone or together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040355-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>DNA isolation, bisulfite modification, and sequencing</title><p>DNA was isolated from GFP-positive oocytes by incubation in STOP buffer (1&#x00025; SDS, 30 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 7.5&#x0005d;, 500 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> Proteinase K) for 2 h at 37 &#x000b0;C.

A total of 500 &#x003bc;l of freshly prepared Na-bisulfite mix (2.85 M Na-bisulfite, 2.7 mM hydroquinone, and 400 mM NaOH) was added and placed in PCR machine for bisulfite transformation (2 h at 55 &#x000b0;C, 1 min at 95 &#x000b0;C, 1 h at 55&#x000b0;C, 1 min at 95 &#x000b0;C, and 1 h at 55 &#x000b0;C). The samples were desulfonated on columns from QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) and purified with buffers from the same kit as follows. Five volumes of PB buffer was added to samples, and the mixture was applied to columns and washed with PE buffer. Samples were desulfonated with NaOH/ethanol (150 mM/90&#x00025;) at room temperature for 10 min, washed with PE, and eluted in 50-&#x003bc;l EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 8.5&#x0005d;) for 15 min at 70 &#x000b0;C. A total of 5 &#x003bc;l of bisulfite-transformed DNA was amplified in 50-&#x003bc;l PCR reactions (40 cycles; annealing temperature was 50 &#x000b0;C) using corresponding meth-primers. (Primer sequences are available upon request.) PCR products were gel purified, cloned into pGEM-T vector, and sequenced with BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) in ABI 3100 sequencer. Efficiency of bisulfite modification was determined by evaluating transformation to T of non CpG Cs. The maximum non-transformed Cs observed was one out of 51.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0040355-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Western Blot Analysis of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b Expressed in Nuclear-Injected <italic>Xenopus</italic> Oocytes</title><p>Left and right panels show analysis of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, respectively.

A <italic>H19</italic> ICR plasmid was co-injected with variety of cDNA expression plasmids; GFP fluorescence was used to select oocytes that had been properly injected. Efficiency of bisulfite modification was determined by evaluating transformation to T of non-CpG Cs. The maximum non-transformed Cs observed was one out of 51.</p><p>(A) The specific expression plasmids co-injected with <italic>H19</italic> ICR are indicated on the right side of the figure. Left panels indicate the methylation status of the 11 CpGs within the m3 region of the <italic>H19</italic> ICR. Grey-shaded parts indicate the position of the CTCF consensus sequence within m3. Open circle (&#x025cb;) indictates non-methylated CpG; filled circle (&#x02022;) indicates methylated CpG. Optimal methylation is dependent on the expression of CTCFL, PRMT7, and all Dnmt3s. Oocytes were analyzed 48 h after injection.</p><p>(B) Methylation analysis of co-injected control DNA plasmid<bold>.</bold> Organization of presented data is as for (A). The control fragment contains a unique sequence fragment present on Chromosome 8 and was also used as a control in ChIP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040355-g002">2</xref>C). No significant methylation was observed with expression of CTCFL, PRMT7, and the Dnmt3a, -b, and -L, confirming sequence specificity of the ICR methylation analyzed in (A).</p><p>(C) Functional analysis of the Dnmt3 isoforms. Organization of presented data is as for (A). Omission of Dnmt3L reduces methylation to 0&#x00025;. Removal of either Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b significantly reduced observed methylation. Maximal ICR methylation is observed when all three Dnmt3s are co-injected with CTCFL and PRMT7. Oocytes were analyzed 72 h after injection.</p><p>(D) Detection of SYM-R3H4 in sulfuric acid&#x02013;extracted proteins from microinjected <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Expression plasmids injected are indicated on the figure. An increase in SYM-R3H4 is observed in the presence of both CTCFL and PRMT7.

The localization to ICR is assured by the zinc finger portion of CTCFL, whereas the interactions with histones and PRMT7 are taking place via the N-terminal portion of the protein.</p><p>(B) Following disengagement of the CTCFL complex, the de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are recruited by either their PWWP motifs or through a bridging protein to the methylated histones. Dnmt3L is recruited by direct interaction with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Subsequent to their recruitment, the de novo DNA methyltransferases methylate adjacent CpGs, resulting in ICR methylation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040355.g008"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="ack3" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests.</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> PJ and PS conceived and designed the experiments.
