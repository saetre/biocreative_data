As a result of these metabolic functions, liver encounters both continuous and intermittent oxidative challenges. To counteract endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, hepatocytes have abundant antioxidant enzymes, including thioredoxin reductases (Txnrd), glutathione reductase (GSR), superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxiredoxins (Prx), and glutathione peroxidases (Gpx), and they have high levels of electron carriers, such as thioredoxins (Txn), glutaredoxins (Grx), and glutathione (GSH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006158-Cesaratto1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> to transfer reducing potential to other reductases.

Because the Txnrd1/Txn1 pathway participates in constitutive maintenance of the redox state of hepatocytes, one might predict that disruption of this pathway in liver would result in chronic oxidative stress. However, Txnrd1-deficient hepatocytes are long-term viable and do not exhibit hallmark signs of chronic oxidative stress (ESS, GFM, and EES, unpublished data; and see below). In the current study, transcriptome analyses showed activation of cytoprotective mRNAs in Txnrd1-deficient liver. Many of these were encoded by Nrf2-response genes. These results suggest that oxidative/chemical stress response pathways are able to compensate for chronic defects in the constitutive antioxidant pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Establishment of Mice Bearing <italic>txnrd1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Hepatocytes</title><p>We previously reported generation of a mouse line bearing a conditional-null <italic>txnrd1</italic> allele, entitled <italic>txnrd1<sup>cond</sup></italic>, that converts to a true null (<italic>txnrd1<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic>) upon expression of Cre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006158-Bondareva1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Instead, we expected that another constitutive electron supplier, like GSR, would compensate for this chronic deficiency. Also, Txnrd1-deficient livers show no evidence of oxidative stress (ESS, GFM, and EES, unpublished data; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006158.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). This indicates the response pathways revealed in the Txnrd1-deficient liver transcriptome, including induction of mRNAs encoding GSTs, Gpx2, and Srx1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006158.s005">Table S1</xref>), are likely effective at detoxifying ROS.</p><p>Importantly, in the absence of measurable oxidative stress, it is unclear what is activating Nrf2. One intriguing possibility is that the Txnrd1/Txn1 system, itself, serves as a part of the Nrf2 stress-response trigger. Thus, active Txnrd1/Txn would maintain the pathway in a repressed state. Challenges that transiently impair Txnrd1/Txn, for example by inducing accumulation of ROS and oxidizing critical sulfhydryls, would de-repress the pathway. Ablation of Txnrd1 in our mice would thus mimic oxidative or xenobiotic challenge and induce a constitutively &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; Nrf2 pathway in the absence of any challenge. Further studies will be required to test this model.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Mammalian Selenoproteins</title><p>Txnrd1 is a selenoprotein.
