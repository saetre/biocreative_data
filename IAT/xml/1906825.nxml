The BRCA1 protein has an amino terminal RING finger domain, potentially involved in ubiquitination, and two BRCA1 C-terminal domains (BRCT), which interact with a number of proteins involved in the transactivation of genes. The central portion of BRCA1, mainly encoded by exon11, contains two nuclear localization signals and interacts with proteins involved in DNA repair as well as the centrosomal protein, &#x003b3;-tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Evidence suggests that BRCA1 functions as a scaffold, coordinating DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the transactivation of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and centrosome separation or maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The phosphorylation of BRCA1 may be important for its function throughout the cell cycle. BRCA1 is hypophosphorylated during G1/S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; however, it becomes phosphorylated from S to G2/M phase. BRCA1 also interacts with kinases involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis such as the cyclin/cdk complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and a hypophosphorylated form of BRCA1 has been found at the centrosomes during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The vertebrate serine/threonine protein phosphatase, PP1, has 3 isoforms: &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; (also known as &#x003b4;) and &#x003b3; that are highly conserved across their large catalytic domain, but are divergent at the amino- and carboxy-termini. Regulatory proteins bind to the unique carboxy termini of the PP1 isoforms to direct their isoform specific activities. For example, <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b3; knock-out mice have impaired spermiogenesis, indicating that the other PP1 isoforms are not entirely able to compensate for the loss of PP1&#x003b3;; and the presence of polyploid spermatids in these mice suggests a defect in meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, the PP1&#x003b1; isoform has also been found to associate with BRCA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>We have used a yeast two-hybrid assay to detect proteins that interact with exon11 of BRCA1. This large exon encodes roughly 60% of the protein, and we wished to identify potentially important interacting proteins outside of the intensely studied RING and C-terminal regions of BRCA1. The identification of PP1&#x003b2; as a BRCA1 interacting protein and characterization of the interaction of BRCA1 with PP1&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, provides new insights into the roles of both BRCA1 and the PP1 isoforms. These biochemical results led to analysis of the expression of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>as well as <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;, which has provided unique evidence for their potential deregulation in breast cancer. Disruption of the interaction of BRCA1 with PP1, or deregulation of its expression, could result in changes in the balance of kinase and phosphatase activities in the cell, leading to tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Two-hybrid screening in yeast</title><p>Sequences from 900 to 4000 bp of BRCA1, were ligated into the DNA binding domain (DBD) yeast expression vector pAS1 (GAL4 <sub>(1&#x02013;147) </sub>DNA-BD, TRP1, amp<sup>r</sup>).

Thermal cycling consisted of a hold at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds and 60&#x000b0;C for 60 seconds, using the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems (ABI)). Standard curves of serial dilutions ranging from 3 &#x000d7; to 0.005 &#x000d7; of a pool of cDNA were used for quantification, and slopes generated by the standard curves ranged from 3.3 to 3.6. Test probes were conjugated to the FAM&#x02122; fluor (Applied Biosystems), and the HPRT1 endogenous control probe was conjugated to the VIC&#x02122; fluor (Applied Biosystems).

We compared the expression levels of the genes to that of the HPRT-1 housekeeping gene for each sample, and all mRNA/HPRT-1 expression levels were approximately one when comparing a pool of cell line cDNA for each experiment to prevent variation between experiments. For our purposes, mRNA/HPRT-1 ratios of less than 0.5 &#x000d7; the mean level of expression were considered to be under-expressed, while mRNA/HPRT-1 ratios of greater than 2 &#x000d7; the mean level of expression were considered to be over-expressed.

The group of breast tumors with a 'low' level of <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; mRNA was compared to those with 'high' <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; expression. Although no correlations were observed in age, menopausal status, tumor size, histologic grade, PgR status and lymphatic invasion, we did detect an association between low <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; expression and ER status (<italic>p </italic>= 0.02). Tumors with 'low' <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; levels were more likely to be negative for ER receptor than those with 'high' <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; levels (87% vs. 25%). No correlations were observed between 'high' or 'low' <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b2; expression and any of the tumor characteristics outlined above.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>BRCA1 interacts with a large number of proteins, and may function as a scaffold protein to bring cell cycle or DNA repair processes together, but the mechanisms by which BRCA1 functions in these processes have yet to be fully elucidated. We performed a yeast two-hybrid study to identify proteins that interact with exon11 of BRCA1. The region of BRCA1 encoded by exon 11 is known to interact with a number of proteins involved in DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], as well as &#x003b3;-tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and several kinases including Aurora-A kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and ChkII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Identification of additional interacting partners, particularly ones that could modify the activity of a BRCA1 through changes in phosphorylation, may further aid in clarifying its function and regulation. In this yeast two-hybrid study, we identified the serine/threonine phosphatase PP1&#x003b2; as a BRCA1 interacting protein, which could have important consequences on both the activity of BRCA1 and the regulation of PP1&#x003b2; activity.</p><p>PP1 has 3 isoforms encoded by different genes that are 97% conserved across their catalytic domains and distinct roles for each isoform have yet to be determined. When we coimmunoprecipitated Flag-epitope tagged PP1&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; with BRCA1, we observed that all 3 isoforms interacted with BRCA1. Additionally, we have identified the functional PP1 interacting domain within BRCA1. This domain is found in other PP1 regulatory proteins, suggesting that BRCA1 may regulate the activity of PP1 and could act as a scaffold protein to promote the dephosphorylation of BRCA1 associated proteins by PP1.</p><p>The expression levels of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>and the <italic>PP1 </italic>isoforms were analyzed in primary human breast tumors. Low levels of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>mRNA were identified, consistent with decreased expression rather than mutation as a method for <italic>BRCA1 </italic>inactivation in these tumors. Additionally, we observed variable levels of expression for <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, but not <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b3;. Interestingly, decreased levels of <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; were identified when comparing their gene expression levels from normal breast tissue with expression levels from sporadic breast tumors (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This decreased expression may lead to perturbations of PP1 protein levels, altering the balance of kinase and phosphatase activities acting on specific substrates and potentially disrupting important cellular functions.</p><p>The use of primary human breast tumors allowed us to examine correlations between tumor and patient characteristics with <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; or &#x003b2; expression. Interestingly, we observed a statistically significant association between the level of <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; expression and estrogen receptor (ER) status using our small sample of 24 sporadic tumors, which will need to be investigated further in a larger sample set. ER turnover is affected by a basal level of phosphorylation that is maintained through a balance of kinase and phosphatase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Activation of protein phosphatase PP2A has recently been shown to increase the level of ER mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Our results indicate that tumors with low expression of <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; are more likely to be ER negative than tumors with high expression of <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; (87% vs. 25%) and it is possible that PP1&#x003b1; has a role in ER mRNA stability, similarly to that of PP2A.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have characterized the interaction of PP1 with BRCA1 and have identified a PP1 binding domain within BRCA1 that is necessary for this interaction to occur. Furthermore, expression of the <italic>PP1 </italic>isoforms as well as several genes encoding BRCA1 interacting proteins was analyzed in primary human invasive breast tumors. We detected low levels of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>expression in 28% of tumors, respectively, and variable levels of <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;. Moreover, significant decreases in expression were observed for <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b2; and PP1&#x003b3; when comparing normal breast tissue with invasive breast cancers. Additionally, a significant association of <italic>PP1</italic>&#x003b1; levels with ER status in breast tumors was identified that could lead to additional studies into the effect of PP1&#x003b1; on ER mRNA stability and its role in the development of breast cancer. The studies presented here provide evidence for an important role for PP1 in the development of breast cancer, possibly through its association with BRCA1, and suggest that deregulation of the balance of kinase and phosphatase activity in the cell may be an important component of breast tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BRCA1: Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1, BRCT (BRCA1 Carboxy-terminal domain), AD: Activating Domain, DBD: DNA binding domain, MEF: Mouse embryonic fibroblast, PP1: Protein Phosphatase 1</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SLW performed the biochemical analysis for the interaction of BRCA1 and PP1 and designed the expression studies, interpreted results and drafted the manuscript.
