We have obtained a cellular model for studying the role of hSuv3p helicase in human mitochondria. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the <italic>hSUV3</italic> gene which encodes a protein with no ATPase or helicase activity results in perturbations of mtRNA metabolism and enables to study the processing and degradation intermediates which otherwise are difficult to detect because of their short half-lives. The hSuv3p activity was found to be necessary in the regulation of stability of mature, properly formed mRNAs and for removal of the noncoding processing intermediates transcribed from both H and L-strands, including mirror RNAs which represent antisense RNAs transcribed from the opposite DNA strand. Lack of hSuv3p function also resulted in accumulation of aberrant RNA species, molecules with extended poly(A) tails and degradation intermediates truncated predominantly at their 3&#x02032;-ends. Moreover, we present data indicating that hSuv3p co-purifies with PNPase; this may suggest participation of both proteins in mtRNA metabolism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA degradation plays a key role in controlling the concentration of a given transcript. In addition, prompt removal of aberrant RNA molecules and maturation products is vital for maintaining homeostasis in living cells. In order to ensure proper turnover of RNA and its quality control in different cellular compartments divergent protein complexes have evolved. While their composition for various taxa may be quite different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>), all contain exoribonucleases acting either 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;; and helicases which are necessary to unwind double-stranded regions of RNA or act as molecular motors feeding the RNA substrate into the catalytic center of the ribonuclease subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>In mitochondria control of transcription is usually very simple and post-transcriptional events seem to be the predominant way of regulating gene expression; thus RNA degradation is of particular importance. The first described enzymatic machinery for mitochondrial RNA degradation was the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mitochondrial degradosome or mtEXO. It consists of two subunits: the NTP-dependent RNA helicase related to the DExH/D (Ski2p) superfamily; and the 3&#x02032;- to 5&#x02032;-exoribonuclease belonging to the RNR family (RNase II-like), encoded by the nuclear genes <italic>SUV3</italic> (YPL029W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and <italic>DSS1</italic> (YMR287C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), respectively. Activities of both proteins are required for the functioning of the degradosome complex, and the &#x02018;inchworm&#x02019; model of its activity has been proposed where depending on ATP hydrolysis the cleft between the two SUV3 domains opens and closes allowing the helicase to move the substrate into the active site of <italic>DSS1</italic> ribonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Inactivation of either <italic>SUV3</italic> or <italic>DSS1</italic> gene results in respiratory deficiency and decreased stability of the mitochondrial genome. At the molecular level, the loss of the degradosome functions results in overaccumulation of excised introns, accumulation of transcripts with abnormal 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; termini and the appearance of unprocessed high-molecular-weight precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). All these phenotypes are consistent with the proposed role of the yeast mitochondrial degradosome in RNA turnover and surveillance.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the protein complex in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> consisting of <italic>SUV3</italic> and <italic>DSS1</italic> orthologs (genes <italic>rpm2</italic> and <italic>rpm1</italic> encoding Pah1p and Par1p, respectively) was found to play only a minor, if any role in RNA degradation: it was proposed to be directly involved in mtRNA processing and was found essential for the generation of 3&#x02032;-ends of mitochondrial transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>A similar protein complex containing orthologs of <italic>SUV3</italic> and <italic>DSS1</italic>, TbSUV3 and TbDSS-1, respectively, was recently described for mitochondria from <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The TbDSS-1 exoribonuclease was shown to function in elimination of nonfunctional byproducts of RNA processing and its depletion resulted in aberrant levels of unedited messenger RNAs (mRNAs), edited mRNAs and guide RNAs. Interestingly, TbDSS-1 was suggested to have additional functions in processing of pre-mRNAs and was found to be associated with a large multicomponent protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>).</p><p>Human mitochondrial RNA turnover, surveillance and processing have remained an unsolved puzzle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). RNA synthesis in human mitochondria starts at only three points, one for the L strand and two for the H strand, and the resulting large transcripts are subsequently processed into two rRNAs (12S and 16S), 11 polyadenylated mRNAs and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Mammalian mitochondrial genomes contain no introns, but excised large noncoding regions from the transcribed L-strand must be efficiently degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Human hSuv3p protein seemed to be a good candidate for a subunit of the putative human degradosome: an RNA helicase activity is indispensable for functioning of all known complexes involved in RNA decay and surveillance; and the <italic>SUV3</italic> gene was found to be very ancient and its orthologs were found in all eukaryotes and Rhodobacter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The human ortholog of the yeast <italic>SUV3</italic> gene (<italic>hSUV3</italic>, <italic>SUPV3L1</italic>) was identified by homology search and complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning. The protein contains a <italic>bona fide</italic> mitochondrial leader and it localizes predominantly in the mitochondrial matrix, although a fraction could be found in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Analysis of the <italic>hSUV3</italic> promoter indicates that it is a housekeeping gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). hSuv3p protein heterologously expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was found <italic>in vitro</italic> to be an ATP-dependent multisubstrate helicase, able to unwind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and RNA&#x02013;DNA heteroduplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The details of the hSuv3p mitochondrial function have been missing, except for a single experiment showing the presence of low-molecular-weight truncated ND2 transcripts upon <italic>hSUV3</italic> gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Moreover, the fact that the human hSuv3p helicase preferentially unwinds dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and has been found in mitochondrial nucleoids suggested its role in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and not necessarily in RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>The search for the ribonuclease component of human mitochondrial degradation pathway proved to be difficult. No mammalian orthologs of the yeast <italic>DSS1</italic> gene have been found and no RNAse-like genes with a putative mitochondrial signal sequence could be identified (our unpublished data). A number of RNase activities were detected in mammalian mitochondrial extracts, but these could not be identified by proteomic analysis (Chrzanowska-Lightowlers,Z., personal communication). One of the candidates for human mitochondrial exoribonuclease has been polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) which is able to catalyze processive phosphorolytic degradation of RNA from 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032;; it can also polymerize RNA in a random, template-independent process from 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;. PNPases have been conserved in evolution and have been found in bacteria, plants, worms, flies and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic> PNPase functions in an RNA degrading complex called degradosome, where it is associated with an RNA helicase, endoribonuclease (ribonuclease E) and enolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). It was described as a polyadenylating enzyme in Gram-positive bacteria, cyanobacteria and chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In plant mitochondria, PNPase is responsible for polyadenylation-dependent degradation of RNAs: particularly of RNA maturation byproducts and of antisense RNAs transcribed from the opposite DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>The human PNPase encoded by the nuclear gene PNPT1 has been discovered as an enzyme upregulated in senescent progeroid fibroblasts and in melanoma cells which undergo terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and it has been suggested that it acts by degradation of RNAs in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). PNPase was found in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), but conflicting data were published on whether PNPase localizes to mitochondria only. While two reports indicated this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), the study of Sarkar and Fisher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) suggested both mitochondrial and cytosolic localization. The physiological role of PNPase in human mitochondria has been recently a matter of controversy, because two more recent studies found the protein in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Therefore, the direct participation of PNPase in mitochondrial RNA metabolism was questioned, although the siRNA inhibition of human PNPase expression resulted in the increased abundance of aberrant mtRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and elongation of poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Recently <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of heterologously expressed hSuv3p and human PNPase was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), but no <italic>in vivo</italic> data presenting hSuv3p&#x02013;PNPase interaction have been published to date.</p><p>Mutants defective in RNA decay provide a possibility to look into steps of RNA processing which are otherwise impossible to observe because of their high reaction speed and low abundance of intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In this paper, we show the construction of a stable human cell line expressing a missense hSuv3p mutant. When expressed, the mutant protein strongly interferes with the native hSuv3p complex and allows detection of otherwise unstable transcripts. The observed phenotypes include accumulation of intergenic noncoding regions transcribed from both strands of mtDNA and perturbations in polyadenylation. Our results suggest that the hSuv3p protein is indeed the key component of RNA metabolism in human mitochondria. We also report co-purification of hSuv3p helicase and PNPase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and cell manipulations</title><p>HeLa or 293 T-Rex cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37&#x000b0;C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The stable, inducible cell lines obtained in this work were cultured by using TET System Approved FBS (Clontech). For cell growth rate assessment 3.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> of the appropriate cells were plated, induced (or not) after 24 h and detached after the next 24 h. The cells were counted and plated at the same density as previously. Every second day the cells were detached, counted and plated. Part of the detached cells was used for RNA and protein isolation. In the RNA stability assay the cells were split, induced (or not) for 24 h and actinomycin D was added at a concentration of 5 &#x000b5;g/ml. For <italic>hSUV3</italic> gene silencing the HeLa cells or 293 T-Rex cells were grown to 40&#x02013;50% confluence and subjected to stealthRNA (Invitrogen) transfection. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. The stealthRNA specific for <italic>hSUV3</italic> silencing with oligo ID HSS110378 (named S1 in the paper), HSS110379 (S2), HSS186162 (S3) and negative control (Stealth&#x02122; RNAi Negative Control LO GC, N) were used at the final concentration of 20 nM. 293 T-Rex cells were subjected to a second round of transfection 2 days after first one and cultured for the next 3 days. Cells were collected after 3 days (HeLa) or 5 days (293 T-Rex).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA cloning and creation of stable transfected cell lines</title><p>DNA fragments encoding either full-length hSuv3p or its form without the 46 N-terminal residues were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by using pKK plasmid as a template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector (Invitrogen) to get pRS97 (full length) and pRS68 (truncated form). In order to obtain a DNA construct encoding hSuv3p in which Gly207 was substituted with Val the site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pRS97 and pRS68 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) to get pRS98 and pRS100, respectively. To construct DNA plasmids encoding C-terminal TAP protein fusions the DNA fragment encoding TAP tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) was PCR amplified and cloned into pcDNA5FRT vector (Invitrogen). Subsequently, DNA fragments encoding PNPase, hSuv3p or its N-terminal 26 aa were cloned in frame with TAP tag encoding DNA to get pcDNA5FRT-PNPTAP, pcDNA5FRT-hSuv3TAP, pcDNA5FRT-mtTAP. Sequences of the used primers are available upon request. The stable inducible cell lines overexpressing hSuv3p<sup>WT</sup> or hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> were obtained by using the Flp-In&#x02122; T-REx&#x02122; 293 system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. The host cell-line was co-transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI) reagent with 0.2 &#x000b5;g of appropriate construct (pRS68, pRS97, pRS98, pRS100) and 1.8 &#x000b5;g of pOG44 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were plated and subjected to selection by adding hygromycin B (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) (Invitrogen) and blasticidin (15 &#x003bc;g/ml) (Invitrogen). Selective medium was replaced every 2&#x02013;3 days. In all presented experiments, expression of the exogenous genes was induced with tetracycline at the concentration of 25 ng/ml. For uninducible cell lines expressing mtTAP (hSuv3p mitochondrial leader with TAP at the C-terminus), hSuv3TAP or PNPTAP identical procedure was applied; however pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen) vector was used and cells were not selected with blasticidin.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>For the <italic>hSUV3</italic> gene silencing control, the total protein cell extracts were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).

For standard northern blots 2.5&#x02013;3 &#x000b5;g of RNA was dissolved in denaturing solution composed of NBC buffer (50 mM boric acid, 1 mM sodium acetate, 5 mM NaOH), 5.5% formaldehyde and 50% formamide, heat-denatured for 5 min at 65&#x000b0;C, mixed with 2 &#x000b5;l of 10 loading dye (15% Ficoll, 0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol in 0.1 M EDTA, pH 8.0) and run on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde (0.9%) using NBC as an electrophoresis buffer. RiboRuler High Range RNA Ladder (Fermentas) was used as a marker. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to Nytran-N membrane (Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell BioScience) by overnight capillary transfer in 10&#x000d7;SSC (1.5 M sodium chloride, 150 mM sodium citrate). The filter was then washed briefly with 2&#x000d7;SSC and RNA was immobilized by ultraviolet-cross-linking. RNA was stained with methylene blue solution (0.02% methylene blue in 0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2). For high-resolution northern blots, 2 &#x000b5;g of RNA was mixed with an equal volume of denaturing loading dye (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol), heat denatured for 5 min at 65&#x000b0;C and run on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel in 1&#x000d7; TBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Heat-denaturated pUC19 DNA/MspI (Fermentas) was applied as a marker. After electrophoresis nucleic acids were blotted onto Nytran-N membrane (Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell BioScience) by semi-dry electrotransfer in 0.5 &#x000d7; TBE buffer using the Transblotter apparatus (Bio-Rad). All hybridizations were performed in PerfectHyb Plus buffer (Sigma). PCR products of the following mtDNA fragments: 3652&#x02013;4029 (ND1), 4807&#x02013;5172 (ND2), 10131&#x02013;10375 (ND3), 10470&#x02013;10758 (ND4L/4), 7586&#x02013;7900 (COX2), 904&#x02013;1307 (12S rRNA) and pUC19 DNA/MspI (Fermentas) were used as templates for preparing probes labeled with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P] dATP (Hartmann Analytic) using HexaLabel DNA Labeling Kit (Fermentas). In the case of strand-specific hybridizations [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P] UTP labeled riboprobes were applied. The PCR products containing SP6 or T7 promoter sequences (one on each end) corresponding to: 10470&#x02013;10758, 10131&#x02013;10375, 6503&#x02013;6922, 5587&#x02013;5891, 4807&#x02013;5172, 3652-4029 nt in the human mitochondrial genome were used for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription.

Therefore, we assumed that its expression in human cells might lead to dominant-negative effects. Genes encoding the wild-type hSuv3p protein (hSuv3p<sup>WT</sup>) or mutated hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> were integrated into the genome of human cell line 293 using the FlpIn system, which ensures an induction of the inserted genes by a low tetracycline concentration.

In order to check that the mutation and overproduction does not change the subcellular localization, immunofluorescence analysis was performed 24 h after induction, with uninduced cells used as a control to distinguish the signal from the endo- and exogenous hSuv3p. The results indicate that overproduced hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> protein, as well as hSuv3p<sup>WT</sup>, is localized in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).

The double band is in agreement with the results already shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). In contrast, the ND3 antisense probe detected molecules in the range from 200 nt to about 4000 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B), which is in agreement with the hybridization smear on northerns with the use of a double-stranded probe (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Although some hybridization signal was unspecific (especially from cytoplasmic rRNA), which was shown using RNA derived from 143B rho-zero cells lacking mitochondrial DNA and their parental cell line 143B, this analysis proved that expression of hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> leads to accumulation of noncoding RNA.</p><p>To check whether a similar accumulation of undegraded noncoding antisense RNA also takes place for other mtDNA regions, we analyzed transcripts representing regions ND4/4L, COX1, ND1 and ND2.

It should, however, be noted that the probe complementary to ND4/4L mRNA also detects small amounts of long RNA, but it does not accumulate to such a high degree as found for the probe for the noncoding RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>hSuv3p is involved in the degradation of mirror RNAs</title><p>Interestingly, analysis of the remaining mtDNA regions corresponding to COX1, ND1 and ND2 in cells expressing hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> showed not only the appearance of an antisense RNA smear but also a large increase of RNA with the same/similar length to the mRNA transcribed from the H strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). We have named such noncoding antisense RNA with a similar length to coding sense RNA mirror RNA. This RNA, at least in the case of ND1 and ND2, can also be detected in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C) but at a much lower level. This phenomenon was not observed in cells overproducing the wild-type hSuv3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C), which suggests that hSuv3p activity may be required for mirror RNA degradation.</p><p>In order to check if mirror RNA stability increases in cells expressing hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> we performed an experiment where we analyzed the changes in mirror ND2 RNA levels after transcription was inhibited. The mirror ND2 transcript was chosen because it can also be detected at low levels in RNA isolated from control cells. The performed analysis indicated that in control cells the mirror ND2 level decreases by about 50% an hour after actinomycin D addition and cannot be detected after 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D), while its level in cells expressing hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> does not change during the first hour and the first changes can only be observed 3 h after adding actinomycin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D). This indicates that hSuv3p participates in the degradation of noncoding RNA resulting from L-strand transcription.</p><p>In the case of some mRNAs, i.e. ND4/4L and COX1, the expression of hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> and the concomitant increase of antisense RNA leads to the decrease in respective sense mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B and C). However, this effect was not observed for the other analyzed transcripts. This may be due to <italic>in vivo</italic> annealing of sense RNA to its antisense counterpart and subsequent degradation by a yet unknown activity. It remains to be seen if this is only the collateral phenotype of our experimental setup, or if it may play a role in mitochondrial gene expression.</p><p>So far, we have demonstrated that human hSuv3p helicase is necessary for degradation of noncoding RNA resulting from L strand transcription. To see whether hSuv3p is also involved in eliminating noncoding RNA transcribed from the H strand, we have analyzed by strand-specific probes the region encompassing four tRNA genes: tRNA Tyr, Cys, Asn and Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). These tRNAs are generated by L-strand transcription. In the cells expressing inactive hSuv3p we found a considerable increase in the amount of 300&#x02013;350-nt-long RNA transcribed from the H strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>E), its length corresponds to the sum of the lengths of tRNA Tyr, Cys, Asn and Ala (305 nt). We suggest that this transcript corresponds to the H-strand transcribed mirror of tRNA Tyr, Cys, Asn and Ala (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C). This experiment indicates that hSuv3p is involved in removal of noncoding RNA transcribed from the H strand, similarly to the removal of L-strand intermediates as has been shown above. <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Mapping the ends of mirror transcripts.

Mirror RNAs are almost undetectable under normal conditions as they are very rapidly degraded. Taking advantage of their abundance in hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> cells we decided to characterize them further. The region corresponding to the COX1 gene was chosen for this analysis. The COX1 mRNA is transcribed from the H strand while on the opposite L-strand this sequence is flanked by two tRNA genes: Tyr and Ser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A).

No clones representing transcripts extended beyond these points were identified. This indicates that the mirror RNA of COX1 is the product of correct excision of natural native tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> from the polycistronic RNA transcribed from the L strand. In the uninduced cells more truncated transcripts, especially at the 3&#x02032;-end, were found: 84% clones (21/26) had the 5&#x02032;-end and only 40% had the 3&#x02032;-end without truncation.</p><p>Among all truncated transcripts the identified truncations were mainly from the 3&#x02032;-end (62.5%) whereas the transcripts truncated at the 5&#x02032;-end or both the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;-end were found in 13% and 24.5% clones, respectively.</p><p>A similar result was obtained for ND3 and ATP6/8 mRNAs and 12S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B).

The detection of polyadenylated transcripts resulting from L-strand transcription is in agreement with our analysis of the RNA fraction bound to oligo-dT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) and data obtained by other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>).</p><p>The CRT-PCR method is not fully quantitative so we decided to confirm our sequencing results by northern blots using two complementary single-stranded probes detecting the 12-nt intergenic region between the COX1 and tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A). Only the probe targeting RNAs transcribed from the L strand recognized molecules corresponding in size to the COX1 mirror RNA (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C) and only in the case of cells expressing hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C). As described above, this RNA was found in uninduced cells using CRT-PCR, but its level is probably too low for detection using the northern technique with the short oligonucleotide probe. Thus, our hybridization results for cells expressing hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> confirm that the majority of mirror COX1 RNA contains the 12-nt region adjacent to the 5&#x02032;-end of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, the probe detecting the 12-nt intergenic COX1-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> region transcribed from the H strand does not bind to any RNA, except for a low level of unspecific hybridization to cytoplasmic rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C). The intergenic RNA fragment is not present in the correctly processed COX1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).

The probe recognizing L-strand-derived transcripts detected only native tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, whereas the other probe detected noncoding RNA &#x0223c;300&#x02013;350 nt long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C), the same size as seen previously using a riboprobe detecting mirror RNA. This RNA represents sequences between tRNA Trp and COX1 genes transcribed from the H strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A and E). This result indicates that tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> is not a component of the L-strand transcribed mirror COX1 which is fully in agreement with our sequencing data.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the ND2 region</title><p>To confirm that mirror RNAs are generated by a standard tRNA excision pathway, we performed a similar experiment for the mirror ND2. The ND2 gene is preceded by the tRNA<sup>Met</sup> gene (both RNAs transcribed from the H strand), which is adjacent to the tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> gene (transcribed from the L strand) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Hybridization with a probe complementary to tRNA<sup>Met</sup> detected only this tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>D), whereas the probe complementary to the antisense tRNA<sup>Met</sup> detected an RNA with the size corresponding to mirror RNA previously detected by the L-strand-specific riboprobe (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>D with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C).

The probe corresponding to tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> but complementary to the L strand recognizes a short RNA molecule, which accumulates in cells expressing hSuv3p<sup>G207V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>D). This RNA corresponds to RNA encoded on the L strand between tRNA<sup>Met</sup> and tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A) which is released by the excision of those tRNAs from the primary transcript.

Therefore, we decided to check whether hSuv3p may interact with PNPase.

These conclusions come from experiments based on a stable cell line expressing in an inducible manner the missense mutant G207V of hSuv3p which leads to impairment of the function of the endogenous protein. Such an approach provides several experimental advantages over transient gene silencing by siRNA: upon induction all cells express the dominant negative mutant protein, while siRNA transfection efficiency may vary from experiment to experiment. In addition, the very low concentration of the inducer does not interfere with mitochondrial metabolism. Moreover, the inducible system allows studying the function of proteins necessary for cell survival and gives a better chance to observe primary effects in contrast to uninducible systems when compensatory mechanisms may mask the primary effects. Finally, the stable cell line allows the continuation of experiments for much longer than in the case of siRNA transfection.</p><p>If the hSuv3p protein participates in the coding RNA decay system, perturbation of its activity should lead to the increased stability of such RNA. Indeed, for the ND3 transcript, which has the shortest half-life among mitochondrial mRNAs, we observed a decrease of the rate of mature mRNA clearance in the mutant cell line compared to controls within 4 h after arresting mitochondrial transcription with actinomycin D. The increase of steady-state mRNA level for ND3, as well as other transcripts, 1&#x02013;3 days after induction of mutant hSuv3p are in agreement with these results. When our experiments were continued for up to 9 days we could observe progressive decay of mRNA levels, but we assume this is a secondary effect resulting from a general deregulation of mitochondrial nucleic acid metabolism. In conclusion, our results indicate that the hSuv3 protein is indeed involved in the decay of properly formed mRNA molecules.</p><p>In contrast to the observed increased stability of mature protein-coding transcripts, all tested tRNA species showed significantly lower abundance upon expression of the hSuv3p mutant. This may indicate that tRNA turnover is accomplished by a different enzymatic system, but more research is needed to explain this observation.</p><p>A function of RNA surveillance systems is the removal of physiologically normal, but not further required processing intermediates. The unique feature of mammalian mitochondrial gene expression is generation of two large transcripts encompassing the full L strand and H strand, which subsequently undergo processing. In contrast to the densely packed H-strand-derived transcript, the entire L-strand-derived RNA encodes only one polypeptide ND6 and 8 tRNA molecules. Therefore, the majority of L-strand-derived RNA represents intergenic regions, which after excision are very quickly degraded and usually escape detection. Using H-strand-specific probes we have shown that the expression of the mutant hSuv3p protein leads to a very strong accumulation of the processing intermediates generated by transcription of the L strand. Our results lead to the conclusion that the hSuv3p protein is necessary for the proper degradation of processing intermediates in human mitochondria. In this respect, it resembles the yeast mitochondrial degradosome, where the knockout of the <italic>ySUV3</italic> gene results in strong accumulation of excised introns.</p><p>Our experimental setup provides a possibility to look closely into the details of this process, and constitutes a valuable tool for further studies of the activities that participate in it. One of the characteristic features of these processing intermediates detected in flagranti is so-called mirror RNAs; i.e. RNA molecules that result from transcription and processing of the same DNA region, but originating from the complementary DNA strand. RNA processing in mammalian mitochondria depends in most cases on punctuation of protein-coding sequences by tRNA sequences. Our data have shown that in the case of mirror RNAs, the processing machinery properly recognizes flanking tRNA molecules and produces in this way the mirror RNA which is subsequently polyadenylated and degraded. There is an open question if such mirror RNAs play a physiological role, for example, in mtDNA replication or translational control. Our data indicate that the increased level of a given antisense RNA correlates with the lower level of some of the respective functional RNAs (COX1, ND4/4L). This fact may suggest a regulatory role for mirror RNAs, in addition it seems that another, not yet described degradation system is responsible for the observed decay of &#x02018;sense&#x02019; RNA.</p><p>The second function of a surveillance system is the degradation of aberrantly formed RNAs. We reasoned that the inhibition of hSuv3p function may result in the increased abundance of such molecules. We performed sequencing of re-ligated RNA molecules which enables to analyze both 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-ends of mitochondrial RNAs. We were able to detect the accumulation of truncated transcripts which, taking into account our other data, most likely represent degradation intermediates. Interestingly, in two isolated cases we have found polyuridinylated RNA. Although their frequency is low, they were identified only in RNA isolated from cells with impaired hSuv3p function. Moreover, they are the only identified transcripts which were composed of mRNA and tRNA and therefore represent the products of improper processing of the polycistronic precursor. We are not able to distinguish whether they appear as a direct or indirect consequence of the lack of hSuv3p function but it may suggest that polyuridinylation is used for tagging and removing aberrantly processed transcripts. It should be noted that Slomovic and Schuster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) have shown an increased amount of improperly matured polyuridinylated COX1 transcript in cells with silenced PNPase.</p><p>Until now, functions of mitochondrial complexes containing <italic>SUV3</italic> orthologs have only been described for two yeast species and <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>. The <italic>SUV3</italic>/<italic>DSS1</italic> mitochondrial degradosome from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has been postulated to participate in RNA surveillance, but not in RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In contrast, the protein complex from <italic>S. pombe</italic>, containing orthologs of Suv3 and Dss1 proteins, respectively Pah1p and Par1p, was recently postulated to be a mitochondrial processosome: inactivation of any of the two subunits resulted in complete block of RNA processing, with a variety of truncations and extensions at 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-ends of mRNAs. The most characteristic phenotype of these mutants was the complete lack of properly formed mature mRNAs. Thus, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Pah1p protein was suggested to play a minor role, if any, in RNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Do the observed aberrant forms of mtRNA represent products of mitochondrial RNA metabolism caught in flagranti due to impaired degradation or do they reflect hSuv3p participation in RNA processing? Our hybridization data and sequence analysis indicate that the aberrant forms exist in the control cells, but their abundance is much lower. Thus, we favor the hypothesis that using our experimental system we only increase their abundance and that the hSuv3p protein may not play a direct role in RNA processing. In addition, we detect a significant amount of mature, properly formed mRNA, and our sequencing analysis revealed only two cases of intermediates containing an unprocessed tRNA molecule on either end. Therefore, it seems that the human hSuv3p function differs from that in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> processosome, and is rather functionally similar to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> degradosome. Since the majority of truncations occurred at the 3&#x02032;-end we suggest that the hSuv3p-dependent degradation pathway operates in the 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; direction. This resemblance of functions has been conserved in evolution despite the fact that no human ortholog of yeast <italic>DSS1</italic> gene has been detected.</p><p>The presence of PNPase in the mitochondrial IMS has been an unsolved puzzle: what is the role, if any, of this enzyme in mitochondrial RNA metabolism, and what are the molecular partners of PNPase? How can PNPase residing in the IMS be involved in processing and possibly polyadenylation of mitochondrial RNAs which are localized in the matrix? Conflicting results were presented when PNPase expression was downregulated by using RNA interference: one study showed that lowering the PNPase levels did not affect mitochondrial morphology or the consumption of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), the other study showed that PNPase knockdown results in the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, fragmentation of mitochondria, significant lowering of ATP level and lower levels of activity of respiratory complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In addition, several laboratories studied mitochondrial RNA metabolism in mammalian cells depleted for PNPase: Nagaike <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) reported the presence of longer poly(A) tails of some mitochondrial transcripts upon RNA interference, but the steady-state levels of the mRNAs remained unchanged. Similarly, Chen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) did not detect any changes in mtRNA abundance. On the other hand, in PNPase knockdown cells, Slomovic and Schuster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) reported abolishment of stable polyadenylation and the presence of an unprocessed 9 nt sequence at the 5&#x02032;-end of COX1 mRNA, while poly(A) tails of ND5 and ND3 transcripts increased in length. Nevertheless, the authors suggested that these phenotypes are secondary effects, because they considered unlikely the direct action of IMS-localized PNPase on RNA metabolism in the matrix. The possible link between polyadenylation and degradation in mitochondrial RNA was therefore missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that TAP-tagged hSuv3p co-purifies with PNPase, and TAP-tagged PNPase co-purifies with hSuv3p. This is in agreement with the data of Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) who recently demonstrated that the two proteins form a stable and active complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our result suggests <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction of those proteins although we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed interaction occurs after the lysis of mitochondria, in which case the intermembrane-residing PNPase would react with matrix-residing hSuv3p. More research is needed to resolve this issue, especially in the context of the well-documented localization of PNPase in the IMS. Our gel filtration analysis of mitochondrial proteins revealed that hSuv3p and PNPase elute in two overlapping peaks, which suggests that only a relatively small portion of the two proteins may form a complex. Therefore, <italic>in vivo</italic> only a fraction of PNPase could enter the mitochondrial matrix and form a stable complex with the hSuv3p protein, which then could participate in mtRNA surveillance. This suggestion is in contrast to Slomovic and Schuster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), who favored the model of indirect influence of PNPase silencing on mtRNA metabolism.</p><p>Data presented in this paper on lengthening of poly(A) tails upon hSuv3p inhibition are in agreement with those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), who reported elongation of poly(A) tails of mitochondrial mRNAs upon transient PNPase silencing. We consider this a further indication that both proteins may cooperate <italic>in vivo</italic>. Nevertheless, the effects of the hSuv3p mutant on mtRNA metabolism observed by us are stronger than those published due to the PNPase silencing: in particular no accumulation of the L-strand-derived processing intermediates has been reported previously in cells with a lower level of PNPase. It is possible that PNPase silencing using siRNA was not sufficiently strong to inhibit its activity in the mitochondrial matrix. The other possibility is that similarly to bacterial systems, the mammalian mitochondrial degradosome contains yet another ribonuclease which has escaped identification to date. Clearly, more research is needed to solve this problem.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The Polish National Centre for Research and Development (NR13004704); the Polish Ministry for Science and Higher Education (NN301014333); Polish Mitochondrial Network MitoNet; and Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw intramural grants (BW179112, BW179107).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
