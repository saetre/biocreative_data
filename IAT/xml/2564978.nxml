MicroRNA miR-34 was recently found to be a direct target of p53, functioning downstream of the p53 pathway as a tumor suppressor. miR-34 targets Notch, HMGA2, and Bcl-2, genes involved in the self-renewal and survival of cancer stem cells. The role of miR-34 in gastric cancer has not been reported previously. In this study, we examined the effects of miR-34 restoration on p53-mutant human gastric cancer cells and potential target gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Human gastric cancer cells were transfected with miR-34 mimics or infected with the lentiviral miR-34-MIF expression system, and validated by miR-34 reporter assay using Bcl-2 3'UTR reporter. Potential target gene expression was assessed by Western blot for proteins, and by quantitative real-time RT-PCR for mRNAs. The effects of miR-34 restoration were assessed by cell growth assay, cell cycle analysis, caspase-3 activation, and cytotoxicity assay, as well as by tumorsphere formation and growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Human gastric cancer Kato III cells with miR-34 restoration reduced the expression of target genes Bcl-2, Notch, and HMGA2. Bcl-2 3'UTR reporter assay showed that the transfected miR-34s were functional and confirmed that Bcl-2 is a direct target of miR-34. Restoration of miR-34 chemosensitized Kato III cells with a high level of Bcl-2, but not MKN-45 cells with a low level of Bcl-2. miR-34 impaired cell growth, accumulated the cells in G1 phase, increased caspase-3 activation, and, more significantly, inhibited tumorsphere formation and growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that in p53-deficient human gastric cancer cells, restoration of functional miR-34 inhibits cell growth and induces chemosensitization and apoptosis, indicating that miR-34 may restore p53 function. Restoration of miR-34 inhibits tumorsphere formation and growth, which is reported to be correlated to the self-renewal of cancer stem cells. The mechanism of miR-34-mediated suppression of self-renewal appears to be related to the direct modulation of downstream targets Bcl-2, Notch, and HMGA2, indicating that miR-34 may be involved in gastric cancer stem cell self-renewal/differentiation decision-making. Our study suggests that restoration of the tumor suppressor miR-34 may provide a novel molecular therapy for p53-mutant gastric cancer.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a conserved class of non-coding 20&#x02013;22 nt small RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to mRNA, leading to mRNA degradation or inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. miRNAs regulate a variety of biological processes, including developmental timing, signal transduction, tissue differentiation and maintenance, disease, and carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Emerging evidence demonstrates that miRNAs also play an essential role in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by negatively regulating the expression of certain key genes in stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. One study has shown that MicroRNA-21 knockdown disrupts glioma growth <italic>in vivo </italic>and displays synergistic cytotoxicity with neural precursor cell delivered S-TRAIL in human gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Another recent study shows that miRNA Let-7 regulates self renewal of breast cancer stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Other miRNAs, such as miR-15 and miR-16, have been reported to be able to downregulate Bcl-2, a proto-oncogene overexpressed in many type of cancers, leading to a prevention of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has been shown that this obstacle to apoptosis due to overexpression of Bcl-2 results in an increased number of stem cells <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This suggests that apoptosis plays a role in regulating the microenvironments of stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, the Bcl-2 signaling pathway is necessary for the survival of stem cells, especially cancer stem cells, because of the overexpression of Bcl-2 in cancer cells.</p><p>Recently, miRNA miR-34 was identified as a p53 target and a potential tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Over 50% of human cancers have mutant p53 and the expression of miR-34a, b, c appears to be correlated with p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Bommer et al. reported that the abundance of the three-member miRNA34 family is directly regulated by p53 in cell lines and tissues, and the Bcl-2 protein is regulated directly by miR-34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The expression of miR-34 is dramatically reduced in 6 of 14 (43%) non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and the restoration of miR-34 expression inhibits growth of NSCLC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. He et al. reported that ectopic expression of miR-34 induces cell cycle arrest in both primary and tumor-derived cell lines, which is consistent with the observed ability of miR-34 to downregulate a program of genes promoting cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. miR-34a has been reported to be involved in p53-mediated apoptosis in colon cancer and pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Tazawa et al. provided evidence that miR-34a induced senescence-like growth arrest in human colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Taken together, these published studies establish that miR-34 is a new tumor suppressor functioning downstream of the p53 pathway, and provide impetus to explore the functional restoration of miR-34 as a novel therapy for cancers lacking p53 signalling.</p><p>It has been reported that miR-34 targets Notch, HMGA2, and Bcl-2, genes involved in the self-renewal and survival of cancer stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Delineating the role of miR-34 in regulation of cell growth and tumor progression, as well as its potential relationship to cancer stem cells, will help us better understand the p53 tumor suppressor signalling network, facilitate our research in carcinogenesis and cancer therapy, and serve as a basis for our exploration of novel strategies in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Thus far, there is limited study on miRNA and gastric cancer; the link between p53 downstream target miR-34 and gastric cancer has not been established; and the role of miR-34 in gastric cancer remains to be investigated. In the current study, we examined the effects of functional restoration of miR-34 by miR-34 mimics and lentiviral miR-34a on human gastric cancer cells, and the effect of miR-34 on tumorsphere formation and growth of p53-mutant gastric cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>Human gastric cancer cell lines Kato III, AGS, N87, MKN45, and normal human lung fibroblast cell line WI-38 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM (HyClone, Logan, UT), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT). miRNA miR-34a, b, c mimics, antagonists, and negative control miRNA mimic (NC mimic) were obtained from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL) with the sequences for <italic>hsa-miR-34a: </italic>5'-<italic>uggcagugucuuagcugguugu</italic>-3'<italic>; hsa-miR-34b: </italic>5'-<italic>caaucacuaacuccacugccau</italic>-3'<italic>; hsa-miR-34c: </italic>5'-<italic>aggcaguguaguuagcugauugc</italic>-3'.

We therefore investigated whether miR-34 restoration could sensitize gastric cancer cells with high a level of Bcl-2 to chemotherapy. We chose four chemotherapeutic agents, doxorubicin, cisplatin (CDDP), gemcitabine, and docetaxel, all of which are used in gastrointestinal cancer chemotherapy. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, miR-34 restoration in Kato III cells rendered the cells 2-3-fold more sensitive to the four chemotherapeutic agents, as compared with the cells transfected with the control mimic, based on IC50 data.

More significantly, miR-34 potently inhibits tumorsphere formation and growth in p53-mutant human gastric cancer cells, providing the first proof-of-concept that there is a potential link between the tumor suppressor miR-34 and gastric cancer cell self-renewal, which involves the presumed gastric cancer stem cells. The mechanism of miR-34-mediated suppression of gastric cancer cell self-renewal might be related to the direct modulation of downstream targets Bcl-2, Notch, and HMGA2, implying that miR-34 may be involved in gastric cancer stem cell self-renewal/differentiation decision-making. Our data suggest that miR-34 may hold significant promise as a novel molecular therapy for human gastric cancer, potentially for gastric cancer stem cells.</p><p>Proteins in the Bcl-2 family are central regulators of programmed cell death, and members that inhibit apoptosis, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are overexpressed in many cancers and contribute to tumor initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Bcl-2 is the founding member of this family of proteins and was first isolated as the product of an oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This family of proteins includes both anti-apoptotic molecules, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bax, Bak, Bid, and Bad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These are crucial regulators of apoptosis mediated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Overexpression of Bcl-2 is observed in a majority of human cancers, including gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The expression level of Bcl-2 protein also correlates with resistance to a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein decreases the pro-apoptotic response to such cellular insults as irradiation and chemotherapy, leading to resistance to the treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Thus, Bcl-2 is a highly attractive target for the development of novel molecular therapy for the treatment of human cancer.</p><p>In our recent study with multidrug resistant human gastric cancer AGS cells, Bcl-2 upregulation and p53 downregulation are found to be involved in drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, simultaneous inhibition of Bcl-2 function and restoration of p53 represents a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance and improve efficacy for the treatment of p53-mutant gastric cancer. This strategy was explored in the current study, where p53 downstream target miR-34 was restored in p53-mutant gastric cancer Kato III cells with a high level of Bcl-2 and low levels of miR-34, resulting in downregulation of Bcl-2 and Notch/HMGA2, tumor cell growth inhibition and accumulation in G1 phase, and chemosensitization and Caspase-3 activation/apoptosis. miR-34 restoration could thus rebuild, at least in part, the p53 tumor-suppressing signalling network in gastric cancer cells lacking p53 function. This multi-mode action of miR-34 provides a therapeutic advantage over other molecular therapies, in that miR-34 has multiple targets and can work on multiple cell signalling pathways simultaneously, leading to synergistic effects that may translate into improved clinical efficacy for gastric cancer patients with p53 deficiency and multidrug resistance.</p><p>Another important implication from the current study is that our data provide a potential link between tumor suppressor miR-34 and the presumed gastric cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells are a small subpopulation of cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation, and have been identified in a variety of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Cancer stem cells are believed to be responsible for tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. To be maximally effective, cancer therapy must be directed against both the resting cancer stem cells and the proliferating cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. This may be possible if specific stem cell signals are inhibited using molecular therapy, while at the same time proliferating cells are attacked by conventional therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. There are limited studies of gastric cancer stem cells, and thus far there are no suitable, widely accepted cellular markers for these rare cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Stem cells are defined by their ability to undergo self-renewal, as well as by multi-lineage differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In our attempts to isolate gastric cancer stem cells, the multiple cell surface markers we used in gastric cancer cell lines did not provide robust, tumorsphere-forming, tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells. This might be due to the use of incorrect markers, or the fact that primary tumor tissues should have been examined instead of the established cell lines. However, our data indicate that miR-34 restoration inhibits tumorspheres from p53-mutant gastric cancer cells, suggesting that miR-34 might be involved in the self-renewal of the presumed gastric cancer stem cells. In a separate project on pancreatic and prostate cancer stem cells, our preliminary data indicate that miR-34s are indeed involved in these cancer stem cells, supporting our hypothesis (Ji et al., manuscript submitted). Currently, we are testing a series of cellular markers for human gastric cancer stem cells (CD44, CD24, CD133, ESA, ALDH1, etc.) and using human primary gastric cancer tissues to identify the true side population of the assumed gastric cancer stem cells, and to delineate the role of miR-34 in these tumor-initiating cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that in p53-deficient human gastric cancer cells, restoration of functional microRNA miR-34 inhibits cell growth, induces apoptosis, and leads to chemosensitization, indicating that miR-34 may restore, at least in part, the p53 tumor-suppressing function. miR-34 restoration inhibits tumorsphere formation and growth, which is reported to be correlated to the self-renewal of cancer stem cells.
