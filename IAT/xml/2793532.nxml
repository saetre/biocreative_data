BACE1 has been studied principally for its role in Alzheimer's disease as the &#x003b2;-secretase responsible for generating the amyloid-&#x003b2; protein. Emerging evidence from mouse models has identified the importance of BACE1 in myelination and cognitive performance. However, the substrates that BACE1 processes to regulate these functions are unknown, and to date only a few &#x003b2;-secretase substrates have been identified through candidate-based studies. Using an unbiased approach to substrate identification, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis of two human epithelial cell lines stably expressing BACE1 and identified 68 putative &#x003b2;-secretase substrates, a number of which we validated in a cell culture system. The vast majority were of type I transmembrane topology, although one was type II and three were GPI-linked proteins. Intriguingly, a preponderance of these proteins are involved in contact-dependent intercellular communication or serve as receptors and have recognized roles in the nervous system and other organs. No consistent sequence motif predicting BACE1 cleavage was identified in substrates versus non-substrates. These findings expand our understanding of the proteins and cellular processes that BACE1 may regulate, and suggest possible mechanisms of toxicity arising from chronic BACE1 inhibition.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting more than 5 million Americans and over 30 million people worldwide.

The first of these is performed by &#x003b2;-secretase on the lumenal domain of APP, secreting the APP ectodomain (APPs) into the extracellular space. The second cleavage is executed by the intramembrane protease, &#x003b3;-secretase, within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer.

Our understanding of the normal biological functions of BACE1 is far from complete, as the majority of efforts to study this protease have focused solely on its role in A&#x003b2; generation. BACE1 is thought to have loose substrate specificity, with preferences including a leucine residue at P1 and a polar residue at P1' positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Citron2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-GruningerLeitch1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Sauder1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Because few substrates of BACE1 have been identified and <italic>BACE1</italic> knockout mice were initially described as having no phenotype, chronic inhibition of BACE1 has been proposed as a potentially attractive therapy for Alzheimer's disease. However, several recent studies have highlighted myelination, behavioral and synaptic abnormalities in <italic>BACE1</italic> knockout mice, suggesting that this protease plays important functions in the development and maintenance of the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Savonenko1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Willem1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Wang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Which substrates BACE1 processes to regulate these complex phenotypes is unknown. These results highlight the limitations in our understanding of the normal functions of this protease and leave us unable to predict the adverse effects BACE1 inhibition may produce in humans.</p><p>In order to better understand the normal cellular functions of BACE1, we have utilized quantitative proteomic methods in a cell culture model to identify the range of proteins that are regulated by &#x003b2;-secretase processing. Using this approach, we have discovered a large number of novel proteins subject to &#x003b2;-secretase cleavage in two human epithelial cell lines. Interestingly, many of these proteins are involved in contact-dependent intercellular communication or serve as receptors and have recognized roles in the nervous system and other tissues. The vast majority of these proteins are of type I transmembrane topology, with one having type II topology and three having glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Our findings indicate that BACE1 has a strong preference for single-pass membrane bound proteins, but that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains do not play obligate roles in recognition by &#x003b2;-secretase. We validated a subset of the identified substrates and non-substrates in a cell culture model, either through analysis of the endogenous protein or by stably expressing the candidate. Analysis of the primary sequence of the BACE1 substrates suggests several potential sites of cleavage. However, as non-substrates also bear potential &#x003b2;-secretase cleavage sites, primary sequence appears not to be the principal determinant of substrate selection. Our results demonstrate the broad role of BACE1 activity in membrane protein turnover, and suggest that this protease may help regulate many diverse biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Quantitative Proteomics of Conditioned Medium from Cells Expressing BACE1 Identifies Many Novel &#x003b2;-Secretase Substrates</title><p>Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), in which cells of different genetic backgrounds or experimental conditions are differentially grown in the presence of heavy or light amino acids, enables sensitive and quantitative comparisons between two proteomes using mass spectrometry. Previously, we used this experimental approach to identify novel substrates of the intramembrane aspartyl protease &#x003b3;-secretase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Hemming2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we use similar proteomic methods, coupled with genetic overexpression of BACE1, to identify in an unbiased fashion the proteins regulated by &#x003b2;-secretase in two epithelial cell lines.</p><p>The human cell lines used in this study were HEK and HeLa, derived from transformed embryonic kidney cells and cervical adenocarcinoma, respectively. HEK cells and, to a lesser extent HeLa cells, express a very low level of BACE1 protein, as evidenced by their modest capacity to produce A&#x003b2;.

For these reasons, we chose to use a BACE1 overexpression system to enhance &#x003b2;-secretase activity and achieve levels of substrate shedding sufficient for proteomic identification. HEK and HeLa cell lines were each stably transfected with either myc tagged human BACE1 cDNA or an empty vector as control.

The metalloprotease (&#x003b1;-secretase) inhibitor GM6001, the &#x003b2;-secretase inhibitor C3 and the &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor DAPT were used to characterize the three principal proteolytic events in APP processing. Expression of BACE1 led to a clear decrease in the amount of mature APP in both HEK and HeLa cells, but the levels of immature, incompletely glycosylated APP remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008477-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;B</xref>, middle panels). BACE1 shedding of mature APP was reversible upon application of a &#x003b2;-secretase inhibitor (C3). This finding indicates proper localization of &#x003b2;-secretase activity to post-Golgi compartments, where the enzyme typically resides on the cell surface and within the endosomal system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Huse1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) are produced after ectodomain shedding by either &#x003b1;- or &#x003b2;-secretase enzymes. Normally, CTFs are rapidly turned over via intramembrane proteolysis by the &#x003b3;-secretase complex, liberating an intracellular domain and a small secreted A&#x003b2;-like peptide. Upon &#x003b3;-secretase inhibition with DAPT, CTFs accumulate to detectable levels, and CTF levels were further enhanced by the increased ectodomain shedding produced by BACE1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008477-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;B</xref>, lower panels).</p><p>Using an ectodomain directed APP antibody, we analyzed the cellular conditioned medium for changes in secreted APP (APPs) arising from BACE1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008477-g001">Figure 1C&#x02013;D</xref>; quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008477-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Under control conditions, APPs levels decrease by approximately 50&#x00025; in response to metalloprotease (&#x003b1;-secretase) inhibition, and by approximately 30&#x00025; in response to &#x003b2;-secretase inhibition. With BACE1 expression, APPs levels increase 4- to 5-fold above control, and this effect is entirely reversed by &#x003b2;-secretase inhibition with C3, confirming the specificity of our paradigm. Two distinct bands correspond to APPs, and both result from &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-secretase processing, as indicated by the inhibitor and overexpression experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008477-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Further, in the case of BACE1 expression, both bands arise from cleavage of the mature form of APP. Although the explanation for two distinct APPs species is unclear, they may arise from either different protein conformations that alter electrophoretic migration, or alternatively the occurrence of post-cleavage modification of APPs such as ectodomain phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Hung1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Walter1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>With these results validating the effects of BACE1 overexpression on one endogenous substrate, we next sought to probe the entire proteome of these two cell lines for proteins whose shedding was increased by elevated &#x003b2;-secretase activity. Stable BACE1 cells were metabolically labeled with heavy lysine and arginine, whereas control cells were labeled with the light form of these amino acids (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). Once labeled and grown to confluence, cells were conditioned in serum-free medium containing 20 &#x000b5;M GM6001. This metalloprotease inhibitor was added to the conditioning medium of both BACE1 and control cells for two reasons. First, several of the known &#x003b2;-secretase substrates are subject to both metalloprotease (&#x003b1;-secretase) and &#x003b2;-secretase processing. As seen with APP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008477-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), addition of GM6001 enhances the difference in APPs levels between BACE1 and control conditions 2-fold. This enhanced difference in the abundance of BACE1-cleaved products was anticipated to increase our ability to detect potential substrates. Second, by decreasing basal metalloprotease shedding of proteins, particularly by the a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) and the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family of enzymes, the complexity of the resultant conditioned medium may be reduced and thus improve our ability to detect low-abundance peptides.</p><p>Conditioned medium was collected from the BACE1 and control cells grown to equal confluence, and the medium combined in parallel for HEK and HeLa cells. This combined medium was then concentrated approximately 200-fold through a centrifugal filter device with a 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff. One hundred micrograms of protein from the concentrated conditioned medium was separated by SDS-PAGE, divided into ten horizontal slices, and subject to trypsinization and LC-MS/MS (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008477.s003">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Data arising from all quantitative peptide comparisons were analyzed to enrich for peptides demonstrating a relative abundance profile consistent with BACE1 expression. Proteins were considered as putative substrates when constituent peptides were found with at least 65&#x00025; of the total (light plus heavy) signal derived from the BACE1 (heavy) condition. One hundred and sixteen proteins were identified that showed this degree of enrichment in the BACE1 conditioned medium, and these individual candidates were further evaluated.</p><p>Based on the known functions of BACE1 and the short list of established &#x003b2;-secretase substrates, we expected to find solely membrane-bound proteins enriched in the medium of BACE1 expressing cells. However, many of the proteins enriched in the BACE1 condition were not membrane-bound and are unlikely to be direct substrates of &#x003b2;-secretase. These are unlikely to be contaminants from lysed cells, as such an artifact should be present in equal abundance between the two conditions. An example of how such proteins may become enriched in the medium of BACE1 overexpressing cells is the co-secretion of a non-membrane-bound protein associated with another membrane protein that is itself cleaved by &#x003b2;-secretase. Alternatively, mistrafficking of a protein may occur after &#x003b2;-secretase cleavage of a receptor responsible for determining its localization. Unexpectedly, 43 of the 116 proteins elevated by BACE1 expression were soluble, non-membrane bound lysosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008477.s002">Table S2</xref>). Investigation of the putative &#x003b2;-secretase substrates revealed the shedding of a membrane protein responsible for lysosomal trafficking (IGF2R/M6PR), indicating that these secreted lysosomal proteins were likely elevated in BACE1 conditioned medium due to the shedding of a receptor responsible for their trafficking (see below for further details). Peptides derived from BACE1 were found to be elevated in the media of cells expressing the protease, although we determined that BACE1 cannot shed itself (see below). Only four other non-membrane bound proteins were found to be elevated in the media of BACE1 expressing cells, and of these, three were related to collagen synthesis and one was a secreted protease inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008477.s002">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Of the 116 proteins elevated in the conditioned medium of BACE1 expressing cells, 68 were integral membrane proteins whose presence in the medium indicates their shedding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008477-t001">Table 1</xref>, additional information in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008477.s001">Table S1</xref>). Analyzed by cell line, 47 putative substrates were found unique to HEK cells, five unique to HeLa cells, and 16 shared between the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008477-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). All of these proteins were found to be either single-pass integral membrane proteins or GPI-linked proteins. The vast majority, 64 of 68, were type I transmembrane proteins. The four remaining putative substrates include three GPI-linked and one type II transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008477-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Based on descriptions of protein function in the Gene Ontology and UniProt databases, these 68 substrates were divided into functional categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008477-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Many of the putative substrates are involved in contact-dependent intercellular communication by interacting with a membrane-bound cognate ligand on another cell. Members of this group include proteins implicated in neurodevelopment and migration, immune function, and cell fate determination. Other putative substrates have been described to function as peptide and lipoprotein receptors, cellular adhesion molecules, proteases, and in intracellular protein trafficking.</p><fig id="pone-0008477-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008477.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Regulation of single-pass and GPI-linked proteins by BACE1.</title><p>Putative substrates identified to undergo BACE1 shedding in HEK and HeLa cells were examined for topology and proposed function.

However, relatively little is known about the normal functions of BACE1 and how prolonged enzyme inhibition would affect the cellular processes it regulates. In this study, we have used unbiased and quantitative proteomic methods to identify proteins shed by BACE1 in two human epithelial cell lines. We have added over 60 putative &#x003b2;-secretase substrates to the previously small list of known BACE1 targets. The vast majority of the substrates have a type I topology, though some type II and GPI-linked proteins can also be cleaved.</p><p>To validate the proteomics findings, we either probed for endogenously expressed proteins or stably transfected a tagged cDNA encoding the putative substrate into a cell culture model. We examined putative substrates of type I, type II or GPI-linked topology identified by our screen, and in every case, the identified substrate was indeed confirmed to be processed by &#x003b2;-secretase. In addition to ectodomain shedding, the levels of the membrane-bound full-length protein were typically decreased with &#x003b2;-secretase activity, as expected. We validated both substrates of high confidence, in which over 100 peptides had been identified by mass spectrometry, and low confidence, in which as little as one peptide was identified. These results suggest that the remaining putative &#x003b2;-secretase substrates emerging from our screen are indeed subject to BACE1 cleavage, and future investigation will shed light on the biological significance of their processing.</p><p>Previously, we used similar proteomic methods to identify novel &#x003b3;-secretase substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Hemming2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In comparison to the former study, we have identified far more putative &#x003b2;-secretase substrates, and the likely reasons lie both in the less complex subcellular fractionation (secreted proteins versus membrane-bound proteins) used here and the larger sizes of the proteins subjected to analysis (ectodomains versus CTFs, thus offering more peptides for detection). The identification of APLP1, which is expressed at very low levels in the epithelial cells we tested, provides a clear example of the sensitivity of these methods. Considering that the large majority of putative &#x003b2;-secretase substrates are type I transmembrane proteins, it is highly likely that the residual membrane-anchored CTFs produced after ectodomain shedding are processed by &#x003b3;-secretase to generate secreted A&#x003b2;-like peptides and a soluble intracellular domain. If true, our findings would substantially expand the list of known &#x003b3;-secretase substrates.</p><p>In addition to the novel &#x003b2;-secretase substrates it identified, our unbiased proteomic method also revealed other proteins that are elevated by BACE1 overexpression but are unlikely to be directly processed by the protease. We found that the majority of these proteins are soluble lysosomal enzymes. The identification of IGF2R/M6PR ectodomain shedding by BACE1 provides a plausible mechanistic explanation for the presence of the extracellular lysosomal enzymes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008477.s002">Table S2</xref>). This cellular phenotype, in which lysosomal proteins accumulate in the extracellular space, is mechanistically similar to the autosomal recessive human disorder, I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II), in which mutations in N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase disrupt normal mannose-6-phosphate labeling of lysosomal proteins, preventing their receptor binding and leading to their secretion. In the analogous case of cellular BACE1 overexpression, elevated IGF2R shedding reduces the number of intact receptors able to mediate lysosomal transport and/or promotes the co-shedding of the IGF2R ectodomain with bound lysosomal proteins, thus increasing lysosomal protein secretion. Only four other non-membrane bound proteins were found to be elevated in conditioned medium due to BACE1 overexpression in our screen, and this may well have occurred through similar, but less clear, mechanisms of mistrafficking or co-shedding with an actual substrate.</p><p>The mechanism by which BACE1 selects its substrates has remained unclear despite over a decade of examination. BACE1 is related to other aspartyl proteases, including renin, cathepsin D and pepsin, and shows &#x0223c;50&#x00025; sequence identity with the homologous BACE2 protein. There is a high degree of BACE1 sequence conservation among mammalian species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Sauder1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, except for BACE2, there is little similarity between BACE1 and other aspartyl proteases in terms of substrate profiles and inhibitor sensitivity. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments with peptide libraries have shown BACE1 to prefer hydrophobic residues at P1 and P3, to accept polar residues at positions P2' and P1, and to display very low catalytic efficiency, even towards optimized peptide substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-GruningerLeitch1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Molecular modeling studies have identified a hydrophobic pocket that may bind to the P1 hydrophobic residue, and Arg296 also may form a salt bridge with a charged P1' residue, which may help explain BACE1's unique substrate preferences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Sauder1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another approach to determining substrate specificity has been to make modified APP constructs and monitor alterations in &#x003b2;-secretase processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Citron2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies showed that, at least for APP, cleavage requires a membrane anchor and most mutations around the scissile bond decrease processing. Almost the entire APP ectodomain can be deleted without changing cleavage efficiency, and the cleavage site can tolerate shifts of at least five amino acids closer to the membrane. In other studies, introduction of the seven amino acids flanking the APP cleavage site into the juxtamembrane domain of a non-substrate permitted &#x003b2;-secretase cleavage of the hybrid protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Li1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>These results all suggest that BACE1 has relatively loose sequence specificity and that regions outside the cleavage site may not play a critical role in substrate selection. However, in candidate-based approaches, the enzyme has been unable to process many type I transmembrane proteins known to be shed by the more promiscuous &#x003b1;-secretases (metalloproteases that include ADAMs and MMPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Kuhn1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008477-Lichtenthaler1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Analysis of the primary sequences of BACE1 substrates reveals potential cleavage sites, but similar sequences are also found in non-substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008477-g007">Figure 7</xref>), indicating that other factors are required for &#x003b2;-secretase processing. These factors may include accessibility of the cleavage site, sequestration of the substrate through incorporation into larger complexes, conformational change after ligand binding, and subcellular localization. Our identification of many new putative substrates should enable experiments to understand better the mechanisms underlying BACE1 substrate selection and what role &#x003b2;-secretase processing plays in modulating a particular substrate's function. Taken together, the findings presented here should enhance our understanding of the normal cellular functions to which BACE1 contributes and improve our search for potential adverse events when considering this protease as a therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture and Treatments</title><p>The epithelial cell lines HeLa (ATCC) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293-FT (Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10&#x00025; FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 &#x000b5;g/ml penicillin, and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin.
