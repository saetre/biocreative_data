Eczema is associated with asthma and allergy, though allergy rarely plays a role in development or severity of eczema. Eczema usually begins during infancy, typically on the face, scalp, neck, extensor sides of the forearms, and legs. Up to one in five infants develops eczema, but in more than half of them, the condition improves or disappears completely before they are 15 years old. If eczema persists into adulthood, it usually affects the face and the skin inside the knees and elbows. There is no cure for eczema but it can be controlled by avoiding anything that makes its symptoms worse. These triggers include irritants such as wool, strong soaps, perfumes, and dry environments. A good skin-care routine and frequent moisturizing can also help to keep eczema under control, but in many cases, corticosteroid creams and ointments may be necessary to reduce inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Eczema tends to run in families. This suggests that eczema is caused by genetic factors as well as by environmental factors. Recently, researchers discovered that two common &#x0201c;loss-of-function&#x0201d; variants in the gene encoding filaggrin (<italic>FLG</italic>) predispose people to eczema. People who inherit one or two defective genes make no filaggrin, a protein that normally forms a physical barrier in the skin that protects the body from potentially harmful substances in the environment. Might the weakening of this barrier in filaggrin-deficient individuals affect their responses to environmental substances to which the skin is exposed? In this study, the researchers test this potential explanation for how genetic and environmental factors (in particular, exposure to pets) might interact to determine an individual's chances of developing eczema.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>To test their hypothesis, the researchers studied two independent groups of infants during their first year of life&#x02014;a high-risk group consisting of infants born in Copenhagen, Denmark to mothers with asthma and a group of infants born to women from the general population in Manchester, United Kingdom. The researchers determined which <italic>FLG</italic> variants each child had inherited and classified those with either one or two defective copies of <italic>FLG</italic> as having an <italic>FLG</italic> mutation. They determined pet exposure in early life by asking whether a dog or a cat was living in the parental home when the child was born (&#x0201c;pet ownership&#x0201d;) and then analyzed how these genetic and environmental factors affected the age of onset of eczema. In both groups, children with <italic>FLG</italic> mutations were twice as likely to develop eczema during the first year of life as children without <italic>FLG</italic> mutations. For children without <italic>FLG</italic> mutations, cat ownership at birth had no effect on eczema risk but for children with <italic>FLG</italic> mutations, cat ownership at birth (but not dog ownership) further increased the risk of developing eczema.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that <italic>FLG</italic> mutations and cat ownership at birth interact to determine the chances of a child developing eczema during the first year of life. They provide support, therefore, for the researchers' suggestion that the weakening of the skin's protective barrier that is caused by filaggrin deficiency increases the child's susceptibility to factors associated with cat exposure. Only a small number of children in this study carried <italic>FLG</italic> mutations and were exposed to cats from birth, so these findings need confirming in independent studies. In addition, it is still not clear how exposure to cats drives the development of eczema. Allergy was not the mechanism as the <italic>FLG</italic>-deficient children exposed to cat and who developed eczema did not develop cat-specific immunoglobin E antibodies. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that, to reduce their risk of developing eczema, filaggrin-deficient individuals should avoid cats (but not dogs) during the first few months of life.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050131">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050131</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus Encyclopedia has a page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000853.htm">eczema</ext-link> (in English and Spanish); links to further information are provided by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/eczema.html">MedlinePlus</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.skincarephysicians.com/eczemanet/index.html">EczemaNet</ext-link> is a comprehensive online information resource about eczema provided by the American Academy of Dermatologists</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Atopic_Dermatitis/default.asp">eczema</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service Direct health encyclopedia provides information for patients on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleID=145">eczema</ext-link> (in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.copsac.com">Copenhagen Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC)</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.maas.org.uk">Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS)</ext-link> Web sites provide more information about the children involved in this research</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Bisgaard H, Simpson A, Palmer CNA, B&#x000f8;nnelykke K, Mclean I, et al.

It codes for the 500-kDa protein profilaggrin, which is the main protein component of the keratohyalin granules within the outermost living cell layers of the epidermis. During terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, profilaggrin is dephosphorylated into filaggrin peptides (37-kDa proteins), which form highly compacted, chemically cross-linked layers that provide a physical barrier that reduces water loss and protects the body from potentially harmful environmental exposures. Non-sense mutation R501X and frame-shift mutation 2282del4 lead to complete loss of filaggrin expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050131-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, which causes excessively dry skin and impaired skin barrier function.</p><p>We hypothesized that weakening of skin barrier function in filaggrin-deficient individuals may modulate the effect of environmental exposures, thus modifying the expression of eczema.

Our data suggest that cat but not dog ownership substantially increases the risk of eczema within the first year of life in children with <italic>FLG</italic> loss-of-function variants, but not amongst those without. The observed effects were independent of allergic sensitisation.</p><p>For the primary outcome we selected age of onset of early eczema. The rationale for this is that in both cohorts the increased risk of eczema amongst <italic>FLG</italic> mutation carriers occurred only in the first year of life and not thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050131-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050131-g002">2</xref>). Therefore development of eczema during the first year of life is the relevant outcome when studying this gene-environment interaction. This also means that the important environmental exposures that may interact with FLG in the development of eczema must occur in the first months of life. This limits the number of relevant exposures, as neonates typically live in a very sheltered environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations and Strengths</title><p>This was a hypothesis-driven analysis. We hypothesized that weakening of physical barrier of skin in FLG deficient individuals may potentiate the effect of relevant environmental exposures. Therefore we investigated whether there is an interaction between FLG loss-of-function mutations with a range of environmental exposures for which the skin could be the relevant route of exposure. Since FLG is not expressed in either lungs or GI tract, we did not test exposures through such routes. We focused on the exposure that was associated with eczema in previous epidemiological studies and that was common for the two populations tested (domestic pets and indoor allergens). In addition, in COPSAC we explored the possibility of testing the effect of skin colonization with <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>, but only one child in the mutated group was colonized on the skin.</p><p>The different designs of the two cohorts prevented data pooling in favour of replication, and necessitated some differences in data analysis. Clinical outcomes were not identical, resulting in a higher prevalence of infant eczema in MAAS (parentally reported, 37&#x00025;) compared to COPSAC (investigator-diagnosed, 28&#x00025;). This suggests that MAAS was capturing milder cases and overreporting of eczema by parents. COPSAC provided closely monitored prospective data on eczema progression. The specificity of diagnosis was high, since the detailed phenotyping and management was carried out solely by the investigators, reducing the risk of misclassification &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050131-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, which is of particular importance in the clinical evaluation of eczema where interobserver variation is a problem &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050131-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite the differences in definition of primary outcome, we achieved replication.</p><p>We acknowledge the fact that the initial finding is based on only five children with eczema with a cat at home and carrying <italic>FLG</italic> mutation in COPSAC, but the power of the statistics (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) derives from the longitudinal dataset with the time of onset clearly distinguishing these populations. Cross-sectional analyses would not have such statistical power. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the findings were confirmed in the analysis of allergen levels, that pet ownership did not differ between those with and without the variant, and that the interaction between <italic>FLG</italic> variants and cat ownership was replicated in an independent cohort that included a larger number of cat exposed FLG mutation carriers.</p><p>Allergens levels were measured at age 1 y representing allergen exposure during the first year of life. Dust samples were taken from the child's mattress in COPSAC and from the lounge floor in MAAS, which resulted in different distribution of results (10-fold increase from third to fourth quartile in COPSAC with only 3-fold difference in MAAS, indicating that quartile analysis would not be appropriate in MAAS). Although we used different indices of allergen exposure, we obtained similar results.</p><p>In the original discovery in COPSAC of the loss-of-function variants 501x and 2282del4 in the gene encoding filaggrin, we demonstrated a strong association to the development of eczema in the first years of life. Two new SNPs within the filaggrin gene (R2447X and S3247X) have since been reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050131-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; and were found in eight children in COPSAC. However, these new SNPs are qualitatively different from the old mutations with some residual function as demonstrated by a significantly lower penetrance of eczema. Inclusion of the novel SNPs would therefore weaken our analyses by mixing a well-known strong risk factor with a weak risk factor, which furthermore is qualitatively different and therefore may have a different effect on the gene&#x02013;environmental interactions studied. As a consequence we did not find it reasonable to formulate a dominant genetic model based on all four SNPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Meaning of the Study</title><p>Several studies have suggested an effect of early-life pet exposure on the development of atopic disease. However, the data are inconsistent, with some studies showing increased risk &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050131-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, and others decreased risk &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050131-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, or no effect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050131-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. These inconsistencies may be due in part to epidemiological artifacts. Recall bias is an obvious risk when exposure assessments are retrospective. Selection for keeping pets is another potential bias. The time from exposure to assessment of the health outcome has been long in some studies, which may lead to confounding by early modification of the exposure and therefore affect the long-term outcome. The causal-effect direction may be uncertain in retrospective assessments, as the pets may have been acquired after the disease onset. Furthermore, cross-sectional studies may report protective effects from pet exposure, when in fact individuals have removed the pet from the household because of the disease or the factors associated with a predisposition to disease. Importantly, in both our studies we documented pet exposure at birth (i.e., before eczema occurrence), thus eliminating uncertainty of the direction of association between exposure and disease. The findings were further supported by objective measures of allergen exposure.</p><p>We only assessed animals living in the household, though other exposures outside the home may be relevant, but this would only have biased the risk estimates toward the null, potentially underestimating the true risk. Having pets has been reported to be biased from socioeconomic status, smoking habits, and parental allergic rhinitis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050131-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, but it is unlikely to affect the genetic distribution in the study population and could therefore not act as confounder.</p><p>The mechanism by which cat exposure drives the development of eczema is unknown. Our data suggest that it does not act through cat-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that the effect of <italic>FLG</italic> loss-of-function mutations was equally strong on allergic and nonallergic eczema, demonstrating that the development of eczema is not dependent on allergic sensitisation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050131-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Cat exposure may act through other nonallergic mechanisms such as endotoxins. COPSAC recently reported that bacterial colonization of the airways in neonates was associated with later development of recurrent wheeze, asthma, and increased total immunoglobulin E (IgE) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050131-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. It may be possible that cat exposure mediates its effect in the FLG mutated genotypes via altered bacterial exposure, or that cat exposure may be a surrogate marker for other unknown environmental influences penetrating the imperfect skin barrier because of defective profilaggrin synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although there are many new susceptibility genes for complex disorders following genome-wide association studies, there are very few gene&#x02013;environment studies.
