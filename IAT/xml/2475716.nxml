Both HGF and Met are established targets for cancer therapy. However, the mechanism of their interaction is complex and remains elusive. HGF is secreted as a monomeric precursor (pro-HGF) that binds to but does not activate Met. Mature HGF is a &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer containing a high affinity Met-binding site in the &#x003b1;-chain (HGF-&#x003b1;) and a low affinity Met-binding site in the &#x003b2;-chain (HGF-&#x003b2;). The extracellular portion of Met contains a semaphorin (Sema) domain, a cysteine-rich hinge (plexin-semaphorin-integrin), and four immunoglobulin-like domains (immunoglobulin-like regions in plexins and transcription factors (IPT) 1-4). HGF-&#x003b2; binds to Sema through a low affinity contact. The domain of Met responsible for high affinity binding to HGF-&#x003b1; has not been identified yet. Here we show that this long sought after binding site lies in the immunoglobulin-like region of Met and more precisely in IPT 3 and 4. We also show that IPT 3 and 4 are sufficient to transmit the signal for kinase activation to the cytoplasm, although the lack of Sema makes the receptor equally sensitive to mature HGF and pro-HGF. Finally, we provide evidence that soluble Met-derived proteins containing either the low affinity or high affinity HGF-binding site antagonize HGF-induced invasive growth both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in xenografts. These data suggest that the immunoglobulin-like region of Met cooperates with the Sema domain in binding to HGF and in controlling Met kinase activity. Although the IPT-HGF-&#x003b1; interaction provides binding strength, the Sema-HGF-&#x003b2; contact confers selective sensitivity to the active form of the ligand.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work has been supported in part by the <grant-sponsor>Italian Association for Cancer Research</grant-sponsor>, the <grant-sponsor>Compagnia San Paolo di Torino Foundation</grant-sponsor>, the <grant-sponsor>Cassa di Risparmio di Torino Foundation</grant-sponsor>, the <grant-sponsor>Italian Ministry of Health</grant-sponsor> (Ricerca Finalizzata 2004), and the <grant-sponsor>Italian Ministry of University and Research</grant-sponsor>.

It consists of a 50-kDa &#x003b1;-subunit and a 145-kDa &#x003b2;-subunit, which are linked by a disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). The &#x003b1;-subunit is completely extracellular, whereas the &#x003b2;-subunit includes (from N to C termini) an extracellular region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The mature heterodimeric receptor is generated by proteolytic processing and terminal glycosylation from a 170-kDa single-chain precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>).</p><p>HGF, also known as scatter factor, is a heparin-binding glycoprotein with a broad spectrum of biological activities including cell proliferation, motility, survival, and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). It is synthesized and secreted as an inactive single chain precursor (pro-HGF) that is stored in the extracellular matrix because of its high affinity for proteoglycans. In the extracellular environment, pro-HGF undergoes proteolytic cleavage at residues Arg<sup>494</sup>-Val<sup>495</sup> to give rise to the biologically active form, a disulfide-linked &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). The &#x003b1;-chain consists of an N-terminal domain followed by four kringle domains; the &#x003b2;-chain shares structural homology with the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases but lacks proteolytic activity. In fact, two of the three critical residues that form the catalytic triad typical of serine proteases are not conserved in HGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Despite its inability to signal, pro-HGF binds to Met at high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>) and displaces active HGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>).</p><p>HGF-Met signaling is essential during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) and tissue regeneration in the adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). Importantly, deregulated HGF-Met signaling plays a key role in tumorigenesis and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Inappropriate Met activation by different mechanisms including autocrine HGF stimulation, receptor overexpression, gene amplification, and point mutation is described in a wide variety of human malignancies and correlates with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). In the last few years, the HGF-Met pathway has been emerging as an appealing target for cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). A variety of Met/HGF inhibitors have been developed, including small molecule compounds targeting Met kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) or neutralizing anti-Met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>), anti-HGF antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), decoy receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>), and HGF-derived factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, despite the great biological and therapeutic importance of this pathway, the mechanism by which HGF activates Met remains poorly understood. Recently, a number of structure-function studies have shed some light onto the interactions between the extracellular portion of Met and HGF. The extracellular region of Met has a modular structure, which encompasses three functional domains. A Sema domain (present also in semaphorins and plexins) spans the first 500 residues at the N terminus of the protein and has a seven-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). A PSI domain (also found in plexins, semaphorins, and integrins) covers about 50 residues and contains four conserved disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). The remaining 400 residues linking the PSI domain to the transmembrane helix are occupied by four IPT domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>).</p><p>HGF is a bivalent ligand containing a high affinity binding site for Met in the &#x003b1;-chain and a low affinity binding site in the &#x003b2;-chain. Cooperation between the &#x003b1;- and the &#x003b2;-chain is required for the biological activity of HGF; whereas the &#x003b1;-chain, and more precisely the N-domain and the first kringle, is sufficient for Met binding, the &#x003b2;-chain is necessary for Met activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). Resolution of the crystal structure of the SEMA and PSI domains of Met in complex with the &#x003b2;-chain of HGF revealed that the low affinity binding site for HGF is located in blades 2 and 3 of the &#x003b2;-propeller and that the portion of HGF-&#x003b2; that binds to Met is the same region that serine proteases use to bind their substrates or inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Importantly, determination of HGF &#x003b2;-chain crystal structure at 2.53-&#x000c5; resolution and specific mutagenesis analysis unveiled that the residues involved in Met binding in the activation pocket of HGF &#x003b2;-chain get exposed only following proteolytic conversion of pro-HGF, thus explaining why pro-HGF binds to Met at high affinity without activating it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>).</p><p>Although the low affinity interaction between the &#x003b2;-chain of HGF and the Sema domain of Met is well characterized both structurally and functionally, at the moment it is not clear what region of Met binds to the &#x003b1;-chain of HGF at high affinity. To address this issue, we analyzed the interactions between isolated domains of Met and HGF both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in living cells. We report that the IPT region of Met, previously thought to merely function as a &#x0201c;stalk&#x0201d; presenting the Sema domain to the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>), actually contains the high affinity binding site for the &#x003b1;-chain of HGF. We also show that engineered proteins derived from the IPT region of Met inhibit HGF-induced invasive growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and display anti-tumor activity in mice.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Protein Engineering</italic>&#x02014;Soluble or transmembrane receptors and engineered ligands described in this work have been generated by standard PCR and genetic engineering techniques. All of the factors conserve the signal peptide of their parental protein at the N terminus.

At the C terminus of each molecule a double FLAG (SDYKDDDDK) or single Myc (EQKLISEEDLN) epitope sequence and a polyhistidine tag (HHHHHHH) were added for protein detection and purification. The engineered, transmembrane Met<sub>&#x00394;25-741</sub> is identical to wild-type Met except for the deleted region (aa 25-741). The amino acid sequences of engineered HGF proteins (GenBank&#x02122; accession number M73239) correspond to aa 1-31 (signal peptide) plus: HGF, aa 32-728; HGF-&#x003b1;, aa 32-473; HGF NK1, aa 32-205; and HGF-&#x003b2;, aa 495-728. The above Myc or FLAG epitope and polyhistidine tag were added at the C terminus. Uncleavable HGF has been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). NK1-NK1 is a dimeric form of HGF NK1 consisting of the same N-terminal region of HGF repeated in tandem (aa 1-205 directly linked to aa 32-205 without spacer). The amino acid sequence of angiostatin corresponds to aa 1-19 (signal peptide) of human plasminogen (GenBank&#x02122; accession number X05199) plus aa 98-459 (kringles 1-4), the above Myc epitope, and a polyhistidine tag.

Factor purification was performed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). Conversion of pro-HGF into active HGF was performed by incubating purified pro-HGF (maximal concentration, 100 ng/&#x003bc;l) with 2-10% FBS (Sigma) at 37 &#x000b0;C for 24 h. Factor conversion was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HGF antibodies (R &#x00026; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Uncleavable HGF subjected to the same incubation with FBS was used as pro-HGF in all assays that compared active HGF with unprocessed HGF. Binding of engineered ligands to soluble receptors was measured by ELISA using FLAG-tagged soluble receptors in solid phase and Myc-tagged engineered ligands in liquid phase. A fixed concentration of purified soluble receptor (100 ng/well) was adsorbed to 96-well ELISA plates. Protein-coated plates were incubated with increasing concentrations of engineered ligands, and binding was revealed using biotinylated anti-HGF antibodies (R &#x00026; D) or anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as indicated.

Briefly, the cells were deprived of serum growth factors for 3 days and then incubated with 1 n<sc>m</sc> HGF for 3 h. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using antibodies directed against the C-terminal portion of Met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>), resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 3-10% polyacrylamide gradient, and analyzed by Western blotting using biotinylated anti-HGF antibodies (R &#x00026; D).

The spheroids were embedded into a collagen matrix containing 1.3 mg/ml type I collagen from rat tail (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Massachusetts) and 10% FBS using 96-well plates (40 spheroids/well). Embedded spheroids were cultured at 37 &#x000b0;C for 24 h and then stimulated with 30 ng/ml HGF (R &#x00026; D) or no factor for additional 24 h. The number of tubules sprouting from each spheroid was scored by microscopy. At least 12 spheroids/experimental point were analyzed.</p><p><italic>Tumorigenesis Assays</italic>&#x02014;Lentiviral vector-transduced MDA-MB-435 tumor cells (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mouse) in 0.2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were injected subcutaneously into the right posterior flank of six-week old immunodeficient <italic>nu</italic><sup>-/-</sup> female mice on Swiss CD-1 background (6 mice/group; Charles River Laboratories, Calco, Italy).

Mice whose tumors were below this threshold were considered tumor-free. After &#x0223c;4 weeks, the mice were euthanized, and the tumors were extracted for analysis. The animals were subjected to autopsy. The tumors and lungs were embedded in paraffin and processed for histology. Micrometastasis analysis was performed by microscopy on serial lung sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed by an independent pathologist not informed of sample identity. Transgene expression was determined on tumor sections by immunohistochemistry using anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma). The sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma). Tumor angiogenesis was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-von Willebrand factor antibodies (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). The sections were counterstained as above. Vessel density was assessed by microscopy. At least 12 fields/animal were analyzed.

The extracellular portion of Met includes a Sema domain, a PSI hinge, and four IPT modules (<italic>left panel</italic>). HGF is composed of a &#x003b1;- and a &#x003b2;-chain joined by a disulfide bridge in the mature protein. The &#x003b1;-chain in turn comprises a N-terminal domain and four kringles (<italic>right panel</italic>). To analyze the interactions between Met and HGF, we expressed all of these functional domains as individual, soluble proteins. Functional domains were engineered to contain the signal peptide of the parental protein at their N terminus, so that they could be properly secreted. At the C terminus, we added an exogenous epitope (FLAG or Myc) for antibody recognition and a polyhistidine tag for protein purification.</p><p>All of the cDNAs encoding the engineered factors were subcloned into the lentiviral vector pRRLsin.PPT.CMV.Wpre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), and recombinant lentiviral particles were produced as described under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures.&#x0201d; Recombinant proteins were collected from the conditioned medium of lentiviral vector-transduced MDA-MB-435 human melanoma cells and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography.

Binding was revealed using biotinylated anti-HGF antibodies. Nonspecific HGF binding was determined using bovine serum albumin in solid phase instead of soluble Met domains. Binding affinity was determined by nonlinear regression analysis as described under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures.&#x0201d; In these conditions, decoy Met bound to HGF with a <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> value of &#x0223c;0.2-0.3 n<sc>m</sc>. Consistent with previous measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>), Sema-PSI and Sema bound to HGF with an affinity at least one log lower compared with decoy Met.

The presence or absence of the PSI domain did not affect the binding affinity for HGF of either Sema or IPT.

Pro-HGF, HGF &#x003b1;-chain, and HGF NK1, which represents the minimal Met-binding module of HGF &#x003b1;-chain, bound to Decoy Met with a 3-, 4-, and 10-fold reduced affinity compared with active HGF, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Binding of HGF-&#x003b2; to decoy Met (or to any other Met domain) was too low to be detected in this kind of assay (not shown).

To more finely map the IPT-HGF interface, we engineered a series of IPT variants that were deleted in one or more domains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). IPT &#x00394;1 and IPT &#x00394;1-2 are two N-terminal deleted forms of IPT lacking the first or the first two immunoglobulin-like domains, respectively. IPT 3 and IPT 4 correspond to the two C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains expressed as single proteins. Protein production and purification were performed as described above. The ability of the engineered IPTs to interact with HGF &#x003b1;-chain was investigated in ELISA binding assays using the whole IPT region as a control. IPT, IPT &#x00394;1, IPT &#x00394;1-2, IPT 3, and IPT 4 were immobilized in solid phase and exposed to increasing concentrations of HGF-&#x003b1;. Binding was revealed using anti-HGF antibodies. Nonspecific binding was measured using bovine serum albumin as above. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>, deletion of the first two immunoglobulin-like domains did not substantially affect HGF binding. In fact, IPT &#x00394;1-2, a protein corresponding to the last two immunoglobulin-like domains of Met, bound to the &#x003b1;-chain of HGF with equal if not higher strength than IPT. However, further deletion of either the third or fourth immunoglobulin-like domain did almost completely impair HGF-&#x003b1; binding. Similar results were obtained using active HGF or pro-HGF instead of HGF-&#x003b1; (not shown).

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody raised against the C-terminal portion of Met, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HGF biotinylated antibodies. As a control, the same analysis was performed on wild-type TOV-112D cells. Immunoblots showed a distinct band with a molecular mass of &#x0223c;180 kDa in the lane corresponding to cells expressing Met<sub>&#x00394;25-741</sub> treated with HGF but not in lanes corresponding to the same cells without HGF or to wild-type TOV-112D cells, either in the presence or absence of the ligand (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). Considering that both Met<sub>&#x00394;25-741</sub> and HGF have a molecular mass of &#x0223c;90 kDa, the immunoprecipitated cross-linked protein is compatible with a 1:1 complex formed by HGF plus Met<sub>&#x00394;25-741</sub>.</p><p>We next tested whether HGF binding to Met<sub>&#x00394;25-741</sub> could induce Met kinase activation. To this end, we stimulated lentiviral vector-transduced TOV-112D cells with pro-HGF or active HGF, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Met antibodies as above. Receptor activation was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The same blots were reprobed with anti-Met antibodies to normalize the amount of receptor immunoprecipitated. Remarkably, both pro-HGF and active HGF were capable of inducing robust phosphorylation of Met<sub>&#x00394;25-741</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). This may be due to the ability of pro-HGF and HGF to form homodimers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref> In any case, because pro-HGF binding to full size Met does not induce kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), this suggests that the Sema domain somehow exerts an auto-inhibitory effect on Met catalytic activity that is released upon binding to active HGF. Receptor stimulation was also performed using HGF NK1 and an engineered dimeric ligand consisting of two NK1 fragments repeated in tandem (NK1-NK1; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>).

These results suggest that the two C-terminal IPT domains of Met (IPT 3 and 4) are sufficient to bind to HGF (and more precisely to HGF NK1 that represents the minimal Met-binding module in the &#x003b1;-chain of HGF) and to transmit the signal for receptor activation to the cytoplasmic kinase domain, presumably following ligand-induced receptor dimerization.

MDA-MB-435 human melanoma cells, which express Met and are an established model system for analysis of HGF-mediated invasive growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>), were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding soluble Decoy Met, Sema-PSI, or IPT.

In a Kaplan-Meier-like analysis, where the percentage of tumor-free animals is plotted against time, and tumor latency is quantified calculating the median in days, all of the engineered soluble receptors delayed the appearance of experimental tumors.

They also suggest that HGF binding to IPT in the context of a transmembrane Met lacking the Sema domain is sufficient for transmitting the signal for receptor activation to the cytoplasmic kinase domain, although without distinction between the inactive and active form of the ligand. Finally, they provide evidence that engineered proteins derived from the IPT region and Sema domain of Met are capable of neutralizing the pro-invasive activity of HGF both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>It has been known for long time that HGF is a bivalent factor. Early protein engineering studies identified a high affinity Met-binding site in the N-domain and first kringle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Subsequently, combined biochemical and biological analysis demonstrated that the serine protease-like domain (&#x003b2;-chain), although not necessary for binding, plays a key role in mediating receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). More recently, detailed crystallographic and mutagenesis data have thoroughly characterized both structurally and functionally the low affinity Met-binding site on the &#x003b2;-chain of HGF and its interaction with the Sema domain of Met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>). The interface between the &#x003b1;-chain of HGF and Met remains, however, elusive. Small angle x-ray scattering and cryo-electron microscopy studies suggested the presence of contacts among the N-terminal and first kringle domain of HGF and the Sema domain of Met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). However, plasmon resonance analysis revealed that this interaction has a very low affinity (about two times lower than that of HGF-&#x003b2; for Sema and 100 times lower than that of HGF-&#x003b1; for the intact receptor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>). Because this weak interaction cannot account <italic>per se</italic> for the tight bond between HGF and Met, the high affinity HGF-binding site on Met has still to be identified.</p><p>The results presented here contribute to fill this gap and suggest that this long sought after HGF-binding site lies in the IPT region of Met and more precisely in the last two immunoglobulin-like domains close to the cell membrane. Several distinct experimental results suggest that this is the case. First, a soluble, deleted Met receptor containing nothing but the four IPT domains binds to HGF with substantially the same affinity as the entire extracellular portion of Met. Conversely, Sema displays very low affinity toward HGF. Second, IPT binds to active HGF, pro-HGF, or HGF-&#x003b1; with unchanged strength. Third, deletion of IPT 1 and IPT 2 does not affect the affinity of IPT for any form of HGF. Fourth, an engineered Met receptor carrying a large deletion in its ectodomain corresponding to the Sema domain, the PSI module, and the first two immunoglobulin-like domains (Met<sub>&#x00394;25-741</sub>) retains the ability to bind to HGF and to transduce the signal for kinase activation to the inside of the cell, although it cannot distinguish between active HGF and Pro-HGF. Finally, a dimeric form of HGF NK1, which is known to contain the minimal Met-binding domain of HGF-&#x003b1;, is capable of eliciting activation of Met<sub>&#x00394;25-741</sub> as efficiently as if not more powerfully than HGF, thus identifying in IPT 3-4 the HGF NK1-binding site.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Soluble IPT inhibits HGF-induced invasive growth <italic>in vitro</italic></bold>. <italic>A</italic>, lentiviral vector-transduced MDA-MB-435 cells were stimulated with recombinant HGF, and Met phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (<italic>upper panel</italic>).

A first draft of the Met ectodomain map suggested that the Sema domain is necessary and sufficient for HGF binding based on ELISAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). However, this analysis was conducted under different conditions. First, these experiments employed fusion proteins between Met subdomains and the Fc portion of a human immunoglobulin, thus forcing receptor modules to be dimeric. Second, the assays were performed using the ligand in solid phase and the engineered receptors in liquid phase, somehow reversing the physiological scenario in which Met is anchored to the membrane and HGF is in solution. Furthermore, the affinity of HGF for the Sema-Fc or Sema-PSI-Fc chimeras was dramatically reduced compared with that of the control chimera containing the entire Met ectodomain, thus implying that the remaining portion of Met (<italic>i.e.</italic> the IPT region) also contained a HGF binding activity. A second study analyzed the role of the Sema domain in receptor dimerization and suggested that an engineered form of the Met extracellular portion containing a deletion in the Sema domain was not capable of co-precipitating HGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). However, HGF-Met interactions were not measured in living cells but in crude cell lysates in the presence of detergent, and no chemical cross-linking was performed. It is quite possible that the different experimental conditions may have affected the sensitivity of the assays, thus leading to underestimation of the IPT function.</p><p>In contrast, a third and more recent independent study on the extracellular portion of Met provides support for the involvement of the IPT region in HGF binding. It is well known that Met is also a receptor for Internalin B (InlB), a surface protein of the human bacterial pathogen <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). ELISA analysis unveiled that the Sema domain of Met is dispensable for high affinity InlB binding. Crystallographic data confirmed that InlB binds tightly to the IPT region of the receptor, whereas it forms a secondary contact with a portion of the Sema domain not involved in HGF binding. In displacement experiments, the authors showed that InlB and HGF partially compete for binding to the Met ectodomain, thus suggesting that Sema does not represent the sole HGF-binding module on the Met receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>).</p><p>The bivalent nature of both HGF and Met poses a fundamental biological question. Why did evolution select for this unusual, complex mechanism of ligand-receptor interaction? Why does Met need two distinct HGF-binding sites, each with a different affinity?

Because HGF is provided paracrinally by the stroma, it would not be feasible to control it at a transcriptional level. In case of organ injury, HGF must be ready on site to provide its survival and trophic signals for tissue regeneration. To comply with this requirement, HGF is secreted as an inactive precursor (pro-HGF) that accumulates in the extracellular matrix of tissues. Pro-HGF binds at high affinity to Met via the IPT site. This interaction does not lead to receptor activation in the context of a full size Met but prepares the cell to respond readily to environmental challenges. Upon a variety of insults including wounds, chemical agents, radiation, oxidative stress, or hypoxia, pro-HGF convertase activity is induced locally and promptly converts pro-HGF into active HGF. This catalytic reaction can occur when pro-HGF is receptor-bound as demonstrated in the case of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>). Following proteolytic processing, the second, low affinity Met-binding site on the &#x003b2;-chain of HGF becomes exposed, and binding to the Sema domain takes place. This interaction results in kinase activation and in launch of the invasive growth program that promotes cell survival, proliferation, motility, and invasion. If only the IPT site were present, both HGF and pro-HGF would elicit receptor activation, thus losing a fundamental degree of regulation. Conversely, if only the Sema domain were present, the strength of interaction between Met and its ligand would be too weak to compete with high capacity, nonspecific interfaces offered by many other components of the cell membrane including proteoglycans.</p><p>Perhaps not accidentally, the model proposed above shares striking similarities with the <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>). Met-mediated bacterial invasion of the host cell occurs in three consecutive steps. First, InlB binds at high affinity to the IPT region of Met. Second, a different portion of InlB binds to the Sema domain at low affinity. This results in receptor activation. Third, heparin-dependent receptor oligomerization amplifies Met signaling and leads to internalization through a yet uncharacterized mechanism. Although Met activation by InlB and Met activation by HGF have different biological goals (bacterial uptake for the former and activation of invasive growth for the latter), the overall strategy is the same. The IPT region is used as a high affinity anchoring site, and a low affinity interaction with the Sema domain provides the signal for receptor dimerization and activation. The fact that two unrelated systems utilizing different ligands employ analogous mechanisms to achieve tyrosine kinase activation supports a critical role of both IPT and Sema in the regulation and control of Met activity.</p><p>Consistent with this notion, cooperation between Sema and IPT is observed also when the extracellular portion of Met is used as a biotechnological tool to inhibit HGF-induced invasive growth. In our <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis and in mouse xenografts, both the IPT and Sema-PSI soluble proteins displayed a significant inhibitory effect. However, none of them could achieve the powerful inhibition displayed by the full Met ectodomain, which contains both the low affinity and high affinity HGF-binding site. This implies that both of these interactions contribute to controlling Met activity. Although the HGF-&#x003b2;-Sema contact had already been identified as a target for therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>), the results presented here unveil a second interface that can potentially offer opportunities for pharmacological intervention. Recombinant proteins or antibodies that bind to the IPT region in place of <italic>bona fide</italic> HGF have a potential application as competitive inhibitors. Paradoxically, one of these proteins may well be HGF NK4, a recombinant HGF inhibitor substantially corresponding to the &#x003b1;-chain of HGF that has been used for some years with success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) without knowing where on Met it bound. Because we now know that HGF-&#x003b1; binds with high affinity to IPT and not to Sema, the fact that HGF NK4 is an effective HGF antagonist provides support to the idea that IPT is a valid target for therapy. Further development of neutralizing antibodies against this region of Met will substantiate this hypothesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mauro Risio for histological analysis and Luigi Naldini for lentiviral technology expertise.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Bottaro, D.
