Three missense mutations (A30P, A53T and E46K) in the &#x003b1;-syn gene are associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial PD. However, the regulation of &#x003b1;-syn's cellular localization in neurons and the effects of the PD-linked mutations are poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the present study, we analysed the ability of cytosolic factors to regulate &#x003b1;-syn binding to synaptic membranes. We show that co-incubation with brain cytosol significantly increases the membrane binding of normal and PD-linked mutant &#x003b1;-syn. To characterize cytosolic factor(s) that modulate &#x003b1;-syn binding properties, we investigated the ability of proteins, lipids, ATP and calcium to modulate &#x003b1;-syn membrane interactions. We report that lipids and ATP are two of the principal cytosolic components that modulate Wt and A53T &#x003b1;-syn binding to the synaptic membrane. We further show that 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C16:0 PAF) is one of the principal lipids found in complex with cytosolic proteins and is required to enhance &#x003b1;-syn interaction with synaptic membrane. In addition, the impaired membrane binding observed for A30P &#x003b1;-syn was significantly mitigated by the presence of protease-sensitive factors in brain cytosol.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that endogenous brain cytosolic factors regulate Wt and mutant &#x003b1;-syn membrane binding, and could represent potential targets to influence &#x003b1;-syn solubility in brain.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The synuclein family of intrinsically unfolded proteins is composed of three homologous and evolutionarily-conserved members with poorly defined physiological roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Of these, &#x003b1;-synuclein (&#x003b1;-syn) has gained particular prominence due to its abundance in nerve terminals and its association with multiple neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson disease (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. &#x003b1;-Syn behaves as a peripherally associated membrane protein and can stably interact with synthetic phospholipid vesicles containing negatively charged head groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] via its amino-terminal domain, an amphipathic region comprising almost two-thirds of the protein and containing seven copies of an 11-residue repeat sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Whereas the freely diffusible form of &#x003b1;-syn is natively unfolded, the N-terminal repeat region adopts an &#x003b1;-helical conformation upon binding to artificial vesicles and detergent micelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Numerous studies have revealed that the interaction of &#x003b1;-syn with phospholipid membranes, fatty acids, or detergent micelles alters the kinetics of its aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We and others have previously reported that synaptic &#x003b1;-syn <italic>in vivo </italic>is partitioned between both cytosolic and membrane-bound fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, despite the understanding of the conformational properties of membrane-bound &#x003b1;-syn, the biochemical mechanisms that mediate &#x003b1;-syn interaction with biological membranes are poorly understood, thereby limiting our understanding of &#x003b1;-syn's physiological role, as well as potential therapeutic approaches to moderate its misfolding and aggregation in disease.</p><p>In this study, we developed an <italic>in vitro </italic>assay to characterise the factor(s) involved in &#x003b1;-syn's binding to synaptic membranes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Using this assay, we analysed the effects of cytosolic proteins, lipids, ATP and calcium on the modulation of &#x003b1;-syn membrane association. Our results revealed that ATP and lipids are two of the principal cytosolic components that modulate the &#x003b1;-syn binding to synaptic membranes. In addition, we report here that the binding of A30P &#x003b1;-syn to synaptic membranes improves significantly in the presence of endogenous cytosolic protein(s) and that the lower recovery of membrane bound A30P is likely due to a more transient interaction which can be stabilised by artificial cross-linking.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A) &#x003b1;-syn binding assay</bold>. <bold>Step 1</bold>.

The bacterial pellet was resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).

Stock chemicals were purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ) with the exception of bovine serum albumin (BSA) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Glycerophospholipids were extracted according to a modified Bligh/Dyer procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] as we have previously published[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Briefly, lipids were extracted using a volumetric ratio of 0.95 of chloroform and 0.8 of 0.1 M Na acetate (aq) per volume of MeOH in acid-washed borosilicate glass tubes (Fisher, Ottawa, ON). Phospholipids were collected from the organic phase after layer separation by centrifugation. The aqueous phase was back-extracted three times in the organic phase of a wash solution prepared by combining RPMI+ 0.025% BSA, methanol, chloroform, and sodium acetate in the volumetric ratio of 1:2.5:3.75:1. The organic fractions were combined, evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas, and dissolved in 300 &#x003bc;l EtOH. C13:0 lysophosphatidylcholine (C13:0 LPC), a lipid not naturally occurring in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], was spiked into cytosol preparations at a concentration of 189 ng prior to extraction to control for variation in extraction efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>LC-ESI-MS</title><p>Glycerophospholipids were analyzed as we have described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Briefly, extracts were diluted 1:4 in EtOH with 13 &#x003bc;L of diluent brought to 40 &#x003bc;l with 0.1% formic acid in H<sub>2</sub>O. To validate the identity of target species, analytes were spiked with 1-<italic>O</italic>-hexadecyl-2-[<sup>2</sup>H<sub>4</sub>]acetyl-glycerophosphocholine (d<sub>4</sub>-16:0 PAF, 2.5 ng) in replicate LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses. Under these circumstances, 10 &#x003bc;l of diluted analyte was added to 5 &#x003bc;l of standard (2.5 ng) and brought to 40 &#x003bc;l with 0.1% formic acid in H<sub>2</sub>O. Samples were loaded onto a 96-well sampling plate, covered with a pre-slit well cap, and thermostated at 4&#x000b0;C. A micro flow 1100 HPLC system (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) introduced the analytes onto a 200 um &#x000d7; 50 mm pre-column packed with 5 &#x003bc;m YMC ODS-A C18 beads (Waters, Milford, MA) at a flow rate of 10 &#x003bc;l/min in a 2000 Q TRAP mass spectrometer. The solvents used were water and acetonitrile each with 0.1% formic acid (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ). The HPLC flow was split and the analyte was eluted through a 75 um &#x000d7; 50 mm picotip emitter (New Objective, Woburn, MA), interfaced with the mass spectrometer via electrospray ionization, at ~200 nL/min. The emitter was packed with the same beads as those of the pre-column. A linear gradient was used to separate glycerophospholipid species. The gradient of the HPLC increased from 5% to 30% acetonitrile in 2 minute, from 30 to 60% acetonitrile in 7 minute, from 60% to 80% acetonitrile over the next 33 minutes, and from 80% to 95% acetonitrile over the next 4 minutes. Data were collected on a 2000 Q-TRAP mass spectrometer operated with Analyst 1.4.1 (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Concord, ON). Total glycerophospholipids between m/z range of 450 to 600 were analyzed by enhanced MS scan. Specific glycerophosphocholine species were further analysed in positive ion mode using precursor ion scan for an MS/MS fragment with a mass to charge ratio (m/z) of 184.0, a diagnostic fragment of phosphocholine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) generated peak areas of LC-MS/MS data measured using Analyst 1.4.1 (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex). Peak areas were normalized to the spiked internal standard to standardize between MS runs and to control for variation in extraction efficiency. Individual species were identified based on theoretical mass validated by closer examination of retention time and following spiking with deuterated standards.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cytosol modulates &#x003b1;-syn membrane binding</title><p>To identify novel co-factors of &#x003b1;-syn binding to presynaptic membranes, we assessed whether co-incubation with brain cytosol modifies &#x003b1;-syn's interaction with membranes. Our assay measured the binding of recombinant human &#x003b1;-syn purified from E. coli to synaptic membranes prepared from brains of &#x003b1;-syn-deficient (KO) mice, in the presence or absence of brain cytosol derived from &#x003b1;-syn-deficient mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We first analysed &#x003b1;-syn binding to synaptic membranes in the presence or absence of cytosol. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, the binding of &#x003b1;-syn, with or without familial PD-linked mutations, was significantly improved by co-incubation with cytosol. Despite the deficient membrane binding of A30P as compared to that of Wt and A53T, all three forms of &#x003b1;-syn showed increased binding over a 30-fold range in concentration, with a pronounced augmentation of binding in the presence of cytosol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The ratio of bound/unbound &#x003b1;-syn was higher at lower &#x003b1;-syn concentrations. These results suggest that endogenous cytosolic factors becoming limiting with increasing &#x003b1;-syn and can partially counterbalance the otherwise impaired binding induced by the A30P mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of cytosol action on &#x003b1;-syn binding</title><p>We recently reported that the dissociation of the &#x003b1;-syn from synaptic membranes requires cytosolic proteins as defined by sensitivity to proteases. To further characterize cytosol action on &#x003b1;-syn binding, and because the data in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> suggests that cytosol activity becomes saturated at high &#x003b1;-syn concentration, we analysed &#x003b1;-syn binding with varying cytosol concentrations over a 6-fold range that we have previously shown to be effective in mobilizing reserve neurotransmitter from permeabilized synaptosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In accord with the data in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, both Wt and A30P &#x003b1;-syn binding was strongly up-regulated by increasing cytosol concentration, whereas only high cytosol concentration resulted in increased A53T &#x003b1;-syn binding. To determine whether the cytosolic factors act on &#x003b1;-syn or on the acceptor synaptic membranes, we first pre-incubated &#x003b1;-syn or synaptic membranes separately with KO cytosol. The membranes were subsequently washed briefly to remove unbound cytosolic factors.

Compared to the control condition (without cytosol), all cytosol concentrations had a significant effect on Wt and A30P &#x003b1;-syn binding, but only the highest concentration of cytosol had a significant effect on A53T &#x003b1;-syn binding (One way ANOVA test, p &#x0003c; 0.0001, Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-test). <bold>(B) </bold>KO synaptic membranes and &#x003b1;-syn were pre-incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature with KO cytosol.

Although, no significant differences between undigested and digested cytosol were observed for either Wt or A53T &#x003b1;-syn binding, the A30P mutant showed significantly reduced binding in the presence of protease-treated cytosol, reaching a basal level similar to the control condition in absence of cytosol. This suggests that the A30P mutation confers a unique dependence on cytosolic protein(s) required to mediate &#x003b1;-syn interactions with synaptic membranes. Moreover, comparable levels of a non-specific protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), did not affect A30P &#x003b1;-syn binding to synaptic membranes (data not shown), suggesting that A30P &#x003b1;-syn binding depends on specific cytosolic proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Involvement of cytosolic lipids in &#x003b1;-syn membrane binding</title><p>Because Wt and A53T &#x003b1;-syn appear to require protease-insensitive cofactors for membrane binding, and &#x003b1;-syn conformation is known to be affected by lipids (Jo et al. 2002), we examined whether removal of cytosolic lipids by chloroform extraction can alter the proportion of &#x003b1;-syn able to bind synaptic membranes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We observed that the binding of Wt &#x003b1;-syn and PD-linked mutants were decreased in the presence lipid-deficient cytosol, suggesting a role for cytosolic lipids in the binding of &#x003b1;-syn to synaptic membranes. These results are also consistent with our observation that heat-denatured cytosol retains its activity to potentiate Wt and A53T &#x003b1;-syn binding (data not shown). Moreover, consistent with the results in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> showing that A53T &#x003b1;-syn membrane binding is less dependent on cytosol, it was also the least affected by lipid extraction. It is also important to note that the chloroform extraction did not non-specifically denature cytosolic proteins because the protein-containing fraction partially rescued A30P &#x003b1;-syn binding, in accord with its dependence on a protease-sensitive cytosolic component.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of cytosolic lipid depletion on &#x003b1;-syn binding</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Using chloroform extraction to fractionate cytosol into three fractions: the top fraction contains the gangliosides or small organic polar molecules, the interface layer contains the proteins and the bottom phase contains lipids solubilised in chloroform.

These include Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple system atrophy, and Down syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Accumulations of &#x003b1;-syn in all these disorders have a common fibrillar configuration, though they differ in the co-localisation with other proteins including tau, parkin, and synphilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. While the physiological functions of normal &#x003b1;-syn remain to be fully elucidated, several studies suggested it may play a role in synaptic plasticity, regulate dopamine (DA) neurotransmission via effects on vesicular DA storage, and act as a co-chaperone with cysteine-string protein to maintain nerve terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These roles may involve &#x003b1;-syn interactions with proteins in cytosol and on membranes, though little is known about the &#x003b1;-syn membrane interaction <italic>in vivo </italic>and how membrane-bound and freely-diffusible pools of &#x003b1;-syn are maintained. Therefore, to understand the regulation of &#x003b1;-syn interaction with synaptic membranes, we developed an <italic>in vitro </italic>assay which measures the binding of recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived &#x003b1;-syn to &#x003b1;-syn-deficient synaptosomal membranes and recapitulates many features of the interactions observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Using this binding assay, we showed that approximately 60% of the Wt and A53T soluble &#x003b1;-syn interacts with membrane, whereas only a small amount of the PD-linked A30P mutant is able to stably bind to the membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Reduced A30P binding has been well-reported in several studies using artificial membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and can be explained by the expected disruption of the &#x003b1;-helix induced by the mutation. Indeed, the secondary structure of &#x003b1;-syn is divided into an &#x003b1;-helical lipid-binding amino-terminal and an unstructured lipid-free carboxyl-terminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The replacement of an Ala by a Pro in the A30P variant restricts the conformational space available to the preceding residue, Ala29, implying the loss of two intra-helical hydrogen bonds modifying the backbone structure of the protein, while the backbone structure and dynamics of the A53T &#x003b1;-syn mutant is found to be virtually unchanged from the Wt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Despite the predicted structural limitations induced by the A30P mutation, and its impaired membrane binding capacity noted in <italic>in vitro </italic>assays, we showed previously that the amounts of Wt, A53T, and A30P &#x003b1;-syn that segregate with synaptic membrane fractions derived from mouse brains are not significantly different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These disparate findings suggest that additional factors <italic>in vivo </italic>control &#x003b1;-syn membrane binding and can be reconciled by our present results showing that the addition of mouse brain cytosol stimulated the membrane association of Wt and A53T &#x003b1;-syn and partially rescued the intrinsically poor binding of the A30P &#x003b1;-syn. These data provide evidence that the subcellular proportion of membrane-bound and soluble &#x003b1;-syn may be regulated by cytosolic factors <italic>in vivo</italic>, which are far more concentrated (~300 mg/ml) than the 0.5&#x02013;3 mg/ml cytosol used in our assay, and might compensate for the low A30P &#x003b1;-syn membrane association observed <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Surprisingly, we observed that pre-exposure of membranes to cytosol was sufficient to augment subsequent &#x003b1;-syn binding, suggesting a mechanism whereby membranes can be primed by cytosolic factors for &#x003b1;-syn recruitment. Moreover, unlike the cytosolic protein requirement for the dissociation of &#x003b1;-syn from synaptic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the cytosol-dependent component of &#x003b1;-syn binding is resistant to digestion by proteinase K and trypsin for the Wt and A53T &#x003b1;-syn, though not for A30P &#x003b1;-syn. This suggests that although cytosolic proteins are not required for the Wt and A53T &#x003b1;-syn membrane interaction, &#x003b1;-syn with A30P mutation would require protein assistance. As it is unlikely that a specific protein interaction evolved to specifically maintain A30P &#x003b1;-syn binding, the protein interaction implied by our results may also interact with Wt &#x003b1;-syn as well, though it is not essential for its membrane binding. We previously reported that cytosolic proteins are required for the dissociation of membrane-bound &#x003b1;-syn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], presumably by transient association with &#x003b1;-helical conformation of &#x003b1;-syn on lipid bilayers. The same factor(s) may also aid in the reverse reaction by coordinating the A30P &#x003b1;-syn amino terminal to configure into an amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix so as to overcome its conformational limitations or to stabilize the mutant in closer apposition to the lipid bilayer prior to membrane binding. Such a mechanism could also account for the transient interaction we observed for A30P mutant with the membrane fraction. By briefly inducing covalent cross-links at various times to stabilize bound &#x003b1;-syn, we observed that A30P &#x003b1;-syn binding was biphasic, peaking at 3 min and declining thereafter. It is important to note this was not due to non-specific cross-linking because the later incubation periods (i.e. 10 min) did not show increased recovery of A30P &#x003b1;-syn with membranes despite the substantial soluble A30P &#x003b1;-syn. These results suggest that &#x003b1;-syn membrane binding may be partially coordinated by local synaptic vesicle proteins. Indeed, proteins such as cysteine string protein or members of the Rab family may fulfil this role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Cross-linking also increased the recovery of bound Wt and A53T &#x003b1;-syn, although the kinetics were different from the A30P mutant. Both Wt and A53T binding peaked in the first minute of incubation suggesting a quicker interaction with synaptic membranes. Interestingly, the Wt &#x003b1;-syn remained stably associated even when cross-linking was activated after 10 min of incubation, the A53T binding declined slowly. These results are consistent with our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] showing greater cytosol-dependent dissociation of both PD mutants from synaptic membranes.</p><p>In the course of characterizing the protein-dependence, we noted that lipid-depleted cytosol lost its activity to induce &#x003b1;-syn binding. Because the cytosol used in these experiments is dialyzed using membranes with a 12 kDa molecular weight cut-off, only lipid-protein complexes larger than 12 kDa are retained. These results suggested that protein-bound polar lipids are likely the protease-insensitive cytosolic components responsible for assisting the membrane binding of &#x003b1;-syn. In accord with the conformational model of &#x003b1;-syn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] whereby it acquires a folded helical structure in the N-terminal region in its membrane-bound state, our results suggested that endogenous cytosolic lipids transferred to membranes prior to &#x003b1;-syn recruitment or bound directly to cytosolic &#x003b1;-syn may aid &#x003b1;-syn folding at the lipid-cytoplasm interface so it is more amenable to binding directly to synaptic membranes. To provide further insight into this novel protein-lipid-protein interaction, we profiled glycerophosphocholines bound to proteins in &#x003b1;-syn-deficient cytosol by nanoflow LC-ESI-MS and precursor ion scan. Our analysis identified 24 species that can potentially affect &#x003b1;-syn membrane interactions. While this number clearly underestimates the cytosolic lipid content <italic>in vivo </italic>given our MS analyses were limited to polar glycerophospholipids with an m/z between 450 and 600, of which glycerophosphocholine-containing species were further analyzed, these data represent the first profile of candidate lipid interactors at the molecular level responsible for the enhanced &#x003b1;-syn binding. Further, we demonstrated that two glycerophosphocholines C14:0 PAF and C16:0 PAF interact with &#x003b1;-syn, with C16:0 PAF definitively identified at the molecular level. Importantly, C16:0 PAF was able to rescue the ability of delipidated cytosol to potentiate &#x003b1;-syn membrane binding but did not, in and of itself, enhance &#x003b1;-syn interaction with membranes. This result suggests the involvement of a cytoplasmic protein, and although appears inconsistent with data in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> showing that &#x003b1;-syn binding does not require intact cytosolic proteins, a more likely possibility is that a cytoplasmic protein may be required to activate or modify the exogenously added lipid. For example, binding to GM2 activator protein elicits a conformational change in PAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Arguably, endogenous PAF in brain cytosol would be active prior to the cytosol depletion, and thus delipidation, but not protein depletion, would impact a-syn binding. Similarly, addition of exogenous PAF, presumably in an inactive conformation, would need prior activation by delipidated cytosol. These findings are also consistent with previous studies indicating that &#x003b1;-syn does not directly bind to palmitic acid (C16:0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], yet addition of 1,2-palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine to &#x003b1;-syn containing protein lysates promotes self-association and formation of protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Here, we further confirmed specificity of these interactions using C16:0 <italic>lyso</italic>-PAF. C16:0 <italic>lyso</italic>-PAF did not impact &#x003b1;-syn interaction with neuronal membranes. Clearly, the nature of these protein-protein-lipid complexes and their effects on &#x003b1;-syn binding to synaptic membranes will require further investigation and expansion of the analysis of lipid co-factors beyond the small second messenger neutral glycerophosphocholines tested in this study. Careful analysis of these lipids will also be relevant to aging and neurodegeneration because abundant data suggest that cumulative oxidative modification of biomolecules, including lipids, plays an important role in aging, and free radical damage to brain lipids is involved in neuronal death in neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. There is also accumulating evidence that &#x003b1;-syn deficiency has complex effects on brain lipid metabolism and production of lipid second messengers although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Consistent with these data, we also detected differences in PAF and LPC glycerophosphocholine levels between KO and normal cytosols, but these did not impact &#x003b1;-syn binding in our assay. Altogether, our data suggest that brain-lipids regulate &#x003b1;-syn binding, and an imbalance in specific species could mediate &#x003b1;-syn accumulation in the cytosol leading to fibril formation.</p><p>Despite previous studies suggesting that &#x003b1;-syn preferentially binds to lipid rafts in HeLa cells and to purified lipid raft fractions from rodent brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we were unable to corroborate this interaction in our studies. We found that &#x0003c; 5% of total exogenously added &#x003b1;-syn co-eluted with the lipid raft marker flotillin-1, and this was unaffected by PD-linked mutations. Moreover, the same minor proportion of brain-expressed &#x003b1;-syn co-eluted with the flotillin-1 enriched fractions isolated from synaptosomes or whole brain, ostensibly reflecting negligible lipid raft associated &#x003b1;-syn <italic>in vivo</italic>. This low level of brain &#x003b1;-syn in lipid rafts was also noted by Fortin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], though they postulated that &#x003b1;-syn may dissociate from brain lipid rafts during the biochemical isolation. However, this explanation is inconsistent with the high recovery of overexpressed &#x003b1;-syn in lipid rafts from HeLa cells following the identical isolation procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and with our results showing that chemical cross-linking of A30P &#x003b1;-syn stabilized its membrane association, though not to lipid raft fractions. Two other explanations could account for the difference in the earlier studies and ours: First, lipid rafts in HeLa cells likely have a distinct lipid and protein composition compared to those in mammalian nerve terminals, possibly allowing them to bind overexpressed &#x003b1;-syn, which is not normally expressed in HeLa cells. Second, in the present work, lipid raft fractions were isolated only after &#x003b1;-syn was incubated with permeabilized synaptosomes, which retain sufficient internal architecture as to permit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In contrast, the study by Kubo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] isolated lipid rafts before incubating with exogenous &#x003b1;-syn. The biochemical purification with 1% TX-100 likely modifies lipid rafts by altering lipid packing and/or loss of peripherally attached constituents, conceivably affecting subsequent &#x003b1;-syn binding capacity that is not normally present <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Because calcium influx and metabolic energy are both critical for the normal function of nerve terminals, we examined whether &#x003b1;-syn binding can be affected by modulating the availability of either Ca<sup>2+ </sup>or ATP. We observed that &#x003b1;-syn binding has an ATP-dependant component that was not supported by ATP&#x003b3;S, and is insensitive to calcium. Because the increased &#x003b1;-syn binding in the presence of ATP and cytosol were additive and ATP&#x003b3;S did not affect cytosol-induced &#x003b1;-syn binding, it is likely that ATP and cytosolic factors act independently. One possibility is that ATP acts on a membrane protein whose interaction with membrane-bound &#x003b1;-syn is stabilized by chemical cross-linking, whereas cytosolic lipids modulate &#x003b1;-syn conformation either by direct interaction in cytosol or after intermediate transfer to a membrane component. Our results suggest that changes in synaptic ATP levels due to elevated metabolic consumption during exocytosis could modulate the &#x003b1;-syn solubility and may explain how neuronal depolarization can increase the level of freely-diffusible cytoplasmic &#x003b1;-syn in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The ATP sensitivity is also relevant to aging because neurodegenerative diseases are commonly associated with mitochondrial dysregulation and consequent impairment of energy production[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Under such pathological conditions, it is possible that lowered ATP levels may increase the cytosolic &#x003b1;-syn, which is significantly less constrained structurally than the membrane bound form. Concomitant oxidative stress could thereby promote &#x003b2;-sheet formation and accelerate &#x003b1;-syn aggregation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, while the identities of the cytosolic components that assist the membrane interaction of &#x003b1;-syn remain to be fully characterized, our study reveals that cytosolic lipids and ATP are two of the principal factors regulating &#x003b1;-syn interaction with synaptic membranes. In addition, the relatively poor membrane binding of A30P &#x003b1;-syn could be explained by a more transient interaction with synaptic membrane and was partially rescued by the presence of protease-sensitive factors in brain cytosol. Those results suggest that endogenous brain proteins moderate the otherwise inefficient membrane association of A30P &#x003b1;-syn mutant, and represent a potential targets to influence &#x003b1;-syn solubility in brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>&#x003b1;-syn: Alpha-synuclein; ESI-MS: electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; XIC: Extracted ion chromatogram; HPLC: High performance liquid chromatography; PD: Parkinson's disease; PAF: Platelet activating factor; Tg: Transgenic; Wt: Wild type.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SW-G conducted the majority of the binding assays and drafted the manuscript; NPV contributed to the cross-linking and cytosolic lipid activity assays; SNW characterized the cytosolic and alpha-synuclein bound lipids; DM contributed to the alpha-synuclein purification and binding assays; WH and DF provided the MS data; PEF contributed reagents and participated in the circular dichroism analyses; SALB and AT designed and coordinated the study.
