whether a brain malignancy is a primary tumor or a metastasis from some other tissue. The accurate diagnosis of brain malignancies is essential for selection of proper treatment. MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA species that regulate gene expression; many exhibit tissue-specific expression and are misregulated in cancer. Using microRNA expression profiling, we found that hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9/hsa-miR-9* are over-expressed, specifically in brain primary tumors, as compared to primary tumors from other tissues and their metastases to the brain. By considering the expression of only these two microRNAs, it is possible to distinguish between primary and metastatic brain tumors with very high accuracy. These microRNAs thus represent excellent biomarkers for brain primary tumors. Previous reports have found that hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9/hsa-miR-9* are expressed more strongly in developing neurons and brain than in adult brain. Thus, their specific over-expression in brain primary tumors supports a functional role for these microRNAs or a link between neuronal stem cells and brain tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MicroRNA expression</kwd><kwd>Molecular diagnostics</kwd><kwd>Tumor classification</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A current effort of cancer research is to discover biomarkers that can improve cancer diagnosis in a clinical setting. Specifically, the pathological characterization of brain malignancies remains a diagnostic challenge. Despite the advent of various high throughput genomic-level technologies, which allow multiple DNA sequences, mRNAs or proteins to be evaluated simultaneously and systematically, these have had little impact on clinical procedures. Recently, however, there has been a paradigm shift in our understanding of genome expression, with the realization that there exists a class of small non-coding RNA species, known as microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), which have critical functions in many biological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">(27)</xref>. Although the total number of microRNAs remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and the roles of specific microRNAs are only beginning to be defined, high throughput microRNA expression analyses indicate that these species represent promising candidates for clinical tumor cell markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">(6)</xref>.</p><p>In general, microRNAs are regulated and transcribed similarly to protein coding genes. Subsequent microRNA biogenesis involves discrete processing and transport steps, whereby the active moiety of 20&#x02013;22 nucleotides is excised from a longer RNA precursor that exhibits specific hairpin structure. Finally, these 20&#x02013;22 nucleotides are incorporated into a composite machinery, termed the RNA-induced silencing complex, which promotes partial duplex formation between the short RNA and the 3&#x02032; untranslated regions of targeted transcripts, resulting typically in mammals in translational silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">(27)</xref>. Systematic, high throughput microRNA expression analyses of many diverse tumors indicate that tumors display microRNA expression profiles that are significantly different from those of normal tissue, and moreover, these microRNA profiles are extremely informative with respect to developmental lineage and differentiation state of the tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">(6)</xref>. Studies have suggested that, unlike with mRNA expression, a modest number of &#x0223c;200 microRNAs might be sufficient to classify human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">(15)</xref>. According to emerging studies that reveal an unexpected target specificity of microRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">(11)</xref>, we set out to investigate whether a much smaller number of microRNAs may serve to identify tumors and to define clinically important tumor characteristics. In a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">(23)</xref>, we used microRNA microarray data and developed general classification algorithms for a range of tissues. In that study, we also identified microRNAs that can identify brain tumors from a subset of non-epithelial tumors.</p><p>Differentiation between primary and metastatic tumors in the brain is often encountered in pathological practice, as metastatic tumors to the brain are quite frequent. The most common tumors to metastasize to the brain originate in the lung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">(10)</xref>, breast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">(30)</xref> and skin (melanomas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>); their respective contributions to all central nervous system (CNS) metastases are 30%, 20% and 10%. Although rare, choriocarcinoma disseminates to the brain with a particularly high frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">(26)</xref>. In autopsy studies, 24% of cancer patients exhibited metastatic tumors in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">(19)</xref>. Indeed, surgical pathologists are regularly presented with specimens from patients with a history of systemic neoplasia but with findings that suggest a primary intracranial tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">(19)</xref>.</p><p>Here, we directly compare brain tumors to a wide range of epithelial tumors and metastases to the brain. Using microarray data, we found that elevated expression of just two microRNAs, hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9*, is sufficient to distinguish brain primary tumors from tumors derived from non-brain tissues, and most significantly for diagnostic purposes, from metastases located in the brain. We translated this assay to a qRT-PCR platform, using additional samples as a training set to develop a classifier. Validating on an independent set of test samples, we found that the simple combination of hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9 (or hsa-miR-9*) can identify brain metastases from brain primary tumors with sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 100%. Thus, economical and relatively easy evaluation of hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9/9* expression, which can be performed robustly using either fresh frozen or fixed materials in the clinical setting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">(33)</xref>, reveals whether neoplastic tissue excised from the brain is brain-derived or represents a metastasis from another tissue. Hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9/9* were identified previously to be over-expressed in developing brain and neuronal stem cells compared to adult brain, and thus have been implicated as players in human nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Taken together, the expression data concerning hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9/9* suggest a connection between deregulation of microRNAs, pluripotency and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Tumor samples</title><p>A total of 285 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples were obtained from several sources (Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel; Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel; Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva, Israel; ABS Inc., Wilmington, DE; Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel).

As a rule, certain morphological features aid in the distinction between secondary and primary neoplasms of the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">(1)</xref>. Metastases retain a cohesive quality as they enlarge, and thus remain demarcated from the host tissue, while astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors exhibit an infiltrative growth pattern, intermingling with the normal cells of the brain tissue. Additionally, in contrast to neoplastic glial cells, neoplastic cells of metastatic carcinomas reveal their epithelial nature by their round or polygonal shape, distinct cellular borders and lack of processes. Furthermore, the amount of fibrous tissue in metastatic lesions is typically greater than in most gliomas, and also, the pattern of necrosis seems to be different in primary tumors from that seen in metastases. However, poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma may be difficult to distinguish histologically from high-grade astrocytic malignant neoplasms, particularly on small open or stereotactic biopsy specimens.</p><p>Immunohistochemical studies are often employed to help in diagnosing brain specimens. One study reported a sensitivity of 100% at a specificity of 86% for identifying primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from metastatic carcinoma using immunohistochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), but a significant number of the metastatic cancers are also stained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">(17)</xref>. A combination of immunostains, including GFAP and cytokeratin CAM5.2, has been suggested as useful in differentiating poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma from GBM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">(17)</xref>. However, GBM may variably stain with cytokeratin immunomarkers, usually expressed in epithelial tumors. Co-expression of GFAP and cytokeratin is frequently found, especially in cases of undifferentiated and high grade gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Therefore, cytokeratin positivity does not rule out the diagnosis of a glial neoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">(8)</xref>. Suggested workup for the differential diagnosis between primary brain neoplasms and poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma based on immunohistochemistry, therefore, requires a combination of multiple factors, and their accuracy in different scenarios has not yet been established. Regardless of these morphological and immunohistological tools, some neoplastic brain specimens still cannot be definitively classified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">(19)</xref>. For instance, anaplastic oligodendroglioma can be macroscopically discrete and composed of compactly arranged polygonal cells such that it simulates a metastatic tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">(26)</xref>.

However, many of these microRNAs are highly expressed in normal brain tissue. Inevitably, during biopsy procedures, significant amounts of normal tissue are excised along with cancerous tissue. In our samples, the tumor content was greater than or equal to 50% in more than 90% of the samples. Nevertheless, as in most studies of expression profiling on tissue samples, a fair amount of non-tumor cells are present in the specimens. Thus, brain-specific microRNAs, such as hsa-miR-124, can be found variously in tissue specimens containing brain metastases, and their expression levels measured in bulk tissue samples do not allow discrimination between brain primary tumors and metastases located in the brain.</p><p>Further analyses, which included a substantial set of 50 brain metastasis samples, delineated a subset of microRNAs that are expressed specifically in brain primary tumors, but importantly, neither in non-brain primary tumors nor in brain-located metastases. Specifically, we found that hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9/9* are very significantly and strongly over-expressed in samples of primary brain tumors, but not in samples of metastatic tumors to the brain. These bulk samples contain surrounding tissue, and it cannot be ruled out at this stage that a fraction of the over-expressed microRNAs may be derived from non-neoplastic glial cells in the surrounding tissue, in which this expression is specific to reactive cells surrounding primary tumors only. Regardless of its biological origin, the specific over-expression of these microRNAs in samples from brain primary tumors provides important diagnostic information. The combined expression levels of hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9/9* allow discrimination between brain primary tumors and metastases located in the brain with very high accuracy, and thus represent a potential biomarker for the identification of brain primary tumors.</p><p>Notably, hsa-miR-92b and hsa-miR-9/9* were reported previously to be over-expressed in neuronal-specific stem cells and to exhibit dynamic expression patterns in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Thus, it appears that elevated expression of these microRNAs is a feature common to brain stem cells and brain tumor cells. Whether cancerous cells originate from abnormal stem cells or represent de-differentiated somatic cells is a hotly debated issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In any case, our data reinforce the enigmatic association between pluripotency and tumorigenesis. Further research should elucidate the function of these microRNAs in the brain and their roles in brain cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCLOSURE</title><p>All authors affiliated with Rosetta Genomics are full-time employees of Rosetta Genomics Ltd. and hold equity in the company, the value of which may be influenced by this publication.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital</collab><article-title>Weekly clinicopathological exercises.

A.</bold> RNA was extracted and profiled (4 &#x003bc;g total RNA) from a mouse liver sample, which was either preserved as fresh frozen (<italic>y</italic>-axis) or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) (<italic>x</italic>-axis). Overall correlation of expressions was 0.9. Similar results were obtained for RNA extracted from lung. <bold>B.</bold> Similar results were obtained when comparing microRNA expression extracted from FFPE sample (<italic>x</italic>-axis) to the RNA extracted from formalin-fixed sample (<italic>y</italic>-axis). Overall correlation of expressions was 0.9. Similar results were obtained for RNA extracted from lung. We next examined the difference in the level of microRNA expression in tissues (liver and lung) preserved at different time points, immediate, 1 h and 5 h post-operation. The microRNA fraction in the lung was not affected even when kept non-fixed for 5 h. Delaying fixation of a liver sample by 1 h had no significant change on the microRNA fraction, but the microRNA fraction was decreased approximately twofold when the liver sample was kept non-fixed for 5 h, reflecting the high content of nucleases in liver tissue (data not shown).</p><p><bold>Figure S2.</bold> MicroRNA stability in formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) archival samples of different ages: total RNA was extracted from 13 lung FFPE samples of different ages (ages 2&#x02013;11 years) and hybridized to the miRdicator&#x02122; microarray. Each bar in the graph depicts the overall microRNA expression correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient) between a single sample (age appearing on the <italic>x</italic>-axis), and the newest sample (age 2 years). The high correlation (mostly above 0.9) indicates the highly preserved fraction of microRNA in paraffin blocks even after many years.</p><p><bold>Figure S3. A.</bold> Microarray reproducibility: 3 &#x003bc;g of placenta RNA (Ambion) was repeatedly (seven times) labeled and hybridized to the microarray. For &#x0003e;200 highly expressed microRNAs (sorted from top to bottom by mean expression level), each column depicts the expression in one repeat. For each pair of repeats, the Pearson correlation coefficient was computed, resulting in an overall mean correlation coefficient of 0.99. <bold>B.</bold> Microarray sensitivity and dynamic range: four synthetic short RNAs, 22 nt long, were spiked in different amounts into 3 &#x003bc;g of placenta total RNA, labeled and hybridized to the array. Each line corresponds to one of the spike-ins. The lowest sensitivity was found to be 0.1 fmole with a linear dynamic range of about three orders of magnitude. <bold>C.</bold> Microarray specificity: synthetic RNAs of hsalet- 7a, c and d were spiked into non-relevant background material (high molecular weight RNA extracted from HeLa cell line, which shows no hybridization background when hybridized to the microarray, data not shown) and hybridized to the miRdicator&#x02122; microarray. The table depicts the probe signals of the let-7 family in response to the spiked-in synthetic RNAs (columns), normalized by the signal of the probe corresponding to the synthetic RNA. Specificity of about 10-fold in the signal level between let-7a and let-7c was demonstrated, representing the level of specificity for a single nucleotide mismatch. <bold>D.</bold> Tissue specificity: 3&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g of total RNA extracted from liver and testis formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded samples were labeled and hybridized to the miRdicator&#x02122; microarray, identifying tissue specific microRNA expression profiles such as hsa-miR-122a in the liver and hsa-miR-372 and hsa-miR-373 in the testis tissue.</p><p><bold>Figure S4.</bold><italic>Expression levels of microRNA (microarray data) in 15 primary brain tumors (blue/cyan squares), 187 primary tumors from other tissues (black/yellow diamonds) and 50 brain metastases from various tissue origins (green circles)</italic>. <bold>A.</bold> HsamiR-128 has high expression levels in brain primary tumors, low in other primary tumors and intermediate in brain metastasis samples (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In contrast to hsa-miR-128, hsa-miR-92b is specifically expressed in brain primary tumors, and is lower in primary tumors from other tissues and in their metastases to the brain. <bold>B.</bold> Hsa-miR-124 has high expression levels in brain primary tumors, low in other primary tumors, and its expression levels in RNA extracted from brain metastasis samples spans a wide range. In contrast to hsa-miR-124, hsa-miR-9* is specifically expressed in brain primary tumors, and is lower in primary tumors from other tissues and in their brain metastases. <bold>C.</bold> Expression of hsa-miR-92a did not correlate with expression of hsa-miR-92b and was not useful for identification between primary and metastatic brain malignancies.</p><p><bold>Figure S5.</bold><italic>The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) plots the sensitivity against the false-positive rate (one minus the specificity) for different cutoff values of a diagnostic metric, and is a measure of classification performance. The area under the ROC curve [area under curve(AUC)] can be used to asses the diagnostic performance of metric. A random classifier has AUC = 0.5, and an optimal classifier with perfect sensitivity and specificity of 100% has AUC = 1.</italic><bold>A.</bold> The sorted values of <italic>C<sub>0</sub></italic> for 15 samples of brain primary tumors (blue squares) and 187 samples of non-brain primary tumors (red circles).
