Stress-induced translational arrest is observed in cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable eIF2&#x003b1; mutant (S51A), which indicates the existence of an alternative pathway of translational control. In this paper, we show that arsenite, heat shock, or ultraviolet irradiation promotes transfer RNA (tRNA) cleavage and accumulation of tRNA-derived, stress-induced small RNAs (tiRNAs). We show that angiogenin, a secreted ribonuclease, is required for stress-induced production of tiRNAs. Knockdown of angiogenin, but not related ribonucleases, inhibits arsenite-induced tiRNA production and translational arrest. In contrast, knockdown of the angiogenin inhibitor RNH1 enhances tiRNA production and promotes arsenite-induced translational arrest. Moreover, recombinant angiogenin, but not RNase 4 or RNase A, induces tiRNA production and inhibits protein synthesis in the absence of exogenous stress. Finally, transfection of angiogenin-induced tiRNAs promotes phospho-eIF2&#x003b1;&#x02013;independent translational arrest. Our results introduce angiogenin and tiRNAs as components of a phospho-eIF2&#x003b1;&#x02013;independent stress response program.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The survival of mammalian cells exposed to adverse environmental conditions requires a radical reprogramming of protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yamasaki and Anderson, 2008</xref>). Stress-induced translational arrest of mRNAs encoding &#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; proteins is triggered by a family of eIF2&#x003b1; kinases that reduce the availability of eIF2&#x003b1;&#x02013;GTP&#x02013;tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> ternary complexes required for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Kedersha, 2008</xref>). Under these conditions, translation of a subset of mRNAs encoding upstream open reading frames (uORF; e.g., ATF4) is selectively enhanced, a consequence of uORF &#x0201c;read-through&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lu et al., 2004</xref>). The reprogramming of protein translation is part of an integrated stress response that promotes the survival of cells subjected to adverse environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The finding that low-dose oxidative stress inhibits protein translation in cells expressing nonphosphorylatable eIF2&#x003b1; suggested the existence of a phospho-eIF2&#x003b1;&#x02013;independent translation control pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McEwen et al., 2005</xref>). We hypothesized that stress-induced cleavage of tRNA, a phenomenon first described as a starvation response in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee and Collins, 2005</xref>), and later observed in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Haiser et al., 2008</xref>), fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jochl et al., 2008</xref>), and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>), may contribute to stress-induced translational arrest. Sequence analysis reveals that tRNAs are cleaved in or near the anticodon loop. In both <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee and Collins, 2005</xref>) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>), many 3&#x02032; fragments possess &#x0201c;CCA&#x0201d; additions characteristic of mature tRNA. Moreover, these fragments lack tRNA introns, which indicates that they are not derived from pre-tRNAs. In most cases, the appearance of tRNA fragments is not accompanied by a significant depletion of mature tRNA, indicating that a small subset of the total tRNA population is cleaved during stress. In mammalian cells, analogous tRNA-derived fragments comprise a small subset of PIWI-associated RNAs (piRNAs), which suggests that tRNA anticodon cleavage may lead to the assembly of specific RNP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that tRNA fragment-containing RNPs contribute to a phospho-eIF2&#x003b1;&#x02013;independent translation control pathway.</p><p>Angiogenin is a secreted ribonuclease that was first identified as an angiogenic factor found in tumor cell&#x02013;conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fett et al., 1985</xref>). The secretion of angiogenin is enhanced by hypoxia, which indicates that it may be a component of a stress response program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hartmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakamura et al., 2006</xref>). Angiogenin binds to receptors on the surface of endothelial cells that facilitate its internalization and transport to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hatzi and Badet, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wiedlocha, 1999</xref>). Remarkably, promotion of new blood vessel growth is dependent on its ribonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shapiro and Vallee, 1987</xref>). Although the RNA targets required for angiogenesis are unknown, in vitro studies have shown that tRNAs are preferred targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Saxena et al., 1992</xref>). Angiogenin also promotes ribosomal RNA transcription and cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsuji et al., 2005</xref>), which suggests that it has multiple functions. We have discovered that angiogenin is a stress-activated ribonuclease that cleaves tRNA and inhibits protein translation. Our results introduce angiogenin and tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs (tiRNAs) as previously unappreciated components of the mammalian stress response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Extracts prepared from human U2OS cells exposed to arsenite-induced oxidative stress, heat shock, or UV irradiation were separated on a denaturing gel and developed with SYBR gold to visualize stress-induced small RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In stressed cells, two discrete bands corresponding to RNAs centered around 30 and 40 nucleotides were observed. Northern blotting using cDNA probes complementary to the 5&#x02032; end of tRNA<sup>Met</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, bottom, NB) and the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of tRNA<sup>Met</sup>, tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, and tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; 5S RNA is included as a loading control) confirms that the stress-induced RNAs are produced by tRNA cleavage. The size of these fragments requires that cleavage occur, as in <italic>T. thermophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee and Collins, 2005</xref>), in or near the anticodon loop. These tiRNAs appear rapidly (within 20 min) in cells subjected to arsenite-induced oxidative stress, and persist for at least 11 h in cells allowed to recover from stress (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811106/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; over this time course provides a marker of stress and recovery from stress (Fig. S1 A). Arsenite-induced tiRNAs are observed in several different primate cell lines (Fig. S1 B). Importantly, tiRNAs are not observed in cells undergoing etoposide- or caffeine-induced apoptosis (Fig. S1 C), which indicates that tiRNA production is not a nonspecific consequence of cell death.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Stress-induced production of tiRNA.</bold> (A) U2OS cells treated with sodium arsenite (SA; 500 &#x000b5;M, 2 h), heat (42&#x000b0;C, 2 h), or UV irradiation (200 J/m<sup>2</sup>, 12 h) were extracted with Trizol, and total RNA (10 &#x000b5;g) was separated on a 15% TBE-urea gel before processing with SYBR gold.

Phospho- and total eIF2&#x003b1; was quantified by immunoblotting (IB; bottom).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200811106R_GS_Fig1"/></fig><p>To determine the potential for tiRNAs to mediate phospho-eIF2&#x003b1;&#x02013;independent translational arrest, we compared their induction in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild-type or eIF2&#x003b1; (S51A) mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Scheuner et al., 2001</xref>). The expression of mature tRNA<sup>Met</sup> is similar in wild-type and mutant (mut) cells in the absence or presence of arsenite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, SA). In both wild-type and mutant MEFs, tiRNAs are much less abundant than tRNAs. Although densitometric analysis may be misleading because of the relative overexpression of tRNA<sup>Met</sup>, the calculated ratios of tiRNA<sup>Met</sup>/tRNA<sup>Met</sup> are always &#x0003c;0.1, which indicates that depletion of tRNA is unlikely to contribute to the functional effects of tRNA cleavage. Interestingly, the induction of tiRNA<sup>Met</sup> is significantly greater in mutant cells compared with wild-type cells, indicating that phospho-eIF2&#x003b1; is not required for, and may inhibit, tiRNA production. We also quantified the production of tiRNAs in U2OS cells treated with control or heme-regulated initiation factor 2-&#x003b1; kinase (HRI)-specific siRNAs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811106/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). Knockdown of HRI, the eIF2&#x003b1; kinase activated by arsenite, increases the arsenite-induced production of tiRNAs. Collectively, these results indicate that the induction of tiRNAs does not require phospho-eIF2&#x003b1;. Moreover, phospho-eIF2&#x003b1; may suppress the induction of tiRNA.</p><p>Ribonucleases that target the anticodon loop of tRNA are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardelt et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaufmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Suhasini and Sirdeshmukh, 2006</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, a tRNA anticodon nuclease designated onconase has been found to inhibit protein synthesis and promote the death of selected tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardelt et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Suhasini and Sirdeshmukh, 2006</xref>). The toxic effects of onconase are observed at doses that do not markedly deplete cellular tRNAs, which suggests that activation of the ribotoxic stress response may contribute to its toxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Iordanov et al., 2000</xref>). Angiogenin is an onconase-related ribonuclease that selectively cleaves tRNA in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Saxena et al., 1992</xref>). To determine whether angiogenin is required for the stress-induced production of tiRNA, we used siRNA to knock down angiogenin expression before quantifying arsenite-induced tiRNA production and stress-induced translational repression. Transfection of a Dharmacon SMART pool targeting angiogenin reduces the expression of angiogenin mRNA (quantified using quantitative RT-PCR) to 63 &#x000b1; 8% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) of the control level. Under these conditions, the arsenite-induced production of tiRNA is reduced to 55 &#x000b1; 6% (<italic>n</italic> = 3) of the control level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lane 3; representative of three independent experiments). This result was confirmed using an angiogenin-specific siRNA that more efficiently reduces angiogenin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsuji et al., 2005</xref>). This reagent reduces the expression of angiogenin mRNA (quantified using quantitative RT-PCR) to 27% &#x000b1; 12 (<italic>n</italic> = 3) of the control level, and production of tiRNAs to 36 &#x000b1; 8% (<italic>n</italic> = 3) of the control level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lane 4; representative of three independent experiments). To determine the effect of angiogenin on stress-induced translational repression, U2OS cells were treated with the indicated siRNAs, then pulsed with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-containing medium in the absence or presence of sodium arsenite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, SA; 100 &#x000b5;M for 1 h) for 30 min. In all cases, [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine incorporation was normalized to that of cells treated with control siRNA. This analysis reveals that reduced expression of angiogenin significantly inhibits arsenite-induced translational repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, compare lane 4 to lanes 5 and 6). These results are consistent with a role for angiogenin-induced tiRNAs in stress-induced translational repression, although cleavage of mRNA and/or rRNA could also contribute to inhibition of protein synthesis.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of endogenous angiogenin on tiRNA production and protein synthesis.</bold> (A) U2OS cells were transfected with control (D0, lanes 1 and 2), angiogenin-specific SMART pool (SP; lane 3), or angiogenin-specific individual (ANG; lane 4) siRNAs, then cultured in the absence (&#x02212;; lane 1) or presence (+; lanes 2&#x02013;4) of sodium arsenite (SA; 250 &#x000b5;M) for 1 h before Trizol extraction, separation on a 15% TBE-urea gel, and CYBR gold staining.

Knockdown of either RNase L or RNase Z (ELAC2) does not prevent arsenite-induced tiRNA cleavage (Fig. S3), which indicates that stress-induced tRNA cleavage is not a general property of ribonucleases.</p><p>We found that the angiogenin inhibitor RNH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Naddeo et al., 2005</xref>) regulates the production of tiRNA in U2OS cells. Targeted knockdown of RNH1 induces the production of tiRNAs in the absence or presence of arsenite-induced oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lanes 2 and 4, respectively). This result suggests that angiogenin is constitutively expressed but held in an inactive state by RNH1. In cells subjected to arsenite-induced oxidative stress, knockdown of RNH1 enhances tiRNA production and promotes stress-induced translational silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4). In unstressed cells, tiRNAs induced by RNH1 knockdown do not inhibit protein synthesis under the assayed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2).

We have shown that: (1) recombinant angiogenin induces the production of tiRNAs in U2OS cells (while this manuscript was under review, similar results were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fu et al. [2009]</xref>), (2) recombinant angiogenin inhibits protein synthesis in U2OS cells, (3) knockdown of angiogenin inhibits arsenite-induced tiRNA production and translational repression, (4) knockdown of RNH1 enhances tiRNA production and promotes arsenite-induced translational repression, and (5) transfection of purified, endogenous 5&#x02032; but not 3&#x02032; tiRNAs inhibits protein synthesis in U2OS cells as well as wild-type and S51A mutant MEFs. Collectively, these results strongly implicate angiogenin and tiRNAs in a process of stress-induced translational repression.</p><p>The finding that tRNA fragments possess posttranscriptionally added &#x0201c;CCA&#x0201d; residues and lack leaders, trailers, and introns suggests that tiRNAs are derived from mature tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee and Collins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fu et al., 2009</xref>). We have found that neomycin, a drug that prevents recombinant angiogenin from entering the nucleus, has no effect on angiogenin-induced tRNA cleavage, which suggests that angiogenin cleaves mature, cytoplasmic tRNAs (unpublished data). The finding that 5&#x02032; but not 3&#x02032; tiRNAs inhibit protein synthesis reveals a functional difference between these tRNA fragments. This may be a consequence of tRNA fragment size: smaller 5&#x02032; fragments (&#x0223c;30 nucleotides) may bind to a protein cofactor more efficiently than larger 3&#x02032; fragments (&#x0223c;40 nucleotides). Another important consideration is the nature of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the tRNA fragments. The 5&#x02032; ends of 5&#x02032; tiRNAs, like tRNA, are likely to be 5&#x02032; monophosphates. In contrast, the 5&#x02032; ends of 3&#x02032; tiRNAs are likely to be hydroxyl groups. As miRNAs and piRNAs have 5&#x02032; monophosphates, this modification may promote the stability and function of small RNAs. The 3&#x02032; ends of 5&#x02032; tiRNAs are likely to be 2&#x02032;, 3&#x02032; cyclic phosphates, as angiogenin cleavage leaves this moiety at the 3&#x02032; ends of cleaved RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rybak and Vallee, 1988</xref>). This cyclic phosphate residue may be resolved to 2&#x02032; phosphate or 3&#x02032; phosphate groups. Whether this moiety is further modified to produce the protective 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl groups found at the termini of miRNAs and piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Horwich et al., 2007</xref>) is an important question for future research. In contrast, the 3&#x02032; ends of 3&#x02032; tiRNAs, like tRNAs, are likely to be hydroxyl groups. Thus, the nature of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of these tRNA fragments may be an important determinant of their functional potential.</p><p>Because stress-induced reprogramming of protein translation can help cells survive adverse environmental conditions, secreted angiogenin may activate an &#x0201c;infectious&#x0201d; stress response program that allows stressed cells to warn their brethren of approaching noxious stimuli. This may occur at the organismal level by secretion of angiogenin from the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Olson et al., 1998</xref>), or at the tissue level by secretion of angiogenin from stressed cells within peripheral tissues. The local and systemic actions of angiogenin would be consistent with its expression from an upstream promoter that is expressed in all tissues and a downstream promoter that is expressed in liver cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dyer and Rosenberg, 2005</xref>). Just as interferons are virus-induced factors that protect adjacent or distant cells from virus infection, angiogenin may be a stress-induced factor that protects adjacent or distant cells from the deleterious effects of environmental stress.</p><p>Angiogenin has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurological disease caused by the death of motor neurons. Mutations in angiogenin are found in a small subset of patients with both familial and sporadic ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Greenway et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). ALS-associated angiogenin missense mutations have reduced ribonuclease and angiogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Greenway et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). It is therefore possible that the survival of motor neurons requires the angiogenin-induced stress response program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p>U2OS cells were cultured in DME (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U/ml antibiotics (penicillin), and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin.
