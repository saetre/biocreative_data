The insensitivity of phagocytosis to brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of certain ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), previously indicated that ARF1 did not participate in phagocytosis. In this study, we show that ARF1 was activated during Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagocytosis and that blocking normal ARF1 cycling inhibited phagosome closure. We examined the distributions and activation patterns of ARF6 and ARF1 during Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagocytosis using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) stoichiometric microscopy of macrophages expressing CFP- or YFP-chimeras of ARF1, ARF6, and a GTP-ARF-binding protein domain. Both GTPases were activated by BFA-insensitive factors at sites of phagocytosis. ARF6 activation was restricted to the leading edge of the phagocytic cup, while ARF1 activation was delayed and delocalized over the phagosome. Phagocytic cups formed after inhibition of PI 3-kinase (PI-3K) contained persistently activated ARF6 and minimally activated ARF1.

However, previous methods have not afforded a system for the in vivo observation of ARF activation dynamics. As a result, the precise location of ARF activation in the cell must be inferred from studies that rely on the localization of GTP-binding or GTP-hydrolysis mutant ARF proteins; these molecules may or may not accurately reflect the localization of endogenous GDP- or GTP-bound ARF proteins. Alternatively, biochemical methods have been developed to measure ARF activation but are unable to resolve where activation and deactivation occur in the cell. A complete understanding of the role of ARF family members in phagocytosis will require detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal profile of their activation during phagosome formation. Of particular interest is the sequence of activation of the various GTPases that coordinate the morphological changes required for phagocytosis.</p><p>In this study, we have used fluorescence microscopy to measure the localization and activation of ARF6 and ARF1 GTPases during phagocytosis. We show that constitutively active ARF1(Q71L) and the dominant-negative, GTP-binding-deficient ARF1(T31N) mutants partially inhibited phagocytosis when expressed in macrophages as cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) chimeras. Macrophages expressing the mutant ARF chimeras were able to initiate phagocytosis and began to extend pseudopods over opsonized target particles. However, the phagocytic cups in these macrophages frequently failed to close, a result similar to the inhibition of phagocytosis produced by the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002. Ratiometric fluorescence time-lapse microscopy indicated both ARF6-YFP and ARF1-YFP chimeras localized to sites of Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagocytosis. To quantify the activation of these ARF molecules in vivo, we used a portion of the GGA1 GAT domain, the &#x003b1;-helical N-GAT, to develop an assay based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) stoichiometry &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Using this FRET microscopy method, we observed that both ARF6 and ARF1 were activated during the extension of phagosomal pseudopods. Activation of ARF6 was concentrated at the tip of extending pseudopods, while ARF1 was active throughout the forming phagosome. ARF6 activation was independent of PI-3K activity, but deactivation of ARF6 required PI-3K function. In contrast, ARF1 activation at the phagosome was blocked by PI-3K inhibition. Furthermore, we found that the phagosome-localized activation of ARF1 was unaffected by BFA, indicating ARF1 may be regulated by cytohesin/ARNO family GEFs in response to Fc&#x003b3;R ligation. The distinct responses of ARF6 and ARF1 activation to PI-3K inhibition suggests that these ARF GTPases regulate distinct functions during Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagocytosis. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>FRET-Based Measurement of ARF GTPase Activation</title><p>To localize ARF activation inside live cells, we developed a FRET microscopic method based on the interaction between GTP-bound ARFs and GGA-family protein GAT domains.

Despite its ability to bind to ARF-GTP, expression of YFP-NGAT was not toxic to macrophages, nor did it appear to inhibit phagocytosis (see below). In contrast, we were not able to express at high levels in macrophages a YFP-NGAT construct derived from the human GGA3 cDNA; this construct inhibited phagocytosis even at low expression levels. We attribute these different results for the two chimeras to different affinities for ARF-GTP. The apparently lower affinity of the GGA1-derived YFP-NGAT allowed it to act as a reporter of ARF activation without inhibiting the RAW264.7 cells' phagocytic functions. </p><p>When co-expressed in cells, the binding of YFP-NGAT to GTP-bound ARF-CFP chimeras could be detected using FRET microscopy.

Additionally, from the component fluorescence images, FRET stoichiometry determines R <sub>M</sub>: the molar ratio of all YFP acceptors (free and complexed) to all CFP donor molecules. </p><p>To evaluate the ability of this method to detect ARF-GTP, RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells co-expressing ARF1-CFP and YFP-NGAT were used to visualize activated ARF1 at the Golgi apparatus and to measure ARF1 deactivation in response to BFA. On the molecular level, BFA binds an ARF&#x02013;GDP&#x02013;GEF intermediate complex preventing release of the GDP nucleotide &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.

ARF1-CFP accumulation resulted in a molar excess of ARF1-CFP donors to YFP-NGAT acceptors at the Golgi complex ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, R <sub>M</sub> panels). This site of ARF1-CFP and YFP-NGAT colocalization corresponded to the region of high E <sub>D</sub> indicating binding of YFP-NGAT to activated ARF1-CFP ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, time 0 E <sub>D</sub> image). Following the addition of 5 &#x003bc;M BFA to macrophages, both ARF1-CFP and YFP-NGAT redistributed to the cytoplasm ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). YFP-NGAT completely dispersed within &#x002dc;5 min of the addition of BFA. ARF1-CFP was also rapidly released from the Golgi complex but remained slightly enriched in the juxtanuclear region for &#x002dc;15 min after BFA addition.

With activation of ARF1 arrested by BFA, stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by endogenous GAPs led to the rapid deactivation of all ARF1-CFP at the Golgi complex within &#x002dc;7 min. The kinetics observed for BFA-induced ARF1-CFP and YFP-NGAT redistribution and ARF1 deactivation were consistent with a previous study of the effects of BFA on the localization of ARF1-CFP and YFP-GAT chimeras &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>When YFP-NGAT was co-expressed in RAW264.7 cells with ARF1(T31N)-CFP or ARF6(T27N)-CFP, mutations known to reduce the affinity of the ARF GTPases for GTP &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, cells exhibited reduced FRET signals ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Similarly, much lower FRET signals were measured from cells expressing wild-type ARF-CFP chimeras with YFP-NGAT(A193T, N194Y).

The average FRET values measured from cells expressing the constitutively active or constitutively inactive ARF-CFP chimeras were significantly different from the corresponding wild-type CFP chimeras (Mann-Whitney U test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Likewise, the FRET values obtained from cells expressing the mutant YFP-NGAT chimera with wild-type or constitutively active ARF-CFP were significantly different from the wild-type YFP-NGAT controls ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

During phagocytosis, ARF6-YFP was recruited to the leading edges of extending pseudopods ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The highest ARF6-YFP enrichment occurred in the front of the advancing phagocytic cups, and ARF6-YFP was prominently enriched in post-phagocytic ruffles after engulfment of the opsonized erythrocytes. Following closure of the phagosome at &#x002dc;7&#x02013;8 min after erythrocyte binding, ARF6-YFP remained associated with the phagosome at moderate levels relative to the surrounding cytoplasm ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">2</xref>B). Analysis of multiple phagosomes showed that ARF6-YFP localization to the phagosome increased rapidly during the extension of phagosome pseudopods, peaked within &#x002dc;2.5 min of the initiation of phagocytosis, then gradually diminished ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). </p><p>Unlike ARF6, ARF1-YFP recruitment did not consistently associate with a particular subregion of the phagosome ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Maximum recruitment of ARF1-YFP to the phagosome occurred later than the peak in ARF6-YFP localization ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">2</xref>D). Based on the aggregate analysis of independent phagosomes, recruitment of ARF1-YFP appeared biphasic: ARF1-YFP was transiently recruited upon the initiation of pseudopod extension but was recruited to greater extent as phagosomes neared closure. ARF1 recruitment to the phagosome plateaued shortly after sealing of the phagosome (&#x002dc;10 min) and remained elevated over the course of observation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). </p><p>We next attempted to use the YFP-NGAT fusion protein to measure the distribution of endogenous activated ARF proteins at the phagosome. The YFP-NGAT chimera was distinctly enriched at juxtanuclear sites indicating binding to endogenous, activated ARFs in the Golgi network ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). However, during Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagocytosis, no significant recruitment of the YFP-NGAT chimera to phagosomes was observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">2</xref>F). Analysis of these phagosomes suggested that either limited or no activation of endogenous ARF proteins occurred during phagocytosis, or the affinity of the YFP-NGAT chimera for activated ARF proteins did not allow it to compete effectively with endogenous ARF-GTP-binding proteins. Pretreatment of macrophages with BFA prior to microscopic observation redistributed the YFP-NGAT evenly throughout the cell; however, YFP-NGAT still did not appear to localize to sites of phagocytosis in these cells ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). The fact that YFP-NGAT was not recruited to phagosomes, combined with the observation that YFP-NGAT did accumulate at the Golgi complex, indicates the total level of ARF-GTP at the phagosome was much lower than the amount of activated ARF in the Golgi compartment. </p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>ARF6 and ARF1 Activation at Sites of Phagocytosis</title><p>To measure the GTP-binding state of ARF6 and ARF1 at phagosomes, ARF6-CFP or ARF1-CFP chimeras were co-expressed with YFP-NGAT chimeras in RAW264.7 cells and observed during Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagocytosis. In macrophages co-transfected with ARF6-CFP and YFP-NGAT, activated ARF6-CFP was observed in ruffles ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>), consistent with previous work that demonstrated ARF6 and ARNO3 translocate to sites of ruffling &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Although ruffles and phagosomes typically displayed comparable E <sub>D</sub> values, ARF6 accumulated to a greater extent at phagosomes than in ruffles ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>). This indicates that while the fraction of ARF6 bound to GTP was approximately equal in ruffles and phagosomes, the total amount of ARF6 activated in response to Fc&#x003b3;R-ligation was higher. </p><p>In our analysis of 11 phagosomes, ARF6 was activated during all phagocytic events, although the magnitude of the activation varied significantly between phagosomes. FRET microscopy indicated ARF6 activation immediately upon binding of opsonized particles to the surfaces of macrophages ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). During extension of the phagocytic cup, activated ARF6-CFP was concentrated at the advancing edge of the pseudopod with lower E <sub>D</sub> values over the base of the phagosome ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>). Based on particle-tracking analysis of multiple phagosomes, the maximum activation of ARF6-CFP occurred within the first two minutes of phagocytosis and most of the ARF6-CFP on the phagosomal membrane was deactivated by the time of phagosome closure (&#x002dc;7&#x02013;8 min) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>). It should be noted that to make quantitative comparisons of independent phagocytic events, the particle-tracking analysis discards much of the spatial resolution provided by the microscope.

This is the result of the advance of an increasing portion of the pseudopod into the measurement region; as the measurement region encompasses a larger area of the macrophage cytoplasm, the FRET signal at the advancing tip is averaged with the trailing region of low FRET. Similar patterns and profiles were reported for Cdc42 activation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>In contrast to ARF6-CFP, ARF1-CFP activation generally increased during pseudopod extension, but ARF1-CFP was also mostly deactivated by the time of phagosome closure ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">Video S2</xref>). The timing of peak ARF1-CFP activation varied from phagosome to phagosome with peaks at 0 min (one phagocytic event), 0.5 min (two events), 1 min (one event), 1.5 min (one event), 2.5 min (three events), 3.5 min (one event), and 4 min (one event). The region of high E <sub>D</sub> was not restricted to a subregion of the nascent phagosome but rather was generally distributed over most of the particle. </p><p>To identify the family of ARF GEFs that catalyzed the activation of ARF1-CFP at sites of phagocytosis, macrophages co-expressing ARF1-CFP and YFP-NGAT were pretreated with BFA before microscopic observation. Prior to phagocytosis, these cells exhibited uniform molar ratios of YFP-NGAT/ARF1-CFP throughout their cytoplasm, and E <sub>D</sub> values in these cells were &#x002dc;0. Similar to phagocytic events that occurred in the absence of BFA, upon particle binding ARF1-CFP activation increased, peaking within 4 min of the start of phagocytosis. Deactivation occurred as the phagosome closed over the target ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv003">Video S3</xref>).

ARF6 activation also was not affected by the presence of BFA (unpublished data). The BFA-resistance of phagosome-associated ARF1-CFP activation implicates a member of the cytohesin/ARNO family of GEFs in the function of ARF1 during phagocytosis. </p><p>When ARF6-CFP or ARF1-CFP were co-expressed with a mutant YFP-NGAT(A193T, N194Y) designed to block binding to activated ARF proteins, macrophages demonstrated low FRET signals of 0&#x00025;&#x02013;1&#x00025; throughout their cytoplasm with no increase observed at the phagosome ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">Figure 3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">3</xref>F). The low E <sub>D</sub> signals in these control cells indicated that FRET was dependent on the binding of YFP-NGAT to activated ARF GTPases. </p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>ARF1 Activation and ARF6 Deactivation at Sites of Phagocytosis Required PI-3K Activity</title><p>To determine whether the activation of ARF1 and ARF6 at phagosomes was regulated by PI-3K, macrophages co-expressing YFP-NGAT with ARF1-CFP or ARF6-CFP were exposed to LY294002 to inhibit PI-3K activity prior to microscopic observation.

Despite the activation of ARF6, macrophages were not able to complete phagocytosis in the presence of PI-3K inhibitor. This result suggests that ARF6 deactivation at the phagosome, rather than activation, is coupled to PI-3K activity. </p><p>In contrast, ARF1-CFP activation at phagocytic cups did not increase in the presence of PI-3K inhibitor ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv005">Video S5</xref>). Macrophages challenged with LY294002 still demonstrated low levels of ARF1-GTP at phagocytic cups but did not produce the transient increase in ARF1 activation observed during phagocytosis in the absence of LY294002 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">Figures 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g004">4</xref>D). Multiple phagosomes never indicated an increase in ARF1-CFP activation at sites of phagocytosis, although Golgi-associated ARF1-CFP activation persisted in the presence of LY294002 ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Taken together, these results indicate ARF1 activation at the phagosome was dependent on a PI-3K-regulated activity, and that LY294002 arrested phagocytosis at a point preceding ARF6 deactivation. </p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>ARF1 GTPase Mutants Block Phagocytosis after the Initiation of Pseudopod Extension</title><p>To test the effects of the constitutively active and dominant-negative ARF-CFP molecules on phagocytosis, we measured phagocytic efficiencies for cells expressing CFP, wild-type ARF-CFP, or cycling mutant ARF-CFP chimeras. Expression of ARF1-CFP reduced the binding index of macrophages by 40&#x00025; compared with macrophages expressing CFP, and expression of the cycling mutant ARF1-CFP chimeras reduced binding indexes by &#x002dc;40&#x00025;&#x02013;50&#x00025; ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Despite the reduction in the number of erythrocytes bound, macrophages expressing ARF1-CFP were able to internalize bound, opsonized erythrocytes with the same efficiency as macrophages expressing CFP. However, expression of ARF1(T31N)-CFP or ARF1(Q71L)-CFP reduced the phagocytic efficiency of macrophages by approximately 2-fold compared with cells expressing CFP ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests indicated that the phagocytic efficiencies of the macrophages expressing the ARF1-CFP mutants were significantly different from the macrophages expressing CFP ( <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.01). Similarly, we found that while wild-type ARF6-CFP produced a 20&#x00025; decrease in phagocytic efficiency when compared with macrophages expressing CFP, the cycling mutants ARF6(T27N)-CFP and ARF6(Q67L)-CFP sharply reduced the phagocytic efficiency of the RAW264.7 macrophages by at least 70&#x00025; ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). None of the ARF6 chimeras had a large effect on the binding indexes of macrophages ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). These results demonstrate that the closure of Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagosomes is dependent on the normal cycling of both the ARF1 and ARF6 GTPases. </p><p>To determine the stage at which mutant ARF1 arrested phagocytosis, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy movies were acquired using RAW264.7 macrophages expressing YFP-NGAT and ARF1(T31N)-CFP or ARF1(Q71L)-CFP. In macrophages expressing ARF1(T31N)-CFP and YFP-NGAT, neither marker accumulated in the juxtanuclear region. In contrast, expression of ARF1(Q71L)-CFP did not inhibit the localization of YFP-NGAT to the juxtanuclear Golgi region. However, the Golgi compartment did frequently appear more fragmented in macrophages expressing the constitutively active ARF1 chimera. Macrophages expressing either of these mutant ARF-CFP chimeras were able to initiate phagocytosis. However, phagocytic cups formed in macrophages expressing ARF1(T31N)-CFP or ARF1(Q71L)-CFP did not progress past pseudopod extension ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g005">5</xref>D). The macrophages expressing ARF1(T31N)-CFP and YFP-NGAT never exhibited FRET.

The phagocytic cups formed in these macrophages resemble the cups formed when PI-3K activity was inhibited by pretreatment of macrophages with LY294002. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>FRET microscopy revealed that PI-3K activity establishes a molecular switch that controls the activation dynamics of ARF GTPases during Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagocytosis. This signal transition comprises a temporal boundary identified by the deactivation of ARF6 and the activation of ARF1. This PI-3K-dependent regulatory mechanism defines a sequence of signaling events during phagocytosis. While this progression occurs smoothly as the phagocyte engulfs the particle, the signal transition initiated by 3&#x02032;PIs distinguishes early and late phagosomal activites regulated by different GTPases from the ARF, and perhaps Rho, family.</p><p>It was previously demonstrated that PI-3K is recruited to phagosomes, and that PI(3,4,5)P <sub>3</sub> accumulates at phagosomes, reaching a plateau shortly before closure, then is cleared from phagosome &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. These observations can be aligned with the signal transition model presented here. As phagocytosis commences, ARF6 is activated independently of PI(3,4,5)P <sub>3</sub> production. However, as PI-3K products accumulate in the phagocytic membrane, GAP activities are recruited to deactivate ARF6, while GEFs simultaneously translocate to the phagosome to activate ARF1. As PI(3,4,5)P <sub>3</sub> is cleared from the closing phagosome, ARF1 GEF activity also decreases, and all ARF GTPases are deactivated. </p><p>ARF6 was rapidly activated upon Fc&#x003b3;R ligation and primarily active during pseudopod extension. ARF6 activation was focused at the advancing edge of pseudopods, where it may regulate the exocytosis of membrane to complete particle engulfment &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The decreasing E <sub>D</sub> values seen at phagocytic cups during closure likely correspond to deactivation of ARF6-GTP. Alternatively, the loss of FRET signal may be attributable to displacement of the YFP-NGAT reporter by endogenous effectors. The activation profile of ARF6 was essentially identical to the profile for Cdc42, which preceded maximal Rac1/Rac2 activation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. The activation of ARF6 and Cdc42 in a confined band at the leading edge of pseudopods is manifested in the particle-tracking results as initially high FRET values that begin to trend downward immediately due to the advance of the macrophage cytoplasm into the phagosome-measurement region, which displays low levels of activated ARF6 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). This indicates that Cdc42 and ARF6 regulate processes required for the extension of pseudopods immediately after binding of opsonized targets. The activation profiles for ARF6, Cdc42, and Rac estimated using FRET microscopy and particle-tracking analysis differ from the profiles measured biochemically &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;; pull-down assays indicated that Rac activation precedes Cdc42 and ARF6 activation. This difference may be explained by the superior temporal resolution provided by the FRET microscopic approach. </p><p>ARF6 activation appeared to be independent of PI-3K activity as LY294002 did not reduce ARF6-GTP levels in the phagocytic cup ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g004">4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv004">Video S4</xref>). Rather, PI-3K function was required for the deactivation of ARF6, suggesting that PI-3K regulates closure activities rather than pseudopod extension. The activation of ARF6 was surprising given previous studies that demonstrated GEFs from the ARNO/cytohesin family translocate to the plasma membrane in a PI-3K-dependent fashion &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Based on our results, we hypothesize that the redistribution of these GEFs in a PI-3K-dependent manner correlates with ARF1, not ARF6, activation, and that ARF1 regulates phagosome closure. Accordingly, ARF1 activation at phagosomes was reduced by LY294002, while activation of ARF1 in the Golgi compartment was unaffected by the presence of the PI-3K inhibitor ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040162-g004">4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv005">Video S5</xref>). Also, the peak activation of ARF1 occurred after maximum ARF6 activation and was not confined to the leading edge of pseudopods. </p><p>The inability of BFA to inhibit phagosome formation led to the hypothesis that ARF1 activation is not required for phagocytosis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the possibility of ARF1 activation by BFA-insensitive GEFs during phagocytosis was not excluded. We observed that BFA did not alter the timing or magnitude of ARF1 activation during phagocytosis, suggesting that ARF1 is an in vivo substrate of ARNO/cytohesin-family GEFs. The activation of ARF1 during phagocytosis did not appear to be gratuitous as we observed that ARF1(T31N) and ARF1(Q71L) blocked phagocytosis after the initiation of pseudopod formation. As ARF6 was activated primarily during the early time points of pseudopod extension, it is unlikely that the blockade induced by the ARF1 cycling mutants was due to a nonspecific effect on ARF6 activation. Given the prominent role of ARF1 in the trafficking of proteins through the Golgi network, it is possible that the effects of the ARF1 mutants on phagocytosis are due to a nonspecific effect on receptor trafficking. However, given that wild-type ARF1-CFP also reduced the binding indexes of macrophages without impacting their ability to phagocytose bound targets, it is possible the reduced binding indexes are simply a reflection of the different morphology of cells expressing ARF1-CFP chimeras. Alternatively, the reduction of binding indexes seen in cells expressing the cycling mutant ARF1 chimeras may reflect a role for ARF1 in the trafficking of Fc&#x003b3; receptors. </p><p>The fact that their activation dynamics are independently regulated during phagocytosis suggests that these ARF GTPases coordinate distinct activities at the phagosome. ARF6 appears primarily to control early events in phagocytosis that occur upstream of PI-3K signaling &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. ARF6 may coordinate these processes in conjunction with Cdc42 and Rac1 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, including the membrane delivery and actin polymerization required to envelop target particles. ARF1 on the phagosome is activated downstream of PI-3K amplification of receptor signaling. ARF1 may be involved in the oxidative burst coupled to Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated phagocytosis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. ARF1 was previously implicated in the BFA-resistant, fMLP-stimulated activation of PLD, a process that leads to increased production of reactive oxygen intermediate in neutrophils &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. ARF1 might also stimulate the oxidative burst through its ability to bind Arfaptin. Arfaptin has been shown to bind to Rac proteins in both their GDP- and GTP-bound states but specifically binds to activated ARF GTPases &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Accordingly, Arfaptin might sequester Rac in the absence of ARF-GTP. Generation of ARF-GTP would free Rac for incorporation into functional phagocyte oxidase complexes. In this model, ARF1 would co-activate the oxidative burst with Rac2, a GTPase that is primarily active during the closure phase of phagocytosis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Given the restriction of ARF6 activation to the leading edge of the phagosome and the profile of Rac activation described previously &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, ARF1 would appear to be a better candidate for this function. </p><p>A crucial question is how the activity of the BFA-resistant GEFs could regulate ARF6 and ARF1 in distinct patterns. Independent regulation of ARF6 and ARF1 may depend on the preference of the GEFs' exchange domains for different ARFs. EFA6 can efficiently catalyze nucleotide exchange on ARF6 but not on ARF1; the constitutive localization of this GEF to the plasma membrane may allow it to function in the absence of PI-3K activity &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.

Cytohesin-4, expressed in leukocytes, was capable of activating ARF1 in vitro but was inactive toward ARF6. Identification of the GEFs responsible for ARF activation during phagocytosis, and determination of their PI-binding preferences could provide insight into the differential regulation of ARF GTPases during phagocytosis. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Molecular cloning and DNA manipulation.</title><p>Plasmids incorporating monomeric versions (A207K) of the GFP spectral variants ECFP and Citrine (an EYFP variant) were used for all constructs &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.

Fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were selected using a JP4v2 filter set (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, Vermont, United States) and a Lambda 10&#x02013;2 filter wheel controller (Sutter Instruments) equipped with a shutter for epifluorescence illumination control. Phase contrast illumination was controlled using a Uniblitz VMM-D1 shutter driver (Vincent Associates, Rochester, New York, United States). Images were recorded with a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, Arizona, United States). Images were acquired by positioning excitation and emission filters to visualize CFP (I <sub>D</sub>): excitation at 430 &#x000b1; 12.5 nm, emission at 470 &#x000b1; 15 nm; YFP (I <sub>A</sub>): excitation at 500 &#x000b1; 10 nm, emission at 535 &#x000b1; 15 nm; or FRET (I <sub>F</sub>): excitation at 430 &#x000b1; 12.5 nm, emission at 535 &#x000b1; 15 nm. Images were collected with exposure times of 100&#x02013;400 ms. To account for variable exposure lengths, image scaling was performed following shading and bias correction, e.g., to correct for I <sub>D</sub>:I <sub>F</sub>:I <sub>A</sub> exposure lengths of 200 ms : 200 ms : 100 ms, the shade/bias corrected I <sub>A</sub> image was multiplied by two prior to further image processing. Shading correction images for I <sub>D</sub>, I <sub>A</sub>, and I <sub>F</sub> were collected from a mixture of CFP and YFP between two coverglasses. Bias-correction images to correct for camera dark noise were collected with the excitation light blocked. The FRET parameters <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> were measured from RAW264.7 cells expressing YFP or CFP, respectively. The parameters <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and <italic>&#x003be;</italic> were determined using cells expressing a covalently linked CFP&#x02013;YFP molecule, whose FRET efficiency (E <sub>C</sub>) has been measured by fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy, and back-calculating using the expression for <italic>f <sub>A</sub></italic> and an updated expression for <italic>f <sub>D</sub></italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>), respectively &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040162-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.

Collection of I <sub>A</sub>, I <sub>D</sub>, I <sub>F</sub>, and phase contrast images began as erythrocytes landed on cells expressing fluorescent chimeras. Image sets were recorded within 2 s at 30-s intervals. Following acquisition of complete time series, shade/bias-corrected I <sub>A</sub>, I <sub>D</sub>, and I <sub>F</sub> images were used to calculate the FRET stoichiometry images E <sub>A</sub>, E <sub>D</sub>, and R <sub>M</sub>. The calculated images represent: the fraction of YFP chimera <italic>(f <sub>A</sub>) </italic> in complex times the characteristic FRET efficiency (E <sub>C</sub>) of the complex (E <sub>A</sub>), the fraction of CFP chimera in complex <italic>(f <sub>D</sub>) </italic> times E <sub>C</sub> (E <sub>D</sub>), or the molar ratio of YFP chimera to CFP chimera (R <sub>M</sub>) at each pixel in the image. Note that the value of E <sub>C</sub> for the ARF&#x02013;CFP&#x02013;YFP&#x02013;NGAT interaction is not required for calculation of E <sub>A</sub>, E <sub>D</sub>, and R <sub>M</sub>. </p><p>To measure the BFA-mediated disruption of ARF1 activation at the Golgi complex, I <sub>A</sub>, I <sub>D</sub>, I <sub>F</sub>, and phase contrast images of RAW264.7 macrophages expressing both ARF1-CFP and YFP-NGAT were collected before the addition of BFA (final concentration of 5 &#x003bc;M). Following the addition of toxin, fluorescence and phase contrast images were collected at 30-s intervals. Image processing to obtain the E <sub>A</sub>, E <sub>D</sub>, and R <sub>M</sub> images was performed as described above. To define the Golgi compartment, a manual threshold was applied to the high intensity region in the shade/bias-corrected I <sub>D</sub> image. This threshold was used to create a binary mask; the mask was applied to the E <sub>A</sub>, E <sub>D</sub>, and R <sub>M</sub> images to define the region of measurement. Metamorph's Integrated Morphometry Analysis was used to measure the area and average gray value of the resulting region in the masked E <sub>A</sub>, E <sub>D</sub>, and R <sub>M</sub> images at each time point. As BFA reduced the Golgi network, the region of high intensity used to make measurements decreased in size. After &#x002dc;15&#x02013;20 min in 50 &#x003bc;M BFA, the measurement region could no longer be defined due to redistribution of ARF1-CFP. Cells expressed uniform E <sub>D</sub> values of &#x002dc;0 at these time points. </p><p>To compare FRET values measured in cells transfected with different ARF-CFP and YFP-NGAT chimeras, the average fluorescence intensities of the masked, shade-corrected, and bias-corrected I <sub>A</sub>, I <sub>D</sub>, and I <sub>F</sub> component images for each cell were recorded into a spreadsheet. The average fluorescence values were then used to calculate E <sub>A</sub>, E <sub>D</sub>, and R <sub>M</sub> using the FRET stoichiometry equations and E <sub>AVG</sub>, the arithmetic mean of E <sub>A</sub> and E <sub>D</sub>. Because E <sub>A</sub> and E <sub>D</sub> are sensitive to the amount of acceptor and donor available for incorporation into FRET complexes, these values are dependent on the value of R <sub>M</sub>; while E <sub>A</sub> is suppressed in cells that express a large excess of YFP relative to CFP, E <sub>D</sub> is increased in cells with an overabundance of acceptor. E <sub>AVG</sub> serves as a weighted average that adjusts for varying levels of donor and acceptor in a population of cells, and was therefore used to compare FRET values in cells that express variable relative amounts of different CFP and YFP chimeras. The relationships between E <sub>A</sub>, E <sub>D</sub>, E <sub>AVG</sub>, and R <sub>M</sub> can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>.

For R <sub>M</sub> values below 1, the CFP donor is in excess, while for R <sub>M</sub> values above 1, the YFP acceptor is the excess binding partner. For low R <sub>M</sub> values, more acceptors are able to form complex with the excess donors, leading to relatively higher E <sub>A</sub> values; however, the lack of sufficient acceptors reduces the fraction of donors that can enter into FRET complexes and reduces E <sub>D</sub>.

ARF1-CFP and YFP-NGAT were enriched at the Golgi complex in transfected RAW264.7 macrophages. BFA rapidly disintegrated the Golgi network (shrinking region outlined in red in the ARF1-CFP panels), and the fluorescent markers redistributed to the cytosol. Color bars to the right of the E <sub>D</sub> and R <sub>M</sub> panels indicate the magnitude of E <sub>D</sub> expressed as a percent, and the molar ratio of YFP-NGAT/ARF1-CFP, respectively. The values to the right of the color bar indicate the values of the pixel colors at the ends of the scale. For each image series and video presented in this work, all images within a single time series are identically scaled and directly comparable. Note that in the region of the Golgi apparatus, ARF1-CFP was present at an &#x002dc;2.5-fold molar excess relative to YFP-NGAT. YFP-NGAT localization to the Golgi apparatus was mediated by ARF1-GTP binding as indicated by the high E <sub>D</sub> values at the Golgi. The FRET-based detection of ARF1-activation rapidly decreased after the addition of BFA; nearly all ARF1 activation was blocked within &#x002dc;5 minutes of the addition of BFA. The scale bar located in the upper right of the CFP time series is 6 &#x003bc;m. </p><p>(B) The decrease in E <sub>D</sub> signals at the Golgi apparatus corresponding to loss of active ARF1 was quantified. An inclusive threshold was used to generate regions (as shown in the ARF1-CFP panels above) and to mask the E <sub>D</sub> image to measure the Golgi-associated activation of ARF1 after BFA addition.

The dominant-negative ARF-CFP chimeras produced low, but detectable, FRET signals when co-expressed with YFP-NGAT. Conversely, co-expression of the constitutively active ARF1(Q71L)-CFP or ARF6(Q67L)-CFP chimeras with YFP-NGAT produced elevated FRET signals compared with wild-type ARF-CFP chimeras. ARF1(Q71L)-CFP and YFP-NGAT generated slightly elevated FRET signals at the Golgi apparatus. The bar plots to the right of the black line are FRET signals measured when the listed ARF-CFP chimera was co-expressed with YFP-NGAT(A193T, N194Y), an NGAT molecule with reduced ARF-GTP binding affinity. Neither the wild-type nor constitutively activated ARF-CFP chimeras generated high FRET signals when co-expressed with YFP-NGAT(A193T, N194Y). Measurements for each FRET pair are the average from at least 25 cells, and error bars represent plus/minus the standard deviation. </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040162.g001"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0040162-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Ratiometric Microscopy of Arf6-YFP, ARF1-YFP, and YFP-NGAT at the Phagosome</title><p>Ratiometric fluorescence microscopy of macrophages expressing ARF1-YFP, ARF6-YFP, or YFP-NGAT chimeras with soluble CFP during phagocytosis.</p><p>(A, C, and E) Phase contrast (PC) and ratiometric images of macrophages during the phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes.
