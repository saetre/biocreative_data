In this manuscript, we examined the effect of UL20 mutations on the coordinate transport and Trans Golgi Network (TGN) localization of UL20p and gK, virus-induced cell fusion and infectious virus production. Deletion of 18 amino acids from the UL20p carboxyl terminus (UL20 mutant 204t) inhibited intracellular transport and cell-surface expression of both gK and UL20, resulting in accumulation of UL20p and gK in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in agreement with the inability of 204t to complement UL20-null virus replication and virus-induced cell fusion. In contrast, less severe carboxyl terminal deletions of either 11 or six amino acids (UL20 mutants 211t and 216t, respectively) allowed efficient UL20p and gK intracellular transport, cell-surface expression and TGN colocalization. However, while both 211t and 216t failed to complement for infectious virus production, 216t complemented for virus-induced cell fusion, but 211t did not. These results indicated that the carboxyl terminal six amino acids of UL20p were crucial for infectious virus production, but not involved in intracellular localization of UL20p/gK and concomitant virus-induced cell fusion. In the amino terminus of UL20, UL20p mutants were produced changing one or both of the Y38 and Y49 residues found within putative phosphorylation sites. UL20p tyrosine-modified mutants with both tyrosine residues changed enabled efficient intracellular transport and TGN localization of UL20p and gK, but failed to complement for either infectious virus production, or virus-induced cell fusion. These results show that UL20p functions in cytoplasmic envelopment are separable from UL20 functions in UL20p intracellular transport, cell surface expression and virus-induced cell fusion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) specify at least eleven virus-specified glycoproteins, as well as several non-glycosylated membrane associated proteins, most of which play important roles in multiple membrane fusion events during virus entry and intracellular virion morphogenesis and egress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Spread of infectious virus occurs either by release of virions to extracellular spaces or through virus-induced cell-to-cell fusion. In vivo, the latter mechanism allows for virus spread without exposing virions to extracellular spaces containing neutralizing antibodies. Mutations that cause extensive virus-induced cell fusion predominantly arise in four genes of the HSV genome: the UL20 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the UL24 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the UL27 gene encoding glycoprotein B (gB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and the UL53 gene coding for glycoprotein K (gK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Of these four membrane associated proteins, only UL20 and gK are absolutely essential for the intracellular envelopment and transport of virions to extracellular spaces in all cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The most prevalent model for morphogenesis and egress of infectious herpes virions includes sequential de-envelopment and re-envelopment steps in transit to extracellular spaces: a) primary envelopment by budding of capsids assembled in the nuclei through the inner nuclear leaflet leading to the production of enveloped virions within perinuclear spaces; b) de-envelopment by fusion of viral envelopes with the outer nuclear leaflet leading to the accumulation of unenveloped capsids in the cytoplasm; c) assembly of sets of tegument proteins on the cytoplasmic capsids, as well as potentially on vesicle sites to be used for cytoplasmic envelopment; d) re-envelopment of cytoplasmic tegumented capsids into TGN-derived vesicles. This final event in cytoplasmic virion envelopment is thought to be largely mediated by interactions between tegument proteins and cytoplasmic portions of viral glycoproteins embedded within the TGN-derived membranes. Cytoplasmically enveloped viruses are thought to be transported to extracellular spaces within Golgi or TGN-derived vesicles (reviewed in: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]).</p><p>The UL20 gene encodes a 222 amino acid non-glycosylated transmembrane protein that is conserved by all alphaherpesviruses. The UL20p is a structural component of extracellular enveloped virions and it is expressed in infected cells assuming a predominantly perinuclear and cytoplasmic distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. An initial report indicated that partial deletion of the UL20 gene resulted in perinuclear accumulation of capsids indicating that the UL20 gene functioned, most likely, in the de-envelopment of enveloped virions found within perinuclear spaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, we showed previously that a precise deletion of the UL20 gene revealed that the UL20 gene strictly functioned in cytoplasmic envelopment of capsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Importantly, syncytial mutations in either gB or gK failed to cause fusion in the absence of the UL20 gene, indicating that the UL20 protein was essential for virus-induced cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, we showed that UL20 is required for cell-surface expression of gK and TGN localization, suggesting a functional interdependence between gK and UL20 for virus egress and cell-to-cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Recently, we delineated via site-directed mutagenesis the functional domains of UL20p involved in infectious virus production and virus-induced cell fusion. Importantly, we showed that both amino and carboxyl terminal portions of UL20p, which are predicted to lie within the cytoplasmic side of cellular membranes, function both in cytoplasmic virion envelopment and virus-induced cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In this manuscript, we show that the amino and carboxyl termini of UL20p contain distinct domains that function in infectious virion production and intracellular gK/UL20 transport.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mutagenesis of HSV-1 UL20</title><p>Previously, we reported on the construction and characterization of a panel of 31 mutations within the UL20 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These mutations included: 1) cluster-to-alanine mutants in which a cluster of proximal amino acids were changed to alanine residues; 2) single amino acid replacement mutants within alanine cluster regions; 3) carboxyl terminal truncations of UL20p. Two additional double mutants where constructed for the present study. UL20 mutant CL38 &#x02013; CL49 combined the two cluster mutations targeting the two putative phosphorylation sites in the amino terminus of UL20p. Similarly, the Y38A &#x02013; Y49A double mutant combined the two specific tyrosine modifications without altering adjacent amino acids. In addition, UL20 mutants CL2, CL61, Y38A, and Y117A, which were not reported previously, were included in these investigations. All UL20 mutants were tested for their ability to complement UL20-null infectious virus production, as well as either gB or gK-mediated virus-induced cell fusion having the gBsyn3, or gKsyn1 mutation, respectively. The mutated amino acids for each type of mutation included in this study are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Complementation experiments involved transfection of Vero cells with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant UL20 genes, followed by infection with the UL20-null virus as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and described in Materials and Methods. A complementation ratio was calculated for each mutant UL20 plasmid as a percent ratio to complementation levels provided by the wild-type UL20 gene. The UL20 wild-type gene effectively complemented UL20-null virus infectious virus production, while the UL20 mutants targeted in this study failed to complement the UL20-null virus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Furthermore, a panel of 31 different UL20 mutants revealed that UL20 domains that functioned in infectious virus production segregated from those that functioned in virus-induced cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The panel of UL20 mutants shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> was tested for the ability to complement UL20-null viruses containing syncytial mutations in either gB (syn3) or gK (syn1) for virus-induced cell fusion as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Briefly, confluent Vero monolayers were transfected with plasmids encoding either wild type or mutant UL20p, and subsequently infected with either &#x00394;20 gKsyn1 or &#x00394;20 gBsyn3 viruses. Viral plaques appearing as larger plaques in a background of uniformelly small UL20-null viral plaques were stained with anti-HSV-1 polyclonal antibody as described in Materials and Methods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In this complementation assay, 20&#x02013;40% of all viral plaques appeared considerably larger than the uniformly small UL20-null plaques (not shown). The CL2 UL20 mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and Y117A (not shown) complemented effectively both gB and gK-mediated virus-induced cell fusion, as evidenced by the appearance of viral plaques similar in size to those produced by the wild-type UL20 gene. As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and as shown here, the CL49 and Y49A mutations partially complemented virus spread and virus-induced cell fusion caused by syncytial mutations in either gB or gK, as evidenced by the production of visibly larger than the UL20-null viral plaques (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The CL38, Y38A, and the double mutants CL38-CL39 and Y38A-Y39A failed to complement for either infectious virus production or virus spread, as evidenced by the appearance of very small viral plaques (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

We showed previously that in the absence of UL20p, gK was localized exclusively to reticular-like compartments and was absent from the Golgi and TGN. A similar pattern was detected for UL20p in the absence of gK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In contrast, coexpression of gK and UL20p significantly altered the distribution pattern of both gK and UL20p with UL20p and gK colocalized in intracellular compartments that stained for the TGN marker TGN46. Overall, these results showed that gK and UL20p intracellular transport and TGN localization were functionally interdependent strongly suggesting that gK and UL20p physically interacted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Similar confocal colocalization assays were performed to test the ability of each UL20 mutant to facilitate transport and colocalization with gK. The CL38-CL49, Y38-Y49, Y38A and Y49A UL20 mutants produced similar patterns to those of the wild-type UL20 gene, since they effectively colocalized with gK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>: rows 1&#x02013;3). In addition, gK was colocalized with TGN46 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>: rows 4&#x02013;6), indicating that these UL20 mutations did not affect intracellular transport and TGN colocalization of the mutant UL20ps with gK. Similar assays were performed for the UL20p carboxyl terminal truncations 216t, 211t, and 204t (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Both 216t and 211t UL20 truncations enabled efficient colocalization of UL20 and gK in TGN compartments, while the 204t UL20 truncation failed to transport and colocalize with gK in TGN compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

We show here that the inability to complement for virus-induced cell fusion was not due to defects in intracellular transport and TGN localization, because 216t, as well as both 204t and 211t were efficiently transported to cell-surfaces and co-localized with gK in TGN-labeled membranes. Therefore, intracellular transport, cell-surface expression and TGN localization of UL20p and gK are not sufficient for infectious virus production. Based on these results, we can conclude that the carboxyl terminal six amino acids of UL20p function exclusively in intracellular virion envelopment and infectious virus production, while the UL20p domain spanning amino acids 204&#x02013;211is important for both intracellular transport and virus-induced cell fusion.</p><p>Domain I is the largest domain (63 aa) and it includes stretches of acidic amino acid (D, E) clusters, which could form electrostatic interactions with other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

The acidic cluster motifs appear to direct TGN localization by binding to a cellular connector protein, PACS-1, which connects the glycoproteins to the AP-1 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], while the YXX&#x003a6; motif binds adaptor proteins directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The YXX&#x003a6; (YSRL) amino acid sequence overlapping the CL49 mutated sequence, is conserved in HSV-1, HSV-2, and cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 and 2, but not in varicella zoster (VZV) or pseurodabies virus (PRV) (not shown). Mutagenesis of the Y residue of a YXX&#x003a6;(YTKI) motif within gK domain IV, shown to lie in the cytoplasmic side of membranes, produced a gK-null phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Similarly, mutagenesis of either Y38 or Y49, or both residues resulted in loss of infectious virus production, while the UL20p mutants carrying either mutation or a combination of both mutations allowed efficient intracellular transport and TGN localization. This result is similar to the results obtained with the UL20p carboxyl terminal domains and suggests that amino terminal domains of UL20p that function in cytoplasmic virion envelopment can be functionally separated from those that function in UL20p and gK intracellular transport and TGN localization. Interestingly, the Y49A mutant allowed some virus-induced cell fusion caused by either the gBsyn3 or gKsyn1 mutation suggesting that the requirement of this residue for infectious virus production is more stringent that the requirement for virus-induced cell fusion.</p><p>We reported previously that the Y49A, CL49 and 216t mutant viruses produced syncytial plaques, although their ultrastructural phenotypes seemed to be similar to that of the UL20-null virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We show here these phenotypes are consistent with the findings that these UL20p mutations allowed efficient intracellular transport, cell-surface expression and TGN localization. However, mutagenesis of both Y38 and Y49 amino acid residues in the amino terminus of UL20p, inhibited virus-induced cell fusion, while allowing efficient intracellular transport and TGN localization. This result suggests that the Y38 and Y49 residues together play important roles in cytoplasmic virus envelopment, but they are not required for proper UL20p/gK intracellular transport. The Y38A mutation seemed to affect both virion production and virus-induced cell fusion, although the Y49A mutation appeared to inhibit virion production, but allowed some cell fusion to occur. As is the case with the carboxyl terminus of UL20p discussed earlier, these results suggest that the amino terminus of UL20p contains functionally separable domains involved in cytoplasmic virion envelopment and intracellular glycoprotein transport. Furthermore, the Y49A mutation allowed some virus-induced cell fusion, but not infectious virus production to occur suggesting that domains within the UL20p amino-terminus involved in cytoplasmic virion envelopment may be functionally separated from domains functioning in UL20p/gK intracellular transport and virus-induced cell fusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results show that UL20p domains required for UL20p and gK intracellular transport and TGN localization can be functionally segregated from domains involved in infectious virus production and virus-induced cell fusion. The results suggest that virus-induced cell fusion mechanisms are not required for cytoplasmic virion envelopment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD).
