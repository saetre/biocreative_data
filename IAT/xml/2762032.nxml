Little is known regarding PKC biological functions in <italic>Leishmania sp.</italic> during parasite-macrophage interaction. PKC-like enzyme was first identified in homogenates and membrane fraction of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> stationary promastigotes by immunoblot. PKC-like enzyme activity was then detected in cell homogenates but also on intact promastigotes showing for the first time the presence of an ecto-PKC dependent on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/phosphatidylserine for activation. This ecto-PKC was activated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and inhibited by RO-32-0432, a selective PKC&#x003b1;&#x003b2;<sub>I</sub>&#x003b5; bisindolylmaleimide inhibitor. Interestingly, the <italic>Leishmania</italic> PKC- activity was higher in the infective stationary than in non-infective logarithmic stage. Then, promastigotes at different stages of time proliferation curve were used in order to identify the role of PKC-like during macrophage invasion. After attachment to macrophages, PKC-like is over-expressed in promastigotes at the 6<sup>th</sup> culture day but also at the 4<sup>th</sup> day of culture corresponding to the maximal infection capacity. An antibody microarray for MAPK and PKC corroborate the <italic>Leishmania</italic> PKC-like over-expression during contact with macrophages. Pretreatment with RO-32-0432 inhibitor reduced the number of infected macrophages and the parasite burden. These data suggest for the first time a direct link between PKC expression level and infectivity, and provide evidence that PKC-like plays a critical role in attachment and in the internalization steps involved in the invasion process.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leishmaniasis is a public health problem throughout most of the tropical and subtropical world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Murray1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-BarretodeSouza1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and is a growing concern in war-torn countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Seaman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Korzeniewski1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

There is therefore an urgent need to identify new drug targets.</p><p><italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites have a complex life cycle that renders the therapeutic approaches very difficult. Parasites move from the sandfly midgut up to the mouthparts, then into the human host where they invade macrophages and live within a phagolyzosoma. During infection of mammalian host, <italic>Leishmania</italic> require adaptive changes to ensure internalization and proliferation into macrophages. During internalization some components of the parasite cell surface such as gp63 and LPG are over-expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Brittingham1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-McGwire1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The intermediate steps of signal transduction pathways mediating these changes are unknown. With the recent publication of the complete genome sequence of <italic>Leishmania major</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Ivens1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, a vast amount of new information will allow more comprehensive identification of parasite-specific proteins, among them protein kinases, and their biological significance.</p><p>The recent genomic analysis of <italic>Leishmania major</italic> shows that they possess numerous molecules suspected to bind protein kinases (PK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Myler1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. By comparing mammalian- and trypanosomatid-PKs, this analysis clearly indicates that PK phosphorylation is a key mechanism for the regulation of parasite processes. The understanding of the structure and function of mammalian PK is now used to elucidate the function of <italic>Leishmania</italic> homologues. To achieve this requires identification of structures and mechanisms that are either unique to <italic>Leishmania</italic> or sufficiently different to allow the identification of specific target molecules. Some of these proteins and metabolic pathways unique to <italic>Leishmania</italic> are under investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-LePape1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

PK distribution differs between <italic>Leishmania</italic> and mammalian cells. First, <italic>Leishmania</italic> completely lacks tyrosine kinases (TK) and tyrosine kinase-like (TKL).

In fact, changes in phosphoprotein abundance in <italic>Leishmania</italic> have been documented throughout their life cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Lester1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Hermoso2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, but their significance for parasite differentiation and virulence remains unclear to date. The recent bioinformatics analyses of the <italic>L. major</italic> genome did not clearly identify a PKC orthologue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Parsons1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, several lines of evidence suggest that a <italic>Leishmania</italic> PKC-like activity is present in promastigotes and its biological significance is different from the mammalian counterpart. First, protein phosphorylation increases during <italic>Leishmania</italic> proliferation, differentiation and interaction with host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Lester1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Hermoso2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, proteomic analyses of <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes by using protein kinase inhibitors and activators such as staurosporine, H7, sphingosine and TPA predicted the presence of a PKC-like activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Banerjee1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, <italic>Leishmania</italic> PKC-like have been associated with biological properties such as interaction with host macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-VannierSantos1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and maintenance of ion homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-deAlmeidaAmaral1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we investigated whether <italic>Leishmania</italic> PKC-like could participate during invasion of host macrophages.</p><p>Similar to mammalian cells, stationary <italic>L. mexicana</italic> promastigotes present a soluble and a membrane-bound form of enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Epand1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Using a monoclonal antibody recognizing an epitope located within the amino acid sequence 296&#x02013;317 at the hinge region of PKC, immunoblot analysis showed that levels of PKC are more important in plasma membrane compared to promastigote homogenates. The putative presence of an ecto-PKC was further investigated by measuring the phosphorylation by intact promastigotes of a synthetic PKC pseudosubstrate in the presence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and phosphatidylserine. We showed here the first evidence that an ecto-PKC-like activity is present in surface membrane of <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>L. infantum</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic> promastigotes. This enzyme activity was dose-dependently inhibited by RO-32-0432, a specific inhibitor of the bisindolylmaleimide family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Birchall1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and increased by the PMA activator. These results are in contrast to the first biochemical studies that showed inhibition of substrate phosphorylation by using PKC inhibitors such as sphingosine, currently questioned because of their poor selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Merritt1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our results are in accordance with several studies that demonstrated the presence and activity of membrane externally PK on <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes that is capable of phosphorylating endogenous membrane substrates and foreign proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Vieira1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> PKC, the activity of PK is Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/phophatidylserine-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Keith1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Gomez1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes, a cyclic-nucleotide-independent protein kinase has been characterized in the outer surface of the parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Banerjee1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, <italic>L. mexicana</italic> ecto-PKC detected in this work has different requirements for activity.</p><p>In a second part of our work, we investigated the possible changes in PKC activity and expression during the time proliferation curve with a particular attention to the infective stationary stage. Our results indicated an higher ecto-PKC activity in infective stationary stage. Other studies have been reported that <italic>Leishmania</italic> extracellular protein phosphorylation increased during parasite development. We provide also the first evidence of PKC-like level increase during proliferation with a higher PKC expression at the 6<sup>th</sup> day. Expression of PKC can be induced in all stages of the time proliferation curve after a brief pretreatment with phorbol esters such as PMA. Protein phosphorylation by PKC during cell growth was previously demonstrated for other protozoan parasites such as <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> and <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Keith1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Gomez1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Makioka1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this PKC expression increase was not strictly correlated with the promastigote infective capacity. Indeed, as in non-infective logarithmic parasites, PKC expression of promastigotes harvested in the early infective stationary growth phase (4<sup>th</sup> day) was very low whereas on this day, the promastigotes are fully infective. It is important to note that during the attachment to BALB/c macrophages, the first step for invasion, PKC over-expression was induced in these early stationary promastigotes (4<sup>th</sup> day).</p><p>Next we examined the capacity of pre-treated parasites with RO-32-0432 to invade host cells. We first demonstrated that <italic>L. mexicana</italic> PKC modulates the parasite internalization and replication into BALB/c macrophages. Another research group evidenced that pre-treatment with a PKC&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3; inhibitor (RO31-8220) reduces both parasite infectivity and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-RobertGangneux1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the pre-treatment of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> tachyzoites with 500 nM PMA enhances parasite infectivity. The TPA pre-treatment of <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes before parasite-macrophage interaction enhances invasion process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-VannierSantos1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The role of ecto-PKC during differentiation from promastigote to amastigote is a boundary that has never been clearly established. An increase of protein phosphorylation during the transition promastigote to axenic amastigotes was the first observation supporting the idea that protein kinases are presented into the two stages of <italic>Leishmania</italic> cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Hermoso2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Doyle1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Banerjee2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance only one ecto-serine/threonine protein kinase have been characterized in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, the ecto-casein kinase 1, LCK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-SacerdotiSierra1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It is expressed in all the stages of the life cycle, enhanced when switches to amastigote form. These studies showed not evidence that LCK1 activity was related to PKA or PKC. Activators and inhibitors of these enzymes had no significant effect on the phosphorylation of exogenous or endogenous LCK1 substrates.</p><p>More recently other laboratories have proposed that the melting down of the flagellum during promastigote differentiation into amastigotes, is a process similar to autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Besteiro1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. This transition seems to be regulated by coordinated action of protein kinases and phosphatases. In the light of our results, the ecto-PKC over-expression during macrophage contact might provide some clues regarding a potential preadaptation of parasite for survival within the macrophage.</p><p>Using antibodies specific to mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and PKCs in a microarray approach, we assessed the expression changes of promastigotes proteins associated with macrophage attachment. The PKC-like over-expression was confirmed by this method. SKK2 (MKK3, MEK3, SAPKK2), a stress activating protein kinase kinase 2 was also over-expressed. Two other proteins, SAPK3 (p38&#x003b3;) and serine-threonine protein phosphatase 2C&#x003b1;&#x003b2;, showed less expression changes. These results let to think these MAPKK and MAPK homologues in <italic>Leishmania</italic> also participated during the attachment process.</p><p>In <italic>Leishmania</italic>, MAPK-like kinases have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Wiese1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Wiese2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, and their significance in parasite flagellar morphology, virulence and survival has been studied in genetic null mutant studies. We note with interest a previous work showing the presence of a conserved MAPK kinase kinase displaying sequence homology with the mammalian SKKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Wiese1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. This kinase designated LmxMKK, activates LmxMPK3 during the expression of flagellar components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Erdmann1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. It could also be that this MKK homologue regulates other promastigote functions during the attachment to host cells.</p><p>According to the central residue of the activation lip TXY motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Kultz1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, the TPY and TGY motifs are typical for stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) like p38. In <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome there are no typical SAPKs encoded with TPY and TGY motifs. However, two MAPK, LmxMPK4 and LmxMPK12 carrying a TQY motif could play a role of SAPKs in <italic>L. mexicana</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Wiese2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PKC-like among an ecto-PKC is important during <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigote development through a stage-differential expression. These data suggest for the first time a direct link between PKC expression level and infectivity and provide evidence that this PKC-like plays a critical role in the attachment and in internalization steps of the invasion process. We hypothesize that, as a consequence of macrophage attachment, the PKC-like is over-expressed in order to phosphorylate other downstream signaling proteins such as SKK2-like and SAPK-like proteins. A similar pathway has been characterized in cancer models demonstrating a direct link between PKC&#x003b1;-regulated invasion in human carcinoma cells and p38 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Hsieh1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is important to note that the detection of several specific binding proteins with the microarray system let to predict other MAPK and PKCs with conserved domains compared to mammalian homologues. However, due to limitations associated to low expression levels in physiological conditions and the absence of specific antibodies, the real significance of these proteins remain to be confirmed genetic studies.</p><p>With the recent technological advances in the analysis of specific <italic>Leishmania</italic> proteins and their functions, new opportunities for drug development became possible. Hence, there seems to be welcome change in the attitude of pharmaceutical industry away from a strictly profit-oriented approach to drug development and towards a greater pursuit of drugs against nonprofitable diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007581-Herrling1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

The key role of <italic>Leishmania</italic>-PKC in the invasion process suggests that this enzyme could be a relevant therapeutic target for new anti-<italic>Leishmania</italic> drugs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Julio Barrera for suggestions and reading of the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0007581-Murray1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>HW</given-names></name><name><surname>Berman</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>Saravia</surname><given-names>NG</given-names></name></person-group><year>2005</year><article-title>Advances in leishmaniasis.</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>366</volume><fpage>1561</fpage><lpage>1577</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16257344</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0007581-BarretodeSouza1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barreto-de-Souza</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Pacheco</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Castro-Faria-Neto</surname><given-names>HC</given-names></name><name><surname>Bozza</surname><given-names>PT</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2006</year><article-title>Increased Leishmania replication in HIV-1-infected macrophages is mediated by tat protein through cyclooxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 synthesis.</article-title><source>J Infect Dis</source><volume>194</volume><fpage>846</fpage><lpage>854</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16941353</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0007581-Seaman1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seaman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Mercer</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Sondorp</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><year>1996</year><article-title>The epidemic of visceral leishmaniasis in western Upper Nile, southern Sudan: course and impact from 1984 to 1994.</article-title><source>Int J Epidemiol</source><volume>25</volume><fpage>862</fpage><lpage>871</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8921468</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0007581-Reithinger1"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Reithinger</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohsen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Aadil</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Sidiqi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Erasmus</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2003</year><article-title>Anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, Kabul, Afghanistan.</article-title><source>Emerg Infect Dis</source><volume>9</volume><fpage>727</fpage><lpage>729</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12781016</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0007581-Desjeux1"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Desjeux</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><year>2004</year><article-title>Leishmaniasis: current situation and new perspectives.</article-title><source>Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis</source><volume>27</volume><fpage>305</fpage><lpage>318</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15225981</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0007581-Korzeniewski1"><label>6</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Korzeniewski</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Olszanski</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><year>2004</year><article-title>Leishmaniasis among soldiers of stabilization forces in Iraq.
