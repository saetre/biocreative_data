We have previously identified a double homeobox gene (<italic>DUX4</italic>) within each <italic>D4Z4</italic> unit that encodes a transcription factor expressed in FSHD but not control myoblasts. DUX4 and its target genes contribute to the global dysregulation of gene expression observed in FSHD. We have now characterized the homologous <italic>DUX4c</italic> gene mapped 42 kb centromeric of the D4Z4 repeat array. It encodes a 47-kDa protein with a double homeodomain identical to DUX4 but divergent in the carboxyl-terminal region. DUX4c was detected in primary myoblast extracts by Western blot with a specific antiserum, and was induced upon differentiation. The protein was increased about 2-fold in FSHD versus control myotubes but reached 2-10-fold induction in FSHD muscle biopsies. We have shown by Western blot and by a DNA-binding assay that DUX4c over-expression induced the MYF5 myogenic regulator and its DNA-binding activity. DUX4c might stabilize the MYF5 protein as we detected their interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. In keeping with the known role of Myf5 in myoblast accumulation during mouse muscle regeneration DUX4c over-expression activated proliferation of human primary myoblasts and inhibited their differentiation. Altogether, these results suggested that DUX4c could be involved in muscle regeneration and that changes in its expression could contribute to the FSHD pathology.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy 1A (FSHD1A, OMIM #158900) is the third most frequent hereditary disease of muscle, affecting one individual in 20,000 and is associated with contractions of a repeat array in the subtelomeric 4q35 region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007482-Hewitt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007482-Wijmenga1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, in the present report, we observed a dose-dependent induction of the Myf5 protein as well in human TE671 as in mouse C2C12 cells expressing DUX4c. In addition, we found an interaction between DUX4c and Myf5 that might lead to a stabilisation of the later protein.

The DMD biopsies used in the present study indeed contained newly formed fibres still presenting centrally located nuclei (data not shown). The DUX4c up-regulation in the DMD biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007482-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) could be related to the increased satellite cell proliferation in comparison to control muscles where satellite cells were quiescent. In keeping with this idea, no difference in DUX4c expression was found between DMD and control myoblasts that were both derived from activated satellite cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007482-g003">Fig 3E</xref>). In contrast to FSHD, DMD muscles do not present D4Z4 contraction (see Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007482.s004">Table S2</xref>) therefore DUX4c up-regulation could only be related to increased muscle regeneration.</p><p>The up-regulation of DUX4c expression upon myoblast differentiation and its inhibitory effect on this very process appear contradictory.

The DUX4c protein sequence was derived from pSK-DUX4c (integrating variations mentioned in GenBank accession no. AY500824) and the DUX4 protein from GenBank #AF117653. The identical double homeodomains are boxed. The arrows indicate polymorphic residues: either valine or isoleucine at position 229 in both DUX4c and DUX4; either alanine or proline at position 272 in DUX4c, but only proline in DUX4. The peptide used to generate a specific rabbit antiserum against DUX4c is underlined.</p><p>(2.56 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007482.s006.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007482.s007"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Downregulation of DUX4c expression by a RNA silencing.
