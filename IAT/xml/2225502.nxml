The rats were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, and a midline incision was made to expose the uterine horns.

After this expansion, an aliquot of cells was plated onto both untreated tissue-culture dishes (Falcon) and glass-bottom chamber slides (Lab Tek II, Nalgene Nunc International, Rochester, NY) for electrophysiological recording and immunocytochemical staining, respectively. Thus, both sets of experiments were performed on cells from the same culture. In initial trial experiments, some dishes and slides were coated with 0.1 to 1 mg/ml of either poly-L-lysine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or poly-L-ornithine (Sigma).

We have demonstrated the expression of two different voltage-gated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents, the delayed rectifier and the A-type. Moreover, we have identified two K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels that may be associated with these currents, namely Kv 2.1 and 4.3.</p><p>It has long been known that voltage-gated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents occur ubiquitously in the developing nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Spitzer3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, multiple K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents have been reported in rodent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Liebau1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Cai1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Stewart1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Wang2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Piper1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> eNPC. However, unlike most of these previous studies, we have focused our attention on eNPC that did not yet express markers of terminally differentiated cells. Since cells require voltage-gated K<sup>&#x0002b; </sup>channels to proliferate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Liebau1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Pardo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Wonderlin1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Ghiani1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> it is not unreasonable to speculate that supporting proliferation is the principal function of the K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents that we have observed in undifferentiated eNPC. The other major role for K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents, namely the regulation of neuronal excitability, would not be involved in these cells as they had not made a fate choice at the time of recording. Moreover, they had not yet developed Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents capable of generating action potentials.</p><p>The rigor of these conclusions depends on several technical considerations: voltage-clamp control, antibody specificity, and the accurate identification of recorded cells. Despite careful efforts to establish full control of membrane voltage while in whole-cell recording mode, for example, great care was taken to correct for liquid-junction potential, leak currents, fast and slow capacitance, series resistance, etc., we cannot exclude the possibility of incomplete clamp in regions remote from the electrode tip. Nearly all cells that were recorded had long processes that resembled axons but were too thin to record from directly. Any voltage-dependent activity in these regions may not have been under complete voltage control and, in an unlikely instance, may have gone undetected.</p><p>The specificities and immunogens of each of the polyclonal anti-Kv antibodies that were used in this study for both immunocytochemistry and Western blotting have been well characterized by the vendor (Millipore). Moreover, the immunostaining for the Kv channels presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001604-g003">Figure 3</xref> has been reviewed by the vendor and the accuracy of the results confirmed (Lyndon M. Foster, Ph.D., Senior Manager Technical Information Services, Millipore Bioscience Division, personal communication). We further validated the specificity of the Kv antibodies that were used by preadsorbing each against its antigen, which eliminated subsequent binding by the antibody in Western blots and in immunocytochemical staining. While we cannot rule out completely non-specific binding of one or more of the antibodies used, the likelihood that such binding has confounded our results is negligible.</p><p>Our conclusions also depend upon the accurate identification of the cells in which K<sup>&#x0002b; </sup>currents were recorded. Ideally, every recorded cell would have been characterized according to type using immunocytochemical or other labeling methods. Despite previous success in this regard with primary cultured neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Lowe1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, we were unable technically to label a sufficient number of single progenitor cells after whole-cell recordings in order to characterize them according to cell type. Nevertheless, immunocytochemical staining of attached cells indicated that nearly all of the cells expressed nestin but not &#x003b2;III tubulin, GFAP, or O4. The few GFAP-positive cells, which were less than 1&#x00025; of the total number of cells available for recording, typically were located near the middle of a large cell cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001604-g002">Figure 2</xref> B). We never attempted to patch-clamp these cells because the overlapping cells in the cluster precluded visualization of the electrode tip. Furthermore, all of the individual cells from which recordings were made were located near the periphery of the cluster (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001604-g001">Figure 1</xref> C), and most appeared to be nearly identical cytologically under phase-contrast optics and immunocytochemically. There is always a chance that we recorded from a differentiated cell, but the immunocytochemical results argue that this is a not a significant possibility. Therefore, we are confident that the vast majority recordings that were made were obtained from nestin-positive, undifferentiated eNPC.</p><p>In a study comparable to the present one of Kv channel expression, Liebau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Liebau1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> identified three K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> currents, including a delayed rectifier and an A-type, and associated them with Kv 1.3, and Kv 3.1 expression in eNPC derived from the midbrain of E14.5 rat embryos. Our analyses clearly showed two K<sup>&#x0002b; </sup>current components, but we cannot rule out a third. We did not investigate Kv 1.3 expression, so we cannot comment on that observation. However, we did test for Kv 3.1b expression with immunocytochemistry and Western blotting, and detected it in adult tissue but not in eNPC.</p><p>At least two plausible reasons can be cited for the discrepancy between our observations and those of Liebau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Liebau1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> with respect to the existence of Kv 3.1 expression in eNPC. First, the sites from which eNPC were derived in our study (SVZ) and that of Liebau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Liebau1">&#x0005b;4, midbrain&#x0005d;</xref> are different, and during normal development they generate neurons with different functional roles. Secondly, in possible contrast to Liebau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Liebau1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, we incubated our cells in medium supplemented with retinoic acid-free B27 to avoid biasing the cultured eNPC toward neuronal differentiation. Moreover, while Liebau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Liebau1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> added EGF to the culture medium, we added FGF-2, which is not interchangeable with EGF, to the medium to promote cell proliferation. This difference in culture conditions and, therefore, in possible differences in the differentiation state of recorded cells may help to explain why our results and those of Liebau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Liebau1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> differ.</p><p>Can we relate channel expression to the two current components that we have described? At least 38 different voltage-gated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel genes (the Kv families) have been identified to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Gutman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, and there may be others. Given the large number of known K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, we did not attempt to explore all possible K<sup>&#x0002b; </sup>channel types. Instead we focused on six K<sup>&#x0002b; </sup>channel candidates that <italic>a priori</italic> seemed likely to be expressed in eNPC from a functional perspective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Kues1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Because Kv 2.1 (also denoted <italic>drk1</italic>) is expressed prominently in granule cells of the adult rat olfactory bulb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Hwang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, we reasoned that it might also be expressed in eNPC derived from the SVZ, as these cells are the source of granule cells for the olfactory bulb. Of the two channel types that we identified, only Kv 2.1 encodes a delayed rectifier channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Frech1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Shi1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. When expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, Kv 2.1 has considerably slower activation (&#x003c4;<sub>activation</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;13 to16 ms) kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Salinas1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Koopman1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and a somewhat smaller single-channel conductance (8 pS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Hartmann1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> than our estimates (2 ms and 30 pS, respectively). However, Kv 2.1 activation and other electrophysiological properties vary considerably depending on the expression system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Murakoshi1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and the phosphorylation state of the channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Murakoshi2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is not unexpected that the results that we report for Kv2.1 do not match precisely those reported by others for Kv2.1 expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Moreover, other K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>channel types that we have not tested, such as Kv 2.2, 5.1, 6.1, 9.1, and 9.2, have been shown to modulate the electrophysiological properties of Kv2.1 considerably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Salinas1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we conclude conservatively that Kv 2.1 is associated with the delayed rectifier current that we have recorded, but we cannot exclude the contribution of other channel types.</p><p>The Kv 4.3 channel is associated with an A-type current and is highly expressed in the olfactory bulb and other brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Serodio1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is not unreasonable to speculate that Kv 4.3 channels mediate the A-type currents that we observed. The single channel conductance that we measured in eNPC was identical, 5 pS, to the value observed in Kv 4.3 channels expressed in a mammalian cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Holmqvist1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the kinetic and voltage-dependent properties of expressed Kv 4.3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Franqueza1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Holmqvist1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Wang3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> resembled those of the A-type currents in eNPC with but one exception; although the activation threshold (approximately &#x02212;30 mV) that we determined matched the values observed in expressed channels, the voltage dependence (Va) differed. Kv4.3 electrophysiological properties are modulated by K-channel interacting proteins (KChiPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Holmqvist1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and by co-expression with other K-channel subtypes, such as Kv 4.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001604-Serodio2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore possible that these or other factors may modulate the A-type current in eNPC that we have attributed to Kv4.3.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
