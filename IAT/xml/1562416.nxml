The most studied example of these are the <italic>Hox </italic>genes which have an ancestral role in the patterning of the primary body axis and in vertebrates have adopted additional roles in a number of processes including limb and genital development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the majority of species, <italic>Hox </italic>genes are further defined by their clustered organisation in the genome. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, eight <italic>Hox </italic>genes are present in a single cluster whereas in mammals, four clusters exist of up to twelve genes on four separate chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The clustered organisation of <italic>Hox </italic>genes is crucial to their function. <italic>Hox </italic>genes show colinearity of expression where the relative position of the <italic>Hox </italic>genes along the cluster correlates with the time and domain of gene expression along the anterior -posterior axis of the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The maintenance of <italic>Hox </italic>clusters has provided a model of evolution by gene duplication, an essential source of material for the generation of novel gene function. It is predicted that, initially, newly duplicated genes are functionally redundant. Three different evolutionary outcomes exist which will resolve this redundancy. Duplicate genes can either be lost by degenerative mutations (nonfunctionalization), functionally compromised in a complementary fashion such that the duplicated genes are functionally equivalent to the single copy ancestral gene (subfunctionalisation) or acquire novel function through natural selection of beneficial mutations (neofunctionalization). <italic>Hox </italic>clusters provide evidence for all three evolutionary processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a novel homeobox gene cluster (<italic>Rhox</italic>) was discovered on the X chromosome containing 12 genes (<italic>Rhox1</italic>-<italic>12</italic>). <italic>Rhox </italic>genes are primarily expressed in reproductive tissues and placenta with additional expression domains in endodermal derived tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>Rhox5 </italic>is essential for the production and motility of sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and we have shown that <italic>Rhox4 </italic>plays an important role in the early stages of ES cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It was reported that the <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster also displays colinearity with the level and timing of expression during spermatogenesis of subsets of <italic>Rhox </italic>genes consistent with their position within specific sub-clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Interestingly, the <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster appears to be rodent specific with only two <italic>Rhox </italic>homologues identified in humans leading to speculation that the cluster is involved in the increased reproductive capacity of rodents compared to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>We describe an extensive duplication within the murine <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster consisting of eight tandem repeats of a 40 kilobase (kb) unit containing <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>potentially increasing the number of <italic>Rhox </italic>genes in this cluster to thirty-two. Transcripts have been identified for the majority of these paralogues and all but three are predicted to produce full-length proteins. Sequence and evolutionary analyses reveal significant differences in the evolutionary signatures of <italic>Rhox 2,3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>paralogues indicative of distinct selection pressures. We have performed functional studies in ES cells that strongly support a role for both <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>in embryonic stem cell biology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Genomic structure of the duplicated <italic>Rhox </italic>&#x003b1; sub-cluster</title><p>In the course of a detailed analysis of the <italic>Rhox4 </italic>gene from the mouse genome assembly, we identified multiple copies of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>Rhox3 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>spanning approximately 350 kb of the X chromosome at region A2 from position 29780 K to 30100 K. Dotplot analysis of this genomic region identified a tandem segmental duplication composed of an approximately 40 kb unit repeated eight times; six in the forward orientation (A-F) and two in reverse orientation (G&#x00026;H) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Each of these duplications contain a single copy of <italic>Rhox2, 3 and 4 </italic>with the exception of repeat F which lacks <italic>Rhox4 </italic>due to a truncation of the 3 prime end. There are therefore eight paralogues of <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox3 </italic>and seven of <italic>Rhox4 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) producing 32 <italic>Rhox </italic>genes in total. Variation exists between each repeat that is primarily due to small rearrangements and repeat element insertions, particularly long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). Outwith these features, BLAST analysis reveals greater than 95% similarity between each repeat, the majority of which is intergenic sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). From the level of similarity and the small rearrangements and repeat element insertions between the different units, one can make the hypothesis that there were several rounds of duplication with the oldest repeats being at the 3 prime end. Indeed for the two reverse repeat units at the 3 prime region it is difficult to define their boundaries accurately because of more extensive rearrangements. The organisation of this duplication is consistent with other rodent segmental duplications that are largely tandem or tightly clustered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The maintenance of orientation and spacing between the different paralogues of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, and <italic>4 </italic>suggests that it is unlikely that any of the paralogues have arisen independently of the 40 kb tandem segmental duplications.</p><p>Given such high similarity between the duplications, we sought to eliminate the possibility of improperly assembled database sequence using Southern Blot analysis. Genomic DNA from CGR8 ES cells was digested with HindIII and Asp718, two enzymes that are predicted to produce significantly different fragment sizes when probed with <italic>Rhox4 </italic>sequence spanning exon1 and intron1. The <italic>Rhox4 </italic>probe hybridises to multiple HindIII fragments of approximately 20, 13, 10 and 5 kb with Asp718 producing 23, 18, 13, 10, and 8 kb fragments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) that are consistent with the predicted sizes from the database sequence. Identical results were observed for genomic DNA isolated from the <italic>Mus musculus </italic>strains C57/Bl6, Balb/c and FVB. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from <italic>Mus domesticus </italic>and <italic>Mus spretus </italic>identified multiple fragments hybridising to <italic>Rhox4 </italic>consistent with multiple duplications of the <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster in these species. These data suggest that the database sequence represents genuine genomic duplications and are highly unlikely to be artefacts of the genomic sequence build.</p></sec><sec><title>Predicted cDNA and protein sequences encoded by duplicated <italic>Rhox </italic>genes</title><p>We analysed the gene structure and the predicted cDNA and amino acid sequence of each <italic>Rhox </italic>paralogue. The similarity between each of the duplications is manifest in the preservation of intron-exon structure between each variant of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>[see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>]. Clustal W comparison of the cDNA sequences that were predicted from repeats A-H revealed, as with the overall duplication unit similarity, greater than 95% similarity between <italic>Rhox2A-H</italic>, <italic>Rhox3A-H </italic>and <italic>Rhox4A-H </italic>[see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>]. Despite such a high similarity we were able to build up a unique nucleotide profile of each copy of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>and <italic>4 </italic>allowing them to be definitively identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, C</xref>, [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>]).</p><p>We focussed on <italic>Rhox2A-H </italic>and <italic>Rhox4A-H </italic>and used these nucleotide profiles to determine whether these paralogues were expressed. Using primer sequences common to all copies of <italic>Rhox2 </italic>or <italic>Rhox4</italic>, we cloned and sequenced RT-PCR products derived from RNA isolated from differentiating ES cells and placenta, cell types known to express <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>4</italic>. In addition, the mouse subset database of expressed sequence tags (est_mouse) was analysed for the unique nucleotide profile of each paralogue. Using both techniques, the expression of six out of eight paralogues of <italic>Rhox2 </italic>(A, B, C, D, G, H) and five out of seven paralogues of <italic>Rhox4 </italic>(A, B, D, E, H) were confirmed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, C</xref>). Translation of the predicted cDNAs for each of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, 3 and <italic>4 </italic>paralogue is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, D</xref> and [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>]. ClustalW analysis of RHOX2, 3 and 4 paralogues identifies most variation in protein sequence within the RHOX2 paralogues with RHOX3 showing the least variation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; [see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]). Both RHOX2 and RHOX4 groups have non-conservative amino acid variations within the homeodomain region including residues crucial for homeodomain packing or DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, D</xref>). Such protein sequence variation could provide functional variation between the RHOX2 and RHOX4 paralogues with, for example, changes in homeodomain sequence leading to different DNA binding characteristics. Alternatively, such changes may reflect the nonfunctionalisation of paralogues due to disrupted DNA binding. RHOX3B, D and G contain non-sense mutations that truncate the predicted proteins after 9 (B and G) or 174 (D) amino acids [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>]. These three genes are unlikely to be functional due to the absence of the homeodomain indicating that these paralogues have become pseudogenes.</p><p>These data, therefore, predicts that eight of the <italic>Rhox2</italic>, five of the <italic>Rhox3 </italic>and seven of the <italic>Rhox4 </italic>paralogues are capable of producing full-length proteins. Therefore, of the thirty-two genes in the <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster, at least twenty-nine are predicted to be functional which is over twice the number of genes present in the largest homeobox cluster identified to date in any species.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular evolution of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4</italic></title><p><italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>are in tandem alignment with each other and show some sequence similarity. However, nucleotide similarity is low; for example, <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>are approximately 65% similar and are, therefore, evolving as separate loci. Given that the paralogues present on each duplication unit arose simultaneously, this could be suggestive of different evolutionary pressures on the paralogues within each duplication unit. To test this hypothesis we calculated maximum likelihood estimates of rates of non-synonymous (<italic>dN</italic>) and synonymous substitution (<italic>dS</italic>) among alignments of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>paralogues using a codon-based model of sequence evolution. These models allowed both the analysis of branch specific ratios of the rates of <italic>dN </italic>and <italic>dS</italic>, or codon specific ratios along the sequence, following the methods proposed by Yang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] respectively. Generally, it is assumed that synonymous substitutions among lineages (genes) accumulate through a neutral or nearly neutral process, and by comparing this rate of accumulation to that for non-synonymous substitutions it is possible to ask whether the non-synonymous substitutions accumulate more (diversifying or positive selection) or less (constrained) than the neutral rate. Effectively a <italic>dN/dS </italic>rate of one is neutral, <italic>dN/dS </italic>significantly greater than one suggests positive or diversifying selection and a significant <italic>dN/dS </italic>of less than one indicates amino-acid constraint. We calculated these ratios, henceforth called &#x003c9;, for the whole gene for each lineage to ask whether particular lineages (duplicates) were evolving under positive selection and for each codon across all lineages in order to ask whether a codon was under positive selection.</p><p>The estimates of <italic>dN</italic>, <italic>dS </italic>and &#x003c9; across each set of paralogues of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>are given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Both the <italic>dN </italic>and <italic>dS </italic>rates are relatively low particularly in comparison to genome-wide estimates of divergence between <italic>Mus musculus </italic>and <italic>Rattus norvegicus </italic>confirming that these duplications are relatively recent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, there is a 10-fold difference in the synonymous substitution rates between <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox3 </italic>or <italic>Rhox4</italic>. Given that the gene paralogues were duplicated together as single genomic fragments this suggests that the rate of nucleotide change is significantly different between <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4</italic>.</p><p>To confirm that the &#x003c9; values are different between <italic>Rhox </italic>genes, we selected <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>and asked whether they are evolving differently after aligning the <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>paralogues to each other. Allowing the <italic>Rhox2 </italic>genes to have one ratio and the <italic>Rhox4 </italic>genes to have another ratio, we found that the likelihood (<italic>l</italic>) of a model with different ratios (<italic>l </italic>= -1838.04, number of parameters (np) = 31) significantly differed from a model where all the <italic>Rhox </italic>genes had the same ratio (<italic>l </italic>= -1844.17 np = 29, 2(&#x00394;<italic>l</italic>) = 12.26 p-value &#x0003c; 0.01 with df = 2). Taken together, this data shows that the <italic>Rhox </italic>loci, as part of a relatively recently duplicated genomic region, are under different evolutionary selection.</p><p>Given that there was significant variation among the <italic>Rhox </italic>loci, it seemed reasonable to test whether &#x003c9; values were the same among the individual paralogues within each of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, and <italic>4</italic>. Given a tree for each set of genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) we estimated substitution rates along each lineage. For <italic>Rhox2</italic>, the one-ratio model, which assumes the same &#x003c9; parameter for the entire tree, leads to <italic>l</italic><sub>0 </sub>= -1242.17. We performed analysis of models allowing all branches to have different &#x003c9; values and we also placed different constraints on the different branches, particularly for branches labelled A and B; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>): &#x003c9;<sub>A</sub>, &#x003c9;<sub>B</sub>, &#x003c9;<sub>0</sub>. Ratios for branches A and B (&#x003c9;<sub>A </sub>= &#x003c9;<sub>B</sub>) are significantly greater than the background ratio (2&#x00394; <italic>l </italic>= 10.32 p &#x0003c; 0.05) and also significantly greater than one. However, a model allowing all branches to vary did not significantly differ from the one ratio model.</p><p>Among the <italic>Rhox4 </italic>paralogues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) mostly non-synonymous substitutions were observed. Again, the log-likelihood difference between the one-ratio model and the free-ratio model suggests that there are no significant differences between the ratios of different branches (2&#x00394; <italic>l </italic>= 6.16, df = 10, 0.50 &#x0003c; p-value &#x0003c; 0.90). This analysis is limited as no &#x003c9; values can be calculated for certain lineages due to the absence of synonymous substitutions. For <italic>Rhox3 </italic>paralogues B, D and G have in-frame stop codons and we would expect mutations to accumulate in a neutral fashion in these paralogues if they have lost function. The comparison of the free-ratio model and the one-ratio model indicates that there are no differences among branches (2&#x00394; <italic>l </italic>= 5.33, df = 12, 0.50 &#x0003c; p-value &#x0003c; 0.90) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><p>We next tested for variable &#x003c9; among codons. The strict neutral model assumes that a proportion p<sub>0 </sub>of sites are conserved with &#x003c9; <sub>0 </sub>= 0 and a proportion <italic>p</italic><sub>1 </sub>= 1- <italic>p</italic><sub>0 </sub>are neutral with &#x003c9;<sub>1 </sub>= 1 fitting the data better than a strict one-ratio model which assumes the same ratio for all sites. The alternative model allows for variable &#x003c9; among codons, with some codons having &#x003c9;<sub>1</sub>&#x0003e; 1 (diversifying positive selection). We used a likelihood (PAML) and a bayesian approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] to test for a departure from neutrality among codons. The likelihood approach assumes no recombination (one phylogenetic history) whereas the bayesian approach allows for recombination to occur among lineages throughout the sequence (and hence, independent multiple genealogies). Using PAML, all models that allow for positively selected sites suggest existence of such sites among <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>paralogues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>). For example, the selection model (M8 in PAML) suggests that &#x02248; 9% of <italic>Rhox2 </italic>amino acid sites are under positive selection. For <italic>Rhox3</italic>, the test of variable ratios among sites (codons) suggests that no particular codon is under positive selection which is consistent with a potential set of pseudogenes. Using the bayesian approach implemented in Omegamap (see methods) similar regions and codons identified with PAML analyses above were likely to be subject to positive selection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C, D</xref>). Very different codons appear to be under positive selection in the two genes. For example, the extreme 5' coding portion of the <italic>Rhox2 </italic>appears to be under positive selection wheras the same region appears to be highly constrained in <italic>Rhox4</italic>. The complete lack of overlap in positive selection between <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>suggests that these two genes families have diverged to perform different functions. There is little evidence of recombination between paralogues (ie. Between <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4</italic>) as these genes are very different from each other. Regardless, it appears that the possible presence of gene conversion or recombination has not inhibited our ability to detect positive selection on some codons at the <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Rhox2 </italic>has a comparable function to <italic>Rhox4 </italic>in ES cells</title><p>Given the complexity of this genomic region, it is not possible to specifically delete <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>Rhox3 </italic>or <italic>Rhox4 </italic>from the genome by standard homologous recombination technology. A more complex genome engineering approach would have to be employed to delete the whole duplicated region and subsequent transgenic rescue approaches performed to assign specific functions (if any) to <italic>Rhox2, Rhox3 or Rhox4</italic>. As an alternative, and more immediate approach we have used an overexpression strategy in an attempt to compare the function of the different <italic>Rhox </italic>genes.</p><p>We had previously identified <italic>Rhox4 </italic>(<italic>Ehox</italic>), as a crucial factor in the early stages of ES cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We identified <italic>Rhox2 </italic>as the most closely related gene to <italic>Rhox4 </italic>within the <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster, so we were interested to assess whether it had a comparable function. We therefore used the same episomal expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] to directly compare the function of these two genes in this system. <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>are expressed at comparable levels in undifferentiated ES cells and are downregulated as ES cells initiate differentiation in the absence of Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (data not shown). We directly compared the effects of altering the level of expression of <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>on the self-renewal and differentiation potential of ES cells both in the presence and absence of LIF. E14/T ES cells were transfected with constructs expressing RHOX2A or RHOX4B, cultures were selected in puromycin in the presence of LIF and the numbers of resistant colonies were counted six days later (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Flow cytometry of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) transfected control cultures and the expression levels of <italic>Rhox2 </italic>anti-sense transcripts in ES cells transfected with <italic>Rhox2 </italic>anti-sense expression constructs demonstrated a very high transfection efficiency [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">Additional file 4</xref>]. We confirmed our previous findings that over-expression of RHOX4B was incompatible with the maintenance of undifferentiated ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] as indicated by the significant reduction in the number of puromycin resistant colonies. Over-expression of RHOX2A had a similar effect with virtually no colonies surviving after puromycin selection. However, we were able to maintain a pool of RHOX4B-over-expressing ES cells upon replating in LIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) whereas it proved impossible to maintain a line of ES cells over-expressing RHOX2A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This difference could either reflect slight functional differences between RHOX2A and 4B or by the differences in expression levels that are achieved using the Internal Ribosomal Entry Site- Puromycin resistance (IRES-PURO) construct. We can conclude that expression of RHOX2A or RHOX4B at a high level is incompatible with an undifferentiated ES cell phenotype possibly driving them into a differentiated cell type that has a significantly reduced viability and/or clonogenic potential.</p><p>We used constructs carrying full-length anti-sense sequence of <italic>Rhox2A </italic>and <italic>Rhox4B </italic>that have the potential to block expression of endogenous transcripts. We have observed successful knockdown of RHOX4B protein when anti-sense <italic>Rhox4B </italic>was co-transfected in COS7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and we see no reduction in RHOX4B protein when anti-sense <italic>Rhox2A </italic>is co-transfected with the <italic>Rhox4B-</italic>expressing vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Furthermore, the anti-RHOX4 antibody does not detect a band in COS7 cells transfected with <italic>Rhox2A</italic>-expressing plasmid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) so taken together these data suggest that this strategy can be effective and specific. Given the similarity between paralogues of each gene we predict that this type of anti-sense approach could knockdown all paralogues of the gene under test.</p><p><italic>Rhox4 </italic>anti-sense expression resulted in a comparable number of colonies compared to control transfections, whereas <italic>Rhox2 </italic>anti-sense expression resulted in a slight increase in the number of puromycin resistant colonies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). This could indicate that blocking RHOX2 expression using the full-length anti-sense construct conferred a survival advantage on undifferentiated ES cells and contributed to them maintaining their undifferentiated state and self-renewal capacity. The phenotype of alkaline phosphatase-stained colonies after puromycin selection and subsequent re-plating in the absence of LIF further substantiated this finding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). We had previously shown (and confirm here) that when LIF is withdrawn from ES cells expressing anti-sense <italic>Rhox4</italic>, small, undifferentiated colonies were detected but no differentiated cells were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This suggested that blocking the expression of RHOX4 inhibits ES cell differentiation even in the absence of LIF. In contrast, when LIF is withdrawn from anti-sense <italic>Rhox2 </italic>expressing cells a proportion of cells remain undifferentiated but we also observe a significant number of differentiated cells. Thus inhibiting expression of RHOX2 and RHOX4 apparently results in a partial or complete block in differentiation, respectively. A block in differentiation is also apparent in anti-sense <italic>Rhox4 </italic>expressing cells when cultured in the presence of LIF, where all colonies are alkaline phosphatase positive (stem cell) with no spontaneous differentiation observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Many spontaneously differentiating cells are observed when anti-sense <italic>Rhox2 </italic>expressing cells are cultured in LIF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), a finding that is consistent with the idea that blocking RHOX2 only partially blocks differentiation. This qualitative difference in the degree of differentiation may reflect a functional difference between RHOX2 and RHOX4 in ES cells. Alternatively, this observation could be explained by differences in the levels of sense and anti-sense expression. We can conclude however, that the levels of expression of both RHOX2 and 4 play a role in the early stages of ES cell differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified extensive tandem duplications of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>on the mouse X chromosome resulting in a total of 32 <italic>Rhox </italic>genes of which all but three are predicted to produce functional proteins. The <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster therefore, has more genes than any other homeobox cluster identified in any species. Moreover, the degree of similarity between the genomic regions and molecular evolutionary analysis of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>suggests that this represents the most recent homeobox gene duplication identified to date. Despite such a recent duplication event, <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>paralogues show evidence of positive selection in their evolutionary history suggesting a potential function for these genes. We have also identified a role for <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>in the maintenance and differentiation of ES cells supporting the biologically importance of this duplication.</p><sec><title>A mouse specific duplication of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4</italic></title><p>The lack of sequence divergence between each 40 kb duplication unit and the <italic>dS </italic>values for <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>imply that the duplication events are relatively young. We predict that the duplications occurred after the divergence of mouse and rat. The alignment of over 70,000 exons common to mouse and rat predicts a synonymous substitution rate of 0.17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] over 10-fold greater than the <italic>Rhox2 </italic>paralogues with a <italic>dS </italic>value of 0.0122 and 100-fold greater for the <italic>Rhox4 </italic>paralogues at 0.001. Obviously, the <italic>dS </italic>values are an average for all <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>paralogues and do not reflect the sequential nature of the duplication events. Nevertheless, assuming that mouse and rat diverged 16 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], a constant molecular clock would result in the relative age of the <italic>Rhox </italic>duplicates being less than one tenth the time split between mouse and rat or approximately &#x0003c;1.6 million years. However, the <italic>dS </italic>ratio is not an accurate measure of time as unequal cross-over and gene conversion events can act to alter <italic>dS </italic>values. This may be particularly relevant in a region showing such repetitive similarity.</p><p><italic>Mus spretus </italic>and <italic>Mus domesticus </italic>are predicted to have diverged from <italic>Mus musculus </italic>approximately three million and one million years ago respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The presence of multiple <italic>Rhox4 </italic>copies in <italic>Mus spretus </italic>suggests that the duplication events were well underway before the divergence of these species 3 million years ago. Preliminary Southern blot analysis using mouse specific <italic>Rhox4 </italic>probes suggest that, at most, two copies of <italic>Rhox4 </italic>exist in rat (data not shown). Moreover, we screened the rat genome (RGSC v3.4) with the highly conserved exon 3 sequence of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>to see if we could identify different paralogues of these genes as evidence for the presence of these duplications in rat. We identified a single homologue of <italic>Rhox4 </italic>on the rat X chromosome (95% similarity) but none for <italic>Rhox2 </italic>or <italic>3</italic>. By comparison the same screen in mouse identifies multiple copies with different chromosomal coordinates. Although the synonymous substitution rate and absence of <italic>Rhox </italic>paralogues in the rat do not definitively show the absence of <italic>Rhox </italic>duplicates in rat these data support our contention that the duplications are murine specific.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular evolution of the <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster</title><p>The molecular evolution analysis of all paralogues, individual paralogues and individual codons within paralogues suggests that both <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>have different degrees of diversifying selection in their evolutionary history whereas <italic>Rhox3 </italic>is evolving neutrally. An extensive analysis of single gene duplicates from a number of species reveals that duplicates typically undergo a phase of relaxed selection or even accelerated evolution at replacement sites and progressively become more constrained as they age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although we report a multiple duplication event, our data is consistent with this observation. The differences observed between the evolutionary profiles of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>could reflect a number of evolutionary and functional differences. <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>are expressed at different stages in the development of the testes and ES cell differentiation and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>is uniquely expressed in the developing and adult thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We predict that such differing biological functions for <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>will put different evolutionary constraints on these genes resulting in different evolutionary outcomes.</p><p>Despite the relatively young age of these duplications these data supports divergent selection pressures on a subset of <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>paralogues that is driving functional change. This is at odds with many other transcription factors, including <italic>Hox </italic>genes, which typically show strong evolutionary constraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, it is consistent with a function for <italic>Rhox </italic>genes in reproduction. Sexual conflict, sexual selection and sperm competition are predicted to exert a strong selective pressure driving the rapid evolution of reproductive genes including transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. For <italic>Rhox2 </italic>we identified two lineages that show significant diversifying selection in their evolutionary history. This data is indicative of a degree of neo-functionalisation for <italic>Rhox2A, D </italic>and <italic>E </italic>relative to the other <italic>Rhox2 </italic>paralogues. Within <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>4</italic>, individual codons have been identified which show evidence of positive selection. Of interest are <italic>Rhox2</italic>(132) and <italic>Rhox4</italic>(170)which translate to non-conservative substitutions within the homeobox region of these genes. Mutations within homeodomains are significant as subtle changes in DNA binding affinity could have important biological affects due to the alteration of downstream gene activation or repression. Consequently, there exists important constraint on homeodomain evolution with <italic>Rhox5 </italic>providing one of the few examples of positive selection within this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>One surprising feature of the molecular evolution of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>is the marked differences in the synonymous substitution rates. Differences in base composition, variable mutation rate and gene conversion are all mechanism by which the synonymous substitution rates could vary between genes. Studies in <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli </italic>and <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>suggest a relationship between gene expression levels and mutation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although its significance in mammals is unknown, <italic>Rhox2 </italic>is expressed 5-fold higher than <italic>Rhox4 </italic>during testis development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Moreover, if the transcriptional control elements of each gene are preserved between duplication units then so will the mechanism for variable <italic>dS </italic>values between genes. Gene conversion could be a factor in suppressing sequence variation in <italic>Rhox3 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>paralogues but not <italic>Rhox2 </italic>although, again, this would have to be consistent over all duplication units to maintain the discrepancy in <italic>dS </italic>values. Regardless of mechanism, <italic>Rhox2 </italic>paralogues show significantly more sequence variation than <italic>Rhox3 </italic>and <italic>4</italic>, which may affect the evolutionary trajectories of these genes. Regardless of whether gene conversion is contributing to the evolution of these genes, it is unlikely to affect our inferences of adaptation at this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Rhox </italic>function in ES cells</title><p>We provide experimental evidence to show that at least two genes (<italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4</italic>) within the duplicated region of the <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster play a role in the maintenance and early differentiation of ES cells. Although we used paralogues RHOX2A and RHOX4B in these studies, the similarity between the <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>Rhox4 </italic>paralogues would predict that these other paralogues would have comparable effects. Both genes are expressed in undifferentiated ES cells so we tested the effects of altering the levels of expression of RHOX2 and RHOX4 on the undifferentiated phenotype. This strategy has revealed other homeobox-containing genes, <italic>Oct4 </italic>and <italic>Nanog </italic>as key stem cell regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Increases in <italic>Oct4 </italic>expression levels in ES cells induces differentiation in a manner that is dominant over the suppressive effects of LIF and overexpression of <italic>Nanog </italic>has been shown to drive self-renewal of ES cells in the absence of LIF. We show that artificially high levels of RHOX2 or RHOX4 are incompatible with an undifferentiated ES cell phenotype either because such high levels of these proteins affect the viability of undifferentiated ES cells or because they override the effects of LIF and drive undifferentiated ES cells into a differentiated state that cannot survive. We favour the latter explanation because when we reduce the levels of RHOX4, differentiation of ES cells appears to be blocked. Reduction of RHOX2 protein increases the numbers of self-renewing colonies in the presence of LIF and, in the absence of LIF, blocking either RHOX2 or RHOX4 results in is a persistence of self-renewing stem cells that are not observed in control cultures. As mentioned, we predict that the anti-sense approach we have used to disrupt <italic>Rhox </italic>gene function is likely to affect all paralogues. A siRNA approach could extend these studies to assess the function of the individual paralogues.</p><p>Although ES cells have proven invaluable as a research tool they are not considered to be entirely equivalent to the inner cell mass tissue from which they are derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Consequently, relating the function of <italic>Rhox </italic>proteins in the <italic>in vitro </italic>ES cells system to any evolutionary analysis is inappropriate. However, RHOX4 is expressed in trophoblast stem (TS) cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>supporting a function for <italic>Rhox4 </italic>in the stem cell compartment of developing placenta that would provide selective pressure for evolutionary change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Consequently, the analysis of <italic>Rhox </italic>function in TS cells would be more applicable to molecular evolutionary data. For example, over-expression of different <italic>Rhox </italic>paralogues in TS cell cultures may help identify whether positive selection of certain paralogues or codons is associated with differences in downstream gene expression changes.</p><p>Our data suggest that the expression levels of <italic>Rhox2 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>may be crucial to their function in ES cells and this phenomenon may be applicable to other cell types in which they are expressed.

The possibility arises that the number of <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>paralogues is linked to the expression levels of these genes. The modulation of <italic>Rhox </italic>gene expression levels in ES cells and the consequent affects on ES biology will begin to address this issue.</p><p>Our studies reveal the crucial role for this duplicated region of the <italic>Rhox </italic>cluster in murine ES cell biology.

Dotplot analysis comparing repeat A to repeats B to H using the NCBI m33 mouse assembly (freeze May 27, 2004, strain C57BL/6J). Black lines represent regions of identity interspersed with LINEs (horizontal pink lines). The orientation and approximate size of each repeat unit is presented as black arrows. The relative position and orientation of <italic>Rhox1 </italic>(green lines, black arrowhead) and <italic>Rhox2</italic>, <italic>3 </italic>and <italic>4 </italic>(blue lines, white arrowhead) and Rhox5 (which is upstream of this region, black arrowhead) are shown. The X chromosome co-ordinates are provided below the dotplot. B. BLAST analysis comparing genomic sequence of each repeat to all others. LINE repeats and rearrangements were not added. Top row represents a comparison of repeat A to B-H, second row repeat B to C-H and so on. C. Southern Blot analysis. CGR8 ES cell genomic DNA digested with Asp718 (lane 1) and HindIII (lane2) and hybridised to <italic>Rhox4 </italic>exon 1 and intron 1 probe. Multiple bands can be seen with both digests (arrowed) of approximately 20, 13, 10 and 5 kb (HindIII) and 23, 18, 13, 10, and 8 kb (Asp718). <italic>Mus domesticus </italic>(lane 3) and <italic>Mus spretus </italic>(lane 4) genomic DNA digested with HindIII and hybridised to a <italic>Rhox4 </italic>exon 2 probe. Fragment sizes common to the <italic>Mus musculus </italic>(ES cells) and <italic>Mus domesticus </italic>are arrowed. Additional bands are predicted to be due to the differences between the probes used.
