How this actomyosin dynamics is dependent upon systems that provide access to ATP at phagosome microdomains has not been determined. We analyzed the role of brain-type creatine kinase (CK-B), an enzyme involved in high-energy phosphoryl transfer. We demonstrate that endogenous CK-B in macrophages is mobilized from the cytosolic pool and coaccumulates with F-actin at nascent phagosomes. Live cell imaging with XFP-tagged CK-B and &#x003b2;-actin revealed the transient and specific nature of this partitioning process. Overexpression of a catalytic dead CK-B or CK-specific cyclocreatine inhibition caused a significant reduction of actin accumulation in the phagocytic cup area, and reduced complement receptor&#x02013;mediated, but not Fc-&#x003b3;R&#x02013;mediated, ingestion capacity of macrophages. Finally, we found that inhibition of CK-B affected phagocytosis already at the stage of particle adhesion, most likely via effects on actin polymerization behavior. We propose that CK-B activity in macrophages contributes to complement-induced F-actin assembly events in early phagocytosis by providing local ATP supply.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>To do work, cells need energy in the form of ATP. High and sudden energy demand is seen during cell-shape change, a process in which ATP fuels the cytoskeletal machinery that drives cell-morphology alteration. How a cell organizes high-energy surges without disrupting global ATP homeostasis remains an important research question. One view proposes that ATP is heterogeneously distributed, but the cytoskeletal proteins actin and myosin receive regional and preferential access to ATP. Yet this model raises another question: how is ATP funneled to these proteins from distant sources? To address some of these questions, we studied the highly localized molecular events controlling actin dynamics around phagocytic activity of macrophages. We demonstrate that actin and creatine kinase-B (CK-B), a long-known enzyme involved in ATP supply, are simultaneously recruited into the sites of action during the early phases of particle ingestion. Local availability of CK-activity and local generation of ATP promotes on-site actin remodeling and particle capture efficiency, and thus supports successful initiation of the first phases of phagocytosis. Interestingly, this coupling between local CK-activity and actin regulation is only relevant for complement-mediated phagocytosis (used by immune cells to target specific particles for ingestion). We predict that our findings may also shed light on how shape dynamics is energized in other cell types.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A tight connection exists between local recruitment of creatine kinase-B (CK-B) and actin remodeling activity in phagocytic cups of macrophages.

These pathways ultimately converge and lead to the induction of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization, which is considered the main driving force for the formation of circular pseudopod protrusions (i.e., a &#x0201c;phagocytic cup&#x0201d;) around the target &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

Moreover, during filament severing or turnover, energy is used when ATP is hydrolyzed when still bound to F-actin, and P<sub>i</sub> is released. Next, ADP-actin dissociates, and free G-actin monomers can be subsequently reloaded with &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; ATP. ATP- or ADP-loaded actin monomers are both competent for polymerization, but the nature of the bound nucleotide differentially modulates the kinetics of the association and dissociation at the pointed or barbed ends of filaments. Also the &#x0201c;storage&#x0201d; of G-actin monomers into thymosin- or profilin-sequestered pools is dependent on nucleotide loading state and hence, the energy state of the cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

By analogy, we hypothesized that the functional coupling between actin-based cytoskeletal dynamics and CK-mediated ATP compartmentalization and supply could be more general, and might be of importance for shape changes and dynamics of nonmuscle or neuronal cells as well.

To obtain dynamic information, we transiently expressed enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-tagged CK-B (via N-terminal fusion) in RAW 264.7 cells, and applied live cell microscopy imaging after induction of phagocytosis.

Initially, we chose a pharmacological approach to modulate activity of the entire cellular pool of CK, applying Cr as a stimulating substrate or cyclocreatine (cCr) as a reversible inhibitor of the CK reaction. RAW 264.7 cells were preincubated with 5 mM cCr or Cr prior to the phagocytosis assay, and cells were then challenged with differentially opsonized and fluorescently labeled phagocytic targets. After 30 min, phagocytic activity was quantified by determining the mean fluorescence intensity of ingested particles in the different cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060051-g005">Figure 5</xref>, data are shown that are normalized to values for nontreated cells.

In contrast, Cr and cCr addition had no significant effect on phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized zymosan, with 97&#x00025; &#x000b1; 5&#x00025; and 88&#x00025; &#x000b1; 9&#x00025; for Cr- and cCr-treated cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060051-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).

Furthermore, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments revealed that the motility of YFP-actin and CFP-CK-B in cup areas differed during the phagocytic process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060051-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), arguing against single association between actin and CK-B. Involvement of transient &#x0201c;kiss-and-run&#x0201d; type interactions cannot be excluded, however.</p><p>Combined, our data suggest that the activities of CK-B that we have described are likely to occur via ATP-supply effects on local F-actin polymerization capacity, which in turn affects CR3-mediated adhesion and internalization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Phagocytosis requires a rapid and spatially confined reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The underlying molecular processes, such as actin polymerization and actomyosin force generation, generate a sudden and localized demand for cellular ATP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. To reciprocate this challenge, sites of ATP production should be coupled tightly to sites of ATP consumption. From studies in cell and animal models, we know that CK isozymes are particularly well equipped for this role, as they provide the cell with a fast ATP regeneration and delivery system that can adequately provide high-energy phosphoryl groups to cellular locales with high energy turnover. Here, we established a tight functional and spatial link between the CK system and the actin-based cytoskeletal machinery in macrophages during phagocytosis. A similar relationship was found for the muscle isoform of CK, CK-M, which associates with the M- and I-bands of skeletal muscle and fuels local ATP-consuming processes, including actomyosin contraction and calcium pumping &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, CK-M's role in these physiological processes is supportive, not absolutely vital &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, just as we report here for CK-B's role in phagocytosis. For CK-M, the molecular nature of events that support its role has been unraveled to some extent. For example, we know that interaction of CK-M with the sarcomeric M-band is mediated via conserved lysine residues. In addition, particular amino acid segments in CK-M enable the protein to bind indirectly to the I-band via the glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK) and aldolase, which have actin-binding properties &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, glycolytic enzymes are also known to be recruited to phagosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, so there may be parallel mechanisms. Unfortunately, to explain CK-B dynamics, it is not possible to use simple analogy since the lysine residues involved in CK-M M-band interaction are not conserved in CK-B &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, and direct sequence comparison is not yielding clear clues for other binding modes&#x02014;for example to glycolytic enzymes. Several mechanisms could therefore be involved in the recruitment of CK-B. One model would be the transient availability of CK-B binding sites at the nascent phagosome by modification of local proteins or presence of CK-B interacting proteins. Based on its colocalization with CK-B, we tested whether actin could be a candidate for such scaffolding, but pull-down assays and FRAP experiments did not reveal a tight interaction. Also yeast two-hybrid assays did not disclose any CK-B to actin binding opportunities (unpublished data). As another possibility, CK-B binding characteristics could also be transiently modified at the enzyme itself, possibly by (enzymatic) events located at the forming cup. Indeed, CK-B is prone to covalent modifications such as phosphorylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, oxidation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, methylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, or ubiquination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Simple presence of substrate may also determine binding ability, as recently shown for CK-M &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. Further studies are necessary to discriminate between all these possibilities.</p><p>Because phagocytosis is a metabolically demanding process, CK-B recruitment to phagocytic cups could serve to promote or safeguard local events or&#x02014;reciprocally&#x02014;shield the rest of the cell from excessive local energy demand. To distinguish between these mechanistic models and elucidate CK-B global and local physiological role(s) in macrophages more precisely will be technically challenging because of the confined character of the events. This, therefore, also remains a topic for future study.</p><p>Of particular importance was our finding that displacement of endogenous CK-B by ECFP-CK-B<sub>(C283S)</sub> during phagocytosis reduced the local accumulation of EGFP-actin in the phagocytic cup area. The observation that inhibition of CK-B activity impairs global F-actin polymerization in RAW 264.7 cells was equally revealing. Normally, actin polymerization requires the incorporation of ATP-actin at the barbed end of actin filaments. During filament elongation, ATP is hydrolyzed and ADP-actin is being released at the pointed end. Thus, constant reloading of actin with ATP is required for the continuation of the polymerization cycle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. We propose here, that CK-B could specifically enhance this process by regenerating ATP at sites of active actin remodeling.</p><p>In addition to the polymerization reaction, actin nucleation and branching play an important role. The Arp2/3 complex, together with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (adapter) protein, WASP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, and the motor proteins myosin-I &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d; and myosin-II &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, helps to guide these processes during shaping of the cup of nascent phagosomes. Recently, the involvement of the formin mDia has also been implicated in phagocytosis of COZ. Inhibition of mDia results in decreased F-actin recruitment at the phagocytic cup and induces a concomitant decrease in efficiency of CR3-mediated, but not Fc-&#x003b3;R&#x02013;mediated, phagocytosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. Formins promote actin polymerization by increasing polymerization-associated ATP hydrolysis up to 15 times via profilin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, regulation of cell structure via RhoA activation or AMP-activated kinase involvement is also directly energy dependent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, different types of actin regulatory processes form local and temporal energy drains, which may need compensation by CK-B&#x02013;mediated ATP regeneration.</p><p>Various associated myosin motor mechanisms involved in formation of the specialized structures at the phagosome may also be CK-B dependent, because motor activity of myosins is controlled by ATP/ADP ratio. In <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, myosin-VII was found to be important for initial adhesion in phagocytosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, another closely related myosin, myosin-X, was implicated in adhesion and phagocytosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. However, at this point, we need more mechanistic information about how ATP fuelling separately serves actin and myosin activities in the phagocytic cup before we can analyze CK-B's presumed role(s) in detail further.</p><p>Intriguingly, Olazabal and coworkers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; have reported that inhibition of myosin-II decreased actin recruitment in phagocytic cups during CR3-mediated phagocytosis, but not Fc-&#x003b3;R&#x02013;mediated events. Our results regarding differences in ingestion capacity for COZ or IgG-coated zymosan and beads after genetic blocking or pharmacological inhibition of CK activity fit with a model in which ATP-driven actomyosin activities differentially contribute to discrete phagocytic processes. Only phagocytosis of COZ and zymosan was significantly affected under conditions in which CK activity was lowered, Fc-&#x003b3;R&#x02013;mediated activity was not significantly affected by cyclocreatine or dominant-negative CK inhibition. Of note, phagocytosis of COZ is mainly, but not exclusively, mediated by complement molecules present on COZ. Also, sugar residues that are present on (non)opsonized zymosan facilitate recognition by lectin domains in CR3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b060">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d; or alternative phagocytic receptors such as dectin-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Based on our findings and these background notions regarding differences in pathways involved in cup formation in complement or IgG modes of phagocytosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;, it is tempting to speculate that CK-B enhances phagocytosis by modulating specific processes up- or downstream of CR3. It may be important to note that differences in the actin levels in the phagocytic cup, as seen between active ECFP-CK-B and mutant ECFP-CK-B<sub>(C283S)</sub>&#x02013;expressing cells, correlated better with the fraction of cells participating in phagocytosis than with the number of fully ingested particles per cell. The observation of the apparent delayed internalization of COZ particles in the RAW-CK-B<sub>(C283S)</sub> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060051-g007">Figure 7</xref>E) suggests that after early binding requirements have been fulfilled, CK-B also promotes transition to the next phases of phagocytosis. Therefore, we propose that the CK-B&#x02013;mediated modulation of actin polymerization is particularly relevant during early CR3-mediated phagocytosis, for example by increasing the number of successful probing attempts for particle binding. Our data also suggest that endogenous levels of resident CK-B molecules are largely sufficient to saturate these requirements for zymosan and COZ phagocytosis.</p><p>CR3 is also known as CD11b/CD18 or &#x003b1;M&#x003b2;2 integrin. Because actin polymerization is pivotal in early adhesion events mediated by integrins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, a picture emerges in which actin behavior determines the efficiency by which CR3s can bind their target. Actin behavior may be less central for IgG-mediated binding events. Our finding that low concentrations of the actin polymerization inhibitor, cytochalasin D, reduced binding of complement opsonized particles more than IgG-opsonized particles is consistent with such a model.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that CK-B enhances phagocytosis of zymosan and COZ, likely via a specific synergistic role in mechanistic events involved in actin polymerization behavior. Although our data indicate that the enzyme's metabolic role is dominant, we cannot completely rule out a structural role of CK-B in phagocytosis at this point. Taken together with the finding that CK-B<sub>(C283S)</sub> was able to inhibit phagocytosis without decreasing the total CK activity, our data suggest that CK-B acts to steer the delicate local balance in ATP/ADP ratio, during formation of the phagocytic cup, around the time that pseudopod&#x02013;filopodium extensions or CR3-mediated adhesions are formed. Because we do see CK-B in filopodia and phagocytic cups in our RAW cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060051-g001">Figures 1</xref>G&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060051-g001">1</xref>L and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060051-g004">4</xref>), but also observe CK-B accumulation in dynamic actin structures of other cell types during adhesion to substratum, spreading, and crawling, (e.g., in neurons and astrocytes; unpublished data), this raises the exciting possibility that CK-B facilitates rapid cytoskeletal dynamics in a broad range of specialized events that occur during tissue development and disease, including dendritic spine generation in brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060051-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;, formation of immune-synapses, or protrusion dynamics for cancer cell invasion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture.</title><p>Resident peritoneal macrophages were isolated from adult (10&#x02013;20 wk old) mice of mixed genetic background (C57BL/6 &#x000d7; 129Ola).
