One possible explanation is that the ability of a specific oncogene to cause tumorigenesis in a particular cell type depends on epigenetic parameters such as the developmental context. To address this hypothesis, we have used the tetracycline regulatory system to generate transgenic mice in which the expression of a <italic>c-MYC</italic> human transgene can be conditionally regulated in murine hepatocytes. <italic>MYC</italic>'s ability to induce tumorigenesis was dependent upon developmental context. In embryonic and neonatal mice, MYC overexpression in the liver induced marked cell proliferation and immediate onset of neoplasia. In contrast, in adult mice MYC overexpression induced cell growth and DNA replication without mitotic cell division, and mice succumbed to neoplasia only after a prolonged latency. In adult hepatocytes, <italic>MYC</italic> activation failed to induce cell division, which was at least in part mediated through the activation of p53. Surprisingly, apoptosis is not a barrier to <italic>MYC</italic> inducing tumorigenesis. The ability of oncogenes to induce tumorigenesis may be generally restrained by developmentally specific mechanisms. Adult somatic cells have evolved mechanisms to prevent individual oncogenes from initiating cellular growth, DNA replication, and mitotic cellular division alone, thereby preventing any single genetic event from inducing tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A transgenic mouse model demonstrates that developmental context may be the reason why the spectrum of tumors differs in children and adults</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The frequency of cancer development varies depending on the age of the host. In humans, the most common childhood cancers include tumors of the hematopoietic system, nervous system, and skeletal muscle system. In contrast, in the adult population, solid tumors of the lung, colon, breast, and prostate are more common. Differences in types of cancers in hosts of different ages may reflect the abundance of cells in a differentiative state susceptible to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Greaves1">Greaves 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Klein1">Klein and Klein 1986</xref>). Indeed, many reports document that oncogene activation generally induces tumorigenesis in immature cellular lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Adams1">Adams et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Spanopoulou1">Spanopoulou et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Pelengaris1">Pelengaris et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Blyth1">Blyth et al. 2000</xref>).</p><p>We recently reported that upon oncogene inactivation tumor cells can differentiate into mature cells, and in this new differentiative context the reactivation of an oncogene fails to restore tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Jain1">Jain et al. 2002</xref>). Based on these results, we speculate that only specific differentiative windows provide the correct epigenetic program to permit oncogene activation to initiate and sustain tumorigenesis. Here we directly evaluate whether an oncogene's ability to induce tumorigenesis depends on the differentiative context when this oncogene first becomes activated. We have examined the ability of the <italic>C-MYC</italic> oncogene to induce tumorigenesis in mice of different ages using a novel conditional transgenic model system for <italic>C-MYC</italic>&#x02013;induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</p><p><italic>C-MYC</italic> (now referred to as <italic>MYC</italic>) is a member of a family of proto-oncogenes comprising <italic>C</italic>-<italic>MYC, N-MYC,</italic> and <italic>L-MYC. MYC</italic> encodes a transcription factor that, as part of a heterodimeric complex with MAX, regulates the expression of a multitude of genes involved in regulating cellular proliferation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Johnston1">Johnston et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Grandori1">Grandori et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Oster1">Oster et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Pelengaris3">Pelengaris et al. 2002a</xref>). Overexpression of MYC is commonly associated with tumorigenesis. MYC exerts its neoplastic function by inducing autonomous cellular proliferation and cellular growth, blocking differentiation, and inducing genomic destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Dang1">Dang 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Felsher2">Felsher and Bishop 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Grandori1">Grandori et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Oster1">Oster et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Pelengaris3">Pelengaris et al. 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Karlsson1">Karlsson et al. 2003</xref>). It is generally assumed that MYC is restrained from causing tumorigenesis because it concomitantly induces cellular proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Pelengaris3">Pelengaris et al. 2002a</xref>).</p><p>HCC is a common and generally incurable human malignancy of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Thorgeirsson1">Thorgeirsson and Grisham 2002</xref>). HCC has been strongly associated with viral infections such as hepatitis B and C; exposure to toxins, such as alcohol, aflatoxin, and phenobarbital; and exposure to various carcinogens such as polyvinyl chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Thorgeirsson1">Thorgeirsson and Grisham 2002</xref>). Interestingly, the ability of these carcinogens, such as the hepatitis viruses, to induce HCC depends on the host age during infection. Hepatitis B infection acquired during neonatal development versus adulthood results in a several-magnitude increased risk of HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Chang1">Chang et al. 1991</xref>). These results suggest that there are differentiative windows during liver development that may be more susceptible to neoplastic transformation.</p><p>Human tumors have been analyzed extensively for genetic events associated with HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Buetow1">Buetow et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Tsuda1">Tsuda et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Boige1">Boige et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Piao1">Piao et al. 1997</xref>). <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene activation is one of the more common events in the pathogenesis of HCC. MYC overexpression in human HCC is most commonly associated with genomic amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020332-Elella1">Abou-Elella et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Kawate1">Kawate et al. 1999</xref>). Human HCCs exhibit amplification of <italic>MYC</italic> in up to 50&#x00025; of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020332-Elella1">Abou-Elella et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Kawate1">Kawate et al. 1999</xref>). The presence of <italic>MYC</italic> amplification in HCC portends a more advanced and aggressive clinical phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020332-Elella1">Abou-Elella et al. 1996</xref>). Thus, the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of HCC.</p><p>The most compelling evidence that <italic>MYC</italic> is causally associated with the etiology of HCC comes from animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Sandgren1">Sandgren et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Fourel1">Fourel et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Murakami1">Murakami et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Morgenbesser1">Morgenbesser and DePinho 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Sargent1">Sargent et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Sargent2">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-De1">De Miglio et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Santoni-Rugiu1">Santoni-Rugiu et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Renard1">Renard et al. 2000</xref>). <italic>MYC</italic> is frequently activated through insertional mutagenesis mediated by the hepadnavirus in woodchuck liver tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Fourel1">Fourel et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Renard1">Renard et al. 2000</xref>).

The overexpression of <italic>MYC</italic> (as a transgene) and other oncogenes (e.g., <italic>RAS,</italic> T antigen) in murine hepatocytes results in HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Sandgren1">Sandgren et al. 1989</xref>). The latency of HCC in these transgenic mice is long, but is greatly accelerated by the transgenic overexpression of transforming growth factor-alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Murakami1">Murakami et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Sargent1">Sargent et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Sargent2">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Santoni-Rugiu1">Santoni-Rugiu et al. 1999</xref>). These results highlight that the activation of <italic>MYC</italic> alone is not sufficient to induce HCC.</p><p>Traditional transgenic systems that have been previously used to study the role of oncogenes in tumorigenesis continuously overexpress transgenes and hence preclude the investigation of the initial and developmentally specific consequences of oncogene activation. To investigate the developmentally specific consequences of MYC overexpression in the pathogenesis of HCC in vivo, we used transgenic mice in which the MYC proto-oncogene is conditionally regulated via the tetracycline regulatory system (Tet system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Felsher3">Felsher and Bishop 1999b</xref>). We found that the ability of <italic>MYC</italic> to induce cellular proliferation versus cellular growth, and consequently its ability to induce tumorigenesis in murine hepatocytes, was dependent on the age of the host. Our results have implications for the mechanisms by which <italic>MYC</italic> and other oncogenes initiate and are restrained from causing tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Conditional Model System for <italic>MYC</italic>-Induced HCC</title><p>We used the Tet system to conditionally express <italic>MYC</italic> in murine hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Kistner1">Kistner et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Felsher3">Felsher and Bishop 1999b</xref>). We mated the transgenic line TRE-<italic>MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Felsher3">Felsher and Bishop 1999b</xref>), which contains the tetracycline response element adjacent to the human <italic>MYC</italic> cDNA, with the transgenic line LAP-<italic>tTA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Kistner1">Kistner et al. 1996</xref>), which contains a liver-specific enhancer that drives the expression of the tetracycline-transactivating protein. Mice possessing both transgenes exhibited increased expression of the <italic>MYC</italic> transgene in their hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Mice possessing either transgene alone did not overexpress <italic>MYC</italic> and lacked evidence of morbidity or mortality. Similarly, mice possessing both transgenes that were treated with doxycycline to suppress <italic>MYC</italic> transgene expression did not exhibit a phenotype. Thus, we have developed a transgenic model that enables us to conditionally regulate <italic>MYC</italic> expression in murine hepatocytes.</p><p>To investigate if MYC overexpression is sufficient to induce HCC in our model system, we removed doxycycline treatment in adult mice (6&#x02013;12 weeks of age) transgenic for both TRE-<italic>MYC</italic> and LAP-<italic>tTA</italic>. Ninety percent of adult mice overexpressing MYC succumbed to liver tumors with a mean latency of 35 weeks. At necropsy, mice exhibited marked gross enlargement of the liver with multiple tumor masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The normal liver architecture was disrupted by nodular tumors with histological features typical of HCC. Tumors were composed of dysplastic nests of cells with large pleomorphic nuclei, delicate vesicular chromatin, and very prominent nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Tumors could invade into the abdomen and the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g002">2</xref>C). These features demonstrated that MYC overexpression in adult mice resulted in HCC.</p><p>To confirm that these tumors were malignant, we transplanted them subcutaneously into <italic>scid</italic> mice. Tumors formed in the inoculated mice after an 8&#x02013;10-week latency (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). The transplanted tumors displayed identical histology to the primary transgenic tumor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g001">Figure 1</xref>E versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g001">1</xref>C). Normal adult hepatocytes failed to induce tumors when inoculated into <italic>scid</italic> mice. We conclude that MYC overexpression in adult hepatocytes results in the formation of highly malignant liver cancers with features consistent with human HCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Developmental State of the Host Influences on Frequency and Latency of Tumor Onset</title><p>To determine if the developmental state of host hepatocytes influenced the ability of <italic>MYC</italic> activation to induce tumorigenesis, we induced <italic>MYC</italic> in cohorts of different ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Mice that overexpressed MYC during embryonic development of the liver succumbed to neoplasia within 10 d of birth. Mice in which <italic>MYC</italic> was activated at birth (neonates) succumbed to neoplasia within 8 weeks. Mice in which <italic>MYC</italic> was induced at 4 weeks or 6&#x02013;12 weeks of age developed tumors after a mean latency of 15 and 35 weeks, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). We conclude that the ability of <italic>MYC</italic> activation to induce tumorigenesis in hepatocytes is inversely correlated with the developmental age of the host.</p><p>One possible explanation for our results was that the levels of MYC induction were different in embryonic and neonatal versus adult hosts. To address this possibility, we examined total MYC protein levels by Western analysis using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both the human c-MYC protein and the endogenous murine c-MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In neonatal and adult mice, MYC protein levels were induced at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In tumors from embryos, neonatal, and adult mice, MYC protein levels increased an additional 5- to 10-fold over the levels observed in nontransgenic and in <italic>MYC</italic>-induced nonneoplastic livers. Tumorigenic conversion of hepatocytes was associated, in all age groups of mice, with further increases in the levels of MYC protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). We obtained similar results by quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA expression of the human <italic>MYC</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). In neonatal and adult mice, <italic>MYC</italic> transgene expression was induced at similar levels. In tumors from embryos, neonatal, and adult mice, the levels of <italic>MYC</italic> transgene RNA increased an additional 10-fold over the levels observed in nonmalignant hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Hence, tumorigenic conversion of hepatocytes was associated, in all age groups of mice, with further increases in the levels of <italic>MYC</italic> transgene expression. However, differences in the ability of <italic>MYC</italic> activation to initiate tumorigenesis in mice of different ages did not appear to be related to differences in the levels of induction of <italic>MYC</italic> transgene expression. The increased levels of MYC expression we observed in tumors likely reflect that the proliferating tumor cells express more abundant levels of the <italic>MYC</italic> transgene than normal hepatocytes. This observation is consistent with observations described in other transgenic models in which expression of transgenes is generally higher in tumors than it is in the normal cellular counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Weiss1">Weiss et al. 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>MYC</italic> Activation in Embryonic and Neonatal Hepatocytes Induces Cellular Proliferation and Tumorigenesis</title><p>To evaluate how <italic>MYC</italic>'s ability to induce tumorigenesis is influenced by the age of mice, we investigated the initial consequences of <italic>MYC</italic> activation in hepatocytes during different developmental periods. Mice that overexpressed MYC during embryonic development were born with livers similar in weight and gross architecture to normal age-matched livers, yet exhibited increasing numbers of neoplastic cells from birth through the first week of life associated with progressive abdominal enlargement. At necropsy, abdominal enlargement was associated with marked hepatomegaly with a 5-fold increase in total liver weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g008">Figure 8</xref>B below). Although these livers were larger, the gross architecture was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, MYC ON versus MYC OFF). When we examined the histology of the livers in which MYC was overexpressed during embryogenesis, we found that they resembled liver cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g004">Figure 4</xref>B versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g004">4</xref>C) similar to the <italic>MYC</italic>-induced HCCs we observed in adult mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g001">Figure 1</xref>C versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g001">4</xref>C). Hence, MYC overexpression appears to induce cellular proliferation in neonatal hepatocytes that progresses rapidly to neoplasia.</p><p>To determine if MYC was inducing changes in cell cycle transit, we measured the DNA content of isolated nuclei from normal hepatocytes and hepatocytes in which <italic>MYC</italic> was activated during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g004">4</xref>E). Normal neonatal hepatocytes mostly contained 2N DNA content, consistent with most of the cells residing in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). A minority of hepatocytes exhibited 4N and 2N&#x02013;4N DNA content, demonstrating that few cells were in G2/M and S phase, respectively.

Conversely, tumors in adult mice frequently exhibited reduced levels of p53 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g010">Figure 10</xref>A and unpublished data). Not all tumors exhibited reduced p53 expression. Since p53 mediates its function largely through inducing the transcription of many different genes, we evaluated if tumors exhibited a loss of p53 function by measuring the expression of these target genes.

Notably, a tumor that exhibited high p53 protein levels, tumor 2264, exhibited a loss in expression of p53 target genes. In contrast, tumors arising in neonatal mice expressed p53 protein and exhibited the induction of p53 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g010">Figure 10</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g010">10</xref>C).

We found that <italic>MYC</italic> activation in adult mice that have undergone partial hepatectomy exhibited a reduced latency of tumor induction in comparison with adult mice that had not undergone surgery (mean latency of 14 weeks versus 35 weeks). However, this latency of tumorigenesis in adult mice after partial hepatectomy was still up to two magnitudes longer than what was observed when <italic>MYC</italic> was activated in embryonic and neonatal mice (&#x0003c;10 d and 4 weeks, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g011">Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020332-g003">3</xref>A).

Finally, in adult mice after partial hepatectomy, but not in neonatal mice, areas of the liver that had not undergone neoplastic conversion clearly exhibited increased cellular hypertrophy, and hence were unable to undergo mitotic division (unpublished data). We conclude that the ability of MYC to induce tumorigenesis in adult hepatocytes is accelerated after partial hepatectomy when adult hepatocytes are proliferating, but other developmentally specific parameters are more important in determining when oncogene activation will induce tumorigenesis than the ability of hepatocytes simply to proliferate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Developmental Context Influences <italic>MYC</italic>'s Ability to Induce Cellular Proliferation</title><p>Here we demonstrate that <italic>MYC</italic>'s ability to induce cellular growth versus proliferation and tumorigenesis depends on the differentiative context of a cellular lineage.

We were able to address this possibility directly by examining the consequences of MYC overexpression in adult hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy, which resulted in the immediate induction of adult hepatocyte proliferation associated with complete liver regeneration within 2 weeks. Adult mice only exhibited a modest increased susceptibility to <italic>MYC</italic>-induced tumorigenesis observed when <italic>MYC</italic> was induced in embryonic mice. This is despite the fact that after partial hepatectomy the total number of proliferating hepatocytes would be at least two magnitudes greater than in a neonatal or embryonic liver, whose total mass is much smaller. We conclude that developmentally specific parameters other than proliferation are more likely to play a causative role in the differential susceptibility of embryonic and neonatal hepatocytes to <italic>MYC</italic>-induced tumorigenesis.</p><p>Several different development-related factors could account for our observations. The relative ability of MYC to induce tumorigenesis in developmentally immature hosts may reflect the relative increased abundance of immature hepatocytes. Homeostatic mechanisms that regulate liver size and hepatocyte proliferation may permit MYC-induced proliferative expansion in the developing livers of young hosts and restrain proliferation in the mature liver of adult hosts. Differences in rates of tumorigenesis may be related to telomerase function that monitors the distance from senescence, as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Artandi1">Artandi et al. 2000</xref>). An unlikely possibility is that higher doses of tetracyclines may impede liver carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-NTP1">NTP 1989</xref>). The conditional model system that we have described should be useful for addressing these different possible mechanisms.</p><p>We conclude that mechanisms that regulate mitotic division play a critical role in preventing potent oncogenes, such as <italic>MYC,</italic> from inducing cancer in adult somatic cells. <italic>MYC</italic> activation alone is capable of enforcing DNA replication, but not cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Johnston1">Johnston et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Felsher4">Felsher et al. 2000</xref>). Mitotic arrest may represent a critical fail-safe mechanism.

It is not clear whether the hepatocytes that ultimately give rise to the tumors we observed derive from mitotically arrested diploid hepatocytes or from polyploid hepatocytes that acquire the capacity to undergo mitotic division.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>MYC Is Restrained from Inducing Proliferation by an Arrest in Cell Division</title><p>Many reports document that p53 functions as a general surveillance checkpoint that prevents oncogenes from inducing tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Sherr1">Sherr 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Vogelstein1">Vogelstein et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Wahl1">Wahl and Carr 2001</xref>). <italic>MYC</italic> activation is known to induce <italic>p53</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Chernova1">Chernova et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Zindy1">Zindy et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Schmitt1">Schmitt et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Felsher4">Felsher et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Grandori1">Grandori et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Oster1">Oster et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Pelengaris3">Pelengaris et al. 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Pelengaris4">2002b</xref>), which in turn has been shown to cause apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Evan1">Evan et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Zindy1">Zindy et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Schmitt1">Schmitt et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Grandori1">Grandori et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Oster1">Oster et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Pelengaris3">Pelengaris et al. 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Pelengaris4">2002b</xref>). In contrast to these reports, we found that <italic>MYC</italic> is restrained from causing cell division in adult hepatocytes, at least in part, through a p53-dependent mechanism. Our results are consistent with many reports that demonstrate that p53 regulates checkpoints during DNA replication and during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Wahl1">Wahl and Carr 2001</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that apoptosis is not the mechanism that precludes <italic>MYC</italic> from inducing neoplasia in hepatocytes. Rather, apoptosis is associated with <italic>MYC</italic>-induced neoplastic progression. Notably, similar results have been described in MYC-induced breast cancer and lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-McCormack1">McCormack et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Blyth1">Blyth et al. 2000</xref>). There are several possible explanations for this discordance between our results and many previous reports. <italic>MYC</italic> may only induce apoptosis in some cellular lineages or only in particular differentiative contexts. In this regard, we have shown that upon inactivating <italic>MYC</italic>, tumor cells differentiated, and upon <italic>MYC</italic> reactivation in this new differentiative state, cells underwent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Jain1">Jain et al. 2002</xref>). Thus, whether oncogene activation induces proliferation, growth, arrest, or apoptosis may depend on the gene expression program of a cell associated with a particular differentiative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Felsher1">Felsher 2003</xref>).</p><p>We found that the ability of MYC overexpression to induce tumorigenesis in adult hepatocytes often requires the loss of p53 function. <italic>MYC</italic>-induced HCC exhibited reduced p53 protein expression and transcriptional activity. The introduction of a single mutant <italic>p53</italic> allele greatly accelerated <italic>MYC</italic>'s ability to induce tumorigenesis. Hence, in adult hepatocytes, loss of p53 function appears to be necessary to permit <italic>MYC</italic> activation to induce cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. Our results here are similar to our previous observations that normal mouse and human fibroblasts overexpressing MYC replicate and even endoreduplicate their DNA, but are unable to undergo mitotic division unless p53 function has been lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Felsher4">Felsher et al. 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Specific Developmental Contexts Permit Oncogene-Induced Tumorigenesis</title><p>We may be able to explain why the frequency and spectrum of neoplasia vary with the host's age. In general, children are susceptible to tumors of the hematopoietic system, musculo-skeletal system, and central nervous system, whereas adults are susceptible more frequently to tumors derived from epithelial lineages, such as colon, lung, breast, prostate, and liver. The ability of oncogenes to induce cancer may be dependent upon the differentiative context. Frequently, oncogene activation has been associated with the malignant conversion of immature cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Adams1">Adams et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Spanopoulou1">Spanopoulou et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Pelengaris1">Pelengaris et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Blyth1">Blyth et al. 2000</xref>).</p><p>We may be able to explain why neonatal versus adult humans that have become infected with hepatitis B succumb to HCC with a 100-fold-increased frequency and reduced latency of tumor onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Chang1">Chang et al. 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Chang2">1997</xref>). We infer that oncogenes in general are more potent in inducing cancer in hepatocytes of younger hosts because these cells are committed to a developmental program permissive to tumorigenesis. Cancers frequently correspond to the malignant expansion of specific immature differentiative states within a given cellular lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Greaves1">Greaves 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Klein1">Klein and Klein 1986</xref>). It would be advantageous for adult somatic cells, which are required to be long lived, to acquire mechanisms that prevent single oncogenes from inducing inappropriate cellular proliferation and thereby tumorigenesis. Two such mechanisms have been proposed: Some oncogenes induce premature senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Serrano1">Serrano et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Lin1">Lin et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Zhu1">Zhu et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Dimri1">Dimri et al. 2000</xref>), and other oncogenes induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Pelengaris2">Pelengaris et al. 2000</xref>). Here we have provided evidence for a different mechanism: The aberrant activation of proto-oncogenes, such as <italic>MYC,</italic> in the developmental context of adult somatic cells appears to be inherently prohibited from inducing mitotic division.</p><p>The intrinsic inhibition of a proliferative program in mature somatic cells may be a more parsimonious mechanism than apoptosis as a means of restraining tumorigenesis because it would permit otherwise normal fully differentiated somatic cells to continue to operate despite their acquisition of an activating mutation in an oncogene. In some cases, it would be advantageous to arrest cells rather than induce their apoptosis. Immature cells, which are committed to a program of proliferative expansion, are inherently more susceptible to oncogene-induced autonomous proliferation and tumorigenesis. In immature cells, apoptosis may be the only mechanism that could prevent tumorigenesis. Thus, the differentiative state and epigenetic program of a cell influences whether an oncogene induces cellular senescence, mitotic arrest, or apoptosis.</p><p>Generally, oncogenes may cause tumorigenesis most readily in developmental contexts that provide a gene expression program permissive to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Jain1">Jain et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Felsher1">Felsher 2003</xref>). Pathologic conditions that trigger the expansion of immature cells&#x02014;tissue injury and regeneration, infection, and autoimmune processes&#x02014;may be associated with cancer because they change the cellular state, now permitting a single oncogene, such as <italic>MYC,</italic> to initiate tumorigenesis. In this regard, we found that <italic>MYC</italic> accelerated tumorigenesis in adult hosts that had undergone partial hepatectomy and were undergoing liver regeneration&#x02014;a state that induces robust cellular proliferation. However, tumorigenesis was not accelerated to the same degree as observed when <italic>MYC</italic> was activated in embryonic or neonatal hosts. Therefore, inducing the capacity of a cell to proliferate alone is unlikely to be sufficient to confer susceptibility to tumorigenesis. It has long been appreciated that conferring the ability of a cell to proliferate is not sufficient to induce tumorigenesis. Other developmentally specific parameters may play a more critical role in defining when oncogene activation results in tumorigenesis. The model system we have developed should prove useful in defining how particular developmental contexts and pathologic states contribute to tumorigenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>The TRE-<italic>MYC</italic> transgenic line generated for these experiments was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="plbi-02-11-03-Felsher3">Felsher and Bishop 1999b</xref>).

correlated with the age of the host at the time of <italic>MYC</italic> induction. Shown are cases where <italic>MYC</italic> was constitutively expressed (&#x025aa;), newborn mice in which <italic>MYC</italic> was activated at birth (&#x025b4;), young mice in which <italic>MYC</italic> was activated at 4 weeks of age (&#x02022;), adult mice in which <italic>MYC</italic> was activated at 6&#x02013;12 weeks of age (&#x02666;), and transgenic mice treated with doxycycline (&#x025a1;). Cohorts consisted of 15&#x02013;30 mice. Mice were scored when moribund. <italic>MYC</italic> transgene expression was induced to similar levels in the differently aged cohorts of mice.

Adult mice exhibited a progressive increase in MYC protein levels during the course of <italic>MYC</italic> induction, with a significant increase in MYC protein in tumors. MYC protein levels in neonatal mice in which <italic>MYC</italic> was activated at birth were slightly increased at 10 d of age, and significantly increased at 18 d of age when these mice developed liver tumors. Liver tumors in 2- and 6-d-old neonatal mice that overexpressed MYC during embryonic development exhibited MYC protein levels similar to those observed in neonatal and adult tumors.</p><p>(C) Real-time PCR analysis showing human <italic>MYC</italic> RNA levels in mice after different durations of <italic>MYC</italic> transgene induction. Adult livers exhibited a small increase in <italic>MYC</italic> RNA levels upon <italic>MYC</italic> activation, and a much greater increase in <italic>MYC</italic> RNA in MYC-induced tumors (black bars).
