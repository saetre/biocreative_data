This reaction is exploited by both antibiotic and proteic gyrase inhibitors, which trap the gyrase molecule at the DNA cleavage stage. Owing to this interaction, double-stranded DNA breaks are introduced and replication machinery is arrested at blocked replication forks. This immediately results in bacteriostasis and ultimately induces cell death. Here we demonstrate, through a series of phenotypic and gene expression analyses, that superoxide and hydroxyl radical oxidative species are generated following gyrase poisoning and play an important role in cell killing by gyrase inhibitors. We show that superoxide-mediated oxidation of iron&#x02013;sulfur clusters promotes a breakdown of iron regulatory dynamics; in turn, iron misregulation drives the generation of highly destructive hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction. Importantly, our data reveal that blockage of hydroxyl radical formation increases the survival of gyrase-poisoned cells. Together, this series of biochemical reactions appears to compose a maladaptive response, that serves to amplify the primary effect of gyrase inhibition by oxidatively damaging DNA, proteins and lipids.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gyrase inhibitors</kwd><kwd>hydroxyl radicals</kwd><kwd>iron&#x02013;sulfur cluster</kwd><kwd>oxidative damage</kwd><kwd>systems biology</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial chromosomal topology is maintained by the activities of topoisomerase I, topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Champoux, 2001</xref>).

In time, the stable DNA&#x02013;GyrA&#x02013;inhibitor complex sterically inhibits replication and transcription by establishing a roadblock to DNA and RNA polymerases, respectively, at stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Kreuzer and Cozzarelli, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Bernard and Couturier, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b95">Willmott <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Cox <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).

Taking a systems biology approach, we enriched our gene expression data using transcription factor and functional pathway classifications. This analysis expectedly revealed that the expression of DNA damage response and repair genes was markedly upregulated following inhibition of DNA gyrase and the generation of DNA lesions. Surprisingly, however, we also observed significantly upregulated expression of genes related to superoxide stress, iron&#x02013;sulfur (Fe&#x02013;S) cluster synthesis and iron uptake and utilization.</p><p>The unfortunate byproduct of increased aerobic respiratory activity and oxidative phosphorylation is the increased formation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Imlay and Fridovich, 1991</xref>). Although superoxide itself presents no additional direct threat to DNA, cytosolic dehydratase proteins containing Fe&#x02013;S clusters are highly susceptible to oxidative attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Liochev and Fridovich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Imlay, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">2006</xref>). Various methods have been used to show that superoxide-mediated decomposition of Fe&#x02013;S clusters, following shifts between anaerobic and aerobic growth states, leads to cytoplasmic release of ferrous (II) iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Keyer and Imlay, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Liochev, 1996</xref>). Elevated intracellular concentrations of ferrous iron have been shown to mediate DNA damage either directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Henle <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Rai <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) or via the formation of additional oxidative molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b88">Touati, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Imlay, 2003</xref>). Hydroxyl radicals, a highly destructive ROS, are the product of the Fenton reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Imlay <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Imlay and Linn, 1988</xref>), in which ferrous iron mediates the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. These biologically threatening oxidative species are capable of inducing a wide array of mutagenic single-base substitutions and DNA adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aruoma <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">McBride <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Balasubramanian <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">Nunoshiba <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>), as well as damaging peptides and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Farr and Kogoma, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the generation of hydroxyl radicals following DNA damage has been shown in higher order systems, including mammalian cells, and is considered as one of the hallmark features of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Jacobson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">Simon <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Here, we provide direct evidence that hydroxyl radicals are generated in bacteria following both antibiotic- and peptide-based gyrase poisoning. Our results show that hydroxyl radical production, upon gyrase inhibition, is directly related to the presence and status of Fe&#x02013;S cluster-containing proteins. In turn, our data suggest that cycling of Fe&#x02013;S clusters between oxidized and reduced states contributes to a breakdown in endogenous iron regulatory dynamics and global iron management. We thus propose that ROS contribute significantly to bacterial cell death following gyrase inhibition and that the associated series of biochemical reactions represents a maladaptive response to aerobic growth which promotes terminal cell fate.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phenotypic response to DNA gyrase inhibition</title><p>We initially sought to characterize the <italic>in vivo</italic> response of the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BW25113 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b93">Wanner, 1983</xref>) to gyrase inhibition and to identify additional contributors to cell death following gyrase poisoning. To accomplish this, we employed the synthetic quinolone antibiotic, norfloxacin, and the natural peptide toxin, CcdB (a component of the F plasmid-encoded CcdB&#x02013;CcdA toxin&#x02013;antitoxin system; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Miki <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>). Upon treatment with norfloxacin, we observed an immediate 2-log reduction in colony forming units (CFU/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). These values steadily declined for the remainder of our experiments. Induction of CcdB expression similarly resulted in consistent CFU/ml reduction over the first 3 h of our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Wild-type cells expressing CcdB, however, routinely reached their minimum density at the 3 h time point, and then began a sustained increase in cell density that continued over the remainder of the experiment.</p><p>Although these results show that, in our system, CcdB is not as efficient as norfloxacin in its ability to induce cellular death in BW25113 cells, our data suggested that both gyrase inhibitors rapidly induce DNA lesion formation. To confirm this hypothesis, we employed an engineered, DNA damage-inducible reporter gene construct that relies upon LexA repression for tight regulation of <italic>gfp</italic> transcription; fluorescence output is thus reflective of RecA-stimulated autocleavage of LexA following DNA damage recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Little, 1991</xref>). As anticipated, gyrase poisoning of wild-type bacteria resulted in significant GFP expression from this construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1B and C</xref>). Norfloxacin treatment uniformly induced high levels of fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>), demonstrating the efficiency and highlighting the irreversibility with which the quinolone traps gyrase and stimulates the formation of DNA breaks. We also observed a large shift in fluorescence upon expression of CcdB, indicative of widespread DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). In line with our CcdB&#x0002b; growth data (and the relative inefficiency of CcdB-mediated cell killing compared with norfloxacin in our system), the broad DNA damage-related fluorescence distribution exhibited by CcdB&#x0002b; cells suggests that DNA damage is being corrected by endogenous repair systems. Taken together, these phenotypic data confirm that norfloxacin and CcdB are both potent inhibitors of DNA gyrase that promote the rapid generation of DNA lesions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene expression response to DNA gyrase inhibition</title><p>We next examined the transcriptional response of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cells treated with norfloxacin or expressing CcdB, with the goal of identifying potential secondary contributors to cell death. Analysis of our time-course microarray data revealed that &#x0003e;800 genes exhibited statistically significant upregulation or downregulation at one or more time points as a function of each respective inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>); significance (<italic>z</italic>-score) was determined on a gene by gene basis, by comparison of mean expression levels to a large (&#x0223c;500) compendium of <italic>E. coli</italic> microarray data collected under a wide array of conditions (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref> for details).</p><p>Taking a systems biology approach, we first applied gene ontology (GO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Ashburner <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Camon <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) classifications to categorize this gene list by biological function, and then enriched these data using GO::TermFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Boyle <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), which enabled us to determine the significance of these classifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures 1 and 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We next employed the RegulonDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Salgado <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) of known transcription factor connections, in conjunction with a published map of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Faith <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), to focus on transcription factors whose targets were significantly enriched in our data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). These measures thus allowed us to group genes based on regulatory and functional pathway classifications and to identify coordinated responses to gyrase inhibition.</p><p>As expected, LexA, which coordinates the expression of the SOS DNA damage response program, was found to be among the most overrepresented transcriptional regulators following norfloxacin treatment and CcdB expression; this result served to further validate our growth data and DNA damage reporter results. As highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, DNA damage-inducible genes comprised one of the largest and most strongly perturbed functional groups in our study. This again is consistent with activation of both the SOS response pathway and the Din (damage-inducible) family of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b96">Witkin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">McEntee, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Kenyon and Walker, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Little and Mount, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b90">Walker, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Courcelle and Hanawalt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Friedberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).

IscR has been shown to autoregulate expression of the <italic>iscRUSA</italic> operon of genes, which are primarily involved in <italic>de novo</italic> Fe&#x02013;S cluster assembly. The repair of heavily oxidized Fe&#x02013;S clusters is believed to require the activity of the Isc protein family, and the derepression of the <italic>iscRUSA</italic> operon following oxidant stress has been previously explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82">Schwartz <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Djaman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Along these lines, additional analysis of our microarray results revealed that the oxidative stress response regulator SoxS was also significantly enriched in our data set. Treatment of <italic>E. coli</italic> with either norfloxacin or CcdB induced the superoxide response operon, <italic>soxRS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Transcription of <italic>soxS</italic> is positively regulated by SoxR and is stimulated upon SoxR activation, the result of superoxide-induced (yet reversible) oxidation of SoxR's Fe&#x02013;S cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Gaudu <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Hidalgo <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). The SoxS transcription factor is known to activate expression of the manganese-superoxide dismutase, <italic>sodA</italic>, considered as the first responder in the protection of biomolecules from superoxide-induced damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Hopkin <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>). SodA, like SoxS, was among our list of significantly upregulated genes following norfloxacin treatment or CcdB expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). That damage to Fe&#x02013;S clusters was occurring as a function of gyrase poisoning was further supported by the observation that each component of the <italic>iscRSUA</italic> operon exhibited highly increased expression upon inhibition of gyrase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>SoxS has also been shown to activate expression of <italic>fur</italic>, a ferrous (II) iron-binding transcription factor that regulates the expression of iron uptake, utilization and homeostasis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Escolar <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Andrews <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). As highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, a number of Fur-regulated iron uptake-related genes were among those genes found to be significantly upregulated by norfloxacin or CcdB. Specifically, we observed increased expression of siderophore-based iron acquisition systems, including components of the Fe<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup>-siderophore receptor/permease Fec, Fep and Fhu families, as well as the energy transducing TonB&#x02013;ExbBD complex, which provides the energy required for active siderophore transport.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gyrase inhibition induces hydroxyl radical formation</title><p>In the Fenton reaction, free ferrous iron reacts with hydrogen peroxide to generate highly destructive hydroxyl radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Imlay, 2003</xref>). Superoxide, via oxidative damage to Fe&#x02013;S clusters and iron leaching, has been shown to play a critical role in the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Based on our microarray results and previous studies, we hypothesized that production of hydroxyl radicals may be the cytotoxic end product of a surge in superoxide and Fe&#x02013;S cluster cycling following gyrase inhibition. To detect the generation of hydroxyl radicals upon gyrase poisoning by norfloxacin or CcdB, we employed the fluorescent reporter dye, 3&#x02032;-(<italic>p</italic>-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">Setsukinai <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), which is oxidized by hydroxyl radicals with high specificity.</p><p>We detected a significant increase in hydroxyl radical-induced HPF fluorescence at both 3 and 6 h post-treatment of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> with norfloxacin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, expression of CcdB in wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> also resulted in a large HPF fluorescence increase at both 3 and 6 h post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, untreated cultures did not show any detectable increase in HPF fluorescence for the duration of our experiments. These data show that inhibition of DNA gyrase and the generation of double-stranded DNA breaks lead to environmental changes that promote the formation of deleterious hydroxyl radicals.</p><p>To demonstrate that generation of hydroxyl radicals was related to the Fenton reaction and an available pool of reactive iron, we repeated our HPF fluorescence measurements in the presence of the iron chelator, <italic>o</italic>-phenanthroline. This chelator has been previously used to block the effects of the Fenton reaction in bacteria exposed to hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Imlay <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Asad and Leitao, 1991</xref>) and to uncover the role of free radical damage in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b97">Yang <italic>et al</italic>, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">de Mello Filho and Meneghini, 1985</xref>). As anticipated, <italic>o</italic>-phenanthroline inhibited the formation of hydroxyl radicals following gyrase inhibition by norfloxacin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>) or CcdB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>) for the duration of the respective experiments.</p><p>To determine the effect of hydroxyl radical-induced oxidative damage on the survival of gyrase-inhibited <italic>E. coli</italic>, we performed growth studies in the presence of Fenton reaction-neutralizing <italic>o</italic>-phenanthroline. Addition of the chelator to cultures treated with norfloxacin significantly inhibited cell killing, essentially rendering the drug bacteriostatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). While the attenuation of cell death in CcdB-expressing cells was not as dramatic, we did observe a greater than 0.5-log increase in CFU/ml before recovery around 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Our findings thus provide strong evidence for the involvement of hydroxyl radicals in gyrase inhibitor-induced cell death.</p><p>Finally, to show that the observed generation of hydroxyl radicals following norfloxacin application was not related to direct redox cycling of the antibiotic, we examined hydroxyl radical formation and survival in two <italic>gyrA</italic> mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains; these strains, RFS289 (<italic>gyrA111</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">Schleif, 1972</xref>) and KL317 (<italic>gyrA17</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">Norkin, 1970</xref>), are both known to be resistant to the quinolone, nalidixic acid. Treatment with norfloxacin of both mutant strains did not result in loss of cellular viability, proving that these specific <italic>gyrA</italic> mutations likewise confer resistance to norfloxacin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). More importantly, we did not observe an increase in hydroxyl radical formation following norfloxacin treatment of these strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). These results clearly show that norfloxacin-mediated hydroxyl radical formation occurs only when cell death is observed and as a consequence of the interaction between gyrase and the gyrase inhibitor.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Iron misregulation following gyrase inhibition</title><p>As our hydroxyl radical-sensitive dye experiments revealed, Fenton-reactive iron plays a critical role in cell killing by gyrase inhibitors. To explore whether this hydroxyl radical-generating iron was derived exogenously (Fur-related uptake), endogenously (Fe&#x02013;S clusters) or from both sources, we first performed growth studies on a series of iron-related single-gene knockouts. To more rapidly perform genetic screening of knockout strains, we initially employed norfloxacin in our phenotypic analyses; the CcdB results are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>.</p><p>Previous work has shown that a deletion of the iron regulator, Fur, leads to an intracellular spike in the concentration of &#x02018;free iron' and potentiates oxidative damage to <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA (in a &#x00394;<italic>recA</italic> background) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b89">Touati <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>).

Following norfloxacin treatment, we observed a large, uniform increase in fluorescence from our Fur-regulated reporter construct, suggesting that gyrase inhibition promotes a breakdown in iron regulatory dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>); specifically, norfloxacin induced a 10-fold change, whereas the iron chelator, <italic>o</italic>-phenanthroline, induced a 100-fold change in fluorescence when compared with untreated fluorescence measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).

Knocking out this protein, which provides atomic sulfur during Fe&#x02013;S cluster assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b99">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), resulted in a near 2-log increase in viability for the majority of the experiment relative to norfloxacin-treated wild-type cultures. &#x00394;<italic>iscS</italic> cultures had a remarkably slow phenotypic response to gyrase inhibition, exhibiting less than 1-log of cell death within the first 4 h post-treatment. We also screened the effect of norfloxacin-based gyrase inhibition on a deletion mutant of the <italic>iscS</italic> paralogue, <italic>sufS</italic>. SufS is a component of the <italic>sufABCDSE</italic> operon, which is thought to handle Fe&#x02013;S cluster assembly not catalyzed by <italic>isc</italic> operon activity during normal growth and is considered to be required for Fe&#x02013;S cluster assembly in iron-limiting and oxidatively stressful conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Djaman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Outten <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).

Norfloxacin treatment of wild-type cells led to a near five-fold increase in fluorescence at 3 h and more than a 10-fold increase in fluorescence at 6 h when compared with untreated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>); CcdB expression also yielded increased fluorescence from our IscR-regulated reporter construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Oxidative attack of iron&#x02013;sulfur clusters</title><p>In light of our Isc-related results, we next sought to determine whether superoxide-based oxidative attack to Fe&#x02013;S clusters was indeed occurring by monitoring the activation of the superoxide response. To do so, we constructed a <italic>soxS</italic> promoter-<italic>gfp</italic> reporter gene fusion using the native <italic>soxS</italic> promoter region. This promoter is transcriptionally regulated by SoxR, and its activation is directly related to the redox state of SoxR (superoxide-related oxidation activates transcription; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Hidalgo <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). As expected, gyrase inhibition by norfloxacin resulted in GFP expression from this superoxide response sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>); more specifically, both norfloxacin and the superoxide-generating compound, paraquat (at a concentration of 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic><sc>M</sc>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), induced a 10-fold increase in fluorescence when compared with untreated cultures. We also observed increased fluorescence from our SoxR-regulated reporter construct following CcdB expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, our baseline (time zero) and untreated control measurements (at 6 h) were remarkably similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>).

The delay in the phenotypic response to norfloxacin treatment in this strain suggests that the generation of superoxide and superoxide-mediated oxidative damage does not occur immediately following gyrase inhibition. Rather, these data imply that oxidative damage is a secondary, yet quite deadly, effect of gyrase poisoning.</p><p>Previous work has established a link between DNA damage, SOS repair activity and bursting of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Barbe <italic>et al</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Dahan-Grobgeld <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Given the connection between the respiratory electron-transport chain activity and superoxide generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Imlay and Fridovich, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Messner and Imlay, 2002</xref>), we hypothesized that a plausible biochemical explanation for superoxide formation and Fe&#x02013;S oxidation after gyrase inhibitor-induced DNA damage was the increased production of ATP. To address this, we first measured cellular ATP levels in wild-type cells following gyrase poisoning by norfloxacin. Using a luciferase-based assay, we determined that at 1 h norfloxacin treatment induced a greater than 10<sup>2</sup>-fold change in moles of ATP/cell when compared with untreated cells; this difference increased with the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>To further explore our hypothesis, we next studied the effect of disabling ATP synthase assembly, and thus genetic-level uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, on gyrase inhibitor-mediated cell death. We challenged the majority of ATP synthase component genes with norfloxacin and observed increased survival (2-log increase in CFU/ml) in each case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). The most striking phenotypic change following norfloxacin application was exhibited by &#x00394;<italic>atpC</italic> cultures, where we observed complete reversal of bactericidal activity. In this strain we observed a 3-log increase in survival relative to norfloxacin-treated wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that efficient norfloxacin-based killing is directly dependent on ATP, supporting published <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Kampranis and Maxwell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Li and Liu, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we examined whether disabling the activity of TCA cycle component succinate dehydrogenase, also an aerobic respiratory electron-transport chain constituent, would affect cell survival following gyrase inhibition. The conversion of succinate to fumarate, catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase, involves three Fe&#x02013;S clusters (SdhB subunit) and has been shown to result in the generation of superoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Messner and Imlay, 2002</xref>); accordingly, we chose to study the effect of norfloxacin on the growth of &#x00394;<italic>sdhB</italic> cells in order to reduce both the level of endogenous Fe&#x02013;S cluster-bearing proteins and the production of superoxide. Compared with wild-type cells, norfloxacin treatment of &#x00394;<italic>sdhB</italic> cells led to a 1-log increase in survival at 1 h and a more modest 0.5-log increase at 6 h. We suspect that this effect may be increased by knockout of additional Fe&#x02013;S cluster-containing proteins and requires further investigation.</p><p>Together, these data suggest that gyrase inhibition promotes endogenous environmental changes that support the generation of superoxide radicals. Moreover, our findings help to provide an explanation for why the loss of superoxide dismutase activity (specifically that of SodB) enhances the killing effect of the gyrase poison, norfloxacin.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Hydroxyl radical production in <bold>&#x00394;</bold><italic><bold>atpC</bold></italic>, <bold>&#x00394;</bold><italic><bold>iscS</bold></italic> and <bold>&#x00394;</bold><italic><bold>sodB</bold></italic> cells</title><p>To validate the results of our genetic screening, we performed hydroxyl radical measurements, again using the reporter dye HPF, in the &#x00394;<italic>atpC,</italic> &#x00394;<italic>iscS</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>sodB</italic> knockout strains.

In this study, we sought to identify additional mechanisms that directly or indirectly contribute to gyrase inhibitor-mediated cell killing. Here, we show that oxidative damage by superoxide and hydroxyl radicals contributes to bacterial cell death following gyrase poisoning. Superoxide, generated as a by-product of aerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Imlay and Fridovich, 1991</xref>), will attack proteins containing Fe&#x02013;S clusters and oxidatively destabilize the cluster, often triggering the release of ferrous (II) iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Keyer and Imlay, 1996</xref>). Based on our phenotypic and microarray analyses, we propose that repetitious Fe&#x02013;S cluster oxidation and repair arises as a deadly and necessary adjunct that potentiates the killing ability of gyrase inhibitors. This cycling should serve to maintain a large pool of ferrous iron, which readily participates as a substrate in the Fenton reaction to produce hydroxyl radicals. Our results demonstrate that highly deleterious hydroxyl radicals, are in fact, generated through the Fenton reaction, upon gyrase poisoning. Based on our findings, we have constructed a model for a complementary bacterial cell death pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>), stimulated by gyrase inhibition, which involves ROS formation and a breakdown in iron regulatory dynamics.</p><p>In this work, we employed biochemical pathway and transcription factor regulatory classifications to identify functional modules within the transcriptional response in <italic>E. coli</italic> to gyrase poisoning and double-stranded DNA break formation.</p><p>This analysis revealed, as expected, that DNA lesion remediation and repair systems constitute a significant proportion of the quickest and highest responding gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Our microarray analysis also revealed enrichment for genes involved in oxidative stress responses, including the <italic>soxRS</italic> operon and <italic>sodA</italic>. Previous work has shown that a loss of chromosomal supercoiling, which occurs when gyrase is inhibited, results in the upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Dahan-Grobgeld <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>); we validate this finding in our present study, showing that gyrase poisoning rapidly results in a large increase in cellular ATP levels. The consequence of heightened ATP synthase and respiratory chain activity in an oxygen-rich environment is the expedited generation of the ROS, superoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Imlay, 2003</xref>). Here, we have shown that oxidative phosphorylation contributes to gyrase inhibitor-induced cell death, and that superoxide formation indeed occurs when gyrase is poisoned. With regard to oxidative phosphorylation, we found that blockage of succinate dehydrogenase activity led to a modest increase in cell viability whereas genetic-level uncoupling of ATP synthase activity resulted in a striking reduction of cell death following treatment with norfloxacin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). By employing a promoter-reporter gene fusion construct designed to respond to superoxide-related oxidation of SoxR, we were able to monitor the induction of the superoxide stress regulon as a function of gyrase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that our proposed oxidative damage cell death pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>) may exist as a maladaptive response to gyrase inhibitor-induced DNA damage in oxygen-rich environments.</p><p>Surprisingly, our systems biology analysis of the microarray data revealed that each component of the Fe&#x02013;S cluster repair operon, <italic>iscRUSA</italic>, was significantly upregulated, and that the transcriptional regulator of this operon, IscR, was statistically enriched. This finding implied that prolonged exposure of Fe&#x02013;S clusters to superoxide was occurring, as the Isc family of proteins has been shown to be critical to the repair of heavily oxidized Fe&#x02013;S clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Djaman <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). This result also suggested that redox cycling, where heavily oxidized clusters are replaced with newly synthesized clusters, was occurring and would thus provide intracellularly abundant superoxide with a steady supply of new substrates. In light of our &#x00394;<italic>fur</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>iscS</italic> results, however, it is necessary to amend our initial hypothesis. It has previously been shown that deletion of the master iron regulator, Fur, results in increased levels of intracellular iron, a function of increased iron procurement system expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b89">Touati <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). Interestingly, it has also been shown that Fe&#x02013;S cluster formation is related to Fur and that the overall number of Fe&#x02013;S clusters is decreased in a &#x00394;<italic>fur</italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">McHugh <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), similar to the effect on Fe&#x02013;S cluster number in a &#x00394;<italic>iscS</italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82">Schwartz <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Thus, our findings that cellular survival was increased following gyrase poisoning in &#x00394;<italic>fur</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>iscS</italic> cells imply that cell killing by gyrase inhibitors is intimately related to the number of intracellular Fe&#x02013;S clusters and not just their status.</p><p>These results raise the question&#x02014;whether the observed generation of hydroxyl radicals is related to repetitious breakdown and repair of damaged Fe&#x02013;S clusters (and thus an increased endogenous level of unbound ferrous iron) or is it possible that hydroxyl radical production is actually taking place at the exposed active sites of oxidatively-sensitive dehydratases (thus involving intact, yet perhaps unstable, 4Fe&#x02013;4S clusters). The latter scenario has previously been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Flint <italic>et al</italic> (1993)</xref>, and it helps to explain the resistance to gyrase inhibition observed in &#x00394;<italic>fur</italic>, and much more strikingly, in &#x00394;<italic>iscS</italic> cells. This hypothesis would also help to explain why ectopic overexpression of Fur in the &#x00394;<italic>fur</italic> background reverts norfloxacin-induced cell death to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, this latter scenario would be still consistent with our iron chelator result, in which <italic>o</italic>-phenanthroline prevents hydroxyl radical formation by sequestering any Fenton-reactive exposed iron in dehydratase Fe&#x02013;S clusters.</p><p>It is quite likely that these events would induce global iron misregulation and a disruption in iron metabolism. Indeed, our engineered iron regulatory reporter gene construct revealed that a breakdown in iron regulatory dynamics occurs when gyrase is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figures 5B</xref>). Specifically, increased Fur-related GFP expression implies less Fur&#x02013;Fe(II) complexes; however, this does not necessarily signify low internal concentrations of Fe(II) and may reflect an internal perception that increased uptake is necessary, or simply a sign that internal iron is &#x02018;stuck' in a redox cycle of Fe&#x02013;S cluster oxidation and repair and cannot be recognized and/or bound by Fur. It is plausible then that the misregulation of Fur-controlled iron uptake, utilization and maintenance genes may serve to amplify the oxidative potential by sustaining a pool of Fenton-ready &#x02018;free iron'.</p><p>As noted above, our proposed oxidative damage cell death pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>) appears to be a maladaptive response by aerobically growing <italic>E. coli</italic> to DNA gyrase inhibition and DNA damage formation by both a synthetic antibiotic and an endogenous toxin. The biochemical reliance of bacteria on Fe&#x02013;S catalysis, evolutionarily related to the oxygen-free and iron- and sulfur-rich environment that existed billions of years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Imlay, 2006</xref>), has predisposed these organisms to oxidative damage. This &#x02018;backdoor' appears to be exploited by gyrase-inhibiting bactericidal agents in exacting cell death, which may explain the dependence of quinolone antibiotics (i.e. ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Morrissey and Smith, 1994</xref>) on oxygen and aerobic growth for bactericidal activity. Our findings may contribute to the development of novel antibacterial therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b91">Walsh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">McAdams <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) that exhibit more efficient bactericidal activity.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the <italic>isc</italic> operon, which we implicate in gyrase inhibitor-mediated iron misregulation and redox cycling, is highly conserved in eukaryotes and is involved in mitochondrial Fe&#x02013;S cluster assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Muhlenhoff and Lill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Johnson <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Moreover, the production of ROS as a kill signal has parallels in apoptosis, and the relationship between ROS, specifically hydroxyl radicals, and mitochondrial breakdown is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b98">Zamzami <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Jacobson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Green and Reed, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Madeo <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">Simon <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Brookes <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).
