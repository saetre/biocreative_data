The amino acid sequence of the zinc finger portion of GKLF is closely related to several Kr&#x000fc;ppel proteins, including the lung Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor (LKLF), the erythroid Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor (EKLF) and the basic transcription element binding protein 2 (BTEB2). The DNA sequence to which GKLF binds has not been definitively established. In the present study we determined the DNA binding sequence of GKLF using highly purified recombinant GKLF in a target detection assay of an oligonucleotide library consisting of random sequences. Upon repeated rounds of selection and subsequent characterization of the selected sequences by base-specific mutagenesis a DNA with the sequence 5'-G/AG/AGGC/TGC/T-3' was found to contain the minimal essential binding site for GKLF. This sequence is present in the promoters of two previously characterized genes: the CACCC element of the beta-globin gene, which interacts with EKLF, and the basic transcription element (BTE) of the CYP1A1 gene, which interacts with Sp1 and several Sp1-like transcription factors. Moreover, the selected GKLF binding sequence was capable of mediating transactivation of a linked reporter gene by GKLF in co-transfection experiments. Our results establish GKLF as a sequence-specific transcription factor likely involved in regulation of expression of endogenous genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
