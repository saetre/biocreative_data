The dissemination and persistence of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>within a mammalian host is thought to be predicated, at least in part, on the organism's ability to bind molecules of the extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], inasmuch as these interactions have been shown to be important for other bacterial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Among various ECM components, <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>binds to type I collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the proteoglycan decorin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>proteins described as ECM-binding proteins include BBK32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], Bgp (<italic>b</italic>orrelia-<italic>G</italic>AG binding <italic>p</italic>rotein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], P66 (Oms66) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], <italic>d</italic>ecorin-<italic>b</italic>inding <italic>p</italic>rotein (Dbp) A, and DbpB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These proteins, and perhaps other as yet unidentified molecules, may play a significant role in the infectivity and pathogenesis phenotypes of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>.</p><p>Our laboratory has been interested in DbpA as a vaccine candidate for the prevention of Lyme disease and the contribution of DbpA and DbpB to <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>pathogenesis and infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Since their <italic>in vitro </italic>characterization as decorin-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the DbpA and DbpB lipoproteins have been implicated as potential contributors to adhesion and colonization of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>within mammalian hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The genes that encode DbpA and DbpB reside in an operon, <italic>dbpBA</italic>, on linear plasmid 54 (lp54) and are found within many <italic>B. burgdorferi sensu lato </italic>isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Neither protein is expressed by <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>within the tick vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], however, expression of <italic>dbpA </italic>(and presumably <italic>dbpB</italic>) is upregulated in the mammalian host after ticks deposit spirochetes into the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. DbpA and DbpB expression likely remains high for the duration of mammalian infection, as inferred by the presence of antibodies against both antigens in the serum of mice as late as one year after infection (Hagman, unpublished data). The presence of antibodies against DbpA in the serum of patients with late-stage, disseminated Lyme disease also is well-documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], providing added support for DbpA expression by <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>during chronic infection.</p><p>Although the combined data to date suggest an important role for the decorin-binding proteins of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>during mammalian infectivity, virtually all data inferring the importance of DbpA and DbpB thus far have been indirect. The first direct investigation into the role of the <italic>dbpBA </italic>operon in the infectious lifecycle of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>was carried out by Shi et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In this study, mutational analysis of <italic>dbpBA </italic>in <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>strain B31 indicated that neither DbpA, nor DbpB was essential in the murine needle-challenge infection model of borreliosis. However, there was evidence suggesting that these mutants exhibited a modest level of attenuation in immunocompetent mice. Unfortunately, a comprehensive 50% infectious dose (ID<sub>50</sub>) was not included in this report to further investigate this possible defect, nor was genetic complementation of the mutation performed. This latter point is of particular importance given the genetic plasticity of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>and the possibility that spontaneous loss of an endogenous borrelial plasmid might account for the apparent defect in this mutant. To more directly examine the role of both DbpA and DbpB in the murine/tick model of Lyme disease, a <italic>dbpBA</italic>-deficient mutant and a <italic>dbpA </italic>genetic complement of the mutant were generated in the infectious strain 297 of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. Phenotypic assessment of mouse needle infectivity by ID<sub>50 </sub>analysis and <italic>Ixodes scapularis </italic>tick colonization and tick-transmission capacity by the Bb297 <italic>dbpBA</italic>-mutant also were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Construction and characterization of a <italic>dbpBA</italic>-deficient mutant</title><p>To assess the roles that DbpA or DbpB play in the infectivity and pathogenesis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, we created a <italic>dbpBA</italic>-deficient mutant by allelic exchange of a P<italic>flgB</italic>-kan cassette for the majority of the <italic>dbpBA </italic>operon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

As a positive control, an additional five mice were inoculated with wild-type Bb297 at a dose of 10<sup>3 </sup>spirochetes (ID<sub>50 </sub>of approximately 50 spirochetes; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). The results are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Whereas the mice infected with 10<sup>3 </sup>of Bb297 showed culture positive ear punch biopsies at two weeks post-infection, needle challenge of na&#x000ef;ve mice with 10<sup>4 </sup>BbKH500 did not produce an infection in any mouse (n = 15), even when the infection was allowed to progress for 14 weeks. Seventeen mice challenged with 10<sup>5 </sup>and ten mice challenged with 10<sup>6 </sup>BbKH500 also did not show signs of infection (negative ear-punch biopsy culture) at four weeks post-challenge (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). However, after 10 weeks, three mice from the group infected with 10<sup>5 </sup>BbKH500 and two mice from the group challenged with 10<sup>6 </sup>BbKH500 were shown to be infected by positive ear-punch biopsy cultures. Additionally, mice were challenged with either 10<sup>5 </sup>or 10<sup>6 </sup>BbKH500 and ear-punch biopsies were harvested 14 weeks after infection (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). From the group that received 10<sup>5 </sup>spirochetes, two mice were infected (n = 10), and from the group that received 10<sup>6</sup>spirochetes, four mice were infected (n = 10). All of the mice challenged with 10<sup>7 </sup>of BbKH500 had positive ear-punch cultures as early as five-weeks post-challenge, and as late as 14 weeks post-infection (n = 5). These spirochetes from ear punch-positive cultures were analyzed by diagnostic PCR as described above, and confirmed to be Bb297 or BbKH500 (data not shown). Aliquots of these cultures also were passed to media containing kanamycin to confirm resistance and sensitivity of BbKH500 and Bb297, respectively. Seroconversion analyses performed on a subset of mice also revealed that none of the mice infected with BbKH500 showed antibody reactivity against DbpA or DbpB (data not shown). Furthermore, only mice that exhibited culture-positive ear punch cultures showed significant serum antibody reactivity with P39 (data not shown).

However, during genetic manipulation of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, it is not uncommon to lose one or more plasmid(s) which potentially contribute to infection, therefore genetic complementation is necessary to definitely ascribe the attenuated phenotype in BbKH500 to the <italic>dbpBA </italic>lesion. Although BbKH500 carries a mutation in both DbpA and DbpB, we chose to complement with only <italic>dbpA </italic>because i) DbpA is better characterized that DbpB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and ii) experimentation suggests that DbpA is the prominent Dbp in <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. To restore DbpA expression in BbKH500, a shuttle plasmid carrying a copy of <italic>dbpA </italic>driven by its native promoter was constructed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Since <italic>dbpA </italic>is the second gene in the <italic>dbpBA </italic>operon, we chose to clone the promoter for this operon upstream of the <italic>dbpA </italic>gene and then insert the fusion product in the multiple-cloning site of pJD51. BbKH500 cells were transformed with this shuttle plasmid (pKH2000), yielding clones resistance to both kanamycin and streptomycin. These transformants were screened by PCR to verify the presence of the complementing plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Clones shown to contain the complementing plasmid were checked for <italic>vlsE </italic>and <italic>pncA </italic>(Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.), as described above. PCR-based plasmid profiling, performed on one of the transformants that contained both <italic>pncA </italic>and <italic>vlsE</italic>, revealed a profile identical to the parent strain, BbKH500 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This clone, designated BbKH501, was selected for further analysis and DbpA expression was confirmed by both SDS-PAGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and immunoblot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Proteinase K digestion of BbKH501 and Bb297, under conditions that left FlaB intact, demonstrated surface exposure of DbpA in both strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Three groups of five C3H/HeJ mice were needle inoculated (i.d.) with BbKH501 at 10<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>3 </sup>or 10<sup>4 </sup>borreliae per mouse. Ear punch biopsies were harvested at either two weeks (10<sup>3 </sup>and 10<sup>4 </sup>doses) or three weeks (10<sup>2 </sup>dose); all 15 mice became infected, as confirmed by positive ear-punch biopsy cultures. Although a precise determination of the ID<sub>50 </sub>of BbKH501 could not be calculated, the fact the 100% of the mice were infected with 10<sup>2 </sup>bacteria suggests that the ID<sub>50 </sub>is less than 10<sup>2 </sup>spirochetes (4-logs lower than BbKH500). Aliquots of these cultures were passed to media containing streptomycin and kanamycin selection to confirm resistance. Diagnostic PCR also confirmed that the spirochetes growing out of the ear punch biopsy were BbKH501 (data not shown). Seroconversion analyses carried out on a subset of mice also revealed that the mice infected with BbKH501 showed antibody reactivity against DbpA, but not DbpB (data not shown). These data confirm that DbpA is necessary for wild-type levels of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>infectivity in mice when introduced via needle inoculation, and that DbpB is dispensable for this aspect of the infectious process.</p></sec><sec><title>Neither DbpA nor DbpB is required for acquisition of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>by ticks or infection of mice via tick bite</title><p>To determine whether <italic>I. scapularis </italic>ticks could acquire borreliae lacking <italic>dbpA </italic>and <italic>dbpB</italic>, na&#x000ef;ve larvae were allowed to feed to repletion on mice infected with BbKH500 or on mice infected with Bb297.

Microscopic examination of multiple fields revealed approximately one spirochete per field in the BbKH500-infected ticks (23 ticks examined), as opposed to 20&#x02013;30 spirochetes per field in the Bb297-infected ticks (10 ticks examined).

An additional two na&#x000ef;ve mice received five Bb297-infected ticks each. The ticks were allowed to feed to repletion, and at three weeks post-infestation, ear-punch biopsies were harvested from all mice. The ear-punch biopsies were cultured in BSK medium and the cultures examined by dark-field microscopy for the presence of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. These results are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. One of the two mice infested with five ticks harboring BbKH500 was infected as demonstrated by a positive ear-punch culture, and four of the six mice infested with ten ticks harboring BbKH500 were infected. Both of the mice on which the Bb297-infected ticks fed had positive ear-punch biopsy cultures. These spirochetes were analyzed by diagnostic PCR as described above, and confirmed to be Bb297 or BbKH500 (data not shown). Seroconversion analyses performed on a subset of the BbKH500-infected mice also revealed that none of the mice infected with BbKH500 showed antibody reactivity against DbpA or DbpB (data not shown). Furthermore, only mice that exhibited culture-positive ear punch cultures showed significant antibody reactivity against P39 (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that DbpA and DbpB are not essential for the transmission of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>from ticks to mice.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Assessing infectivity of BbKH500 via tick inoculation of C3H/HeJ mice</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Strain</td><td align="center">Ticks/mouse<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center">Mouse infectivity<sup>b</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Bb297</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">2/2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">BbKH500</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">1/2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">4/6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a </sup>Varying number of ticks infected with BbKH500 were allowed to feed to repletion on na&#x000ef;ve mice.</p><p><sup>b </sup>Infection rates were assessed at three weeks post-infestation by culturing BbKH500 from ear-punch biopsies</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The importance of ECM-binding proteins to the pathogenic strategy of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>is not currently known. It is presumed that borreliae bind mammalian host cells during infection because binding to various ECM molecules and to tissue culture cells has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Of the known ECM-binding proteins of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, Bgp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and BBK32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] have been deleted from infectious strains N40 and B31, respectively, and shown to be dispensable for infectivity in the mouse model of Lyme disease. A deletion of integrin-binding protein, P66, in a noninfectious strain of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, HB19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], caused the spirochetes to lose their ability to bind b<sub>3</sub>-chain integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] but the phenotype of a P66 mutant in an infectious strain of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>is currently unknown. The remaining two known ECM-binding proteins, DbpA and DbpB, were the focus of this work due to multiple lines of evidence suggesting a role for one or both proteins during infection of mammalian hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. To directly address the contribution of both DbpA and DbpB to <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>infectivity, we created BbKH500, a <italic>dbpBA</italic>-deletion mutant of the human isolate Bb297, and used this strain to challenge mice with increasing numbers of spirochetes. We observed a 4-log reduction in infectivity of the mutant strain when the spirochetes were needle inoculated into mice. Complementation of the <italic>dbpBA</italic>-mutant with DbpA alone in the <italic>dbpBA</italic>-mutant restored infectivity of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>to wild-type levels.</p><p>Prior to this work, Fischer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] had restored DbpA and DbpB expression (via shuttle plasmid) to <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>strain B314, a non-adherent, noninfectious derivative of strain B31 that has lost several plasmids, including lp54 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Although expression of the Dbp molecules restored binding of the spirochetes to purified decorin, dermatan sulphate, and human epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], experiments to test the infectivity of B314 expressing DbpA and DbpB in the murine model of Lyme disease were implausible due to the loss of plasmids that are required for mammalian infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. A recent study by Shi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] assessed the infectivity of a DbpA,B mutant of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>strain 5A18NP1, a B31 derivative that lacks the BBE02 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Based on needle-challenge results obtained from a single inoculation dose of 10<sup>5 </sup>bacteria (80% infection), Shi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] ascertained that the <italic>dbpBA </italic>locus was not required for infectivity. However, in the present study, we observed a 4-log increase in the ID<sub>50 </sub>of BbKH500 (&#x0003e;10<sup>6 </sup>bacteria) and a 19% infection rate with a dose of 10<sup>5 </sup>BbHK500 when mice were infected by needle inoculation. The reason for the difference in infectivity levels of the <italic>dbpBA</italic>-deficient mutants reported by Shi et al. and BbKH500 created in our laboratory is unknown at this time. One possible explanation for this disparity could be due to our use of Bb297 as the parental strain for the present mutational analysis, whereas Shi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] utilized a clonal derivative of B31 that is a BBE02-mutant. This variability also could be explained by spirochete enumeration differences prior to needle challenge. As mentioned in the Methods, significant attention was given to the enumeration of BbKH500 prior to needle inoculation of mice.</p><p>It should be noted that during the course of the study described herein, a subsequent report on the role of DbpBA was published by Shi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], which, unlike their previous study, included genetic complementation experiments. Our current findings agree with those of this most recent report in that Shi et al. also observed a 4-log increase in ID<sub>50 </sub>values with their <italic>dbpBA </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In addition, Shi et al. observed a defect in the ability of the <italic>dbpBA </italic>mutant to colonize heart, joint and skin tissues, suggesting an overall deficiency in dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The observation that mice infected with BbKH500 showed a delay in infectivity (10- to 14-weeks post-infection) also suggests that BbKH500 might be attenuated with respect to its capacity to disseminate through the host. However, whereas we were able to compensate fully for the loss infectivity in the <italic>dbpBA </italic>mutant by complementing with <italic>dbpA </italic>alone (as assessed by ear punch biopsy culture), Shi et al. reported that both <italic>dbpA </italic>and <italic>dbpB </italic>were required to restore the infectivity of their <italic>dbpBA </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Although the precise reason for this disparity is unknown at this time, there are several differences between the experimental approaches of these studies that might account for these differing results. First, it is possible that some intrinsic differences(s) in the bacterial strains utilized might account for the variation observed between these two studies. Specifically, as noted above, strain 297 was the parental strain used in the current study, and Shi et al. utilized a highly-transformable clone (5A13) of strain B31 that lacks both lp56 and the virulence-associated plasmid lp25 as the background for their mutagenesis experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Second, the disparity in our results might be due to the use of different strains of mice in these two studies; C3H/HeJ mice were used in our study, whereas Shi et al used BALB/c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This may be relevant because numerous studies have reported that experimental infection of C3H strains of mice with <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>results in significantly different disease pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], higher spirochetal loads in multiple tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and different cytokine responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] by comparison to similarly infected BALB/c mice. Although, it is difficult to precisely predict how the reported differences in pathogenesis observed in these two distinct murine backgrounds might be impacted by DbpA and/or DbpB during infection, it is reasonable to suspect that these differences might account for some of the disparity in the results of complementation experiments obtained in the aforementioned studies.</p><p>Even though DbpA was required for full infectivity by Bb297 in mice when introduced by needle inoculation (intradermally), neither DbpA, nor DbpB, was required for infection of larval <italic>I. scapularis </italic>ticks or for transmission of BbKH500 from infected ticks to na&#x000ef;ve mice. That DbpA was not required for uptake of the spirochetes by larval ticks was not surprising due to our earlier work demonstrating that DbpA is not expressed by <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>harbored within the tick vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, based on the data we obtained from needle inoculation of mice with BbKH500, it was surprising that as few as five nymphal ticks could transmit BbKH500. This is especially surprising because semi-quantitative analysis of the total number of spirochetes observed in the midguts of unfed ticks infected with BbKH500 showed a lower spirochete density (approx. 1/field) by comparison to number of bacteria present in the dissected midguts of the Bb297-infected ticks (20&#x02013;30/field). While these data might suggest a possible defect in either the efficiency of acquisition of the <italic>dbpBA </italic>mutant or the capacity of this mutant to persist in the tick midgut, there were still sufficient numbers of the mutant spirochetes in these ticks to infect na&#x000ef;ve mice. Since it is not known precisely how many spirochetes are transmitted by ticks during the feeding process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], it was impossible to directly compare the number of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>transmitted by tick bite to our needle-challenge experiments. Spirochete numbers within salivary glands during tick feeding have been estimated between 20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and 61 spirochetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] per salivary gland pair. These data suggest that an individual tick deposits far fewer than 10<sup>4 </sup>spirochetes during the feeding process, and our results have shown that by the needle-inoculation route, 10<sup>4 </sup>BbKH500 are not infectious.</p><p>In addition to the data presented by Fischer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], additional reports have attempted to address the role of DbpA, DbpB, and the ECM proteoglycan, decorin, with respect to the infectivity and pathogenesis of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. Brown et al. described <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>infection of decorin-deficient mice (Dcn<sup>-/-</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Brown et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] found that, by comparison to Dcn<sup>+/+ </sup>mice, Dcn<sup>-/- </sup>mice challenged with a higher dose of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>(10<sup>4</sup>) had i) fewer infected joints, ii) a reduction in the severity of arthritis, but iii) no significant defect in colonization of the other tissues. Whereas 10<sup>4 </sup>wild-type <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>were infectious for Dcn<sup>-/- </sup>mice in the studies by Brown et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], the Bb297 <italic>dbpBA</italic>-mutant was unable to infect mice at this dose. When considered together, these data support the hypothesis that DbpA, in addition to binding decorin, may have an additional ligand(s) or has another function critical for infectivity. At the present time, the only other known ligand recognized by DbpA is the GAG dermatan sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], but the contribution of this interaction to the pathogenesis of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite the disparities between the results of the complementation experiments described in the current study and those obtained by Shi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], the overall results of our needle-inoculation experiments are in agreement with the most recent conclusion of Shi et al. that mutation of <italic>dbpBA </italic>results in significant attenuation of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>in the murine model of Lyme borreliosis. However, the observation that the <italic>dbpBA </italic>mutant showed a significant reduction in infectivity when the mice were needle inoculated is overshadowed by the finding that this same mutant was capable of infecting mice via tick challenge. The fact that DbpA and DbpB are dispensable for infection via the tick-mediated route of infection suggests that <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>transmitted via tick bite are in some way phenotypically different than their <italic>in vitro</italic>-cultivated counterparts, and/or that tick-derived salivary components, such as Salp15, may assist <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>during the early infection process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].

achieved by transforming electrocompetent BbKH500 with the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-shuttle plasmid, pKH2000. Because <italic>dbpB </italic>precedes <italic>dbpA </italic>in the native operon, it first was necessary to clone the promoter for the <italic>dbpBA </italic>operon directly in front of the <italic>dbpA </italic>gene from Bb297, thereby removing the <italic>dbpB </italic>gene. The <italic>dbpBA </italic>promoter region (Prom) was amplified by PCR using primers comp1 and comp2 and the <italic>dbpA </italic>open reading frame (ORF) was amplified using primer comp3 and comp4. To facilitate fusion of the Prom and <italic>dbpA </italic>open reading frame fragment, an <italic>Nde</italic>I restriction site was introduced into the 3' end of oligonucleotide comp2 and the 5' end of primer comp3. Following PCR amplification, the resulting PCR fragments were digested with <italic>Nde</italic>I and ligated together. A second PCR amplification was performed using the ligation product as the template and the oligonucleotides comp1 and comp4 for primers. The resultant PCR product was digested with <italic>Bgl</italic>II (a unique <italic>Bgl</italic>II site is located in the PCR product, 11 bp downstream of the 3' end of the comp1 primer) and <italic>Sph</italic>I (5' end of comp4 primer) then cloned into the <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Sph</italic>I sites of pJD51, a derivative of pJD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], that contains the <italic>aadA </italic>gene encoding streptomycin resistance in <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], to create pKH2000. Electroporation of BbKH500 was performed as described above and transformants were selected in the presence of kanamycin and streptomycin. Antibiotic-resistant clones first were checked for the presence of the Prom-<italic>dbpA </italic>construct by PCR using primers ko5 and comp5 (the latter anneals near the middle of the <italic>dbpA </italic>coding strand); Bb297 = 1.2 kb product; BbKH500 = no product; Prom-<italic>dbpA </italic>= 535 bp product. Next, DbpA expression in clones identified by PCR confirmation was assessed by immunoblot analysis as described below. Clones that expressed DbpA from the Prom-<italic>dbpA </italic>construct were assessed for the presence of the <italic>vlsE </italic>and BBE22 genes by PCR amplification using the primers described above. One clone, BbKH501, was chosen for further characterization. PCR-based plasmid profiling was performed on BbKH501, as described above, to compare the plasmid content of this clone to BbKH500 and Bb297.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteinase K digestion of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic></title><p>Intact, motile borreliae were exposed to 200 &#x003bc;g of proteinase K (40 mg/ml; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) or were sham treated for 40 min at room temperature. To stop the reaction, 10 &#x003bc;l of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 mg/ml in isopropanol; Sigma) was added to each sample and the bacteria prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblot analysis as described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p><italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>whole-cell lysates were generated by washing the spirochetes with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) three times, incubating the cells in BugBuster plus Benzonase solution (Novagen, Madison, WI) overnight then adding an equal volume of 2&#x000d7; SDS-PAGE running buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) for a final concentration of 10<sup>7 </sup>bacteria/ml. Whole-cell lysates were separated via electrophoresis through 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (approximately 10<sup>7 </sup>spirochetes per lane) and transferred to nitrocellulose (0.45 &#x003bc;m; Bio-Rad Laboratories) for immunoblot analysis. Nitrocellulose membranes were probed with either 6B3-DbpA, a mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes DbpA, chicken anti-<italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>FlaB IgY, or rat anti-DbpB anti-sera. The monoclonal antibody, 6B3-DbpA, was produced in collaboration with the Antibody Production Core facility at UT Southwestern and the polyclonal rat anti-DbpB antisera was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The chicken anti-FlaB antibody was produced in collaboration with Lampire Biological Laboratories (Pipersville, PA). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), donkey anti-chicken IgY, or goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) diluted 1:10,000&#x02013;1:30,000 for chemiluminescent detection. Immunoblots were developed using Immobilon Chemiluminescent Western HRP Substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and exposed to X-ray film (Phenix Research Products, Hayward, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Infection of mice by needle inoculation</title><p>Prior to use of the cultures in needle-inoculation experiments, the bacterial cell density in each culture was accurately determined by counting spirochetes in no fewer than 60 microscopic fields (400&#x000d7; magnification) using dark-field microscopy. Cultures exhibiting cell aggregation were not used for infections as the presence of clumps prevented accurate enumeration of spirochete density. Cultures with spirochetes exhibiting reduced motility also were not used for mouse infections. Three- to five-week-old female C3H/HeJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used for all studies. Mice were infected via intradermal injection with serial dilutions of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>in BSK medium as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. At the appropriate time intervals, ear-punch biopsies were harvested using a 2 mm ear punch, placed in BSK-H medium supplemented with BAM, and cultures were examined by dark-field microscopy for the presence of spirochetes. Aliquots of each culture were passed to media containing antibiotics to confirm the antibiotic-resistance phenotype of the bacteria that were recovered from cultures of the ear punch biopsies. The ID<sub>50 </sub>was calculated using the method described by Reed and Muench [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. UT Southwestern is accredited by the International Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animals Care (AAALAC) and all animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at UT Southwestern.</p></sec><sec><title>Colonization of <italic>Ixodes scapularis </italic>larvae with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic></title><p>Female C3H/HeJ mice were needle inoculated as described above with either Bb297 (10<sup>4 </sup>spirochetes) or BbKH500 (100 &#x003bc;l of a post-exponential growth phase culture; 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7 </sup>spirochetes). Infection of mice was confirmed by ear-punch biopsy culture; 4- and 8-weeks post-inoculation for Bb297 and BbKH500, respectively. Na&#x000ef;ve, pathogen-free <italic>I. scapularis </italic>larvae, obtained from the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology at Oklahoma State University (Stillwater, OK), were allowed to feed to repletion on the infected mice individually housed in cages with raised wire-bottoms above water to facilitate recovery of the ticks. Fed larvae were collected and washed sequentially with 70% ethanol, deionized water (dH<sub>2</sub>O), 1&#x000d7; Fungizone (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA), and dH<sub>2</sub>O before placing them in 100% cotton fabric-lined Petri dish molting chambers for storage until they molted to the nymphal stage. The molting chambers containing the ticks were housed in a humidified chamber (97&#x02013;98% humidity) containing saturated potassium sulfate solution at 20&#x000b0;C with a 16 h light, 8 h dark cycle. Unfed nymphs were collected and stored in autoclaved glass vials containing approximately 1 cm of sand. The vials were closed with vented lids and the ticks housed as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Direct immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-infected ticks</title><p>Prior to placement of unfed (flat) nymphs on na&#x000ef;ve mice, five nymphs from each of two individual mice were dissected on silylated slides (CEL Associates, Inc., Pearland, TX) in 50 &#x003bc;l phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. At the time testing was performed, approximately 11 weeks had elapsed since these ticks had fed to repletion as larvae. Midgut tissues were extracted from the ticks, allowed to dry on the slides, blocked with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20, then probed with a FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-<italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>antibody (Fitzgerald Industries International, Inc., Concord, MA) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Transmission of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>from infected nymphal ticks to na&#x000ef;ve mice</title><p>To assess the transmissibility of strain Bb297 and BbKH500 from flat nymphs to na&#x000ef;ve mice, either five or ten ticks were allowed to feed to repletion on three- to five-week-old female C3H/HeJ mice. At three-weeks post-infestation, ear-punch biopsies were harvested from each mouse and cultured in BSK-H medium without antibiotics to determine infection status. Borreliae from the ear-punch biopsy cultures were transferred to BSK-H medium supplemented with kanamycin and streptomycin to confirm their antibiotic-resistance phenotypes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with assistance from the UT Southwestern Clinical Sciences Department.
