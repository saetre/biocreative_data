Salicylic acid (SA) and its associated proteinaceous signaling components, including enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1), non&#x02013;race-specific disease resistance 1 (NDR1), phytoalexin deficient 4 (PAD4), senescence associated gene 101 (SAG101), and EDS5, have been identified as components of resistance derived from many R proteins. Here, we show that EDS1 and SA fulfill redundant functions in defense signaling mediated by R proteins, which were thought to function independent of EDS1 and/or SA. Simultaneous mutations in EDS1 and the SA&#x02013;synthesizing enzyme SID2 compromised hypersensitive response and/or resistance mediated by R proteins that contain coiled coil domains at their N-terminal ends. Furthermore, the expression of <italic>R</italic> genes and the associated defense signaling induced in response to a reduction in the level of oleic acid were also suppressed by compromising SA biosynthesis in the <italic>eds1</italic> mutant background.

Present understanding of plant defense signaling pathways places salicylic acid and enhanced disease susceptibility 1 downstream of resistant protein activation. In addition, enhanced disease susceptibility 1 is primarily thought to function in the signaling initiated via Toll-interleukin 1-receptor type of resistance proteins. Here, we show that salicylic acid and enhanced disease susceptibility 1 serve redundant functions in defense signaling mediated by coiled-coil-domain containing resistance proteins that were thought to function independent of enhanced disease susceptibility 1. Furthermore, resistance signaling induced under low oleic acid conditions also requires enhanced disease susceptibility 1 and salicylic acid in a redundant manner, but these components are required upstream of resistance gene expression. Together, these results show that the functional redundancy between salicylic acid and enhanced disease susceptibility 1 has precluded their detection as required components of many resistance protein&#x02013;signaling pathways.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants have evolved highly specific mechanisms to resist pathogens. One of the common ways to counter pathogen growth involves the deployment of resistant (R) proteins, which confer protection against specific races of pathogens carrying corresponding avirulence (<italic>Avr</italic>) genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Flor1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Following recognition of the pathogen, one or more signal transduction pathways are induced in the host plant and these lead to the prevention of colonization by the pathogen. Induction of defense responses is often accompanied by localized cell death at the site of pathogen entry. This phenomenon, termed the hypersensitive response (HR), is one of the earliest visible manifestations of induced defense reactions and resembles programmed cell death in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Flor1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Gray1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Concurrent with HR development, defense reactions are triggered in both local and distant parts of the plant and accompanied by a local and systemic increase in endogenous salicylic acid (SA) levels and the upregulation of a large set of defense genes, including those encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Ward1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Uknes1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The SA signal transduction pathway plays a key role in plant defense signaling (see reviews in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Durrant1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Kachroo2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>).

Conversely, the NDR1 (<underline>N</underline>on-race-specific <underline>D</underline>isease <underline>R</underline>esistance) protein is required for many R proteins that contain coiled-coil (CC) domains at their N-terminal ends.

The altered defense-related phenotypes in <italic>ssi2</italic> plants can be rescued by restoring the 18&#x02236;1 levels via second site mutations in genes encoding a glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) acyltransferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Kachroo4">&#x0005b;<italic>ACT1</italic>, 30&#x0005d;</xref>, a G3P dehydrogenase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Kachroo5">&#x0005b;<italic>GLY1</italic>, 31&#x0005d;</xref>, and an acyl carrier protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Xia1">&#x0005b;<italic>ACP4</italic>, 35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, a mutation in <italic>acp4</italic> produces similar phenotypes as the <italic>act1</italic> mutant and suppresses <italic>ssi2</italic>-mediated signaling by increasing 18&#x02236;1 levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Xia1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. A mutation in <italic>GLY1</italic> also restores 18&#x02236;1 levels in <italic>ssi2 gly1</italic> plants because it disrupts the formation of G3P from dihydroxyacetone phosphate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Kachroo5">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Reduced availability of G3P in turn impairs the ACT1-catalyzed reaction resulting in accumulation of 18&#x02236;1 in <italic>ssi2 gly1</italic> plants. Concurrently, increasing the endogenous G3P levels via exogenous application of glycerol reduces 18&#x02236;1 levels and induces <italic>ssi2</italic>-like phenotypes in wt plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Kachroo5">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Kachroo8">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, we showed that pathogen resistance induced via this mode bypasses the requirement for components that are normally required for signaling downstream of R protein activation.

In this study, we have characterized the relationship between EDS1 and SA. We show that the two components act in a redundant, and not necessarily sequential manner to regulate <italic>R</italic> gene expression induced in response to a reduction in the levels of the FA 18&#x02236;1. Furthermore, EDS1 and SA also function redundantly in <italic>R</italic> gene-mediated defense against viral, bacterial and oomycete pathogens. It appears that the redundant functions of EDS1 and SA may have prevented their identification as required components for signaling mediated by CC-NBS-LRR R proteins. Indeed, <italic>RPS2</italic>-mediated signaling is fully compromised only in <italic>eds1 sid2</italic> and not in the single mutant plants. Similarly, <italic>HRT</italic>-mediated signaling leading to HR formation and <italic>PR-1</italic> gene expression is only affected in <italic>eds1 sid2</italic> plants, while <italic>eds1</italic> or <italic>sid2</italic> plants behave similar to wt plants. Furthermore, <italic>RPP8</italic>-mediated resistance, which was previously reported not to require EDS1 or SA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Aarts1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-McDowell1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, is compromised in plants lacking both EDS1 and SA. In contrast to their effect on <italic>R</italic> gene-mediated resistance, loss of both EDS1- and SA-dependent signals did not additively lower basal resistance to <italic>P. syringae</italic> or TCV. Together, these data suggests that the redundant functions of EDS1 and SA might be relevant only for <italic>R</italic> gene-mediated signaling.</p><p>In contrast to SA application, overexpression of <italic>EDS1</italic> was unable to confer increased resistance to the avirulent pathogen <italic>P. syringae</italic>. Furthermore, unlike SA, overexpression of <italic>EDS1</italic> was not associated with the induction of <italic>PR-1</italic> gene expression. These findings, together with the observation that SA was able to induce <italic>EDS1</italic> expression and that SA application on wt plants resulted in higher resistance than that in <italic>eds1</italic>, suggests that SA feedback regulates EDS1-derived signaling in a unidirectional manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000545-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Thus, SA application induces both SA- and EDS1-derived signaling, the additive effects of which enhance resistance in wt plants much more than in <italic>eds1-22</italic> plants.

This suggests that the second <italic>EDS1</italic> allele in the Col-0 ecotype might also contribute towards the resistance response. This is consistent with another study where constitutive defense phenotypes due to the overexpression of the <italic>SNC1</italic> gene, encoding a TIR-NBS-LRR R protein, are not completely suppressed by a mutation in <italic>eds1</italic> in the Col-0 background but restored by the <italic>eds1</italic> mutation in the Ws background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Yang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The inability to accumulate SA together with a mutation in <italic>EDS1</italic> was also required to suppress constitutive defense signaling resulting from the overexpression of <italic>R</italic> genes induced in response to reduced 18&#x02236;1 levels. Although <italic>eds1</italic> or <italic>sid2</italic> plants were entirely competent in inducing <italic>R</italic> gene expression in response to a reduction in 18&#x02236;1, <italic>eds1 sid2</italic> plants were not.

Moreover, treatment of <italic>ssi2 eds1 sid2</italic> plants with exogenous SA restored <italic>R</italic> transcript induction and cell death in these plants. The fact that glycerol treatment is unable to induce <italic>R</italic> gene expression in <italic>eds1 sid2</italic> plants supports the possibility that EDS1 and SA function upstream of, and not merely serve as a feedback loop in, <italic>R</italic> gene induction. Signaling induced by low 18&#x02236;1 levels continues to function in the absence of SA, suggesting a novel SA-independent role for EDS1 in defense signaling.</p><p>Since <italic>ssi2 eds1 sid2</italic> plants contain a mixed ecotypic background (N&#x000f6;, Ws/L<italic>er</italic>, Col-0, ecotypes), it is possible that ecotypic variations in various genetic backgrounds resulted in the restoration of <italic>ssi2</italic>-triggered defense phenotypes. Indeed, phenotypic variations amongst different Arabidopsis ecotypes have been associated with many physiological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Yang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Sandra1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, since <italic>ssi2 EDS1 SID2</italic>, <italic>ssi2 EDS1 sid2</italic> or <italic>ssi2 eds1 SID2</italic> plants (F2 population) always exhibited <italic>ssi2</italic>-like phenotypes, it is highly unlikely that ecotypic variations resulted in the restoration of phenotypes in <italic>ssi2 eds1 sid2</italic> plants. The effect of ecotypic variations on the observed phenotypes can be further ruled out for the following reasons. First, the effects of different mutations were assessed in multiple backgrounds. For example, we used both <italic>eds1-1</italic> (Ws-0 ecotype) and <italic>eds1-2</italic> (L<italic>er</italic> ecotype) alleles in <italic>ssi2 sid2</italic> (N&#x000f6;, Col-0 ecotypes) and <italic>ssi2 nahG</italic> (N&#x000f6; ecotype) backgrounds and all combinations of <italic>ssi2</italic> with <italic>eds1-1/eds1-2</italic> and <italic>sid2/nahG</italic> produced similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000545.s006">Table S1</xref>). Second, all defense phenotypes were assessed over three generations using multiple progeny. Third, similar results were obtained when different ecotypic backgrounds were evaluated for their response to different pathogens. For example, <italic>eds1 nahG</italic> or <italic>eds1 sid2</italic> backgrounds conferred increased susceptibility to <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic>, <italic>P. syringae</italic> and TCV, even though only the genotypes used for TCV were of mixed ecotypic backgrounds. Fourth, F2 plants containing wild-type alleles behaved like wild-type parents. Finally, the effects of various mutant backgrounds on <italic>ssi2</italic> phenotypes were also confirmed by glycerol application on individual mutants.</p><p>Although glycerol treatment failed to induce <italic>R</italic> gene expression in <italic>eds1 sid2</italic> plants, it did induce cell death. This is in contrast to the absence of a cell death phenotype in <italic>ssi2 eds1 sid2</italic> leaves. One possibility is that the glycerol-triggered cell death is not due to a reduction in 18&#x02236;1 levels. However, significant overlap between <italic>ssi2</italic>- and exogenous glycerol-triggered signaling pathways lessens such a possibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Kachroo8">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternate possibility is that, while EDS1 affects a majority of the responses induced by low 18&#x02236;1 levels, the cell death phenotype is also governed by some additional molecular factor(s). This is supported by the fact that <italic>ssi2 pad4 sid2</italic> plants exhibit improved morphology and reduced cell death even though they are not restored for other defense-related phenotypes.</p><p>Since the overexpression of <italic>R</italic> genes can initiate defense signaling in the absence of a pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Yang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Stokes1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that the induced defense responses in <italic>ssi2</italic> plants are the result of increased <italic>R</italic> gene expression. This idea is supported by the fact that <italic>ssi2</italic>-related phenotypes can be normalized by restoring <italic>R</italic> gene expression to wt-like levels, irrespective of their 18&#x02236;1 levels. Thus, wt-like defense phenotypes are restored in suppressors containing high 18&#x02236;1 levels, such as <italic>ssi2 act1</italic>, <italic>ssi2 gly1</italic> or <italic>ssi2 acp4</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Kachroo4">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Kachroo5">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Xia1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as in suppressor containing low 18&#x02236;1 levels, such as <italic>ssi2 eds1 sid2</italic> (this work) and restored in defective crosstalk (<italic>rdc</italic>) 2 (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000545-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). We have also characterized additional <italic>ssi2</italic> suppressors that show wt-like phenotypes even though they contain low 18&#x02236;1 levels and express <italic>R</italic> genes constitutively (<italic>rdc3</italic>, <italic>rdc4</italic>). Together, these results suggest that the <italic>ssi2</italic>-associated phenotypes can be restored by normalizing <italic>R</italic> gene expression to wt-like levels either by increasing 18&#x02236;1 levels, impairing factors downstream of signaling induced by low 18&#x02236;1 levels, or impairing events downstream of <italic>R</italic> gene expression induced by low 18&#x02236;1 levels.</p><p>In addition to 18&#x02236;1 levels or <italic>R</italic> gene expression, <italic>ssi2</italic>-related defense signaling could also be normalized by altering some factor(s) that function downstream of <italic>R</italic> gene induction. Indeed, our preliminary characterizations have identified additional <italic>ssi2</italic> suppressors that yield wt-like phenotypes with regards to defense signaling but continue to express <italic>R</italic> genes at high levels. Reduced 18&#x02236;1 levels may induce defense signaling by directly regulating the transcription of activators or suppressors of defense gene expression. This is supported by the fact that 18&#x02236;1-mediated activation of a transcription factor induces the expression of genes required for neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-RodriguezRodriguez1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, in <italic>Sacharromyces cerevisiae</italic> as well as mammalian cells, binding of 18&#x02236;1 to specific transcription factors induces the transcription of genes carrying 18&#x02236;1 responsive elements in their promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Stremmel1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000545-Svanborg1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.

Reduced 18&#x02236;1 might also directly activate/inhibit/alter protein activities.

Indeed, we have also identified several Arabidopsis proteins for which enzymatic activities are inhibited upon binding to 18&#x02236;1 (unpublished data).</p><p>In conclusion, results presented here redefine the currently accepted pathway for SA-mediated signaling by showing that EDS1 and SA play a redundant role in plant defense mediated by R proteins and in signaling induced by low 18&#x02236;1 fatty acid levels. Further biochemical characterization should help determine if 18&#x02236;1 binds to EDS1 and if cellular levels of 18&#x02236;1 modulate the as yet undetected lipase activity of EDS1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant growth conditions and genetic analysis</title><p>Plants were grown in MTPS 144 Conviron (Winnipeg, MB, Canada) walk-in-chambers at 22&#x000b0;C, 65&#x00025; relative humidity and 14 hour photoperiod.
