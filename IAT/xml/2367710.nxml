We overexpressed Mus81-Mms4 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, purified the heterodimer to apparent homogeneity, and performed a classical enzymological characterization. Kinetic analysis (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) demonstrated that Mus81-Mms4 is catalytically active and identified three substrate classes <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Support of DNA replication and the generation of pathological genetic changes by inappropriate applications of recombination during fork recovery may have important consequences to genetic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). As an endonuclease that incises DNA joint molecules associated with replication fork recovery and recombination, Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 is likely a central factor in eukaryotic replication fork support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12">9&#x02013;12</xref>). Its substrate(s) <italic>in vivo</italic>, however, are still uncertain. Biochemical studies <italic>in vitro</italic> demonstrate that the enzyme can cleave a number of DNA joint structures, but a quantitative enzymological analysis determining kinetic parameters for the native enzyme has been lacking.</p><p>DNA molecules exchange homologous sequence information during recombinational repair and damage tolerance mechanisms, and undertake structural interactions that require phosphodiester bond hydrolysis for separation. In the traditional double-strand break repair model, the interacting DNA molecules must be separated either by reversal of strand exchange (D-loop disruption), by dissolution (BLM-TOPOIII&#x003b1;) or by endonucleolytic incision of the structure(s) joining the duplex molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Prevailing models for DNA double-strand break repair have postulated that a single, symmetric intermediate DNA joint molecule, the Holliday junction, is the target for endonucleolytic separation of the joined duplex molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>). Support for the existence of this structure comes from physical analyses in bacteria and yeast and from the biochemical description of several endonucleases that deliver paired, symmetric incisions across a four-way branch point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Endonucleases that incise Holliday junctions have been characterized from bacteria (RuvC and RusA), archaea (Hjc and Hje) and bacteriophages (T4 endonuclease VII and T7 endonuclease I), but candidate nuclear enzymes have been absent from eukaryotic sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). To date, no sequence ortholog of any of the characterized resolvases has been recognized in eukaryotes, apart from the mitochondrial Cce1 that appears to be of bacterial origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>In association with its interaction partner Mms4 in budding yeast and Eme1 in fission yeast and humans, Mus81 is a facultative associate of the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group and has been proposed to be a eukaryotic candidate for Holliday junction processing <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">19&#x02013;24</xref>). Biochemical support for this idea is uneven. Heterodimer preparations from partially purified, eukaryotic sources differ from most highly purified, recombinant sources in their ability to incise synthetic Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Mus81-Eme1 partially purified from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> by a tandem affinity purification protocol has shown a capacity to resolve model Holliday junctions to linear duplex products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Mus81-Eme1 recovered in recombinant form from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, however, showed nearly no activity on Holliday junctions <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Recombinant <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4 expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> was similarly inactive on the same Holliday junction substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In the case of human Mus81-Eme1, endogenous complex immunoprecipitated or fractionated from HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and recombinant complex immunoprecipitated from a eukaryotic expression source (insect Sf9 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) has shown an incision capacity on model Holliday junctions, but no Holliday junction incision has been observed for recombinant human complex expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>What explains the difference between eukaryotic sources of Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 and recombinant sources in Holliday junction incision activity? One possibility has been the presence of post-translational modifications available in eukaryotic expression systems, but not in <italic>E. coli.</italic> Another concerns the association of an unidentified junction-targeting factor in partially pure eukaryotic enzyme preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Still, another possibility relates to the presence of factors in the partially purified preparations that alter junction presentation to Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 by nickase or helicase activity. Most recently, an explanation for the difference between recombinant and endogenous heterodimer abilities to cleave Holliday junctions was proposed by isolation of the first recombinant <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Eme1/Mms4 fractions that exhibited Holliday junction cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Gaskell <italic>et al.</italic> suggest that purification procedures that selected for the endonuclease complex in an oligomeric state greater than the single heterodimer conferred Holliday junction incision ability, in a manner responsive to metal ion concentration.</p><p>Because most recombinant preparations incise Holliday junctions poorly, a number of alternative potential physiological targets of Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 have been proposed, including a 3&#x02032;-flapped structure, variants of a replication fork and the strand exchange intermediate, the displacement loop (D-loop). Whether partially purified from a eukaryotic source or purified from a recombinant source, all preparations of Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 are active on these substrates and it is only the Holliday junction activity that remains unclearly attributable to Mus81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25 B26 B27 B28 B29">23&#x02013;29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, the lack of a quantitative comparison (<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) does not allow one to distinguish whether substrate recognition or catalysis drives the distinction.</p><p>One approach to identify whether eukaryotic-expressed Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 is sufficient for Holliday junction processing <italic>in vitro</italic> is to isolate the heterodimer to apparent homogeneity from its eukaryotic expression source. This should distinguish whether eukaryotic expression alone is sufficient to confer Holliday junction resolution <italic>in vitro</italic>, or whether a state of partial purity is necessarily correlated with Holliday junction incision. Furthermore, a strategy to more clearly define Mus81-Mms4 substrate selectivity <italic>in vitro</italic> entails the design of kinetic assay conditions that supply a direct quantitative comparison among joint molecule substrates. Classically, enzymological assays demand stringency in substrate processing by presenting a limiting quantity of enzyme with an excess of substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Effective substrate processing is therefore demonstrated as turnover by a catalytic enzyme preparation.</p><p>We performed a kinetic analysis of Mus81-Mms4 cleavage, and present a quantitative comparison of its substrate selectivity. Mus81-Mms4 purified from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> exhibits low <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and correspondingly slow turnover on a number of substrates. The incisable joint molecules can be grouped into three classes by differences in <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>; differences among these substrates reveal the need for duplex DNA flanking the branch point for low <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>. Furthermore, we find that Holliday junction incision is not an enzymatic property of endogenous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81 endonuclease in isolation, and not a property likely to be conferred by post-translational modification of the heterodimer in response to genotoxic challenge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning of <italic>MUS81</italic> and <italic>MMS4</italic> into <italic>GAL1/10</italic> divergent promoter, 2<bold>&#x003bc;</bold>-based overexpression vector</title><p>The binary expression vector is based on pJN58, a 2&#x003bc; shuttle vector bearing the bidirectional yeast promoter <italic>GAL1/10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). pWDH619 (pJN58 with His10 insertion) was generated by removing the NotI fragment of pWDH423, blunted and cloned into the XbaI site (blunted) of pJN58. <italic>MUS81</italic> was PCR-amplified using Elongase&#x000ae; enzyme (Invitrogen&#x02122;) from plasmid pWDH484 (p<italic>GAL-MUS81</italic>, a kind gift of S.

To remove free glutathione, pooled fractions were dialyzed against 1 l PBS/500 mM NaCl with constant stirring for 1&#x02013;2 h, then dialyzed against an additional 1 l volume for 1 h. A 2 ml-bed volume Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA resin (Qiagen) was equilibrated with 10 mM imidazole (Fisher Scientific) in PBS/500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The dialyzed material was adjusted to 10 mM imidazole and loaded at 0.3 ml/min flow rate. The resin was washed with increasing imidazole stringency to 50 mM imidazole in PBS/500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5.

Following electrophoresis, DNA was identified in the PAGE-TBE gel by UV shadowing on Baker-flex&#x000ae; cellulose PEI-F thin layer chromatography paper (J.T. Baker). Bands corresponding to the fully annealed DNA structures were excised and stored at 4&#x000b0;C. For radiolabeled structures, the PAGE-TBE gel was exposed to Kodak Scientific Imaging film for 15 min. Fully annealed joint structure bands were excised using the processed film as a template on a light table. Completely annealed structures were verified by their slow electrophoretic mobility relative to structures annealed with all possible partial oligonucleotide compositions. Heat-denaturation of substrates verified their component strands. DNA joint structures were electroeluted from the polyacrylamide slice in a Millipore Microelutor in TBE buffer at 150 V for 2 h at room temperature or at 4&#x000b0;C. Samples were concentrated in the Millipore Centricon device by centrifugation in a Beckman Avanti J25-I centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 1 h to 1 h 45 min at 4&#x000b0;C.

For metal ion characterization, buffer composition was 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5/100 mM NaCl/1 mM DTT/0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml BSA (New England BioLabs) with the appropriate concentration of the metal acetate salt (magnesium acetate from Fisher; manganese and calcium acetates from Sigma-Aldrich). Aliquots of 0.5 &#x003bc;l were removed from each [substrate] reaction at 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min and quenched immediately into pre-aliquoted 0.5 &#x003bc;l volumes of 0.5&#x000d7; nuclease stop buffer (1&#x000d7; is 200 mM EDTA, 2.5% SDS, 10 mg/ml Proteinase K). Nine &#x003bc;l of DNA loading dye (5% glycerol/bromophenol blue) were added to each time point and samples were electrophoresed by 10 &#x000d7; 20 cm native 10% TBE-PAGE at 100 V for 65 min. Gels were equilibrated in 5% glycerol or 3% glycerol/20% methanol for 30 min and vacuum-dried to Whatman&#x000ae; paper at 65&#x000b0;C, then exposed overnight to a phosphorimager screen. For DL analyses, time point volumes were boiled in formamide/bromophenol blue for 2 min at 95&#x000b0;C before electrophoresis on a 7M urea/10% TBE-PAGE denaturing gel at 150 V for 40 min. These gels were equilibrated as described and vacuum-dried to DE81 anion exchanger chromatography paper (Whatman&#x000ae;).

Although physiological conditions are frequently cited as pH 7.5 with total ionic strength approaching 150 mM, some enzymes are especially active at pH regions outside this standard range. We therefore assayed Mus81-Mms4 initial reaction velocity on the 3&#x02032;-flapped substrate as a function of pH and ionic strength defined by NaCl concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). We chose buffers with pKa values that represented a pH span from 6 to 9, and titrated NaCl at 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 500 mM at every pH value represented across the buffers MES, PIPES, MOPS, HEPES, Tris&#x02013;HCl and TAPS. For the common biological buffers HEPES and Tris&#x02013;HCl, we assayed initial reaction velocity at several pH values defined at 30&#x000b0;C. First, we observed buffer-specific effects primarily at low pH. PIPES, pH 6.5 is an especially poor buffer for heterodimer activity. Reaction velocity is even poorer than in MES, pH 6.0, suggesting that low pH is not solely responsible for reduced activity. Nuclease activity improves at pH above 7.0, regardless of the buffer identity (Tris&#x02013;HCl, HEPES or TAPS). Heterodimer nuclease activity is most sensitive to increasing NaCl concentration at low pH, but becomes more resistant to increasing NaCl concentration at higher pH. Mus81-Mms4 shows improved activity at NaCl concentrations approximating physiological ionic strength, but becomes salt-sensitive at concentrations above 200 mM NaCl. Mus81-Mms4 nuclease activity is more robust in the face of increasing ionic strength at pH 8&#x02013;9. Taking these observations in sum, we chose assay conditions at 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5/3 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>/100 mM NaCl for nuclease incision assays, being optimal as defined for the 3&#x02032;-flapped substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Mus81-Mms4 is active on any tested DNA joint molecule that meets minimal criteria of a branch point coincident with a strand discontinuity</title><p>Having defined nuclease assay conditions that promote optimal reaction velocity on the 3&#x02032;-flapped substrate, we examined the heterodimer's substrate selection on a number of DNA joint molecules <italic>in vitro</italic>. A broad spectrum of DNA joint molecules is readily incised by limiting enzyme (5&#x02013;10 nM), including the 3&#x02032;-flapped (3&#x02032;-FL) and replication fork-like (RF-like) structures, nicked four-way junctions (nXO12), three-way junctions with 3&#x02032;- or 5&#x02032;-emanating single-stranded DNA (pXO12-3&#x02032; and pXO12-5&#x02032;), and the displacement loop structure (DL). All these structures share properties previously defined as relevant to Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 recognition and processing, primarily the presence of duplex DNA flanking a phosphodiester backbone discontinuity (nick), which defines a branch point from which emanates duplex or single-stranded DNA. In the case of single-stranded DNA, the polarity must be 5&#x02032; &#x02192; 3&#x02032; for optimal cleavage adjacent to the branch point, although this is less important in substrates with three duplex arms (pXO12 structures). Increasing the concentration of enzyme relative to substrate (20&#x02013;100 nM enzyme) broadens the class of substrates that can be readily incised by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4, including the 5&#x02032;-flapped (5&#x02032;-FL) and splayed arm (Y) joints. The apparent selectability of a joint molecule substrate can therefore be modulated by enzyme: substrate stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). These observations underscore the fact that Mus81-Mms4 is not structure-specific, but rather structure-selective, <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Mus81-Mms4 in isolation is not active on four-way Holliday junctions</title><p>Having shown that Mus81-Mms4 readily incises a number of DNA joint molecules <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that even structures that are not considered likely targets by structural criteria can be incised when heterodimer approaches or exceeds substrate concentration, we focused on the Holliday junction substrates that have been the most controversial substrate profiled by all reported Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 preparations. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> endogenous heterodimer is nearly inactive on intact four-way oligonucleotide junctions (Figures 3A and B, 4C). This is the case whether the branch point core is fixed at the junction of heterologous arms (XO12) or is free to branch migrate over a span of 12 bp homology shared by the emanating duplex arms (X12). Even at heterodimer: substrate ratios of 2:1, conditions that allow nearly complete incision of a 5&#x02032;-flapped substrate and splayed arm Y substrate, the Holliday junction structures are nearly untouched by Mus81-Mms4 nuclease. This is true for several preparations of Mus81-Mms4 isolated in our laboratory, ranging in concentration from &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;M to 3 &#x003bc;M heterodimer. We tested whether Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentration influences Mus81-Mms4 capacity to incise intact Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

Purified Mms4 can be collapsed to a species with faster relative electrophoretic mobility by treatment with phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Mus81 does not show a detectable electrophoretic mobility shift under the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conditions described. The shift of Mms4 is unlikely due to phosphorylation of GST, as other GST-fusions (Rad54, Rad57) do not show electrophoretic mobility shifts under similar treatment (W.-D.H., data not shown). In addition, mass spectrometric analysis of the purified complex identified a number of constitutive and DNA damage-induced phosphorylated serine and threonine residues on each Mus81 and Mms4 subunit (unpublished data). Mus81 and Mms4 also show electrophoretic mobility shifts <italic>in vivo</italic> in response to genotoxins including the alkylating agent MMS, the chemical UV mimetic 4-nitroquinoline (4-NQO) and the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C).

It is unclear whether the reduced activity of the heterodimer isolated from MMS-challenged cells reflects a physiologically relevant modification of enzyme behavior; the heterodimer isolated from HU-challenged cells shows nuclease activity similar to the heterodimer isolated from cells in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D and E). The reduced specific activity of the preparation from MMS-challenged cells may be associated with chemical modification of the complex by alkylation. In sum, these observations indicate that eukaryotic post-translational modification profiles constitutive to the overexpressed heterodimer complex or modification profiles induced by global genotoxic stress do not confer Holliday junction incision capacity as an enzymatic property latent to the heterodimer. Global dephosphorylation of the complex by PP1 phosphatase treatment also does not alter substrate selection as tested for 3&#x02032;-flapped and Holliday junction substrates (data not shown). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Mus81-Mms4 phosphorylation does not contribute to a capacity to incise Holliday junctions <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Some of these structural features have been defined, including foremost the presence of a hydroxyl or phosphate group at the 5&#x02032; deoxyribose position adjacent to a backbone discontinuity at a branch point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The discontinuity must occur at the junction of at least three DNA arms, two of which must be duplex DNA for optimal cleavage. We find that nevertheless, the splayed Y structure can be incised, although its initial binding parameter (<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) is highest of all tested substrates. This is consistent with the observation that duplex DNA 3&#x02032; to a structural branch point marked by a strand discontinuity is important for optimal enzyme binding to substrate.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> shows an example for a [substrate] versus velocity plot for the 3&#x02032;-flapped substrate. For the 3&#x02032;-flapped, RF-like, and pXO12 substrates, expression of the data points at concentrations up to 50 nM in an equation that describes a rectangular hyperbolic function using the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> calculated by non-linear regression shows that the data points are appropriately modeled by a rectangular hyperbolic function. Enzyme action on these substrates is therefore accommodated by an Henri&#x02013;Michaelis&#x02013;Menten kinetic model. The initial velocity at increasing substrate concentration (100 nM) is reduced relative to the maximal velocity defined by the rectangular hyperbolic region of the [substrate] versus velocity plot, which indicates that at high concentration of these oligonucleotide joint molecules, the endonuclease exhibits substrate inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the nicked four-way junction and D-loop structure, substrate inhibition occurs at 10-fold lower substrate concentrations (maximal velocity at 5 nM) relative to that observed for the 3&#x02032;-flapped, RF-like and pXO12 substrates. The substrate inhibition observed for Mus81-Mms4 may reflect the presence of at least two semi-independent binding sites for at least two discrete substrate regions. These binding sites may be shared between a single heterodimeric Mus81-Mms4 unit, or they may be shared between a homodimeric complex of two Mus81-Mms4 heterodimeric subunits. Analysis and possible implications of substrate inhibition on the mechanism of Mus81-Mms4 are the subject of further analysis to be reported in a subsequent manuscript. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>[Substrate] versus velocity plots for a catalytic preparation of Mus81-Mms4, optimized for pH, ionic strength and metal ion cofactor.

To our knowledge, we provide the first demonstration of catalytic turnover of DNA joint molecules by a native XPF-family endonuclease. We use this catalytic preparation to supply the first quantitative comparison of DNA joint molecule turnover by a native Mus81 preparation at apparent homogeneity, under conditions of limiting enzyme relative to substrate concentration. We first optimized assay conditions for buffer, pH, ionic strength and metal ion character. Because the anticipated <italic>in vivo</italic> concentration of a single substrate in a yeast nucleus is low (on the order of 0.5&#x02013;1 nM), there is no <italic>a priori</italic> expectation as to whether the enzyme should function catalytically or whether stoichiometric behavior is sufficient (presumably, stoichiometric behavior would be explained by some manner of hysteresis, in which the enzyme adopts an inactive conformation after a catalytic cycle). We show that Mus81-Mms4 performs catalytic turnover on a number of DNA joint molecules that meet minimal structural criteria. We further show that catalysis is not directed to model oligonucleotide Holliday junctions by native Mus81-Mms4 in isolation.</p><p>Substrates that are catalytically processed by the enzyme share low <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (on the order of 1&#x02013;7 nM) and correspondingly slow turnover (estimated on the order of 1&#x02013;4 min for 3&#x02032;-flapped, replication fork-like, nicked four-way, partial three-way and splayed Y junctions, and up to 10.8 min for the D-loop). Three substrate classes can be distinguished by their kinetic parameters <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>. Class I substrates (nicked Holliday junction, 3&#x02032;-flapped junction, and replication fork-like junction) are characterized by low <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (3&#x02013;7 nM) and highest <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (&#x0223c;1 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) among the substrates examined. Class II substrates (partial Holliday junction and D-loop) also demonstrate low <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> recognition by Mus81-Mms4 (1&#x02013;6 nM), but lower <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (&#x02264;0.3 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) relative to the Class I substrates. The splayed Y junction represents a Class III substrate that is poorly cleaved relative to Class I and II substrates, with both a higher relative <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (&#x0223c;30 nM) and low <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (0.26 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Comparing Class I and II substrates to the Class III Y substrate reveals that duplex DNA flanking the branch point is key to a low <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> parameter for Mus81-Mms4 substrates, although duplex DNA is not absolutely required 3&#x02032; to the branch point for turnover.</p><p>Despite the low <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for Class I and II substrates, the average <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> is several-fold greater than the anticipated substrate concentration on which Mus81-Mms4 is expected to act <italic>in vivo.</italic> This may imply that additional factors are needed to target the enzyme to its joint molecule substrate. Mus81-Mms4 was first identified by a physical interaction with the Snf2-like ATPase Rad54, a DNA translocase that promotes Rad51-mediated DNA strand exchange, heteroduplex extension and Rad51 turnover from the DNA strand exchange product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). This physical interaction may suggest a role for Rad54 in placement of Mus81-Mms4 at targeted substrates.</p><p>Our kinetic analysis of Mus81-Mms4 isolated from the cognate host demonstrates commonalities and interesting differences to a previous analysis of Mus81-Mms4 isolated from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). While the overall substrate selectivity of both preparations appears similar, including exceedingly poor cleavage of intact HJs, the absolute kinetic parameters differ substantially for any given substrate. Moreover, the response to NaCl (improved activity up to 150 mM within pH 7&#x02013;9 instead of inhibition), a more narrow magnesium optimum (3 mM) and discrimination between Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> as cofactors distinguish the native enzyme from the bacterial preparation. The reasons for these differences are unclear and may include the presence of different tags, post-translational modifications or differences in assay design and analysis.</p><sec><title>Mus81-Mms4 incises a broad class of DNA joint molecules <italic>in vitro</italic>, but not intact four-way junctions</title><p>Coordinated Holliday junction incision <italic>in vitro</italic> remains an activity that is difficult to attribute with certainty solely to Mus81-Mms4/Eme1. In cases where human HeLa cell Mus81 immunoprecipitates and partially purified <italic>S. pombe</italic> preparations show activity on Holliday junctions, the duplex products are gapped and flapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). These products differ from the nicked duplex products associated with symmetric incision by RuvC, RusA, Hjc, Hje and bacteriophage junction-resolving enzymes T4 endonuclease VII and T7 endonuclease I. This suggests that the Holliday junction incision observed for some Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 preparations (i) may occur in a manner distinct from that of other classified four-way junction-specific enzymes, (ii) requires other factors to impose symmetric and coordinated cleavage or (iii) is an off-target outcome of independent incision events that occur at high enzyme: substrate ratios or in the presence of assay components that alter four-way junction presentation.</p><p>We show that the apparent selectivity of the enzyme toward substrates can be modulated by protein: substrate concentration ratios. 5&#x02032;-flapped substrates have been poor substrates for nuclease incision and excluded as potential candidate <italic>in vivo</italic> targets. At protein: substrate concentration ratios greater than or equal to 1:1, however, even a 5&#x02032;-flapped substrate can be incised by endogenous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This demonstrates that protein: substrate ratios are in fact critical determinants to apparent selectivity <italic>in vitro</italic>. The direct comparison of Mus81-Mms4 substrate selectivity under conditions of limiting enzyme is therefore needed to more completely describe Mus81 biochemistry.</p><p>Despite the capacity of endogenous Mus81-Mms4 to incise a non-canonical substrate such as the 5&#x02032;-flap at high protein concentration, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4 is not active on synthetic Holliday junctions, even at excess protein: substrate ratios (2:1). Less than 2% substrate turnover can be demonstrated on 50 nM substrate with 2-fold excess enzyme; this is true for any Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentration tested from 1 to 20 mM. Hence the X12 and XO12 structures are inaccessible for <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> determinations. These observations suggest that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4 does not resolve model Holliday junctions, and by extension to <italic>S. pombe</italic> and human Mus81-Eme1, may suggest that the heterodimer alone is not responsible for the model Holliday junction processing observed in partially purified eukaryotic preparations. Gaillard <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) proposed that the inability of recombinant <italic>S. pombe</italic> and human Mus81-Eme1 preparations to cut model Holliday junctions could be explained by an inability of recombinant enzyme to make an initial nick in the junction core. In these studies, <italic>S. pombe</italic> Mus81-Eme1 has shown greater incision activity on X12 cruciform structures having 12 base-pair homologous cores that allow branch migration, as opposed to XO12 cruciform structures having a fixed branch point. X12 structures can undergo thermal breathing of the interior core with transient single-stranded DNA nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). These authors conclude that a coactivator in endogenous preparations may help Mus81-Eme1 open the Holliday junction core at the branch point, as a requirement for initial incision. Although our observations cannot exclude this possibility for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4, our Mus81-Mms4 preparation shows least activity on X12 junctions, and minimal activity on XO12 junctions. This may be explained by an absence of the coactivator proposed by Gaillard <italic>et al.</italic>, or it may alternatively be explained if the preferential incision of X12 substrates in partially purified endogenous preparations relates to a trace contaminating endonuclease that makes an initial nick at the transiently unpaired X12 core. Moreover, enzyme at high concentration excess as performed in these assays may have allowed incision of a partially unpaired (splayed) core, a behavior that is enhanced on the Y substrate in our assays with increasing heterodimer concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation status of endogenous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4 does not confer a latent Holliday junction incision activity to the endonuclease</title><p>Given that purified endogenous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4 shows weak activity on model Holliday junctions, we explored alternative global phosphorylation profiles of the native complex. Mus81 complex overexpressed and purified from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is multiply phosphorylated in a constitutive fashion on both subunits, but this apparently is not sufficient to confer a latent Holliday junction incision activity. Furthermore, enzyme overexpressed and purified from cells challenged by the genotoxin MMS exhibits a different phosphorylation profile, yet remains incompetent to incise Holliday junctions. The damage-modified complex, whether isolated from MMS- or HU-challenged cells, remains competent to incise other structures, however. Eukaryotic post-translational modifications in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are therefore not sufficient to explain the Holliday junction incision behavior described for partially purified heterodimer preparations from <italic>S. pombe</italic> and human HeLa cells. If Holliday junction incision is a latent activity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4, it likely requires an additional factor that functions by a mechanism that remains to be described.</p><p>Most challenging to reconcile at this time is the difference in our preparation and the recombinant preparation recently reported by Gaskell <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). These authors propose that recombinant preparations of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Mus81-Eme1 and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4 can incise Holliday junctions when a purification protocol has selected for oligomeric states greater than the single heterodimer, and that quaternary structural differences account for disparities in Holliday junction incision competence observed to date. Their gel filtration protocol isolated fractions containing Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 with weak Holliday junction incision ability; in these peak fractions, however, strand dissociation of a fraction of the model junction population can also be detected and gel filtration fractions were not normalized for protein concentration. This report further suggests that magnesium ion concentration modulates the oligomeric state of the enzyme, to explain the magnesium-response profile for Holliday junction incision observed in their recombinant preparations. Whereas nicked model Holliday junctions were incised over a broad range of magnesium concentrations (0.5&#x02013;20 mM), intact Holliday junctions were incised 3- to 4-fold more effectively at magnesium concentrations below 5 mM. Modulation of substrate selectivity by metal ion concentration is without precedent, and a mechanism for oligomerization in response to metal ion concentration remains to be explained. Rather than reflecting different magnesium optima for cleavage of different substrates by Mus81-Mms4/Eme1, the enhanced Holliday junction incision at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration may alternatively be interpreted as modulation of a trace activity that responds to metal ion concentration and may alter the substrate presentation to Mus81-Mms4/Eme1. Our results indicate that magnesium or manganese titration does not alter <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4 activity on model Holliday junctions. Furthermore, our operative conditions for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mus81-Mms4 biochemical assays are not consistent with a requirement for isolation above threshold protein concentrations. Our nuclease assays require dilution of the enzyme 200- to 500-fold for meaningful rate determinations on excess substrate, suggesting that enzyme concentration is not a primary limiting factor for catalytic activity and therefore not likely to bear on active oligomeric state.</p></sec><sec><title>The DNA structure selectivity of Mus81-Mms4 is likely to be circumscribed by protein&#x02013;protein interactions specific to the context in which the joint molecule is generated</title><p>Functional specialization of nucleases to targeted substrates has probably been permitted by virtue of an inherent plasticity in substrate selection. This plasticity explains Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 selectivity <italic>in vitro.</italic> Substrate specificity has been accomplished <italic>in vivo</italic> by specialization of paralogs in the context of pathways in which their DNA structural targets are generated. A component of the &#x02018;specificity&#x02019; of enzymes <italic>in vivo</italic> stems from their placement relative to potential substrates, and proximity may therefore become central to understanding how the apparent substrate selectivity of Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 <italic>in vitro</italic> is proscribed to a target or subset of targets in a context-specific manner <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Consistent with this restriction of substrate specificity <italic>in vivo</italic>, genetic studies indicate that Mus81-Mms4 has no role in 3&#x02032;-flap cleavage during single-stranded DNA annealing (SSA) in budding yeast, even though the 3&#x02032;-flapped structure is a biochemical target <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Instead, the evolutionarily related endonuclease Rad1-Rad10 is assigned to this pathway, and Mus81-Mms4 is not recruited to the 3&#x02032;-flap intermediates inherent to this Rad52-promoted context and cannot substitute in the absence of Rad1-Rad10. These observations underscore the probable role of protein&#x02013;protein interactions in the sanction of substrate specificity by evolutionarily evolved associations within pathways. Substrate assignment to Mus81-Mms4/Eme1 <italic>in vivo</italic> is most likely to be understood in context of the interacting proteins that generate the DNA substrates the endonuclease targets.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>Thanks are extended to Shamsher Samra, who generated the <italic>mus81-dd</italic> mutant during a UC Davis Young Scholars Program internship, and to Doug Huseby, who purified the mutant heterodimer.
