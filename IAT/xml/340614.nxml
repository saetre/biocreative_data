The enzyme is a tetramer consisting of two heavy and two light subunits. A large proportion of humans demonstrate genetic deficiencies in the production of myeloperoxidase. As a first step in analyzing these deficiencies in more detail, we have isolated cDNA clones for myeloperoxidase from an expression library of the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Two overlapping plasmids (pMP02 and pMP062) were identified as myeloperoxidase cDNA clones based on the detection with myeloperoxidase antiserum of 70 kDa protein expressed in pMP02-containing bacteria and a 75 kDa polypeptide produced by hybridization selection and translation using pMP062 and HL-60 RNA. Formal identification of the clones was made by matching the predicted amino acid sequences with the amino terminal sequences of the heavy and light subunits. Both subunits are encoded by one mRNA in the following order: pre-pro-sequences--light subunit--heavy subunit. The molecular weight of the predicted primary translation product is 83.7 kDa. Northern blots reveal two size classes of hybridizing RNAs (approximately 3.0-3.3 and 3.5-4.0 kilobases) whose expression is restricted to cells of the granulocytic lineage and parallels the changes in enzymatic activity observed during differentiation.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0141-a" xlink:role="2017"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0143-a" xlink:role="2019"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0149-a" xlink:role="2025"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2013"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2014"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2015"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2016"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2017"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2018"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2019"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2020"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2021"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2022"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2023"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2024"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2025"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2026"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2027"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00249-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2028"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
