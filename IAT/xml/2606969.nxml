In addition, through its control of nucleolar formation, rRNA gene transcription indirectly regulates several other essential processes, including titration of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, cellular response to stress, and aging (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moss, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mayer and Grummt, 2005</xref>).</p><p>A typical human cell contains &#x0223c;200 copies of the rRNA genes arranged in tandemly repeated arrays located in nucleolar organizing regions (NORs). Remarkably, despite rRNA gene transcription being limiting for growth, &#x0003e;50% of the rRNA genes are believed to be transcriptionally silent at any one time (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Grummt and Pikaard, 2003</xref>). The epigenetic mechanisms controlling the activity status of individual ribosomal genes and the reasons why a majority is silenced in higher eukaryotes remain unresolved questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>One factor whose function has been linked to regulation of the rRNA gene locus is upstream binding factor (UBF). UBF belongs to the sequence-nonspecific class of high mobility group (HMG) proteins and appears to function exclusively in Pol I transcription (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moss et al., 2007</xref>). UBF consists of two polypeptides (UBF1 and 2), which form hetero- and homodimers and arise from alternative splicing of a single transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Mahony and Rothblum, 1991</xref>). Although UBF1 supports robust rRNA gene transcription, UBF2 is fivefold less active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hannan et al., 1996</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms that confer poor transcriptional activity to UBF2 are unclear. In one model, UBF acts through its multiple HMG boxes to induce looping of DNA. This creates the enhancesome, a nucleosome-like structure thought to be responsible for the ability of UBF to modulate rRNA gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stefanovsky et al., 2001a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">b</xref>). Early studies suggested that UBF1 acts predominantly at the promoter in the recruitment of SL1 (selectivity factor 1) and Pol I and in the formation of the preinitiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McStay et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jantzen et al., 1992</xref>). More recently, additional roles have been ascribed to UBF1, including regulation of promoter escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Panov et al., 2006</xref>) and transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moss et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, the association of UBF1 with rRNA genes in vivo is not restricted to the promoter but extends across the entire transcribed portion and to a lesser extent to the intergenic spacer (IGS; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Sullivan et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, consistent with its ability to modify DNA conformation, the inclusion of rRNA gene sequences with high affinity for UBF into ectopic sites on human chromosomes results in the formation of NOR-like structures indicative of &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mais et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, targeting UBF1 to regions of heterochromatin is sufficient to induce large-scale chromatin decondensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). Together, these data suggest that UBF1 binding throughout the rRNA gene repeat might contribute to the formation of the active chromatin state of rRNA genes. However, direct experiments to demonstrate this function on endogenous rRNA genes and information on the relative contribution of the two UBF isoforms in chromatin remodeling are lacking.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Silencing of UBF1/2 by siRNA.</bold> (A) NIH3T3 cells were transfected with siRNA-EGFP or -UBF1/2, and protein samples were harvested as indicated and analyzed by Western blotting.

Long-term rRNA gene silencing in response to UBF depletion is stably propagated through the cell cycle and through many generations and is not associated with heterochromatic marks related to nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC)&#x02013;dependent remodeling, including DNA methylation. Restoring UBF levels rescues the number of active genes. Thus, in contrast to epigenetically silenced rRNA genes, which are methylated, silencing of rRNA genes through UBF depletion is reversible. We also demonstrate that, contrary to accepted dogma, the pool of active ribosomal genes is not static but decreases during differentiation and that this decrease correlates with diminished UBF levels in the absence of changes in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) methylation. Together, these data suggest that modulation of UBF levels might be an important determinant of the relative proportion of active and silent rRNA genes during development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>UBF1 depletion silences rRNA genes</title><p>To determine whether UBF is necessary for maintenance of the open chromatin structure found in active NORs, we transfected siRNAs targeting conserved regions of both isoforms of UBF (UBF1/2; Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805146/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805146/DC1</ext-link>) into NIH3T3 cells and examined the effects of UBF knockdown on ribosomal gene chromatin (r-chromatin). UBF knockdown reduced UBF1/2 mRNA and protein levels by 80% compared with the control siRNA oligonucleotide duplex against EGFP (siRNA-EGFP; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP [qChIP]) analysis was used to examine the effect of UBF1/2 depletion on the level of UBF associated with the rRNA genes. Consistent with recent experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Sullivan et al., 2002</xref>), we found that UBF1/2 is enriched not only at the proximal promoter but also across the transcribed portion of the 45S rRNA gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Depletion of UBF1/2 reduced the levels of UBF1/2 associated with the rRNA genes by a mean of 60% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in interphase demonstrated a significant reduction in both the number of UBF-positive nucleoli and the intensity of UBF immunostaining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>) after inducible UBF1/2 knockdown using retroviral delivery of a tetracycline-inducible UBF1/2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dickins et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Next, we directly examined the effect of UBF depletion on the relative proportion of active and inactive (silent) ribosomal genes using psoralen, a DNA cross-linking agent. Active rRNA genes have an open chromatin structure that is accessible to psoralen and associated with nascent rRNA transcripts. Conversely, the silent genes are inaccessible to psoralen and associated with regularly spaced nucleosomes. After psoralen cross-linking, the active and inactive rRNA genes can be distinguished with Southern blotting by their differing rates of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conconi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dammann et al., 1993</xref>). Strikingly, psoralen analysis of the rRNA genes demonstrated a 70% reduction in the number of active genes with a reciprocal increase in the fraction of silenced genes (47.4 and 52.6% to 18.8 and 81.2%) after UBF knockdown in NIH3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). The change in the proportion of active genes was not a result of off-target effects, as silencing of UBF1/2 using siRNAs to different regions of the UBF1/2 coding sequence (Fig. S1, A and B) also reduced the number of active ribosomal genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;6), whereas siRNA targeting EGFP or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) had no effect on the ratio of active to inactive genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and C</xref>). UBF1/2 knockdown also increased the percentage of silenced rRNA genes in cells arrested in G0&#x02013;G1 phase after serum starvation (SS; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, SS 24 h) and also in cells in early G1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, &#x0002b;Serum 6 h). Thus, silencing of rRNA genes (rDNA) after depletion of UBF is not dependent on growth factors or chromatin remodeling during S phase. We further examined the effect of UBF depletion using argyrophilic NOR (AgNOR) staining of nucleoli from interphase NIH3T3 cells. Nucleolar fibrillar centers contain undercondensed and thus transcriptionally competent rRNA genes. Like mitotic NORs, they can be silver stained because of their association with the Pol I transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roussel and Hernandez-Verdun, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weisenberger and Scheer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heliot et al., 1997</xref>). AgNOR staining of the nucleoli demonstrated an &#x0223c;60&#x02013;70% decrease in the overall intensity of silver staining and number of fibrillar centers after UBF1/2 knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). The strong correlation between decreased AgNOR staining and UBF depletion is consistent with experiments demonstrating that UBF is responsible for recruiting a majority of the Pol I transcription machinery to the rDNA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mais et al., 2005</xref>). Together, these data provide strong evidence that the association of UBF with rRNA genes is necessary for maintenance of the open chromatin structure found in active NORs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>UBF1/2 depletion decreases the number of active ribosomal genes.</bold> (A) NIH3T3 cells transfected with siRNA-EGFP (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2) or three independent siRNAs targeting UBF1/2.

This model predicts that the association of UBF and histone H1 with r-chromatin in vivo would be mutually exclusive and that UBF knockdown would increase histone H1 association with the pool of rRNA genes that are undergoing silencing. To monitor relative UBF and histone H1 occupancy at silenced (methylated) and active (unmethylated) rRNA genes, we used the ChIP-CHOP assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>). In this assay, immunoprecipitated DNA from UBF and histone H1 ChIP experiments was digested with HpaII before quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using the core primers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) that span the &#x02212;133 CpG dinucleotide in the rRNA gene promoter (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). The percentage of unmethylated versus methylated DNA was determined and used to distinguish between active and silent rRNA genes.

Thus, the rRNA genes are either associated with UBF or histone H1; they are mutually exclusive. UBF1/2 knockdown led to a twofold increase in the amount of H1 at the promoter and transcribed portion of the total pool of rRNA genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 E</xref>). ChIP-CHOP demonstrated that this enrichment occurred on the unmethylated fraction of genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, D and E</xref>). These would, presumably, correspond to the fraction of newly silenced genes depleted of UBF. Together, these results suggest a model in which direct association of UBF with the unmethylated rRNA genes prevents the assembly of transcriptionally inactive higher order chromatin structures catalyzed by linker histone H1.</p></sec><sec><title>UBF1 overexpression does not increase UBF loading on the rRNA genes</title><p>Our aforementioned data and previously published experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Santoro and Grummt, 2001</xref>) demonstrate that UBF does not bind to methylated rRNA genes. When considered with the UBF rescue experiments in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, the data suggest a model whereby methylated rRNA genes are permanently silenced because of their inability to load UBF, which is required for rDNA activation. Consistent with this model, three- to fourfold overexpression of Flag-tagged UBF1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>) failed to significantly increase the amount of UBF1 at the promoter, transcribed, and IGS regions of the rDNA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). In addition, ChIP-CHOP experiments revealed that in control as well as UBF1-overexpressing cells, immunoprecipitated UBF was almost exclusively associated with unmethylated rDNA promoters (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Thus, UBF cannot be loaded onto the methylated pool of rRNA genes. Surprisingly, despite the inability to increase the net loading of UBF onto the rRNA genes, overexpression of UBF1 induced a modest but statistically significant increase in the proportion of active genes from 45.8 to 60.4% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). One explanation for the increase in active gene number without more UBF loading is that overexpression of UBF1 increases the preponderance of UBF1&#x02013;UBF1 homodimers, which our data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) indicate would be more active in r-chromatin remodeling than UBF1&#x02013;UBF2 or UBF2&#x02013;UBF2 dimers.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of UBF1 is not sufficient to activate silenced rDNA.</bold> (A) Western blot analysis of NIH3T3 cell lines expressing rUBF1-MSCV or empty vector MSCV.

This suggests that the rate of transcription on the remaining active genes was increased. Consistent with this, ChIP analysis using antibodies to the largest subunit of Pol I (RPA194) demonstrated that UBF1/2 knockdown led to a twofold increase in Pol I loading on the remaining 15% of active rRNA genes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>). This would maintain a nearly constant transcriptional output. We also examined Pol I transcription elongation rates, which are regulated by UBF and are limiting for rRNA gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stefanovsky et al., 2006a</xref>).

However, in contrast to classical epigenetic silencing of NORs, rRNA gene inactivation in response to UBF depletion is not associated with CpG methylation and thus is reversible; restoring UBF levels restores the wild-type ratio of active to inactive genes. Thus, we term this form of rRNA gene inactivation methylation-independent silencing or pseudosilencing to distinguish it from epigenetic silencing characteristic of imprinting. These data provide strong evidence that UBF binding to rRNA repeats is necessary for maintenance of the open chromatin structure found in active NORs.</p><p>Through its HMG boxes, UBF has been shown to bend &#x0223c;140 bp of DNA into a near 360&#x000b0; loop. This protein DNA structure, coined the enhancesome, is central to the ability of UBF to regulate Pol I transcription at the level of elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stefanovsky et al., 2006a</xref>). Our data demonstrate that mutations that block the ability of UBF1 to bend DNA and form the enhancesome in vitro also severely reduce the ability of UBF to define a unique psoralen-accessible chromatin structure across the rRNA gene in vivo, suggesting that these two processes are linked. Specifically, a UBF1 mutant (UBF-T117E) that mimics extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation at threonine 117 and is thus defective in the ability to form a functional enhancesome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stefanovsky et al., 2001a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2006b</xref>) was unable to prevent the loss of active genes. In contrast, the equivalent nonphosphorylatable mutant (UBF-T117A) that retains its ability to form the enhancesome in vitro was able to remodel r-chromatin to the same extent as recombinant wild-type UBF.</p><p>Interestingly, although the T117A mutant is able to function in enhancesome formation, it, like the T117E mutant, is severely compromised in its ability to regulate transcription by Pol I compared with wild-type UBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stefanovsky et al., 2001b</xref>). However, we do not think this demonstrates that transcription and chromatin remodeling can be separated. Rather, we conclude that psoralen cross-linking measures the number of actively transcribed genes but does not differentiate between highly transcribed genes (i.e., rescue with wild-type UBF1) and poorly transcribed genes (i.e., rescue with T117A). This is consistent with the observation that the number of active genes, as determined by psoralen cross-linking, does not vary between exponentially growing cells and serum-starved cells, although clearly the rate of transcription on the latter pool of rRNA genes is considerably repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stefanovsky and Moss, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our data also demonstrate that UBF1 and its natural splice variant UBF2 possess distinct abilities to remodel r-chromatin. UBF1 was able to efficiently replace endogenous UBF1/2 to maintain rRNA genes in an open chromatin state. In marked contrast, UBF2 exhibited little, if any, chromatin remodeling capability. UBF2 contains a 27&#x02013;amino acid deletion in HMG box 2, which reduces the DNA-binding capacity of this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stefanovsky and Moss, 2008</xref>). Thus, reminiscent of the aforementioned UBF1 mutants, UBF2 may function poorly in remodeling r-chromatin as a result of an inability to bend and loop DNA as efficiently as UBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stefanovsky and Moss, 2008</xref>). Moreover, these data also suggest that in vivo variations in UBF2 levels might function to fine tune the number of active rRNA genes by forming less active UBF2&#x02013;UBF2 homodimers or UBF1&#x02013;UBF2 heterodimers.</p><sec><title>NoRC activity is not required for sustained silencing of ribosomal genes in response to UBF depletion</title><p>Importantly, our data demonstrate that ribosomal genes pseudosilenced in response to UBF depletion do not require increased CpG methylation or histone deacetylation across the rDNA repeats. These data are consistent with a model in which rRNA genes loaded with UBF are open; rRNA genes devoid of UBF are closed regardless of their CpG methylation status. In this model, the chromatin-remodeling complex NoRC lies upstream of UBF in the rRNA gene&#x02013;silencing program, most likely by controlling the local r-chromatin landscape, including CpG methylation, to regulate the overall level of UBF binding to the rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Santoro and Grummt, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our data also demonstrate that rRNA genes pseudosilenced by UBF depletion do not become CpG methylated even after many generations, and, thus, the silencing is stable and can be reversed by restoring UBF levels. This suggests that UBF does not normally function to prevent &#x0201c;constitutive&#x0201d; NoRC-mediated methylation of rRNA genes, which is consistent with a model in which epigenetic silencing of genes through CpG methylation and UBF exclusion only occurs during defined stages during development.</p><p>Our data also allow us to make some conclusions about the mechanism by which UBF facilitates decondensation and formation of an active chromatin environment at rRNA genes. First, it is apparent that the UBF&#x02013;DNA complexes and the core histones can coexist on rRNA genes. We found no evidence that UBF depletion was associated with increases in the total level of the core histones associated with the rRNA genes, which would be expected if UBF chromatin remodeling functioned to eject nucleosomes from DNA. These findings do not necessarily imply that the histones associated with active rRNA genes are nucleosomal. Indeed, much earlier experiments suggested that actively transcribed ribosomal genes remain associated with core histones, but in an unfolded &#x0201c;half-histone&#x0201d; state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prior et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Second, rRNA gene silencing through loss of UBF leads to significant increases in the level of linker histone H1 associated with the new fraction of silenced genes. Thus, the combined data argue strongly that UBF contributes to the open r-chromatin structure by preventing the assembly of transcriptionally inactive higher order chromatin structures catalyzed by linker histone H1 binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of rRNA synthesis at the level of rate per gene rather than number of active genes</title><p>Another important finding of our study is that the reduction in the number of inactive genes through the depletion of UBF does not lead to a commensurate decrease in net cellular rRNA gene transcription rates. This was because the density of Pol I loading on the remaining active genes was increased, thus maintaining rRNA synthesis rates per cell. Such a phenomenon has been observed in yeast where artificially reducing the rRNA gene copy number from 143 to 42 does not affect growth rates because the mean number of polymerases per rRNA gene increases to maintain transcription output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">French et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, upon UBF knockdown, a pool of unmethylated rRNA genes exhibited increases in markers of gene activation (acetylated H3K9 and di- and trimethylated H3K4) at their promoter regions (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, A&#x02013;C</xref>). It is probable that these changes are functionally associated with the increased Pol I loading.</p></sec><sec><title>UBF regulates the active ribosomal gene pool during differentiation</title><p>The prevailing view is that the relative amounts of active and inactive ribosomal genes are stably maintained as a result of CpG methylation of a fixed number of rRNA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conconi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stefanovsky and Moss, 2006</xref>). In contrast, our experiments demonstrate that the number of silenced genes increases markedly during granulocyte differentiation. Furthermore, the silencing correlates with a reduction in UBF levels and UBF loading on the rDNA repeat but not promoter methylation of rRNA genes, suggesting that the loss of UBF is causative in the rRNA gene inactivation. Furthermore, as we and others have shown that reduced UBF expression is common during the terminal differentiation of many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Larson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Datta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alzuherri and White, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poortinga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2007</xref>), it is likely that down-regulation of UBF is a widespread mechanism for the silencing of active rRNA genes during development.</p><p>The level of rRNA gene silencing during granulocyte differentiation is similar to that observed during UBF depletion in NIH3T3 cells. However, UBF depletion did not change rRNA gene transcription rates significantly. Thus, although rRNA gene silencing may be required for the down-regulation of Pol I transcription during differentiation, it is not sufficient to regulate this process. Interestingly, our preliminary experiments show that during granulocyte differentiation, in addition to UBF, the expression of a majority of the other components of the Pol I complex is down-regulated (unpublished data). We propose that this results in limiting amounts of the Pol I complex, which prevents increased loading of Pol I on the remaining active rRNA genes after UBF depletion. This would ensure that rRNA gene silencing during differentiation leads to decreased rRNA synthesis rates. Future studies are needed to determine whether coordinate regulation of Pol I transcription factors and modulation of the number of active rRNA genes is a general mechanism to effect long-term changes in rRNA gene transcription rates during differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Anti&#x02013;trimethyl H3K9, anti&#x02013;dimethyl H3K9, anti&#x02013;trimethyl H3K4, anti&#x02013;dimethyl H3K4, anti-H4, and anti-SNF2H antibodies were obtained from Abcam.
