MSSP-1 binds to a DNA replication origin/transcriptional enhancer of the human c-myc gene and has turned out to be identical with Scr2, a human protein which complements the defect of cdc2 kinase in S.pombe [Kataoka and Nojima (1994) Nucleic Acid Res., 22, 2687-2693]. We have cloned the cDNA for MSSP-2, another member of the MSSP family of proteins. The MSSP-2 cDNA shares highly homologous sequences with MSSP-1 cDNA, except for the insertion of 48 bp coding 16 amino acids near the C-terminus. Like MSSP-1, MSSP-2 has RNP-1 consensus sequences. The results of the experiments using bacterially expressed MSSP-2, and its deletion mutants, as histidine fusion proteins suggested that the binding specificity of MSSP-2 to double- and single-stranded DNA is the same as that of MSSP-1, and that the RNP consensus sequences are required for the DNA binding of the protein. MSSP-2 stimulated the DNA replication of an SV40-derived plasmid containing the binding sequence for MSSP-1 or -2. MSSP-2 is hence suggested to play an important role in regulation of DNA replication.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00049-0063-a" xlink:role="5579"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00049-0064-a" xlink:role="5580"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00049-0064-b" xlink:role="5580"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00049-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5576"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00049-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5577"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00049-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5578"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00049-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5579"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00049-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5580"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00049-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5581"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
