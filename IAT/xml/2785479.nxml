In the disease process, T cells are primed in the periphery by antigen presenting dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are considered to be crucial regulators of specific immune responses and molecules or proteins that regulate DC function are therefore under extensive investigation. We here investigated the potential immunomodulatory capacity of the ATP binding cassette transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp generally drives cellular efflux of a variety of compounds and is thought to be involved in excretion of inflammatory agents from immune cells, like DCs. So far, the immunomodulatory role of these ABC transporters is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Here we demonstrate that P-gp acts as a key modulator of adaptive immunity during an <italic>in vivo</italic> model for neuroinflammation. The function of the DC is severely impaired in P-gp knockout mice (Mdr1a/1b&#x02212;/&#x02212;), since both DC maturation and T cell stimulatory capacity is significantly decreased. Consequently, Mdr1a/1b &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice develop decreased clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Reduced clinical signs coincided with impaired T cell responses and T cell-specific brain inflammation. We here describe the underlying molecular mechanism and demonstrate that P-gp is crucial for the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;. Importantly, the defect in DC function can be restored by exogenous addition of these cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data demonstrate that P-gp downmodulates DC function through the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, resulting in an impaired immune response. Taken together, our work highlights a new physiological role for P-gp as an immunomodulatory molecule and reveals a possible new target for immunotherapy.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by the presence of demyelinated lesions throughout the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008212-Ewing1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008212-Lucchinetti1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Diminished proliferation coincided with decreased Th1 and Th2, but not Th17 cytokine levels. These results suggest that P-gp is involved in Th1 and Th2 responses during EAE and point to an overall impaired T cell response in Mdr1a/1b&#x02212;/&#x02212; animals during EAE.</p><p>Reduced clinical signs in Mdr1a/1b &#x02212;/&#x02212; mice during EAE may be caused by an altered immune response to myelin proteins in these animals.

These results strongly imply that the ability of Mdr1a/1b &#x02212;/&#x02212; T cells to become activated during immune responses is impaired. However, anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation of T cells from Mdr1a/1b &#x02212;/&#x02212; displayed a normal activation capacity, indicating that P-gp on T cells is not required for T cell activation responses, which has previously been suggested for Mdr1a encoded P-gp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008212-Eisenbraun1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.
