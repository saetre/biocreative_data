Cigarette smoking is associated with increased susceptibility to infection, while COPD is characterised by bacterial colonisation and infective exacerbations. We found reduced TLR4 gene expression in the nasal epithelium of smokers compared with non-smoking controls, while TLR2 expression was unchanged. Severe COPD was associated with reduced TLR4 expression compared to less severe disease, with good correlation between nasal and tracheal expression. We went on to examine the effect of potential modulators of TLR4 expression in respiratory epithelium pertinent to airways disease. Using an airway epithelial cell line, we found a dose-dependent downregulation in TLR4 mRNA and protein expression by stimulation with cigarette smoke extracts. Treatment with the corticosteroids fluticasone and dexamethasone resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in TLR4 mRNA and protein. The functional significance of this effect was demonstrated by impaired IL-8 and HBD2 induction in response to LPS. Stimulation with salmeterol (10<sup>-6 </sup>M) caused upregulation of TLR4 membrane protein presentation with no upregulation of mRNA, suggesting a post-translational effect. The effect of dexamethasone and salmeterol in combination was additive, with downregulation of TLR4 gene expression, and no change in membrane receptor expression. Modulation of TLR4 in respiratory epithelium may have important implications for airway inflammation and infection in response to inhaled pathogens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The lung represents the largest epithelial surface in the body and the respiratory epithelial cell represents the body's first interaction with airborne pathogens. As well as providing a physical barrier to entry of micro-organisms, the epithelium is increasingly recognised to play an important role in innate immunity, and can respond to potential pathogens by releasing a variety of effector molecules of the inflammatory response along with anti-microbial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>TLR4 is critically important in signalling the inflammatory response to Gram-negative bacteria through recognition of LPS, regulating the inducible expression of many cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and acute phase proteins. We have previously shown that LPS signalling via TLR4 induces production of the anti-microbial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (HBD2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], which has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, including <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>and the yeast <italic>Candida albicans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a condition characterised by progressive airflow limitation punctuated by exacerbations, associated with airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis and acceleration of COPD remains the subject of some debate, but increasing evidence in recent years supports the importance of bacteria in this disease, as a stimulus to chronic inflammation and a cause of exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Modulation of TLR4 expression in respiratory epithelium could result in an ineffective host response and failure to eradicate potentially pathogenic organisms, leaving the host susceptible to colonisation, chronic inflammation and acute exacerbations.</p><p>This study examined the expression of TLR4 and HBD2 in respiratory epithelium in non-smokers and smokers with COPD. The effect of cigarette smoke was replicated <italic>in vitro </italic>by examining TLR4 mRNA and protein expression and quantifying IL-8 expression in airway epithelial cells stimulated with cigarette smoke extracts. The effects of other potential modulators of TLR expression in respiratory epithelium pertinent to COPD, including the long-acting beta<sub>2 </sub>agonist (LABA) salmeterol and the corticosteroids fluticasone and dexamethasone were also examined. The data indicate that altered expression of TLR4 may be important in the pathogenesis of COPD and may be modulated by corticosteroids, LABAs and cigarette smoke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Outpatients attending for upper GI endoscopies were recruited for nasal brush sampling following approval of study protocol and consent forms by the Beaumont Hospital Ethics Committee.

The main objective of the study was to observe differences between COPD patients of different degrees of severity. Observed differences with control groups represent a "real world" differences between typical subjects with this condition and healthy control subjects. As all COPD patients were using both inhaled LABA and corticosteroids, differences between subsets of patients may be attributable to the disease process, while differences with control subjects may be the result of disease, smoking or medication.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>TLR4 mRNA expression is down-regulated in the nasal mucosa of smokers and in severe COPD <italic>in vivo</italic></bold>.

Smokers and non-smokers were therefore grouped together for further analysis. As demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, there was significant upregulation of TLR4 expression in mild to moderate COPD compared to smoking controls (&#x02020; P &#x0003c; 0.05), while severe disease was associated with a significant reduction in TLR4 expression compared to less severe disease (P &#x0003c; 0.05).

We went on to examine functional effect by IL-8 ELISA. As expected, CSE has some direct inflammatory effect resulting in IL-8 production at dilute concentrations. However, concordant with the reduced expression of TLR4, the respiratory epithelial cells have dose dependent reduced secretion of IL-8 following treatment with higher concentrations of CSE, both with and without additional LPS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Failure of the cells to produce any IL-8 following exposure to undiluted CSE may be a result of the direct toxic effects demonstrated in the viability assay.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cigarette smoke downregulates TLR4 gene and protein expression in A549 cells resulting in relative hyporesponsiveness to LPS</bold>.

Analysis of protein expression in total cell lysates similarly showed no significant change in total TLR4 (TLR4t) expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> lower panel), however levels in cytosolic extracts (TLR4c) were decreased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> upper panel). A concomitant increase in membrane expression was evident at doses of 10<sup>-7 </sup>M and 10<sup>-6 </sup>M. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), an effect which was confirmed by Laser Scanning Cytometry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Pre-treatment of cells with the beta-blocker Butoxamine abrogated the effect of Salmeterol 10<sup>-6 </sup>M on membrane expression of TLR4, indicating a specific beta-adrenoreceptor mediated effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Taken together these data indicate that salmeterol induces a post-translational transport effect on TLR4.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Salmeterol upregulates TLR4 membrane protein expression in respiratory epithelial cells</bold>.

The lowest dose of dexamethasone at which a functionally significant downregulation of TLR4 was observed, namely 10<sup>-7 </sup>M, was used in combination with the dose of salmeterol required to produce upregulation of the same receptor, namely 10<sup>-6 </sup>M. TLR4 gene expression was determined by Real Time PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Again, treatment with salmeterol alone caused no significant change in TLR4 expression above untreated cells, while dexamethasone down regulated TLR4 expression. At the mRNA level, the dexamethasone effect persists when the two compounds are used in combination, resulting in significant downregulation in TLR4 mRNA expression compared to untreated cells. Looking at membrane protein expression however, salmeterol reverses the effect of dexamethasone on TLR4 expression resulting in no net change in TLR4 membrane expression with the two drugs used in combination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Cell viability was not affected by either drug (data not shown). A similar pattern was observed in LPS-induced IL-8 expression, where the addition of salmeterol partly reversed the impaired IL-8 response to LPS observed with steroid treatment alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Salmeterol reverses the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on TLR4 membrane protein expression despite downregulation of mRNA</bold>.

Recent evidence also implicates TLR4 deficiency in oxidant induced lung damage and emphysema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Here we report altered expression of TLR4 in the respiratory epithelium of smokers and in patients with COPD, and modifications associated with corticosteroid and LABA treatment that may contribute to our understanding of their therapeutic mechanisms.</p><p>Cigarette smoking is a major environmental risk factor predisposing to COPD and is also an independent risk factor for bacterial colonisation of the lower respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], acute respiratory infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and infective exacerbations of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our data demonstrates that smoking is associated with reduced TLR4 expression and LPS responsiveness in respiratory epithelium and is consistent with other data demonstrating reduced HBD2 production in response to LPS in respiratory epithelial cells following exposure to cigarette smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>TLR4 and HBD2 expression was increased in subjects with mild-moderate COPD compared to normal controls, while with increasing severity of disease and fall in FEV1, expression was reduced. In contrast to alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], TLR2 expression is not changed, suggesting that this is not a non-specific response to airway inflammation. There is little existing data regarding the transcriptional regulation of TLRs in human airway epithelial cells, although IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; have been shown to modulate TLR4 expression and function in human intestinal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The inflammatory milieu in the airways in COPD includes many potential modulators of TLR4 including cytokines, acute phase reactants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and anti-proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] which may upregulate TLR4 in mild to moderate disease. Whether the reduced expression of TLR4 expression in severe COPD is an adaptive response to increased exposure to Gram-negative pathogens, as part of the phenomenon of endotoxin tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] in an attempt to attenuate ongoing LPS induced airway inflammation, or pre-exists and thus promotes colonisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] is not clear. Reduced epithelial expression of TLR4 may represent a useful biomarker of disease severity.</p><p>Our COPD population differed from controls in terms of their exposure to inhaled medications, namely LABAs and corticosteroids. We therefore went on to explore the potential of these compounds to modulate TLR4 expression <italic>in vitro</italic>. Glucocorticoids have been previously reported to modulate lung responses to infection, including Pseudomonas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. There have been no previous reports about the effect of corticosteroids on TLR4 expression in epithelial cells. Here we demonstrate that corticosteroid exposure, at clinically relevant doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] results in downregulation of TLR4 and impaired IL-8 response to LPS. Here we provide evidence for a mechanism whereby corticosteroids could impair host defence against Gram-negative bacteria by downregulation of TLR4 expression.</p><p>LABAs such as salmeterol are prescribed primarily as bronchodilators, although accumulating evidence in recent years indicates that LABAs have numerous anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are expressed in respiratory epithelium, but the immunomodulatory effect of LABAs on these cells has been largely unexplored. Here we show that the LABA salmeterol had no effect on TLR4 gene transcription or total protein expression, but did induce membrane presentation of TLR4 from the cytoplasmic/nuclear compartment. A similar post-translational effect has been described in nasal epithelium of patients with allergic rhinitis compared to healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], while nuclear localisation of TLR4 has been confirmed in bronchial epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. TLR4 has been shown to cycle rapidly between the Golgi and the membrane, with signal transduction occurring only at the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Little is known about the mechanism of this translocation or indeed transport from the nucleus. Our data, demonstrating a beta-receptor mediated effect on post-translational TLR4 transport suggests a potential role for cAMP-dependent protein kinases in this process.</p><p>Following in vivo inhalation of 50 &#x003bc; of salmeterol, the estimated lung tissue concentrations are between 10<sup>-7 </sup>and 10<sup>-8 </sup>M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and local concentrations at the site of deposition of the drug namely the epithelium are likely higher. The observed effects at doses of 10<sup>-7 </sup>and 10<sup>-6 </sup>are therefore clinically relevant.</p><p>While the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids are well documented, chronic inhaled corticosteroid therapy alone has failed to impact significantly on disease progression or mortality in numerous large scale multi-centre placebo controlled trials of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Downregulation of TLR4 membrane protein expression and consequent susceptibility to Gram-negative infection may contribute to the failure of unopposed steroid therapy in these trials. Abrogation of this effect by the addition of salmeterol may represent another important advantage of co-prescription of these compounds, and may contribute to the clinically important improvements in outcome which result when these compounds are prescribed together. In the recent TORCH study, combination therapy with fluticasone and salmeterol resulted in significant reductions in exacerbation rate and 3-year mortality (both COPD related and all cause) compared to fluticasone alone, which had no effect on mortality compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>In the presence of CSE, the protective effect of salmeterol on TLR4 signalling is lost and in fact there is a small but statistically significant further reduction in LPS-induced IL-8 expression compared to dexamethasone alone. These findings are in keeping with recent report that combination of fluticasone and salmeterol potentiates the suppression of cigarette smoke-induced IL-8 production by macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although salmeterol was found to have no effect on CSE induced IL-8 production in airway smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], although the effect of LPS was not examined in these studies. It would be of great interest to know if the clinical effects of salmeterol and fluticasone in combination were more profound in smokers compared to non-smokers in the TORCH study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], but this subgroup analysis has not been reported.</p><p>The respiratory epithelium is in constant dynamic interaction with the environment, and is uniquely exposed to airborne pathogens and toxins, as well as aerosolised drugs. The TLRs perform a pivotal role in host defence, and this study demonstrates that TLR4 expression in respiratory epithelium is altered in COPD, potentially contributing to the airway inflammation and infective exacerbations which characterise this disease. TLR4 expression is modulated both by drugs used to treat airways inflammation and by cigarette smoke, the major pathogenic determinant of COPD. A greater understanding of the mechanism of these effects may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of airways disease, and direct future therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AMP : Anti-microbial peptide; </p><p>CF : Cystic Fibrosis; </p><p>CSE : Cigarette smoke extract; </p><p>Dex : Dexamethasone; </p><p>EMEM : Eagle's minimal essential medium; </p><p>FCS : Foetal calf serum; </p><p>HBD2 : Human beta-defensin 2; </p><p>IFN-&#x003c7; : Interferon gamma; </p><p>IL-1&#x003b2; : Interleukin-1 beta; </p><p>IL-8 : Interleukin-8; </p><p>LABA : Long-acting beta<sub>2 </sub>agonist; </p><p>LPS : Lipopolysaccharide; </p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B : Nuclear factor-kappa B; </p><p>Sal : Salmeterol; </p><p>TNF&#x003b1; : Tumour necrosis factor alpha; </p><p>TLR : Toll-like receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RMacR carried out patient recruitment, sample collection and analysis, gene and protein expression analysis, drafted the manuscript and contributed to study design and analysis.
