We initially discovered IL-33 as a nuclear factor (NF-HEV) abundantly expressed in high endothelial venules from lymphoid organs, that associates with chromatin and exhibits transcriptional regulatory properties. This suggested that, similarly to IL-1&#x003b1; and chromatin-associated cytokine HMGB1, IL-33 may act as both a cytokine and a nuclear factor. Although the activity of recombinant IL-33 has been well characterized, little is known yet about the expression pattern of endogenous IL-33 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here, we show that IL-33 is constitutively and abundantly expressed in normal human tissues. Using a combination of human tissue microarrays and IL-33 monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, we found that IL-33 is a novel nuclear marker of the endothelium widely expressed along the vascular tree. We observed abundant nuclear expression of IL-33 in endothelial cells from both large and small blood vessels in most normal human tissues, as well as in human tumors. In addition to endothelium, we also found constitutive nuclear expression of IL-33 in fibroblastic reticular cells of lymphoid tissues, and epithelial cells of tissues exposed to the environment, including skin keratinocytes and epithelial cells of the stomach, tonsillar crypts and salivary glands.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Together, our results indicate that, unlike inducible cytokines, IL-33 is constitutively expressed in normal human tissues.

Moreover, abundant expression of IL-33 was also observed in the nucleus of endothelial cells in several distinct human tumors, indicating that IL-33 is a marker of tumor blood vessels as well.

The increase in serum levels of soluble ST2 likely results from the activation (or recruitment) by IL-33 of target cells co-expressing the membrane and secreted forms of the ST2 receptor, thus providing evidence for IL-33 release (or activation) in all these diseases. Our observations that demonstrate constitutive expression of IL-33 in normal human tissues are therefore important, because they suggest IL-33 can potentially be released in any tissue after injury (after endothelial or epithelial cell damage), and this could explain why the IL-33/ST2 signaling system appears to be involved in numerous human diseases affecting many different organs.</p><p>Although IL-33 was generally not detected in fibroblasts from normal human tissues, it was found to be constitutively expressed in the nucleus of T-zone FRCs of lymphoid tissues.
