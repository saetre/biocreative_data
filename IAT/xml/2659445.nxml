On the other hand, the ratio between thymosin &#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> and thymosin &#x003b2;<sub>10</sub> exhibits a constant value of about 4 along all the range of PMA (190&#x02013;550 days of PMA) examined. In order to investigate thymosin &#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> origin and to better establish the trend of its production as a function of gestational age (GA), immunohistochemical analysis of major and minor salivary glands of different pre-term fetuses were carried out, starting from 84 days (12 weeks) of gestational age. Reactive granules were seen in all glands with a maximum of expression around 140&#x02013;150 days of GA, even though with high inter- and intra-individual variability. In infants and adults reactive granules in acinar cells were not observed, but just a diffuse cytoplasmatic staining in ductal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>This study outlines for the first time that salivary glands during foetal life express and secrete peptides such as &#x003b2;-thymosins probably involved in the development of the oral cavity and its annexes. The secretion increases from about 12 weeks till to about 21 weeks of GA, subsequently it decreases, almost disappearing in the period of expected date of delivery, when the gland switches towards the secretion of adult specific salivary peptides. The switch observed may be an example of further secretion switches involving other exocrine and endocrine glands during foetal development.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Beta thymosins are ubiquitous peptides having interesting intra- and extra-cellular functions, whose name derives from their first characterization from thymus extracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005109-Hannappel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005109-Low1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Pre-term newborn sample collection was performed during several weeks after birth at established time intervals (one or two weeks). When possible, it was also performed after discharge from the neonatal unit, during the periodical check visits with about one year follow-up. Saliva was not collected from newborns when sample collection seemed to cause even a minimal stress to the newborn and/or to his/her parents. For these reasons, sample collection was more frequent during the hospital stay and sporadic after this period. After collection samples were immediately mixed with an equal volume of 0.2&#x00025; 2,2,2 trifluoacetic acid (TFA) (v/v) in ice bath. After stirring, the acidic solution was centrifuged at 9000 g for three min to remove the precipitate (mainly mucins) and the acidic solution was immediately analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS (100 &#x000b5;L, corresponding to 50 &#x000b5;L of whole saliva) or stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>RP-HPLC-ESI-MS analysis</title><p>The following solutions were utilized for the chromatographic separation: (eluent A) 0.056&#x00025; aqueous TFA and (eluent B) 0.050&#x00025; TFA in acetonitrile-water 80/20 (v/v).

The T splitter addressed a flow-rate of about 0.20 mL/min towards the diode array detector and 0.10 mL/min towards the ESI source. During the first 5 min of separation the eluate was not addressed to the mass spectrometer to avoid instrument damage due to the high salt concentration. The diode array detector was set at a wavelength of 214 and 276 nm. Mass spectra were collected every 3 millisecond in the positive ion mode. MS spray voltage was 4.50 kV and the capillary temperature was 220&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Detection of &#x003b2;-thymosins in whole saliva and determination of their concentration</title><p>Deconvolution of averaged ESI mass spectra was automatically performed either by the software provided with the Deca-XP instrument (Bioworks Browser) or by MagTran 1.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005109-Zhang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> software.

On the obvious impossibility to extend the HPLC-MS analysis of whole saliva at lower GA ranges and with the aim at finding the sources responsible for the high concentration observed in the oral cavity of pre-term newborns, we addressed our experimental plan towards immunohistochemical detection of T&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub>.

However, the increase in concentration of both determined by HPLC/MS analysis of oral fluid, suggested a trend for T&#x003b2;<sub>10</sub> similar to that one observed of T&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> by immunochemistry. Some roles of the T&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> and T&#x003b2;<sub>10</sub> couple are linked to a subtle modification of their relative amounts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005109-Smart2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the change of concentration at constant peptide ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005109-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) observed in the present study suggests that the absolute thymosin quantities should play relevant functions during fetal development.</p><p>The major outcomes of morphological results suggest that immunochemical pattern of T&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> is dynamic and that it changes during the different stages of pre-natal and post-natal development. Particularly, a granular T&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> pattern predominates in the early and middle phases of fetal development, progressively substituted by a structural diffuse cytoplasmic staining as seen in full term infants and adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005109-g009">Figs. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005109-g010">10</xref>). The granular pattern comprises both exocrine and paracrine features, the former were represented, at immunoistochemical level, by T&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub>-reactive granules inside the tubular lumen and in the apical cytoplasm of the acinar cells; the latter was represented by large peptide amounts in the mesenchymal space, as evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005109-g006">Figs. 6a and 6b</xref> that may suggest a role of T&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> in the control of salivary gland branching morphogenesis. On the other hand, the pattern of thymosin we observed in histochemical preparation reflects the glandular differentiation and namely the start of acinar cell differentiation. Such a change is reflected even in development of tight junctions as demonstrated by immunohistochemical studies of claudins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005109-Loureno2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The presence of high amounts of thymosins &#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>10</sub> in the oral cavity of pre-term infants with a probable maximum of expression around 140&#x02013;150 days (20&#x02013;21 weeks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005109-g006">Figs. 6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005109-g007">7a&#x02013;d</xref>), starting at least from about 85 days (12 weeks) of GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005109-g004">Figs. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>), put forward a role for these peptides in the development of oral cavity and its annexes. Until now the salivary glands were believed organs of slow development, reaching a complete secretory maturation after birth. Surprisingly, our results suggest that salivary glands do possess specific secretory capability even during prenatal maturation stages. In fact, at least since 85 days (12 weeks) of GA they start secreting peptides, such as thymosins &#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>10</sub>, which should have specific roles during development. After an apex reached at around 150 days (21 weeks) of GA, production of these peptides decreases rapidly and the secretion of salivary glands slowly switches towards the expression and secretion of salivary peptides typical of adult age (i.e. acidic proline-rich proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005109-Inzitari2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, statherin, histatins, basic proline-rich proteins and salivary cystatins). The switch of secretion disclosed by HPLC-MS analysis of whole saliva, was confirmed by immunoistochemical analysis of developing salivary glands, which evidenced a progressive decrease in the secretion of T&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> starting from the middle phases of foetal development. The switch could involve other exocrine and endocrine glands during foetal development. This study offers only a partial description of this switching phenomenon and obviously it does not pretend to establish any role for this high T&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> and T&#x003b2;<sub>10</sub> salivary gland production during a particular period of foetal life, even though the immunohistochemical results are suggestive for a contemporaneous paracrine and exocrine functions. The exocrine pathway arises puzzling questions about the environment where the peptides are potentially released. In fact, salivary glands discharge during foetal life directly in amniotic fluid, where thymosins may be dispersed. The secretion of T&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> and T&#x003b2;<sub>10</sub> from salivary gland might be connected to a demand of the whole amniotic sac. On the other hand, fluid secreted by salivary glands may be ingested and addressed towards the foetal gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts putatively influencing their pre-natal development. Alternatively, potential interactions with specific mucins could maintain these peptides adherent to the epithelium of the oral cavity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
