The canonical Hh signaling cascade is initiated through the binding of secreted Hh proteins to the membrane-bound receptor Patched-1 (Ptc1) or Patched-2 (Ptc2) to relieve patched-mediated repression of the signal transducer smoothened (Smo), leading to the activation of transcription factors Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3 to enhance transcription of downstream targets such as <italic>Ptc1, Ptc2 </italic>and<italic> Gli1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>. In addition to its critical roles during embryonic development and tumorigenesis, Hh signaling emerges as a potential mediator of fat formation and body weight gain during postnatal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>. Injection of adult mice with sonic Hh (Shh)-IgG fusion protein (a Hh agonist) causes a significant increase in fat mass and body weight without affecting food consumption and fluid intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. In agreement with this observation, inactivation of Hh signaling by injection of anti-Hh antibodies in normal adult mice fed with a high-fat diet and in obese leptin-deficient (<italic>ob/ob)</italic> mice fed with a low-fat diet can significantly reduce body weight gain in these animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. These animal studies suggest that Hh signaling may stimulate fat formation (adipogenesis) and promote body weight gain in adult mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. In contrast to the above animal studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, it has been reported that Hh can block adipogenesis in cultured mammalian adipocytic or multipotent mesenchymal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. This is highlighted by the recent study by Suh<italic> et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. They found that fat-body-specific activation of Hh signaling inhibited fat formation in<italic> Drosophila </italic>and that Hh blocked adipogenesis in mammalian cells by regulating antiadipogenic gene expression. In addition, they found that Hh signaling molecules such as Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3 are expressed in white fat tissues (WAT) of adult mice and that expression of these genes are down-regulated in normal mice fed with high fat diet and in <italic>ob/ob </italic>mice. A model of Hh signaling in inhibiting fat formation has been proposed in which Hh activates Gli transcription factors (Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3), which then activate antiadipogenic gene expression to inhibit the expression of adipogenic genes such as <italic>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma</italic> (<italic>PPARgamma</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> and <italic>CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPalpha) </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> in adipose tissues, resulting in inhibition of adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. According to this model, it is expected that ectopic activation of Hh signaling in adipose tissues will reduce fat formation in adults, which would be contradictory to observations reported by Martin <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. Therefore, whether Hh signaling acts to stimulate or inhibit fat formation during postnatal development remains to be characterized <italic>in vivo</italic> using animal models such as mutant mice carrying deletions of Hh signaling molecules.</p><p>Ptc1 is a negative regulator of the Hh signaling during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. It is a Hh receptor protein containing twelve transmembrane domains and intracellular amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>. In the absence of Hh, Ptc1 represses Smo activity. This repression of Smo is relieved once after Hh binds to the extracellular loops within the transmembrane domains of Ptc1, resulting in the activation of Hh signaling downstream target genes to elicit its biological functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>. It have been shown that the carboxyl terminus of Ptc1 is important for the inactivation of Hh signaling target genes and the localization and degradation of Ptc1 itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>. Deletion of <italic>Ptc1</italic> in mice can mimic ectopic Hh signaling and cause embryonic lethality, indicating the essential role of Ptc1 during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. Although Ptc1 has been shown to be a determinant of body weight<italic> in utero</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, there is no direct evidence that Ptc1 is also involved in controlling fat formation during postnatal development. The naturally occurring spontaneous mesenchymal dysplasia (<italic>mes</italic>) mouse line (<italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>), which has a deletion of the Ptc1 protein at the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic region and can bypass the embryonic lethality observed in a complete knockout of Ptc1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, would be an excellent model to investigate the potential role of Ptc1 in fat formation during postnatal development.</p><p>In this communication, we found that Ptc1 was expressed in epididymal white fat tissue (WAT) in adult mice. Loss of the carboxyl-terminus of Ptc1 in adult <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>mice caused a significant reduction in WAT. The adipocyte size of epididymal WAT was also reduced in <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic> mice.

Reduced white fat mass observed in adult <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes </sup></italic>mice can be due to the reduced cell sizes of adipocyte cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and the reduced adipocyte cell numbers in adult <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes </sup></italic>mice. The latter is indicated by the observation that the reduced levels of adipose cell sizes (40% of controls) are less than the reduced levels of total WAT weights in 33-week-old <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes </sup></italic>(about 75% of controls), even though it is difficult and almost impossible to determine the exact numbers of total adipocyte cells in adult mice. Since we did not observe significant changes in food intake and blood glucose concentrations in adult <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes </sup></italic>mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), the reduced white fat mass (reduced adipocyte cell size and cell numbers) is probably not due to reduced food consumption and aberrant glucose metabolism observed in <italic>Ptc1<sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref> as well as other hormonal signaling such as insulin signaling during adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>. Rather, the reduced white fat mass is likely due to the defective Hh signaling during adipogenesis in <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes </sup></italic>mice during postnatal development. By RT-PCR analyses, we found that many Hh signaling molecules are expressed in epididymal WAT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which is consistent with the presence of Gli transcription factors in perigonadal fat pads reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. Importantly, we found that truncated <italic>Ptc1</italic>, <italic>Ptc2 </italic>and <italic>Gli1, </italic>the Hh signaling downstream target genes, are overexpressed in epididymal WAT of<italic> Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic> mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>b), indicating the ectopic activation of Hh signaling in WAT to regulate its downstream gene expression for fat formation. Consistent with reduced white fat mass in<italic> Ptc1</italic><sup>mes/mes</sup> mice, we also observed the reduced expression of adipocyte marker genes <italic>aP2</italic> and <italic>adipsin</italic>. These reduced expression of adipocyte marker genes likely results from the decreased expression of adipogenic genes <italic>PPARgamma </italic>and <italic>CEBPalpha</italic>. It has been reported that Shh can inhibit adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells, C3H10T1/2 and primary mouse calvaria cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. Overexpression of <italic>Gli1</italic> and reduced expression of adipocyte markers, <italic>aP2</italic> and/or <italic>adipsin</italic>, and adipogenic transcription factors, <italic>PPARgamma </italic>and <italic>CEBPalpha, </italic> have been observed in Shh-treated 3T3-L1 or C3H10T1/2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. Moreover, reduced expression of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Gli2 </italic>has been reported in <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice and normal mice fed with a high fat diet to induce obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. Collectively, our results are consistent with the recent findings from cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, indicating that Hh signaling plays a role in inhibiting WAT formation in adult mice.</p><p>Since we did not observe overexpression of <italic>Gilz</italic>, an antiadipogenic gene, which has been reported by Suh <italic>et al </italic>in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, it is likely that the action of Hh signaling in adult white fat formation is via the inhibition of adipogenic gene transcription, rather than the stimulation of antiadipogenic gene expression. Our gene expression results indicate that Gli1 and Gli2, but not Gli3, may be two major transcription factors involved in adult WAT formation. These Gli transcription factors may inhibit transcription of adipogenic genes<italic> PPARgamma </italic>and <italic>CEBPalpha </italic>in adipocyte cells, resulting in reduced WAT formation. Or, they could directly regulate adipocyte gene expression such as<italic> aP2</italic> in WAT, given that Gli1 can inhibit <italic>aP2</italic> promoter activity in C3H10T1/2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. Future studies using molecular approaches such as gel-shift mobility and promoter reporter analyses will determine these possibilities. In addition, further molecular analyses of Hh signaling downstream genes in Hh agonist- or antagonist-treated 3T3-L1 cells over-expressing the amino region of Ptc1 (with a deletion of C-terminal residues of Ptc1) or mouse embryonic fibroblast cells isolated from <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic> embryos will likely provide more details about the mechanism about the action of C-terminal tail of Ptc1 during adipogenesis.</p><p>We observed that there was a gradual reduction of total WAT in <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>males during postnatal development with no significant reduction of total WAT weights at the age of 5-6 weeks, modest reduction in 19-20-week-old mice and remarkable reduction in 33-week-old or older mice. This gradual reduction of WAT observed in our studies is contradictory to the previous finding of the increased adipose weights in Shh-treated mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. One possible reason may be due to the differential expression levels of Hh target genes such as<italic> Ptc1</italic>, <italic>Ptc2 </italic>and <italic>Gli1 </italic>in white adipocyte cells in mice during postnatal development. Future gene expression analyses of <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic> mice at different developmental stages and Shh agonist-treated mice will be required to address this possibility.</p><p>Increased body weights have been observed in <italic>Ptc1 </italic>mutant embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref> and Shh-treated normal mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. Inhibition of body weight gain has also been reported in mice injected with antibodies against Hh proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. Ectopic activation of Hh signaling in <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>mice would lead to general stimulation of cell proliferation (other than adipocyte cells), resulting in an increase of body weight. However, we did not observe a significant increase of the body weight in <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>mice during postnatal development, except those mice at the age of 19-20 weeks after birth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This phenomena is unlikely due to the reduction of food consumption as well as potential aberrant glucose metabolism displayed in <italic>Ptc1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, since food consumption and serum glucose levels in adult <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>mice appears to be comparable with those of control littermates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Considering that the major organ weights including liver, heart, kidney, lung and spleen were not significantly different between <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>and their control mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>d), it is also unlikely the case that the general stimulation of cell proliferation by Hh signaling observed in embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> plays a significant role in body weight gain during postnatal development. Instead, Hh signaling may be active only in a subset of target tissues such as WAT to elicit its biological function in adult <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>mice. Interestingly, <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic> mice at the age of 33 weeks or older were not lighter than their control littermates, even though there was a significant reduction of total white fat mass (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In light of no significant changes in major organ weights in<italic> Ptc1<sup>mes/mes </sup></italic>mice, it is possible that hyperplasia in other tissues and/or cells other than WAT and tested organs exist in <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic> mice, which may offset the reduced WAT weights. In support of this, we did notice that <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>mice at that age appear to be rounder and bigger than their controls (unpublished data). Considering that activation of Hh signaling can push adipocyte precursor cells toward an osteogenic fate at the expense of adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, it is likely that <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>mice will display aberrant bone formation, which will affect the body weight during postnatal development. Recently, epidermal hyperplasia has been observed in adult <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes </sup></italic>mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, which will likely be another factor to offset the reduced WAT weight. Nevertheless, it appears that white fat mass is not a major factor that directly contributes to the body weight gain during postnatal development.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that<italic> Ptc1</italic> was expressed in the epididymal fat pad of adult mice. Reduced total white fat mass and white adipose cell size were observed in adult<italic> Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>mice. Truncated <italic>Ptc1</italic>, <italic>Ptc2</italic> and <italic>Gli1</italic> were overexpressed in WAT of <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic>, suggesting ectopic activation of Hh signaling in WAT. Consistent with reduced WAT, expression of adipogenic genes, <italic>PPARgamma </italic>and <italic>CEBPalpha,</italic> and adipocyte marker genes, <italic>aP2 </italic>and <italic>adipsin, </italic>were reduced in WAT of adult <italic>Ptc1<sup>mes/mes</sup></italic> mice. Our results suggest that deletion of the carboxyl terminal tail of Ptc1 can lead to a reduction of white fat mass during postnatal development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Dennis R.
