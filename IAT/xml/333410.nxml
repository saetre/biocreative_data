Activation requires phosphorylation of Thr172 of AMPK within the activation loop by upstream kinases (AMPKKs) that have not been identified. Recently, we identified three related protein kinases acting upstream of the yeast homolog of AMPK. Although they do not have obvious mammalian homologs, they are related to LKB1, a tumor suppressor that is mutated in the human Peutz-Jeghers cancer syndrome. We recently showed that LKB1 exists as a complex with two accessory subunits, STRAD&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and MO25&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report the following observations. First, two AMPKK activities purified from rat liver contain LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1;, and can be immunoprecipitated using anti-LKB1 antibodies. Second, both endogenous and recombinant complexes of LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and MO25&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; activate AMPK via phosphorylation of Thr172. Third, catalytically active LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; or STRAD&#x003b2; and MO25&#x003b1; or MO25&#x003b2; are required for full activity. Fourth, the AMPK-activating drugs AICA riboside and phenformin do not activate AMPK in HeLa cells (which lack LKB1), but activation can be restored by stably expressing wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, LKB1. Fifth, AICA riboside and phenformin fail to activate AMPK in immortalized fibroblasts from <italic>LKB1</italic>-knockout mouse embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results provide the first description of a physiological substrate for the LKB1 tumor suppressor and suggest that it functions as an upstream regulator of AMPK. Our findings indicate that the tumors in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome could result from deficient activation of AMPK as a consequence of LKB1 inactivation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta><notes><p>Correspondence regarding LKB1 should be addressed to Dario Alessi and regarding AMPK to Grahame Hardie.</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>AMP-activated protein kinase kinase (AMPKK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are the upstream and downstream components, respectively, of a protein kinase cascade that acts as a sensor of cellular energy charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. AMPK is activated by the elevation in cellular 5'-AMP that accompanies a fall in the ATP:ADP ratio due to the reaction catalyzed by adenylate kinase (2ADP &#x02194; ATP + AMP). This occurs during metabolic stresses such as hypoxia, ischaemia, glucose deprivation and, in skeletal and cardiac muscle, during contraction or exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Once activated by stress, AMPK switches on the uptake of glucose and fatty acids and the oxidative metabolism of these fuels to generate ATP, while switching off biosynthetic pathways that consume ATP. It achieves this metabolic switching both by direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes and by longer-term effects on gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>We have previously partially purified from rat liver an upstream kinase (AMPKK) that activates AMPK by phospho-rylation of AMPK residue Thr172 within the activation loop of the kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but we have been unable to identify the activity as a defined gene product. As an alternative approach, we searched for kinases upstream of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>homolog of AMPK (the SNF1 complex), taking advantage of genome-wide approaches available in that organism. This identified Elm1, Pak1 and Tos3 as alternative upstream kinases in yeast that can activate the SNF1 complex <italic>in vivo </italic>in a partially redundant manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The nearest relatives encoded by the human genome are calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) and LKB1 (see Additional data file 1 with the online version of this article). We have previously shown that CaMKK purified from pig brain could activate AMPK in cell-free assays (albeit poorly in comparison to the extent to which it activates its known substrate, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I); but the AMPKK previously purified from rat liver was not calmodulin-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. LKB1 is a 50 kDa serine/threonine kinase that was originally discovered as the product of the gene mutated in the autosomal dominant human disorder, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. People with PJS develop benign polyps in the gastrointestinal tract but also have a 15-fold increased risk of developing malignant tumors in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Nearly 100 different PJS mutations have been reported, and most are expected to impair the kinase activity of LKB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Several human tumor cell lines, including HeLa and G361 cells, lack expression of LKB1. Expression of wild-type LKB1, but not catalytically inactive LKB1 or PJS mutants, in G361 cells caused a G1-phase cell-cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that was associated with the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, and was dependent on p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Homozygous <italic>LKB1 </italic>knockout mice die of multiple defects at mid-gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Heterozygotes are viable, but most develop polyps similar to those found in people with PJS by 45 weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], although it is controversial as to whether these are caused by haploinsufficiency or loss of heterozygosity (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). It has also been reported that a significant number of <italic>LKB1</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mice over 50 weeks of age develop hepatocellular carcinomas that are associated with loss of <italic>LKB1 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These results show that LKB1 acts as a tumor suppressor and that the catalytic activity of LKB1 is essential for this function, but the downstream substrate(s) that LKB1 phosphorylates to mediate the suppression of cell proliferation remained unknown.</p><p>Recently, we reported that LKB1 is associated with two accessory proteins called Ste20-related adaptor protein-&#x003b1; (STRAD&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and mouse protein 25-&#x003b1; (MO25&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], for each of which there is also a closely related isoform (STRAD&#x003b2; and MO25&#x003b2;) encoded in the human genome. Although STRAD&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; are related to the Ste20 protein kinases, several of the residues expected in active protein kinases are not conserved, and they appear to be inactive 'pseudokinases' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. MO25&#x003b1; binds to the carboxyl-terminus of STRAD&#x003b1; and stabilizes the association between STRAD&#x003b1; and LKB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The association of LKB1 with STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; increased the kinase activity of LKB1 against an artificial substrate (myelin basic protein) and also enhanced its cytoplasmic localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], which was previously implicated in the tumor suppressor function of LKB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Here, on the basis of the sequence similarity between LKB1 and the upstream kinases identified for the yeast homolog of AMPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], we investigate whether LKB1:STRAD:MO25 complexes could play a role in activating AMPK in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Resolution of two AMPKKs from rat liver that both contain LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1;</title><p>While experimenting with different conditions to optimize recovery at the Q-Sepharose step of our previous purification protocol for AMPKK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], we found that we were able to resolve two peaks of activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Because the second peak corresponds to the AMPKK originally purified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], we refer to it as AMPKK1, with the first peak being termed AMPKK2. On size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-200, AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 eluted as proteins of large but distinct size, with estimated Stokes radii of 5.7 and 5.2 nm respectively. We probed blots of fractions across the Q-Sepharose column using antibodies against LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). This revealed that the activity of AMPKK2 correlated with the presence of the LKB1 polypeptide (around 50 kDa), as well as those of STRAD&#x003b1; (around 45/48 kDa) and MO25&#x003b1; (around 40 kDa). The monoclonal antibody against STRAD&#x003b1;, which is specific for the &#x003b1; isoform, detected a doublet, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; the explanation for this is not known. We did not obtain any signal of the correct molecular mass in these fractions using anti-MO25&#x003b2; antibody (not shown), consistent with previous observations that MO25&#x003b2; is not expressed in mouse liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We also obtained a faint signal for LKB1 and STRAD&#x003b1; in fractions containing AMPKK1, but at this loading MO25&#x003b1; was below the limit of detection. However, the presence of LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; in these fractions was confirmed by analyzing a higher loading (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>, bottom three panels). An interesting finding was that the LKB1 polypeptide migrated with a significantly faster mobility in AMPKK1 than in AMPKK2, while LKB1 in AMPKK2 appeared to run as a doublet (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>; see also Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> suggest that this difference in mobility was not due to a difference in phosphorylation state of the LKB1 polypeptide. Incubation of the AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 fractions with MgATP, followed by treatment with or without the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1&#x003b3; (PP1&#x003b3;) or the protein phosphatase 2A<sub>1 </sub>(PP2A<sub>1</sub>) holoenzyme, did not alter the mobility of any of the LKB1 polypeptides. The right-hand panel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref> shows that these protein phosphatases did dephosphorylate Thr172 on the &#x003b1; subunit of AMPK when incubated under identical conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>AMPKK activity can be immunoprecipitated from AMPKK1 and AMPKK2</title><p>Using anti-LKB1 antibody but not a pre-immune control immunoglobulin, we were able to immunoprecipitate AMPKK activity from fractions containing both AMPKK1 and AMPKK2. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> shows results of an experiment where the amount of AMPKK1 or AMPKK2 was limiting and the antibody was in excess, and shows that we were able to remove more than 80% of the activity from the peak fractions containing AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 by immunoprecipitating with anti-LKB1 antibody, while no activity was removed using a pre-immune control immunoglobulin. We could remove more than 95% of the AMPKK activity of a recombinant tagged LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b1; complex (see below) under the same conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). The small amount of activity remaining in the supernatants of the AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 immunoprecipitates could be accounted for by the fact that the immunoprecipitation was not quantitative, with a small amount of the LKB1 polypeptide remaining in the supernatant. No LKB1 polypeptide was precipitated using the pre-immune control immunoglobulin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).</p><p>Because of the small amount of AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 used in this experiment, it proved difficult to analyze the pellets for AMPKK activity and the presence of the other polypeptides. We therefore repeated the experiment with more AMPKK (the amount of antibody was now limiting) and analyzed the pellets only. This showed that we could recover a similar amount of AMPKK activity in the pellet from the peak fractions containing AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 as we could from the recombinant LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b1; complex, with no activity being recovered in the pellet using the pre-immune control immunoglobulin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Western blotting of the AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 pellets showed that they contained LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b1; complexes activate AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain in cell-free assays</title><p>To examine whether LKB1 activated AMPK on its own or whether the accessory subunits STRAD&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and MO25&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; were required, we expressed LKB1 tagged with glutathione-S-transferase (GST), FLAG-tagged STRAD&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and Myc-tagged MO25&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; in various combinations in HEK-293T cells, and purified the complexes on glutathione-Sepharose. We also used a GST-tagged kinase-inactive mutant of LKB1 (D194A), and a plasmid expressing GST alone, as controls. The complexes were purified on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain in the presence of MgATP, and activation of the catalytic domain as well as phosphorylation of Thr172 (using a phosphospecific anti-pT172 antibody) was measured. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> shows that LKB1 alone did not significantly increase the activity, or phosphorylation of Thr172, of the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain above the basal activity observed in the presence of GST alone (compare lanes 1 and 14). The same result was obtained with LKB1 that had been co-expressed with MO25&#x003b1; or MO25&#x003b2; (lanes 4 and 5), which was expected as these proteins do not interact with LKB1 in the absence of STRAD&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. An LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1; complex did give a small but significant activation, and Thr172 phosphorylation, of the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain above the basal value (compare lanes 1 and 2). To produce, however, a large activation and phosphorylation of the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain, a heterotrimeric complex containing LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; or STRAD&#x003b2;, and MO25&#x003b1; or MO25&#x003b2; was required (lanes 6 to 9). With the heterotrimeric complexes the degree of activation was in the order LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b1; &#x0003e; LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b2; &#x02248; LKB1:STRAD&#x003b2;:MO25&#x003b1; &#x0003e; LKB1:STRAD&#x003b2;:MO25&#x003b2;. The ability of LKB1:STRAD:MO25 complexes to activate AMPK&#x003b1;1 was dependent on LKB1 catalytic activity, because complexes of a catalytically inactive mutant of LKB1 (D194A) with the various combinations of STRAD&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and MO25&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (lanes 10&#x02013;13) were unable to activate or phosphorylate AMPK&#x003b1;1. The degree of activation obtained with the various complexes of wild-type LKB1 correlated well with the phosphorylation of Thr172, as assessed by probing blots with a phosphospecific antibody (pT172). The bottom three panels in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, probed with anti-GST, anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies, confirm that the relevant STRAD and MO25 subunit co-precipitated with LKB1 when DNAs encoding these subunits had been co-transfected. When STRAD&#x003b1; was co-expressed with LKB1 in the absence of a MO25 subunit, the amount of STRAD&#x003b1; subunit co-precipitated with LKB1 was reduced (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 6 and 7).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref> provides evidence that Thr172 was the only site on the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain phosphorylated by the LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b1; complex. When the two proteins were incubated together in the presence of [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, the wild-type AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain became <sup>32</sup>P-labeled, but a T172A mutant of the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain did not.</p></sec><sec><title>AMPKK1, AMPKK2 and recombinant LKB1:STRAD:MO25 complexes also activate heterotrimeric AMPK complexes</title><p>Although most of the AMPKK assays in this study were conducted using the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain as substrate, AMPKK1, AMPKK2 and the recombinant GST-LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b1; complex also activated heterotrimeric AMPK complexes. We incubated rat liver AMPK (a mixture of &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2 in complexes with &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b3;1) with MgATP with or without each of the three AMPKK preparations. We then immunoprecipitated with anti-AMPK&#x003b1;1 or anti-AMPK&#x003b1;2 antibodies, and measured the activation of each isoform in the precipitate. The results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) show that the AMPK&#x003b1;1 and AMPK&#x003b1;2 complexes were activated by all three AMPKK preparations. Blotting of the three AMPKK preparations using anti-LKB1, anti-STRAD&#x003b1; and anti-MO25&#x003b1; antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>) showed that activation of the heterotrimers was not simply proportional to the amount of these polypeptides in the preparation. Although the amounts of each AMPKK preparation used for Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref> had been chosen to yield a comparable degree of AMPK activation, there was much more LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; in the recombinant LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b1; complex than in either of the native complexes, and more of all three subunits in AMPKK2 than in AMPKK1. All three AMPKK preparations also activated recombinant &#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1 and &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1 complexes prepared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] by co-expression of recombinant DNA in CCL13 cells (not shown).</p><p>The assays in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref> were conducted in the presence of 200 &#x003bc;M AMP. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref> shows that when the AMPK&#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1 or AMPK&#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1 heterotrimers were used as substrate, the activation of all three AMPKK preparations was stimulated from 2- to 3.5-fold by AMP. When the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain was used as substrate, however, the activation was not affected, or was even slightly inhibited, by AMP. The activity of the three AMPKK preparations was not significantly affected by the direct addition of phenformin to the assays up to 1 mM concentration, although concentrations above that started to inhibit AMPKK activity (not shown). These results indicate that neither AMP nor phenformin directly stimulates the LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b1; complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Endogenous LKB1 that activates AMPK can be immunoprecipitated from 293 cells but not from HeLa cells</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref> shows that AMPKK activity that activated the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain above the basal activity, and phosphorylated Thr172, could be immunoprecipitated from untransfected HEK-293T cell extract using anti-LKB1 antibody (lane 1), but not pre-immune control immunoglobulin (lane 2). As reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], immunopre-cipitation of endogenous LKB1 resulted in the co-precipitation of STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; (lane 1). As a further control, we employed normal HeLa cells as an LKB1-null cell line, as it is known that LKB1 is not expressed in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Consistent with this, no LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; subunits or AMPKK activity were immunoprecipitated from the same amount of HeLa cell-extract protein using anti-LKB1 antibody (lane 3). AMPKK activity and Thr172 phosphorylation, as well as detectable STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; subunits, were recovered following immunoprecipitation of LKB1 from a line of HeLa cells that stably express wild-type LKB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] (lane 5). The LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; polypeptides were still recovered in cells expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of LKB1, but AMPKK activity was not (lane 7). Although the LKB1 polypeptide was overexpressed to a large extent in the HeLa cells compared to the endogenous levels observed in 293 cells (compare lane 1 with lane 5 or 7), it is clear that the availability of STRAD&#x003b1; and/or MO25&#x003b1; limits the activity in these cells. There was less AMPKK activity and Thr172 phosphorylation, as well as less co-precipitated STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1;, in HeLa cells expressing LKB1 than in 293 cells, even though the LKB1 polypeptide was overexpressed. The AMPKK activity in the immunoprecipitates from 293 cells and HeLa cells expressing wild-type LKB1 correlated with the levels of STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; in the complex, rather than with the levels of LKB1.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref> shows western blots of total lysates of the same cells. Although the expression of MO25&#x003b1; in HeLa cells was lower than in 293 cells, it was unaffected by overexpression of either wild-type or kinase-dead LKB1, as was expression of the protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2, used as loading controls. Interestingly, however, expression of the STRAD&#x003b1; doublet was almost undetectable in the control HeLa cells but was readily detectable in cells stably expressing wild-type or kinase-dead LKB1.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of LKB1 restores activation of AMPK in HeLa cells</title><p>The drug 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICA) riboside activates AMPK in intact cells by being taken up and immediately converted by adenosine kinase to AICA riboside monophosphate (ZMP), which mimics the effect of AMP on the AMPK system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The anti-diabetic drug metformin activates AMPK in intact cells by a mechanism that is not known, although it does not involve changes in cellular adenine nucleotide content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We have previously found (unpublished observations) that, although AMPK is expressed in HeLa cells, it is not activated either by AICA riboside or by metformin. A potential explanation for this is that HeLa cells do not express LKB1 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; see also above). To examine whether expression of recombinant LKB1 might restore the ability of HeLa cells to respond to these drugs, we used the HeLa cell line that stably expresses wild-type LKB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In these experiments we used phenformin, a close relative of metformin that we have found to activate AMPK more rapidly than metformin in other cell types. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref> shows that neither AICA riboside nor phenformin activated AMPK above the basal level in control HeLa cells. In cells expressing wild-type LKB1 but not the kinase-inactive mutant, however, both AICA riboside and phenformin caused a robust activation, as well as a small increase in basal activity. The AMPK activity also correlated with the phosphorylation of Thr172 on AMPK&#x003b1; (shown by probing with the anti-pT172 antibody, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>) and with the phosphorylation of a downstream target of AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC; shown by probing with a phosphospecific antibody against Ser-79, the primary AMPK site on that protein; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). Interestingly, stable expression of wild-type LKB1 in the HeLa cells caused a small but reproducible degree of upregulation of expression of AMPK&#x003b1;1 and a marked down-regulation of expression of ACC (data not shown). These effects may be a consequence of the increase in basal AMPK activity shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>. Because the expression of these proteins was not uniform in these cells, in order to accurately quantify their phosphorylation status we simultaneously probed single blots of lysates using either anti-pT172 and anti-&#x003b1;1/&#x003b1;2 antibodies (to detect Thr172 phosphorylation and total AMPK&#x003b1;), or with anti-pACC and streptavidin (to detect Ser79 phosphorylation and total ACC). The two probing reagents used in each of these dual-labeling protocols were labeled with fluorescent dyes emitting in different regions of the infra-red spectrum, and the results were quantified in two separate channels using an infra-red laser scanner. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>, these results are expressed as ratios of the signal obtained using the phosphospecific antibody to the signal obtained for the total protein, which corrects for different levels of expression of the proteins. This revealed that there was a good correlation between activation of AMPK and phosphorylation of Thr172. There was also a correlation with phosphorylation of ACC, although in this case AICA riboside appeared to have a larger effect than phenformin.</p></sec><sec><title>AMPK activation is defective in immortalized fibroblasts from LKB<sup>-/- </sup>mouse embryos</title><p>We performed further experiments with immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF cells) from embryonic-day (E) 9.5 embryos of <italic>LKB1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>knockout mice.

The key evidence may be summarized as follows. First, during previous extensive efforts to purify from rat liver extracts activities that activate dephosphorylated AMPK, ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and subsequent unpublished work), we have not detected any activities other than AMPKK1 and AMPKK2, at least under the assay conditions used. Second, both AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 purified from rat liver contained LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; that were detectable by western blotting and whose presence correlated with AMPKK activity across the column fractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Third, the ability of the AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 fractions to activate AMPK was almost completely eliminated by immunoprecipitation with anti-LKB1 antibody, but not a control immunoglobulin. Activity was also detected, along with the LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; polypeptides, in the anti-LKB1 immunoprecipitates but not in the control immunoprecipitates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Fourth, the AMPKK activity in AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 was not a contaminant that co-precipitated with anti-LKB1 antibody, because recombinant complexes of GST-LKB1, STRAD and MO25 expressed in 293 cells and purified on glutathione-Sepharose also activated the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain efficiently, and phosphorylated Thr172 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Complexes formed from a catalytically inactive mutant LKB1 failed to activate or phosphorylate AMPK. Phosphorylation of the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain by this recombinant complex occurred exclusively at Thr172, because the wild-type AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain, but not a T172A mutant, could be phosphorylated using [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and the GST-LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b1; complex. Fifth, although most of the experiments in this study were conducted using the bacterially expressed AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain as substrate, AMPKK1, AMPKK2 and recombinant LKB1-STRAD&#x003b1;-MO25&#x003b1; complexes also efficiently activated heterotrimeric AMPK complexes, both the &#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1 and &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1 isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Sixth, HeLa cells, unlike HEK 293T cells, do not express LKB1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and therefore represent a natural 'knockout' cell line. The drugs AICA riboside and phen-formin, which activate AMPK in other cell types via distinct mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], did not activate AMPK in HeLa cells. In cells stably transfected with DNA that expressed wild-type LKB1 (but not a catalytically inactive mutant), however, the ability of AICA riboside and phenformin to activate AMPK, to phosphorylate Thr172 on the AMPK&#x003b1; subunit, and to cause phosphorylation of a downstream target (ACC) was restored (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This experiment proves that (in the presence of STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1;) LKB1 is sufficient for AMPK activation, but does not prove that it is necessary, because expression of upstream kinases other than LKB1 might also be defective in HeLa cells. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> also confirms that STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; are necessary to generate an active complex because, although the LKB1 polypeptide was greatly overexpressed in the stably transfected HeLa cells compared to the endogenous level in 293 cells, the AMPKK activity, and the amounts of STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1;, in the anti-LKB1 immunoprecipitate, were actually less. This suggests that the amount of active LKB1 was limited by the availability of STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1;. Seventh, in <italic>LKB1</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>MEF cells, AMPK became activated in response to both AICA riboside and phenformin. In <italic>LKB1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>MEF cells, however, the basal activity of AMPK was lower and AICA riboside and phenformin failed to activate AMPK. These results show that LKB1 is both necessary and sufficient for AMPK activation, at least in MEF cells.</p><p>All of the assays of the activity of LKB1 and its complexes described in this article, whether using the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain or AMPK heterotrimers as substrate, utilized MgATP as the co-substrate. Previous studies of the kinase activity of LKB1, whether utilizing autophosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], or p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] or myelin basic protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] as substrates, had used MnATP as co-substrate and had reported that there was no activity with the more physiological MgATP complex. Thus, unlike previously used substrates, AMPK is a good substrate for LKB1 complexes even using the physiologically relevant divalent metal ion.</p><p>We have previously reported that the activation of AMPK by AMPKK1 (called at that time AMPKK) was stimulated by AMP, and presented evidence favoring the hypothesis that AMP acted not only by binding to the downstream kinase and making it a better substrate, but also by activating the upstream kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref> support the first hypothesis but do not support the second. Using &#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1or &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1&#x003b3;1 AMPK complexes as substrate, activation by AMPKK1, AMPKK2 or LKB1 was stimulated from 2-to 3.5-fold by AMP. When using the AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain as substrate, however, AMP had no effect, or even slightly inhibited activation. The AMPK&#x003b1;1 catalytic domain is not allosterically activated by AMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and AMP binding appears to be a function of the &#x003b3; subunit ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and unpublished observations). Taken together with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], these data support the idea that the effects of AMP on the kinase cascade are all mediated through binding to the downstream kinase, AMPK. The previous report that AMP stimulated the upstream kinase was obtained using a less pure AMPKK preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and we have been unable to reproduce this with the more purified preparations utilized here.</p><p>Both AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 appear to contain LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1;, and thus it is not clear at present why they resolve on Q-Sepharose chromatography. One interesting difference is that the LKB1 polypeptide in AMPKK1 migrated significantly faster on SDS gels than that in AMPKK2 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). LKB1 is known to be phosphorylated at up to eight sites, and is also farnesylated at Cys433, near the carboxyl-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], suggesting that the difference in mobility might be due to a difference in covalent modification. It did not appear to be due to differential phosphorylation, however, because neither incubation with MgATP, nor protein phosphatase treatment, produced a shift in mobility of the LKB1 polypeptides in either AMPKK1 or AMPKK2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). Another difference between AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 was their Stokes radii estimated by size exclusion chromatography (5.7 versus 5.2 nm respectively). By combining estimates of Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient, we previously estimated the molecular mass of AMPKK1 to be 195 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and assuming a similar shape our estimate of the Stokes radius of AMPKK2 would suggest a mass of about 175 kDa. These values are close to, although slightly larger than, the calculated mass of 140 kDa for a 1:1:1 LKB1:STRAD&#x003b1;:MO25&#x003b1; complex. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that AMPKK1 and/or AMPKK2 contain additional associated protein(s) other than LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and MO25&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, it is also possible that differences in covalent modification might affect the shape of the complex and hence the Stokes radius. Whatever the reason for the difference in electrophoretic and chromatographic behavior of AMPKK1 and AMPKK2, a clear conclusion from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> is that, for the same amount of LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; polypeptides, the former was more active than the latter. Although further work is required to explain these differences, they might be caused by the same covalent modifications that alter the mobility on SDS gels. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> also shows that, for the same amount of LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; polypeptides, both AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 were much more active than the recombinant complex. The low activity of the latter might be explained by the presence of the purification tag on each subunit, by imperfect folding or assembly, or by an altered level of covalent modification, when the complex is overexpressed. As mentioned above, our data do not rule out the possibility that the recombinant LKB1 complex may be lacking additional subunit(s) present in the endogenous AMPKK1 and AMPKK2 complexes.</p><p>Our present results confirm, using a probable physiological substrate, previous findings using an artificial substrate (myelin basic protein) that a STRAD subunit stimulates the kinase activity of LKB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and that the MO25 subunit stimulates the activity further, probably by stabilizing the LKB1:STRAD complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. No AMPKK activity was obtained with recombinant LKB1 unless a STRAD subunit was also expressed, and the activity was increased substantially by the additional presence of a MO25 subunit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It was also noticeable that the amount of STRAD&#x003b1; and STRAD&#x003b2; that co-precipitated with LKB1 was greatly enhanced by the co-expression of MO25&#x003b1; or MO25&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Another new result in this article is that STRAD&#x003b1; protein (unlike MO25&#x003b1;) was not detectable in HeLa cells unless either wild-type or kinase-dead LKB1 was stably expressed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). These results suggest that STRAD&#x003b1; is normally complexed with LKB1 in the cell, and that STRAD is unstable in the absence of LKB1. The exact mechanism by which the STRAD and MO25 subunits activate LKB1 remains unclear, but these accessory subunits introduce scope for additional regulation of the kinase. It is already known that LKB1 phosphorylates STRAD&#x003b1; at two distinct sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and that STRAD&#x003b1; and MO25&#x003b1; form a complex that retains LKB1 in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>People with PJS are heterozygous for mutations in LKB1, and further work is required to establish whether loss of one allele of <italic>LKB1 </italic>could affect AMPK activation in these patients. An interesting unanswered question is whether activation of AMPK can explain the ability of LKB1 to act as a tumor suppressor and to arrest cell growth and proliferation. This certainly seems plausible, because apart from the fact that AMPK is a general inhibitor of biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], there is accumulating evidence that it can regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. For example, activation of AMPK inhibits proliferation of HepG2 cells by stabilizing p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, expression of LKB1 in G361 cells that normally lack expression of the kinase causes an arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle that is associated with an induction of p21 and is dependent on p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Another exciting possibility is that LKB1:STRAD:MO25 complexes might also act as upstream kinases for other protein kinases, in the same manner that PDK1 phosphorylates threonine residues in the activation loop of a number of kinases of the 'AGC' subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A dendrogram showing the relationships between catalytic domain sequences of 518 human protein kinases encoded in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] shows that the AMPK&#x003b1;1 and AMPK&#x003b1;2 subunits lie on a small sub-branch also containing eight other protein kinases (NuaK1, NuaK2, BrsK1, BrsK2, SIK, QIK, QSK and MELK), most of which either have not been studied previously or have very little known about them. An alignment of the activation loop sequences of these kinases is shown in Additional data file 2 with the online version of this article and show that, as well as conservation of the threonine residue phosphorylated by LKB1 in AMPK, they have other conserved motifs that are not present in other protein kinases known to be activated by other upstream kinases. It remains to be determined whether the other kinases in the AMPK subfamily are activated by phosphorylation of the conserved threonine residue by LKB1:STRAD:MO25 complexes, but if this is the case these other kinases might mediate some of the tumor suppressor functions of LKB1.</p><p>A significant number of inherited forms of PJS found in certain families do not exhibit mutations in the LKB1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], indicating that there could be other causative loci for PJS. On the basis of the results presented here it would be very interesting to examine whether mutations in the genes encoding STRAD&#x003b1; or &#x003b2;, MO25&#x003b1; or &#x003b2;, or any of the subunits of AMPK or of the AMPK-like subfamily of kinases, are found in PJS patients who do not have mutations in the LKB1 gene.</p><p>While this article was under review, two papers were published that are relevant to our results. Hong <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] reported that FLAG-tagged LKB1 expressed in, and purified from, COS7 cells would activate a recombinant AMPK heterotrimer, and phosphorylate the &#x003b1; subunit at Thr172, in cell-free assays. This is consistent with our results, although these authors provided no evidence that LKB1 acts on AMPK <italic>in vivo</italic>, or that LKB1 required the presence of the STRAD and MO25 subunits to phosphorylate AMPK. Spicer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] reported evidence, based on expression of recombinant LKB1 in cultured cells, suggesting that it might act upstream of the PAR1A protein kinase. PAR1A (also known as MARK-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]) lies with three closely related protein kinases (MARK-1, MARK-2, MARK-4) on a branch of the human kinase tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] immediately adjacent to AMPK-&#x003b1;1 and -&#x003b1;2 and the eight AMPK-like kinases discussed above. Although Spicer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] did not provide evidence that LKB1 directly phosphorylated PAR1A, the results of our study suggest that this might be the case. The sequence of the activation segment of PARIA is given in Additional data file 2 (available with the online version of this article).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results provide strong evidence, both in cell-free assays and in intact cells, that complexes between LKB1, STRAD&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and MO25&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; constitute the long sought-after upstream kinases that activate AMPK via phosphorylation at Thr172 in the activation loop. Because it is already known that pharmacological activation of AMPK causes a general inhibition of biosynthesis, as well as a p53-dependent arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle, activation of AMPK by LKB1 might explain, at least in part, the ability of LKB1 to act as a tumor suppressor.
