Two UNC45 genes are found in vertebrates, including a striated muscle specific form, Unc45b. We have investigated the role of Unc45b in myosin folding. Epitope tagged murine Unc45b (Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup>) was expressed in muscle and non-muscle cells and bacteria, isolated and characterized. The protein is a soluble monomer in solution with a compact folded rod-shaped structure of &#x0223c;19 nm length by electron microscopy. When over-expressed in striated muscle cells, Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> fractionates as a cytosolic protein and isolates as a stable complex with Hsp90. Purified Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> re-binds Hsp90 and forms a stable complex in solution. The endogenous Unc45b in muscle cell lysates is also found associated with Hsp90. The Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup>/Hsp90 complex binds the partially folded myosin motor domain when incubated with myosin subfragments synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate. This binding is independent of the myosin rod or light chains. Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> does not bind native myosin subfragments consistent with a chaperone function. More importantly, Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> enhances myosin motor domain folding during <italic>de novo</italic> motor domain synthesis indicating that it has a direct role in myosin maturation. Thus, mammalian Unc45b is a cytosolic protein that forms a stable complex with Hsp90, selectively binds the unfolded conformation of the myosin motor domain, and promotes motor domain folding.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Folding of myosin in striated muscle follows a pathway mediated by the molecular chaperones Hsp90, and Hsc70.

Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> expressed in bacteria is a soluble monomeric protein that readily forms a complex with purified Hsp90. Pure Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> is an elongated molecule when visualized by EM. The Unc45b/Hsp90 complex specifically binds the unfolded myosin motor domain but not native myosin, binding interactions that are characteristic of a chaperone complex.

The Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> digest was comprised of the 60, 37, 34 and 26 kDa fragments and did not contain any full length Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup>. These four fragments remained associated with the Flag-tagged 37 kDa fragment in the pull-down assay, and they retained the same level of motor domain and Hsp90 binding activity as an equivalent amount of undigested Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup>. Therefore, the Hsp90 binding TPR motifs on the N-terminus remain associated with the C-terminal UCS domain in the trypsin clipped protein. These data are inconsistent with a model of the protein as three independent modular domains. Instead, the results indicate extensive folded interactions that span the full length of the molecule and include surface accessible and protease sensitive loops that do not mark domain boundaries.</p><p>Finally, the structure of Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> was visualized by electron microscopy after rotary shadowing with platinum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002137-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The images of single molecules produced with this contrasting method were analyzed using reference-free classification and averaging techniques to reveal an extended and slightly curved, rod-shaped molecule that is about 19 nm long. There is some suggestion of substructure, but the interpretation is limited by the metal replica method used to contrast the protein. Purified human Hsp90 was analyzed in parallel with Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> using the same imaging and single particle averaging techniques. The Hsp90 is a dimer of the &#x0223c;90 kDa subunits that associate via a C-terminal dimerization domain.

Myosin motor domain folding is assisted in striated muscle cells by the general chaperones Hsp90 and Hsc70 and muscle specific co-factors.

Knockdown of Unc45b protein levels results in paralysis and cardiac dysfunction in zebrafish embryos correlated with a loss of myosin filaments in sarcomeres. We have now shown that Unc45b is an active component of the chaperone machinery associated with the folding of the myosin motor domain providing a biochemical explanation of the genetic phenotypes.</p><p>The Unc45b interaction with Hsp90 is highly selective. The reticulocyte lysate contains about 3&#x02013;5 &#x000b5;M Hsp90 that is generally found as a complex with an array of Hsp90 interacting co-chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002137-Murphy1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Unc45b binding to Hsp90 in the reticulocyte lysate is surprisingly free of other Hsp90 interacting proteins suggesting that the interaction is independent of other components of the Hsp90 chaperone machinery present in the lysate. The endogenous Unc45b in muscle cell lysates also interacts with Hsp90 and isolates as a complex with the chaperone. Another &#x0223c;120 kDa protein component that has not been identified was also found associated with the Unc45b/Hsp90 complex. Given the selectivity of binding in the retiulocyte lysate, this interaction might be important in muscle. This new component was not detected when Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> was over-expressed in muscles cells. The adenovirus induced expression produces up to 100 fold more Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> than the levels of endogenous Unc45b found in these cells. Hsp90 is abundant in muscle amounting to 1&#x02013;3&#x00025; of the total protein and is present in excess of the Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> produced by over-expression. In contrast, the amount of the 120 kDa protein might be limiting and below the detection limit in the over-expressed Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup>/Hsp90 complex we isolated from the muscle cells.</p><p>The Unc45b/Hsp90 complex selectively binds the unfolded myosin motor domain but not native myosin subfragments. Therefore, the Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup>/Hsp90 complex has a binding preference consistent with molecular chaperone activity. However, binding of non-native myosin does not necessarily place the Unc45bFlag/Hsp90 complex on the myosin folding pathway. The stimulation of smooth muscle motor domain folding in a <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis assay clearly places this complex on a pathway to myosin maturation. Addition of pure Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> or the Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup>/Hsp90 complex dramatically enhances the accumulation of the native conformation by conversion of the unfolded protein to the compact folded conformation.</p><p>In a mechanistic characterization of this reaction presented elsewhere, we demonstrate that both vertebrate isoforms of Unc45 behave as activators of the Hsp90 dependent folding of the smooth muscle myosin motor domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002137-Liu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. These results place Unc45b and Hsp90 on the myosin maturation pathway. However, in that study we also show that neither isoform supports the folding of the striated muscle motor domain. So, while the Unc45b/Hsp90 complex is sufficient for smooth muscle motor domain folding other components are still needed to complement the folding of the striated muscle myosin motor domain in this assay. These factors are probably involved in regulating myosin folding <italic>in situ</italic>.</p><p>The levels of UNC-45 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> appear to be tightly controlled by ubiquitinylation and turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002137-Hoppe1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and it has been suggested that UNC-45 regulates sacomere assembly through myosin ubiquitinylation and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002137-Landsverk1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. We did not observe enhanced turnover of Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> as a consequence of forced over-expression of the protein in the C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, there was no disruption of the differentiation program or reduction in the assembly of the striated muscle myosin in the C2C12 myotubes promoted by over-expression of Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup>. It is possible that the ubiquitin-linked regulatory pathway was overwhelmed by the level of expression induced here. Alternatively, tight regulation of Unc45b levels might not be an element of the vertebrate regulation system. Nonetheless, we have shown here that a primary activity of Unc45b is as a positive effector of myosin folding.</p><p>Finally, we have shown that Unc45b is a monomer in solution with a compact rod-shaped structure by EM. The molecule has been represented as modular based on the division into three homology regions corresponding to the N-terminal TPR motifs, a large central region of uncertain function, and the C-terminal UCS domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002137-Barral1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Partial protease digestion produces a discrete C-terminal 37 kDa fragment containing most of the UCS homology region. However, in pull-down assays the flag-tagged 37 kDa fragment remains associated with the other proteolytic fragments, and the fragments retain the same level of motor domain and Hsp90 binding activity as an equivalent amount of undigested Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup>. These results are similar to what is seen with myosin subfragment-1 (S1). Exposed surface loops in the S1 structure are clipped by a variety of proteases producing discrete fragments without disrupting the structure or binding activity of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002137-Rayment1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the Hsp90 binding TPR motifs on the N-terminus of the trypsin cleaved Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup> remain associated with the C-terminal UCS domain, suggesting extensive folded interactions that span the full length of the molecule. These results blur the boundaries between the homology regions and provide a tantalizing first glimpse at this interesting Hsp90 dependent co-chaperone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002137.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Expression and purification of bacteria expressed Unc45b<sup>Flag</sup>.
