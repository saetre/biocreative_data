Effector T cell functions are under a tight control of a specialized T cell subset, regulatory T cells (Treg). At present, nothing is known about the in situ presence of Treg in human atherosclerotic tissue. In the present study we investigated the frequency of naturally occurring Treg cells in all developmental stages of human atherosclerotic lesions including complicated thrombosed plaques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p>Normal arteries, early lesions (American Heart Association classification types I, II, and III), fibrosclerotic plaques (types Vb and Vc) and &#x02018;high risk&#x02019; plaques (types IV, Va and VI) were obtained at surgery and autopsy. Serial sections were immunostained for markers specific for regulatory T cells (FOXP3 and GITR) and the frequency of these cells was expressed as a percentage of the total numbers of CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.

Treg were present in the intima during all stages of plaque development (0.5&#x02013;5&#x00025;). Also in the adventitia of atherosclerotic vessels Treg were encountered, in similar low amounts. High risk lesions contained significantly increased numbers of Treg compared to early lesions (mean: 3.9 and 1.2&#x00025;, respectively). The frequency of FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in high risk lesions was also higher compared to stable lesions (1.7&#x00025;), but this difference was not significant.

An important population of Treg is formed by the naturally occurring Treg, phenotypically characterized by a high constitutive expression of CD25, the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor, and also referred to as CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Bacchetta1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, using the AHA classification of lesions, we compared specifically the relative frequency of Treg in early, stable, and high risk (vulnerable and thrombosed) plaques.

Also in atherosclerotic disease the presence and function of regulatory T cells may have important implications, because of their potential suppressive effects on the in situ inflammatory response. In the present study we investigated the presence of naturally occurring regulatory T cells in normal and atherosclerotic vessels by studying the presence of FOXP3 and GITR positive T cells. In normal intima T cells are virtually absent. T cells and Treg are present in atherosclerotic plaques, but the frequency of the latter is low (0.5&#x02013;5&#x00025;). Despite these relatively low numbers, related to the total number of T cells present in the plaque, we found that high risk plaques (AHA IV, Va and VI) contain significantly more FOXP3 positive T cells compared to early lesions (AHA 1, II and III). It is known that the onset of acute coronary syndromes is associated with changes in the inflammatory response in these lesions, including a shift in phenotype of intraplaque T cells: the frequency of activated T lymphocytes is significantly increased in unstable lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Hosono1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-vanderWal2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, it is has been shown that the onset of acute coronary syndromes is associated with the antigen driven, oligoclonal proliferation of certain T cell subsets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-DePalma1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. It appears that as a result of such an increase in T cell mediated inflammatory activity, also the frequency of Treg increases in these unstable lesions.</p><p>At present, most studies on Treg in relation to (auto) immunity have been performed on peripheral blood Treg. Peripheral blood Treg are relatively easily detectable by their high constitutive expression of CD25 (CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> subset). In humans, decreased frequency of peripheral blood CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> Treg have been linked to different types of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, type-1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Ehrenstein1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Crispin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently it was shown that the frequency of Treg is also decreased in the peripheral blood of patients with acute coronary syndromes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Mor2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Sardella1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study is the first describing (low numbers) of Treg also inside human plaques.</p><p>In the present study we used FOXP3 and GITR to analyze the presence of Treg in situ. GITR is directly involved in maintaining immunological tolerance by GITR-GITRligand interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Stephens1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, recently activated T lymphocytes may also express GITR, and therefore the expression of GITR by T lymphocytes should be taken with caution. Still, in the present study we found that, apart from the adventitia in advanced atherosclerotic plaques, the distribution of GITR and FOXP3 were comparable, and the results obtained with GITR were in line with the observations obtained with FOXP3. Transcription factor FOXP3 is now generally considered as the most reliable antigen to identify naturally occurring Treg <italic>in situ</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-deBoer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Hori1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Khattri1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Only recently reliable monoclonal antibodies specific for FOXP3 became available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Roncador1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, and therefore there are not many data available yet on the distribution or frequency of Treg in solid tissues. In the present study we observed that the mean frequency of FOXP3 positive Treg in atherosclerotic intima, but also in atherosclerotic adventitia was in the range of the 0.5&#x02013;5&#x00025; of the total number of CD3 positive T cells. By contrast, in a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-deBoer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, performed under identical methodological conditions, we found that the frequency of FOXP3 positive T cells in normal skin and a panel of inflammatory skin diseases was in the range of 25&#x02013;30&#x00025;, which is significantly higher compared to the situation in atherosclerotic intima and adventitia. It thus appears that, at least compared to normal and various T cell mediated inflammatory skin diseases, the frequency of Treg in atherosclerotic tissue is very low. This raises two important questions: first, what the reason for this low frequency of Treg in atherosclerotic tissue, and the second, does this have biological and/or clinical implications.</p><p>Recently, it was shown that oxidized lipoproteins inhibited FOXP3 expression and Treg function of mouse effector cells <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Mor1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it could be that oxidized lipids, present already in the intima in the earliest stages of atherosclerosis, locally inhibit FOXP3 expression and Treg function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, we found that the frequency of Treg is not only relatively low in advanced, but also in early lesions. Similarly, the low frequency of FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Treg in the adventitia could be the result of plaque derived lipoproteins, transported via Vasa vasorum microvessels to the adventitia. On the other hand, it is also possible that other mechanisms are responsible for the low numbers of Treg, like a decreased homing of Treg into vascular tissue. Still, it also important to note the frequency of Treg may be highly variable between different solid tissues, and so far we only compared (inflammatory) skin and atherosclerotic vessels.</p><p>The second important question that should be addressed concerns the biological and clinical implications of this low frequency of Treg in atherosclerotic tissue. In this respect it is first important to emphasize again that both experimental, as well as studies in humans have clearly shown that T cells and T cell activation are very important in development of atherosclerotic lesions, and the onset of acute cardiovascular syndromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Zhou1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, it has been shown that increasing the numbers of Treg in atherosclerosis prone (ApoE-/-) mice by means of adoptive transfer leads to smaller atherosclerotic lesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Mallat1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000779-Mor1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, implicating that Treg do appear capable modifying plaque volume in vivo. These observations, taken together with the findings on the in situ expression of Treg in human plaques of the present study make it tempting to speculate that such low umber of Treg do have implications could be explain the smoldering chronic inflammatory process in the longstanding course of atherosclerosis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0000779-Ross1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><year>1999</year><article-title>Atherosclerosis&#x02013;an inflammatory disease.</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><volume>340</volume><fpage>115</fpage><lpage>126</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9887164</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0000779-Jonasson1"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jonasson</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Holm</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Skalli</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Bondjers</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansson</surname><given-names>GK</given-names></name></person-group><year>1986</year><article-title>Regional accumulations of T cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells in the human atherosclerotic plaque.</article-title><source>Arteriosclerosis</source><volume>6</volume><fpage>131</fpage><lpage>138</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2937395</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0000779-vanderWal1"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>van der Wal</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>Bentz van de Berg</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>van der Loos</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name></person-group><year>1989</year><article-title>Atherosclerotic lesions in humans.
