To investigate whether such a LIF-controlled survival pathway might be commonly induced upon photoreceptor injury independently of the nature of the toxic stimulus, we analyzed the role of LIF during light-induced retinal degeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p><italic>Lif<sup>+/&#x02013;</sup></italic> and <italic>Lif<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice were exposed to 15,000&#x000a0;lx of white light for 2 h. Retinal morphology and rhodopsin content were analyzed nine days after light exposure. Gene expression studies were done using real-time PCR. Protein levels were determined by western blotting using specific antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A lack of LIF reduced survival of photoreceptor cells after light exposure. In the absence of LIF several genes encoding molecules involved in the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) signaling pathway were not activated after light exposure. Presence or absence of LIF did not affect AKT (also known as protein kinase B, PKB) signaling and had only a mild effect on extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Stress-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) induction was minimal in the absence of LIF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that increased retinal expression of LIF is a general response to photoreceptor injury. Independent of the nature of the toxic insult (gene mutation, light), LIF may activate an endogenous rescue pathway that protects viable photoreceptor cells, leading to an increased photoreceptor survival in the stressed retina. This defense system may depend on the Jak/STAT pathway and may involve endothelin 2 (EDN2) but not (or only minimally) AKT and ERK1,2 signaling.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>corr-author</meta-name><meta-value>Grimm</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Degenerative diseases of the retina are widespread. In Europe and North America, for people over age 60, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness and severe visual impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Currently, no effective therapies are available to sustain or improve vision in those with AMD or retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Several strategies are being followed to develop therapeutic approaches, one of which involves neuroprotection. However, in order for effective pharmaceuticals to be developed, the molecular events occurring in the degenerative retina need to be understood. Of special importance are mechanisms that are common to many, if not most, disease categories. Knowledge of these mechanisms may provide the basis for the inhibition of pro-apoptotic pathways or the activation of endogenous anti-apoptotic signaling systems.</p><p>It is well known that the retina can induce self-protecting mechanisms that help photoreceptors survive toxic stress situations. The concept of preconditioning, for example, uses subtoxic stress levels to provoke an endogenous protective response. In the retina, preconditioning has been applied successfully to protect neuronal cells from ischemic damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] and light-induced degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Depending on the preconditioning protocol, the retina may use different mechanisms for this protection. Whereas ischemic and hypoxic preconditioning may involve heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), erythropoietin, and other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], preconditioning by light has been shown to involve activation of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>].</p><p>We have demonstrated that LIF, one of the main ligands for LIFR, is strongly upregulated in retinas exposed to excessive levels of white light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, we identified LIF to be the central molecule in a retinal response to a stress, which is induced by the expression of a mutant rhodopsin transgene in VPP mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], a model for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. In the VPP or light-stressed retina, LIF is produced by a subset of M&#x000fc;ller glia cells and is required to support survival of photoreceptors. Lack of LIF strongly accelerates disease progression in the VPP mouse leading to a fast loss of photoreceptor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Without LIF, an extensive endogenous signaling cascade culminating in the production of the growth and survival factor fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is not activated. Together with results obtained by the light-induced preconditioning paradigm, this suggests that LIF may orchestrate a common response to photoreceptor stress.</p><p>Here we tested whether LIF may also be required to reduce photoreceptor loss after extensive light exposure and whether the response to light stress involves molecular mechanisms similar to the signaling cascade identified in VPP mice. We show that the presence of LIF indeed reduced the severity of degeneration also in the light damage model and that this protection uses a similar signaling system as detected earlier in the inherited model of retinal degeneration. Thus, LIF-mediated survival signaling seems to be a general response used by the retina to counteract stress situations endangering survival of photoreceptors. Therapeutic stimulation of the LIF pathway may provide an attractive approach to prevent or delay photoreceptor degeneration in a broad range of degenerative diseases of the retina.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice and light exposure</title><p>Animals were treated in accordance with the regulations of the Veterinary Authority of Zurich and with the statement of &#x0201c;The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology&#x0201d; for the use of animals in research. <italic>Lif<sup>+/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice were a generous gift of Bettina Holtmann and Michael Sendtner (University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany).

Here we analyzed the consequences of the absence of LIF in light-exposed animals and show that fewer photoreceptor cells survive exposure in <italic>Lif<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice. Jak/STAT and EDN2 signaling, which is normally induced after light stress, is lacking in the absence of LIF. As a consequence, expression of the growth and survival factor FGF2 is not induced and survival of photoreceptors is less sustained than in wild-type retinas.</p><p>It was recently shown that intravitreal application of recombinant LIF (rLIF) protects photoreceptor cells against light-induced degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Similarly, preconditioning by light provided protection against light damage through activation of LIFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Together with our data showing that lack of LIF increases the vulnerability of photoreceptors to light damage, this provides strong evidence for a potent neuroprotective role of LIF with a high capacity to support survival of photoreceptor cells. It is of significance that LIF acts as a neuroprotective not only in the light damage paradigm but also in models of inherited retinal degeneration. Photoreceptors expressing a mutant rhodopsin gene degenerate much faster in the absence of LIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. This suggests that LIF controls a survival pathway that is generally induced upon a mild (light preconditioning) or strong (light damage, inherited degeneration) photoreceptor stress. Artificial interference with this pathway may provide a tool to protect photoreceptors and to prolong their survival in various disease pathologies. To do so, however, a detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in LIF signaling is required. Here we show that the absence of LIF prevents expression as well as activation of members of the Jak/STAT signaling system (JAK2, STAT3, STAT1, SOCS3) in response to light stress. LIF seems to be the only cytokine that can induce the Jak/STAT pathway in the retina. CLC, which also belongs to the IL-6 family of cytokines is induced in the light-damaged retina but obviously does not have the capacity to activate JAK2 and its downstream signaling molecules in the light-exposed retina. In contrast to LIF, which signals through a bipartite receptor consisting of LIFR and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>], CLC requires the formation of a tripartite receptor including LIFR, gp130, and ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. LIFR and gp130 are widely expressed in the retina including photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. CNTFR, however, does not seem to be expressed in rodent photoreceptor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] but has been found in ganglion cells and cells of the INL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Since we isolated RNA and proteins from total retina and thus included cells of the INL and GCL, which express all three components of the CLC receptor, the absence of JAK2, STAT1, and STAT3 phosphorylation in LIF knockouts is surprising. Unlike other cytokines, however, CLC was reported to require the soluble receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF-1) for the formation of an active complex to interact with the LIFR/gp130/CNTFR tripartite receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. It will therefore be of interest to analyze expression of CLF-1 in the physiologic and pathophysiological mouse retina to investigate the biologic significance of elevated CLC expression levels during light-induced retinal degeneration.</p><p>AKT has been associated with retinal neuroprotection in various situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. However, in our light damage paradigm, we did not detect a differential regulation of AKT phosphorylation after light exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Also, the absence of LIF did not influence the levels of p-AKT before or at 12 h after light offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, phosphorylation of ERK1,2 was not affected or not strongly affected by the absence of LIF. The role for ERK1,2 in light-induced retinal degeneration is not clear. We noticed that light exposure induces phosphorylation of ERK1,2 similarly in retinas of susceptible and protected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. This makes it unlikely that ERK1,2 is actively involved in the degenerative process. However, it is possible that ERK1,2 is part of a protective pathway, independent of LIF signaling. Such a pathway, however, would not be able to protect photoreceptors from their increased vulnerability in the absence of LIF.</p><p>A central factor of the molecular response to photoreceptor injury seems to be EDN2. EDN2 is expressed by photoreceptors in the injured retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. This expression, however, depends on LIF in a model of inherited retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>] as well as in the light damage model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, activation of EDN2 receptor (EDNRb), which is expressed on M&#x000fc;ller cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>] by a synthetic agonist, increases resistance of photoreceptors against light stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Recently, Ueki and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] demonstrated that injection of rLIF before light exposure is similarly protective. Since injection of rLIF induced expression of <italic>Edn2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], it is likely, that this rLIF-mediated protection also involves EDN2 signaling, although this was not tested directly. Preconditioning by a subtoxic stimulus can induce a molecular response protecting the retina against a subsequent stronger insult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Consequently, preconditioning by light was proven to be effective against light damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. The molecular response induced by light-preconditioning involves activation of LIF expression and signaling through LIFR and STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. This is additional strong evidence for a central role of the LIF signaling system in retinal injury and photoreceptor protection.</p><p>Another striking observation is the strongly reduced expression of GFAP in mouse retinas lacking LIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). The reduced GFAP levels are not due to reduced numbers of M&#x000fc;ller glia cells since <italic>Lif<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice have a similar spatial expression of glutamine synthase and comparable levels of cellular retinaldehyde binding protein (CRALBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. It has been reported, however, that development of astrocytes is impaired in brain tissue lacking LIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Since astrocytes enter the developing retina from the brain through migration along the optic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>], it may be that the reduced GFAP levels in <italic>Lif<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice are a consequence of a reduced number of GFAP expressing astrocytes. Astrocytes are mainly found in the ganglion cell layer and around retinal blood vessels, where they may participate in the formation of the blood retina barrier (BRB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Thus, studies of the development and distribution of astrocytes in the wild-type and the <italic>Lif<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mouse retina are warranted as well as investigations into the function of the BRB in these animals.</p><p>In summary, we show that lack of LIF signaling leads to increased photoreceptor death in the light-induced model (this work) and in a model of inherited retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. This suggests that the endogenous LIF system may be commonly activated in degenerating retinas, probably independently of the disease-causing stimulus. Targeting molecules of this signaling pathway by neuroprotective treatments may prove beneficial for the management of a large number of degenerative diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Coni Imsand, Hedwig Wariwoda, and Philipp Huber for excellent technical assistance and Bettina Holtmann and Michael Sendtner for providing Lif knockout mice.
