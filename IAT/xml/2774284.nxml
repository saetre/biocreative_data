The development of methods for the early detection and quantification of drug transport across the bacterial cell wall is a tool essential to understand and overcome this type of drug resistance mechanism. This approach was developed to study the transport of the efflux pump substrate ethidium bromide (EtBr) across the cell envelope of <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>K-12 and derivatives, differing in the expression of their efflux systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>EtBr transport across the cell envelope of <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 and derivatives was analysed by a semi-automated fluorometric method. Accumulation and efflux of EtBr was studied under limiting energy supply (absence of glucose and low temperature) and in the presence and absence of the efflux pump inhibitor, chlorpromazine. The bulk fluorescence variations were also observed by single-cell flow cytometry analysis, revealing that once inside the cells, leakage of EtBr does not occur and that efflux is mediated by active transport. The importance of AcrAB-TolC, the main efflux system of <italic>E. coli</italic>, in the extrusion of EtBr was evidenced by comparing strains with different levels of AcrAB expression. An experimental model was developed to describe the transport kinetics in the three strains. The model integrates passive entry (influx) and active efflux of EtBr, and discriminates different degrees of efflux between the studied strains that vary in the activity of their efflux systems, as evident from the calculated efflux rates: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1754-1611-3-18-i1.gif"/></inline-formula> = 0.0173 &#x000b1; 0.0057 min<sup>-1</sup>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1754-1611-3-18-i2.gif"/></inline-formula> = 0.0106 &#x000b1; 0.0033 min<sup>-1</sup>; and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1754-1611-3-18-i3.gif"/></inline-formula> = 0.0230 &#x000b1; 0.0075 min<sup>-1</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combined use of a semi-automated fluorometric method and an experimental model allowed quantifying EtBr transport in <italic>E. coli </italic>strains that differ in their overall efflux activity.

Active efflux of antibiotics by bacteria was first described in 1978 in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>resistant to tetracycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and, since then, it has been proven that the constitutive or inductive expression of these systems is responsible for the intrinsic and acquired resistance of many bacterial species to antimicrobials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Bacterial efflux pumps may be divided into five categories, according to their bioenergetics and structural characteristics: the <underline>A</underline>TP-<underline>B</underline>inding <underline>C</underline>assette (ABC) superfamily, the <underline>M</underline>ajor <underline>F</underline>acilitator <underline>S</underline>uperfamily (MFS), the <underline>R</underline>esistance <underline>N</underline>odulation cell <underline>D</underline>ivision (RND) family, the <underline>S</underline>mall <underline>M</underline>ultidrug <underline>R</underline>esistance (SMR) family and the <underline>M</underline>ultidrug <underline>A</underline>nd <underline>T</underline>oxic compound <underline>E</underline>xtrusion (MATE) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Efflux pumps may be specific for one substrate or recognize a wide range of structurally dissimilar and unrelated compounds, including several classes of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the most common commensal Gram-negative bacterium of the human gut, at least nine proton dependent efflux pumps responsible for multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotypes have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Among these, the tripartite AcrAB-TolC system is recognized as the most important multi-component efflux system and is composed of: (i) AcrB, an inner membrane protein that functions as the transporter component of the pump; (ii) TolC, the protein that traverses the cell envelope and provides a conduit to the exterior; and (iii) AcrA, two periplasmic embedded membrane proteins that anchor TolC to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The AcrAB-TolC system is responsible for the extrusion of substrates from the periplasm and/or the cytoplasm. The over-expression of this efflux system is a major cause of the MDR phenotype of clinical isolates, due to its ability to extrude several classes of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although AcrAB-TolC is considered the most important efflux system of <italic>E. coli</italic>, other tripartite efflux pumps, such as the AcrEF-TolC can extrude similar substrates albeit at lower efficiency levels. Moreover, these pumps can be over-expressed when AcrAB is deleted or inactivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Several methods have been used to detect and quantify the activity of bacterial efflux pump systems using radio-labeled, metal-labeled or fluorescent substrates to monitor their efflux in bacterial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Bulk measurement techniques that use fluorescence spectroscopy yield a general understanding that represents the balance between entry and extrusion of a given substrate, which may result from the efflux activities of one or several pumps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and where cell membrane permeability also plays an important role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Because the permeability to the substrate may be regulated by a decreased number of porins or by an increase of the lipopolysaccharide layer of the cell envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the demonstration of efflux activity invariably involves the use of an agent that promotes a significant increase of substrate accumulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Unless the demonstration of the role of a specific efflux pump is readily made, <italic>i.e</italic>. by the quantification of the expression level of a specific transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], or by the use of mutants whose specific efflux pump has been deleted or inactivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], very little can be said about the role that any efflux pump system may play in the MDR phenotype of bacteria.</p><p>Recently, a semi-automated fluorometric method has been developed by us for the assessment of efflux pump activity in bulk bacterial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The method uses the common efflux pump substrate ethidium bromide (EtBr) that has been shown to be a particularly suitable probe for these studies. In fact it emits weak fluorescence in aqueous solution (external to the cell) and becomes strongly fluorescent when its concentration within the periplasm exceeds that of the aqueous solution due to its binding to cellular components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Such binding must be of a weak type if the agent is to serve as a useful probe for efflux, since later intercalation into DNA results in strong binding that precludes any dissociation of the substrate for efflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This method can distinguish accumulation, which reflects the balance between influx and efflux, from efflux itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and, therefore, has the potential for the study of the kinetics of EtBr transport. The method was developed using the wild-type <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 AG100 as the bacterial model and the accumulation and efflux of EtBr was monitored by real-time fluorometry using the Rotor-Gene&#x02122; 3000 from Corbett Research (Sydney, Australia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The major innovation of this method is the simultaneous evaluation of efflux pump activity <italic>in vivo </italic>and on-line of a large number of samples, with the possibility to expose the same cell preparation to different environmental conditions in a single assay.</p><p>In the study to be described herein, this method has been used to define and parameterize a mechanistic experimental model that demonstrates the kinetics of EtBr influx and efflux by <italic>E. coli </italic>strains that differ in their capacity to extrude this molecule. The determination of the influx and efflux rates (<italic>k</italic><sup>+ </sup>and <italic>k</italic><sup>-</sup>, respectively) of a fluorescent substrate by the approach proposed allows the quantification of the cell overall efflux capacity. This information can be useful to interpret different phenotypes resulting from this efflux activity, including multidrug resistance in clinical bacterial strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacteria</title><p>The following bacteria were employed in this study: <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 AG100 wild-type strain (<italic>argE3 thi-l rpsL xyl mtl </italic>&#x00394;(<italic>gal-uvrB</italic>) <italic>supE44</italic>), containing a fully functional AcrAB-TolC efflux pump system; <italic>E. coli </italic>AG100A (&#x00394;<italic>acrAB</italic>::Tn<italic>903 </italic>Kan<sup>r</sup>) with the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump system inactivated due to the insertion of the transposon Tn<italic>903 </italic>in the <italic>acrAB </italic>operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; and <italic>E. coli </italic>AG100<sub>TET</sub>, a AG100 progeny strain, induced to high level of resistance to tetracycline (able to survive in 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of tetracycline, with an MIC of 12 &#x003bc;g/ml), as previously described, and over-expressing several efflux pumps, among which <italic>acrAB </italic>shows the highest expression level when exposed to high levels of tetracycline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 AG100 and AG100A have been previously characterized and were kindly offered by Hiroshi Nikaido (University of California, Berkeley, California, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

EtBr solutions were stored at 4&#x000b0;C and protected from light. Tetracycline stock solution was prepared in methanol, whereas kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, erythromycin and CPZ were prepared in distilled water and filtered with 0.22 &#x003bc;m syringe filters (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, USA).

Briefly, bacterial strains were incubated overnight in 5 ml of MH broth at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking at 220 rpm. Bacterial cultures were then diluted in PBS to a McFarland 0.5 turbidity standard. Aliquots of 0.05 ml were transferred to each well of the 96-well plate that contained 0.15 ml of each compound at concentrations prepared at 2-fold serial dilutions in MH broth medium. The plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C and the MIC results registered after 16-18 h. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of compound for which no growth was observed. In order to assure that the EPI did not compromise the cellular viability, the concentrations used in the following work did not exceed 1/2 of the MIC. The MIC for tetracycline was also calculated in the presence of CPZ at 1/2 of the MIC.</p></sec><sec><title>The semi-automated fluorometric method</title><p>The method was carried out using the real-time thermocycler Rotor-Gene&#x02122; 3000 (Corbett Research, Sidney, Australia) to monitor the accumulation and extrusion of EtBr on a real-time basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Briefly, the <italic>E. coli </italic>strains were grown in 10 ml of LB medium until they reached a mid-log phase, which corresponded to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.6. The bacteria were then centrifuged at 16,060 &#x000d7;<italic>g </italic>for 3 minutes, the pellet washed twice with the same volume of PBS and the OD<sub>600 </sub>of the cellular suspension adjusted to 0.3. Glucose was added to the cellular suspension to a final concentration of 0.4% (v/v) and aliquots of 0.095 ml were transferred to 0.2 ml microtubes.

The effect of CPZ in the accumulation of EtBr was determined under conditions that optimize efflux (presence of glucose and incubation at 37&#x000b0;C). CPZ was used at concentrations that did not exceed 1/2 the MIC and the fluorescence was measured over a period of 60 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>(ii) Efflux assay</title><p>The assessment of the efflux of EtBr was conducted as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Briefly, the <italic>E. coli </italic>strains were loaded with EtBr under conditions that favor accumulation (no glucose, 25&#x000b0;C and presence of CPZ). When the maximum level of EtBr accumulation was reached (approximately 60 minutes), the bacteria were centrifuged (16,060 &#x000d7;<italic>g </italic>for 3 minutes) and the medium was replaced by: i) PBS without glucose; ii) PBS containing glucose; and iii) PBS without glucose and with CPZ (control of minimum efflux). Aliquots of 0.1 ml were transferred to 0.2 ml microtubes and the assay was performed at 37&#x000b0;C with continuous measurement of fluorescence as described above. The efflux of EtBr is presented in terms of relative fluorescence, which is obtained from the comparison between the fluorescence observed for the bacteria in the presence or absence of glucose and the control in which the cells are exposed to conditions of minimum efflux (<italic>i.e</italic>., absence of glucose and presence of CPZ). Each experiment was conducted in triplicate and the results obtained did not vary.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Model to quantify EtBr efflux in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><sec><title>(i) Quantification of intracellular EtBr concentration</title><p>In order to assess the amount of EtBr extruded from the cells, one has to quantify the amount retained inside the cells. First, a calibration curve is determined that correlates the initial fluorescence of the buffer containing EtBr (FL<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding EtBr concentration (varying from 0 to 6 &#x003bc;g/ml): [EtBr]<sub><italic>intial </italic></sub>= 0.1201 &#x000d7; FL<sub>0 </sub>+ 0.0373(R = 0.99). Then, for each concentration tested, an EtBr accumulation assay was performed, as described above. To quantify the intracellular EtBr concentration, at the end of the accumulation assay, 0.6 ml of each EtBr containing buffer were separated from the cells by centrifugation at 16,060 &#x000d7;<italic>g </italic>for 10 minutes and the supernatant filtered with 0.22 &#x003bc;m syringe filters from Millipore Corporation (Bedford, USA). The fluorescence of the cell free buffer was measured in the Rotor-Gene&#x02122; 3000 (FL(PBS+EtBr)<sub>filt non corrected</sub>).</p><p>Since some EtBr is retained by the filter itself, a correction factor must be used to account for this difference. Thus, the corrected fluorescence of the filtered buffer corresponds to (FL(PBS+EtBr)<sub>filt corrected</sub>). = 1.2289 &#x000d7; (FL(PBS+EtBr)<sub>filt non corrected</sub>). + 0.7032 (R = 0.99). The difference between the initial fluorescence of the EtBr containing buffer (FL<sub>o</sub>) and (FL(PBS+EtBr)<sub>filt corrected </sub>gives the fluorescence corresponding to the intracellular EtBr concentration. However, the fluorescence data from the transport assays measured experimentally still contains a component from the EtBr that remains in solution. Thus, each value of the experimental accumulation curve can then be corrected by subtracting the background corresponding to the fluorescence of the initial EtBr concentration, originating FL<sub>int exp corr</sub>. By plotting the previously determined EtBr intracellular concentration for the final value of FL<sub>int exp corr</sub>, for each initial EtBr concentration tested, a new relation is achieved: [EtBr]<sub>int </sub>= 0.022 &#x000d7; FL<sub>int exp corr</sub>+ 0.06 (R = 0.99), which allows the conversion of the experimental fluorescence data over time into intracellular EtBr concentration over time. The correlations shown here were determined for the wild-type <italic>E. coli </italic>K-12 AG100.

The semi-automated fluorometric method affords the <italic>in vivo </italic>and on-line evaluation of the efflux pump activity by real-time fluorometry using the Rotor-Gene&#x02122; 3000, and represents an innovative technique when compared to other technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Based upon the differences of fluorescence that reflect differences on the EtBr concentrations outside and inside the cells, the technique provides a powerful tool for the real-time monitoring of efflux kinetics in bacterial cells. Moreover, it has potential for the identification of new efflux pump substrates, as well as new bacterial EPIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A more fundamental application is the extension of this methodology to understand the transport kinetics of EtBr or other fluorescent substrates in bacterial cells.</p><p>We used such approach to differentiate and quantify EtBr transport in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and an experimental model was developed which parameterizes passive entry (influx) and active efflux of EtBr. The methodology developed allowed to detect differences in the EtBr efflux activity among strains that differ in their efflux pump expression, highlighting the importance of these systems in the extrusion from the cell of toxic compounds such as EtBr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Although the experimental model presented was designed based upon a set of three canonic, isogenic strains, as a way to assess the method's sensitivity to differentiate their singular efflux activities, it can be applied to other <italic>E. coli </italic>strains or bacteria, since it is based on the overall transport of EtBr across the bacterial cell wall, which is common among bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It should be stressed however that it allows measuring the overall efflux activity rather than efflux related to a specific pump. For evaluation of the role played by a pump, a mutant specific for that pump must be used. The determination of influx and efflux rates for each of the strains to be analyzed opens new insights and opportunities for exploration of cell wall permeability, as well as for the control of the efflux activity in bacterial cells, representing a quantitative method to determine efflux activity. This approach may be used to elaborate a standardized data base for different reference strains relative to efflux activity (efflux rates), providing the means by which one can evaluate the resistance due to efflux pump activity in standardized conditions between laboratories. It represents a particularly suitable procedure for the assessment of efflux pump activity in MDR clinical isolates and screening for potential inhibitors of such activity. Such approaches may contribute to a better understanding of the bacterial efflux systems as a resistance mechanism and to design new therapeutic strategies against MDR bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LP and LR carried out the experimental work related to accumulation and efflux assays and MIC determination.
