Among the most interesting of these proteins is the 30-kDa-subunit of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor, or CPSF30. In this study, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CPSF30 ortholog, AtCPSF30, is characterized. This protein possesses an unexpected endonucleolytic activity that is apparent as an ability to nick and degrade linear as well as circular single-stranded RNA. Endonucleolytic action by AtCPSF30 leaves RNA 3&#x02032; ends with hydroxyl groups, as they can be labeled by RNA ligase with [<sup>32</sup>P]-cytidine-3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-bisphosphate. Mutations in the first of the three CCCH zinc finger motifs of the protein abolish RNA binding by AtCPSF30 but have no discernible effects on nuclease activity. In contrast, mutations in the third zinc finger motif eliminate the nuclease activity of the protein, and have a modest effect on RNA binding. The N-terminal domain of another <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> polyadenylation factor subunit, AtFip1(V), dramatically inhibits the nuclease activity of AtCPSF30 but has a slight negative effect on the RNA-binding activity of the protein. These results indicate that AtCPSF30 is a probable processing endonuclease, and that its action is coordinated through its interaction with Fip1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Messenger RNA 3&#x02032; end formation is an essential step in the biogenesis of mRNAs in eukaryotic cells. This step consists of a series of events that culminate in the addition of a finite tract of poly(A) to the 3&#x02032;-end of a processed pre-mRNA. These events are mediated by a complex of multi-subunit factors, the composition of which is generally conserved in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). This complex recognizes specific sequence elements in a pre-mRNA, processes the RNA and adds the poly(A) tract. In animals, the canonical poly(A) signal AAUAAA is recognized by the 160-kDa subunit of cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF; the 160-kDa subunit is termed CPSF160), the U + G-rich downstream sequence element is bound by CstF64, the 64-kDa subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF) and other auxiliary elements situated 5&#x02032; to (or upstream of) the polyadenylation site are recognized by CFI<sub>m</sub>25, the 25-kDa subunit of cleavage factor I (CFI<sub>m</sub>). Two other subunits of the complex, hFip1 and CPSF30, also bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), but the roles of these activities in the process remain poorly defined. These RNA&#x02013;protein interactions, as well as a number of protein&#x02013;protein interactions between other subunits of the subcomplexes, serve to coalesce the complex and position the RNA for cleavage and polyadenylation. Two different subunits of CPSF, namely CPSF73 and CPSF30, have been suggested as the endonuclease responsible for the cleavage of the mRNA at the polyadenylation site subsequent to polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>). Subsequent to RNA processing, poly(A) polymerase (or PAP) is brought to the RNA, presumably through its interaction with animal orthologs of Fip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), so as to add the polyadenylated tract. This final step in the reaction is modulated by a nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PabN) that serves to promote processive poly(A) addition and to regulate the final length of poly(A) that is added to the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, mRNA 3&#x02032; end formation is directed by a tripartite polyadenylation signal, the elements of which have been termed as the efficiency element, positioning element and polyadenylation site, respectively. The RNA-binding subunits Hrp1, Rna15 and Yth1 associate with these elements; Hrp1 binding to the efficiency element, Rna15 to the positioning element and Yth1 to the polyadenylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). Hrp1 and Rna15 are subunits of the so-called cleavage factor I (CFI<sub>y</sub>, the subscript &#x02018;y&#x02019; serving to distinguish this factor from the mammalian CFI<sub>m</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) while Yth1 is a subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Rna15 and Yth1 are orthologs of CstF64 and CPSF30, respectively, while Hrp1 has no strict counterpart in the animal polyadenylation complex. Presumably as is the case in animals, these RNA&#x02013;protein interactions that involve different multi-subunit factors serve to promote the assembly of the complete complex on a pre-mRNA, as well as to position the pre-mRNA for processing and subsequent polyadenylation. The nature of the processing endonuclease in yeast has not been explored, but both of the animal proteins (CPSF73 and CPSF30) that have been associated with suggestive nuclease activities have yeast counterparts&#x02014;Ysh1 is the ortholog of CPSF73, and Yth1 is the counterpart of CPSF30. As in animals, PAP is tethered to the processed RNA through its interaction with Fip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). While yeast has no formal counterpart of PabN, two other PabNs, Nab2 and Pab1, contribute to poly(A) length control in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>).</p><p>Plant genomes possess genes with the potential to encode virtually the complete set of polyadenylation factor subunits that are found in animals and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Moreover, as is the case in animals and yeast, the plant polyadenylation signal consists of several distinct <italic>cis</italic> elements&#x02014;in plants, the so-called Near-Upstream Element, Far-Upstream Element and Cleavage Element, or NUE, FUE and CE, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>). The plant polyadenylation complex has not been as extensively studied as its animal and yeast counterparts. However, recent studies have established that several of the plant counterparts of CPSF subunits (specifically, CPSF160, CPSF100 and symplekin) reside in a nuclear complex that also includes the ortholog of the yeast polyadenylation factor subunit Pfs2 (the plant protein has been termed FY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and most of the plant subunits may be linked conceptually with PAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Eukaryotic CPSF30 proteins are among the most interesting of the subunits of the polyadenylation complex. As stated in the preceding paragraph, the yeast ortholog (Yth1) associates with the cleavage/polyadenylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog possesses nucleolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), leading some to propose that CPSF30 is a processing endonuclease in the polyadenylation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In animal cells, CPSF30 has been shown to be the focus of regulatory events in virus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The animal and yeast proteins share an array of five tandemly arranged CCCH-type zinc finger motifs (typically, Cys-X<sub>8</sub>-Cys-X<sub>5</sub>-Cys-X<sub>3</sub>-His) that have been implicated in RNA binding by these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), in nucleolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and in interactions with other polyadenylation factor subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Moreover, animal proteins have additional zinc knuckle motifs that are absent from Yth1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and the zinc knuckle motif of the bovine protein enhances the RNA-binding activity of the core zinc finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>Among the set of plant genes that encode polyadenylation factor subunits are those that encode orthologs of CPSF30/Yth1. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene (as well as its counterparts in other plants; unpublished data) encodes two mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>); the smaller of the two (termed herein as AtCPSF30) specifies a <italic>ca</italic>. 250-amino acid polypeptide that is analogous to CPSF30/Yth1, whereas the larger is translated to yield a polypeptide in which all but the C-terminal 13 amino acids of AtCPSF30 are fused to a protein domain found in mammalian splicing associated factors [the so-called YT521B motif; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>)]. Both polypeptides can be detected in nuclear extracts, and the smaller resides in a nuclear complex with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ortholog of CPSF100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). AtCPSF30 also interacts with an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ortholog of Fip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), placing it in a network of interactions that includes PAP (among other polyadenylation factor subunits). Like its other eukaryotic counterparts, AtCPSF30 is an RNA-binding protein; interestingly, the RNA-binding activity of AtCPSF30 is inhibited by calmodulin in a calcium-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), suggestive of a regulatory link between signaling and RNA processing in plants.</p><p>In our ongoing studies of AtCPSF30, it was noticed that a persistent nuclease activity co-purified with the recombinant protein, an activity that confounded attempts to define RNA-binding sites on substrate molecules. In this report, the properties of this nuclease activity are described. Specifically, we show that AtCPSF30 is itself an endonuclease, that the RNA products of endonucleolytic cleavage possess 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl groups, and that an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Fip1 ortholog inhibits the AtCPSF30-associated nuclease activity. Together with other studies, these results suggest that AtCPSF30 is a processing endonuclease, and that the pre-mRNA cleavage step in plants is mediated by more than one protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>The purification of MBP-AtCPSF30, m4 and m9 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) has been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).

The results of mutagenesis were confirmed by DNA sequencing; accordingly, the C-terminus of the first zinc finger was changed from DACGFLHQF to DASTFLYQ, the second zinc finger from QDCVYKHTN to QDSTYKYTN and the third from PDCRYRHAK to PDSTYRYAK. The oligonucleotide primers that were used for the mutagenesis are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Attempts to explore the RNA-binding properties of AtCPSF30 by mapping possible sites of binding on labeled RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) were not successful owing to persistent nuclease activity that was insensitive to commercially available ribonuclease inhibitors (data not shown). Extensive and exhaustive purification, as well as characterizations of equally pure preparations of MBP (the tag used to purify recombinant AtCPSF30), led to the realization that AtCPSF30 itself was the source of this activity. In light of reports ascribing similar activities to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart of CPSF30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), the nuclease activity of AtCPSF30 was characterized in some detail. For these studies, an RNA containing a complete suite of polyadenylaton-associated <italic>cis</italic> elements was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). This RNA is derived from the pea <italic>rbcS</italic>-E9 gene and includes the well-defined FUE)and NUEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) from this gene, and was chosen so as to best recapitulate the complex nature of plant polyadenylation signals. Initial studies using uniformly labeled RNA revealed an activity that yielded numerous breakdown intermediates at early times in a typical time-course study, and an eventual loss of all detectable poly- nucleotides or oligonucleotides after extended times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Nuclease activity was dependent on enzyme concentration, and was not seen when comparable quantities of purified MBP were used in place of the MBP-AtCPSF30 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>The transient accumulation of RNA breakdown intermediates in the time-course studies suggested that AtCPSF30 might possess endonuclease activity; such intermediates were also observed with RNAs end-labeled at either their 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; ends (data not shown). To further test this, assays were conducted using circular RNAs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, such RNAs were also susceptible to the nuclease activity of AtCPSF30. Moreover, the kinetics of breakdown of the circular RNAs were similar to those seen with the linear RNA. These results indicate that AtCPSF30 can act as an endonuclease.</p><p>One possible function for the endonuclease activity of AtCPSF30 is the processing of the pre-mRNA as a prelude to the polyadenylation. Such a function would require that the nuclease action leaves a 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl group at the end of the RNA; alternative modes of nuclease action, in contrast, might leave 3&#x02032;-phosphates or 2&#x02032;-3&#x02032; cyclic phosphates. To examine this, the products of AtCPSF30 endonucleolytic action were end-labeled with RNA ligase + [<sup>32</sup>P] cytidine 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-bisphosphate ([<sup>32</sup>P]-pCp); such a treatment is expected to label RNAs bearing 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl groups, but not 3&#x02032;- or 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (lane 1), the end-labeling treatment of the input (unlabeled) RNA yielded a single discrete species. Pre-treatment of the input RNA with 3&#x02032;-dATP + PAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lane 2) eliminated this labeling, indicating a requirement for a free 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl for the labeling with [<sup>32</sup>P]-pCp. Subsequent treatment of the 3&#x02032;-blocked input RNA with AtCPSF30 yielded an array of breakdown products that were readily labeled with ([<sup>32</sup>P]-pCp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lane 3). This result indicates that the nuclease action of AtCPSF30 yields 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl groups. It should be noted that the RNAs labeled by [<sup>32</sup>P]-pCp in lane 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> do not correspond in size to those expected if cleavage was occurring at the three &#x02018;natural&#x02019; polyadenylation sites in the substrate RNA (the latter would be expected to yield 5&#x02032; cleavage products of 125, 145 and 175&#x02009;nt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).

Such preferences may be related to one or more of the polyadenylation-related motifs&#x02014;FUE, NUE or CE&#x02014;present in the RNA. To explore this possibility, the action of AtCPSF30 on a battery of other RNA substrates was explored. These RNAs consisted of smaller parts of the E9 polyadenylation signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). One of these (&#x02018;&#x00394;FUE&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) had a deletion in its FUE region. Another (&#x02018;PC&#x02019;) retained the FUE and two of the NUEs, and ended at the middle of the three sites in this 3&#x02032;-UTR (this site is the predominant site utilized <italic>in vivo</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>); this RNA is thus analogous to a pre-cleaved RNA. A third (&#x02018;&#x00394;NUE&#x02019;) had a deletion extending from 60&#x02009;nt upstream to 40&#x02009;nt downstream from the middle poly(A) site; this deletion removes all of the NUEs and cleavage sites contained in this signal, but retains the FUE. A fourth (DE) extended from the middle polyadenylation site to 80&#x02009;nt downstream from this site. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, all of these RNAs could serve as substrates for AtCPSF30 in the nuclease assay. Moreover, no dramatic differences could be seen in the rates with which these RNAs were degraded. An RNA (labeled &#x02018;GFP&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) with no known polyadenylation-related elements was degraded with similar kinetics. The results indicate that AtCPSF30 does not have an obvious preference for polyadenylation-related signals for its nucleolytic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of AtCPSF30 domains involved in nuclease activity and RNA binding</title><p>AtCPSF30 consists of a number of domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>); these include a central region of three CCCH-type zinc finger motifs that are conserved to some extent in all eukaryotic CPSF30 proteins, an N-terminal region with a highly-conserved, plant-specific region enriched in acidic amino acids and a plant-specific C-terminal region. To study the possible contributions of these various domains to the nuclease activities of AtCPSF30, a number of mutant forms of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) were prepared and assayed. These includes derivatives lacking either the N-terminal or C-terminal plant-specific domains (m4 and m9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and point mutants in which the last five amino acids of each zinc finger motif (CxxxH) were replaced with the motif STxxY; this replacement eliminates two of the four putative zinc-coordinating amino acid side chains in the motif. As was noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), purified preparations of the full-sized MBP-AtCPSF30 consisted of two polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B); the smaller of these (noted with an * in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B) is a breakdown product whose C-terminus lies near that of the m4 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, the &#x02018;m4&#x02019; lane on the right of the panel). These variants were assayed for nuclease activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, the m9 and ZF1 mutants displayed activities that were similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The m4 and ZF2 mutants both had activity, but less than that seen with the wild-type enzyme (this is apparent as still-detectable precursor RNA after the 30-min incubation). The ZF3 mutant showed little or no detectable activity under these conditions. These results indicate that several parts of the protein are needed for full activity, but point to the third zinc finger as being most important. Importantly, the effects of the point mutations, and especially the ZF3 mutant, indicate that the nuclease activity under study is a property of the AtCPSF30 polypeptide (as opposed to a co-purifying bacterial contaminant that the stringent washes and ion exchange purification protocols did not separate).</p><p>One possible explanation for the absence of nuclease activity with the ZF3 mutant is that it no longer binds RNA as does the wild-type protein. This hypothesis was tested using a gel-shift assay and the <italic>rbcS</italic>-E9 RNA depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, the ZF2 mutant had an RNA-binding activity that was similar to the wild type. The ZF3 mutant was also able to bind RNA, albeit at a somewhat reduced level. The ZF1 mutant displayed no ability to bind RNA. These results indicate that ZF1, which is dispensable for nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) is primarily responsible for the RNA-binding activity of AtCPSF30. Ablation of ZF3 partially reduces RNA binding but completely eliminates the nuclease activity. Interestingly, alteration of ZF2 had no effect on RNA binding. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>RNA binding by the zinc finger mutants.

In contrast to this, the GST-Fip137 protein had little apparent effect on RNA binding by AtCPSF30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Thus, RNA binding by AtCPSF30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C, lane 1) was still apparent in the presence of added GST-Fip137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C, lane 2) or GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C, lane 3). A slight reduction in binding in the presence of GST-Fip137 was apparent; this is consistent with the reduced RNA binding of the ZF3 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the extent of diminution of RNA binding by GST-Fip137 was far less than the inhibition of nuclease activity seen with the same preparation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>AtCPSF30 as a processing endonuclease</title><p>The nature of the events associated with processing of the pre-mRNA remains somewhat unclear. Bai and Tolias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) reported that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CPSF30 ortholog, the so-called clipper protein, possesses an inherent nuclease activity. Based on this observation, it was suggested that CPSF30 is the processing endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Such a suggestion would seem to be consistent with the observation that Yth1 associates with the processing site <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, others have suggested that CPSF73 is the processing endonuclease. These arguments are based on a number of observations: the AAUAAA-dependent crosslinking of CPSF73 to the cleavage site, the similarity of CPSF73 to Zn-dependent hydrolytic enzymes related to metallo-beta-lactamases, the requirement of amino acids residues in CPSF73 that are required for hydrolytic function in metal-beta-lactamases and the observation that recombinant CPSF73 possesses endonucleolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Based on the results presented in this study, AtCPSF30 would seem to be an excellent candidate for an endonuclease involved in processing pre-mRNAs prior to polyadenylation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. It possesses a distinctive endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and leaves a 3&#x02032;-terminus that is suitable for subsequent poly(A) tail addition by PAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Poly(A) site choice <italic>in vivo</italic> is altered in a mutant deficient in AtCPSF30 (Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., submitted for publication), indicating that normal poly(A) site selection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> requires the presence of AtCPSF30. However, if AtCPSF30 is in fact a processing endonuclease, it cannot be the only one active in plants. This follows from the realization that this protein is not essential for plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), and that plants deficient in this protein produce bulk poly(A) that is indistinguishable in length and quantity from wild-type plants (Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., submitted for publication). Wickens and Gonzalez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) have speculated that the cleavage step in polyadenylation may be performed by any of a multiplicity of processing endonucleases, and has likened the 3&#x02032;-processing machinery to the &#x02018;package&#x02019; of nucleases that comprise the exosome. It may be that such a situation is in fact in force in plants, and that AtCPSF30 and AtCPSF73 are both processing endonucleases.</p><p>Another possibility merits mention. While the obvious role for an endonuclease in the polyadenylation reaction is the generation of the 3&#x02032; end for PAP, alternative functions for such an activity may exist as well. CPSF has been implicated in small RNA 3&#x02032; end maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), 3&#x02032; end formation of cell cycle-regulated histone mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and cytoplasmic polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). While specific roles for CPSF30 in these processes have not been reported, it is nevertheless possible that the endonuclease activity documented here may reflect roles for AtCPSF30 in these, or other as yet unidentified, activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications of the structure&#x02013;function map of AtCPSF30 for mRNA 3&#x02032; end formation in plants</title><p>The part of AtCPSF30 that is associated with endonucleolytic activity (the third zinc finger) is present in all eukaryotic CPSF30 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). The corresponding zinc finger motif in Yth1 is required for RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Moreover, with AtCPSF30 and Yth1, this motif is needed for interactions with Fip1 proteins, and interactions with Fip1 inhibit the associated RNA-related activities (nuclease, in the case of AtCPSF30, and RNA binding, in the case of Yth1) of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Tacahashi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) have proposed that this interplay between Fip1 and Yth1 may reflect a progression through the polyadenylation reaction, with Fip1 displacing Yth1 from the pre-mRNA after the processing step, thereby bringing PAP to the 3&#x02032; end left by processing. The characteristics of AtCPSF30 do not lend themselves easily to an analogous model. In particular, the zinc finger motifs of AtCPSF30 implicated in RNA binding and nucleolytic activity are different, and AtFip1 interacts only with the motif involved in nuclease action. Moreover, AtFip1 inhibits the nuclease activity of AtCPSF30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) but has a much more modest effect on RNA binding by AtCPSF30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Therefore, it seems unlikely that AtFip1 would displace AtCPSF30 from a processed pre-mRNA. One plausible alternative to this is a scenario where AtCPSF30 is initially associated with AtFip1, such that the endonuclease activity of AtCPSF30 is repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). The endonuclease would become activated with the dissociation of AtFip1(V), perhaps as a consequence of binding of other subunits to AtFip1(V). Along these lines, it is of interest to recall the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PAP isoforms bind to the same 137 amino acid portion of AtFip1(V) that inhibits the nuclease activity of AtCPSF30 (24; B. Addepalli and A. G. Hunt, unpublished data). This remodeling around AtFip1(V) would lead to subsequent processing and polyadenylation. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Models for the structure and function of AtCPSF30. (<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the domain organization of AtCPSF30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), showing the correspondence with orthologs from mammals, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).

Symbols are as indicated beneath the representations of the proteins. (<bold>B</bold>) Model for the action of CPSF30 in the course of pre-mRNA 3&#x02032; end processing in plants. Initially, AtCPSF30 is associated with AtFip1(V); in this complex nuclease activity is repressed, the complex may bind RNA via the AtFip1(V) and AtCPSF30 RNA-binding sites. PAP may displace AtCPSF30 from AtFip1(V) as shown in the middle panel; this would activate the endonucleolytic activity of AtCPSF30 (thick black arrow). Subsequent to this processing, PAP would polyadenylate the processed RNA as shown in the bottom panel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm457f8"/></fig></p><p>More generally, the mutational analysis of AtCPSF30 presented in this study reveals a protein of interesting and subtle complexity. Two RNA-associated activities of the protein, binding and endonucleolytic activity, are associated with different zinc finger motifs. The third motif and its evolutionarily conserved association with AtFip1 is mentioned above. The first zinc finger motif is the most highly conserved of the motifs when compared with other eukaryotic CPSF30 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and is needed for RNA binding by AtCPSF30. The corresponding motif in the bovine and yeast counterparts is also needed for RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Interestingly, the corresponding motif in Yth1 is needed for the functioning of this protein in the cleavage step of polyadenylation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>); this is consistent with the model proposed in the preceding paragraph, in which positioning prior to cleavage by the nuclease domain is accomplished by the RNA-binding domain of AtCPSF30.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (and likely other plants), CPSF30 is encoded by a complex gene whose transcripts are alternatively processed to yield two mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The smaller of these encodes AtCPSF30, whereas the larger specifies a polypeptide that consists of virtually the entire CSPF30 sequence fused to another domain (the so-called YT521B domain) that is found in splicing-associated proteins in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins that are associated with so-called calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinases [CIPKs; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>)]. The function of the larger polypeptide is not known, but the present study suggests that it should possess endonuclease activity. The possible roles that the larger polypeptide might play in gene expression are not clear, but the conceptual linkages between mRNA 3&#x02032; end formation and both calcium-mediated signaling and pre-mRNA splicing are intriguing.</p><p>To summarize, the results presented here constitute strong evidence that AtCPSF30 is a processing endonuclease in the polyadenylation reaction in plants. In addition, they suggest that this function is regulated by AtFip1(V), thereby suggesting an ordered series of events that occurs during the process of mRNA 3&#x02032; end formation in plants. With other studies, these data suggest that there is more than one 3&#x02032;-end processing endonuclease, and possibly an unexpected redundancy in this function, in plants.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors are grateful to Carol Von Lanken for technical assistance and to Kim Delaney and Dr Kevin Forbes for some materials used in this study.
