The severity of disease ranged from disabling muscle weakness to a subclinical phenotype. Neurologic exams of nine patients and nerve conduction studies (NCS) and myography in five endorsed the variable presentations of HMN in this family, including patients with only lower (four), upper (one), or both upper and lower extremities involvement (four). Asymmetrical or strictly unilateral disease was noted in three patients. Three also showed pyramidal features. A genome-wide search combining SNP arrays (250K) with parametric linkage analysis identified a novel locus on chromosome 16p (mLOD&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.28) spanning 6&#x000a0;Mb (rs6500882&#x02013;rs7192086). Direct sequencing excluded mutations in the <italic>SIMPLE/LITAF</italic> gene (mapping to the 16p locus) and identified a pathogenic mutation (p.N88S) in <italic>BCLS2</italic> (11q12&#x02013;q14). All 12 affected relatives had the <italic>BSCL2</italic> mutation and the chromosome 16p haplotype and showed features of motor neuron degeneration. One patient had a very mild phenotype with bilateral pes cavus, normal concentric needle electromyography but signs of motor neuron involvement at electrophysiological muscle scan (EMS). Similar EMS abnormalities in addition to abnormal NCS and myography were observed in a clinically unaffected person (carrying only the 16p haplotype). These results expand the clinical spectrum of HMN and suggest a digenic inheritance of HMN in this family with a <italic>BSCL2</italic> mutation and a chromosome 16 locus likely contributing to the phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Distal hereditary motor neuronography</kwd><kwd>Genome-wide scan</kwd><kwd>Novel locus</kwd><kwd>Electrophysiological muscle scan</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2009</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Distal hereditary motor neuronopathy (HMN) is defined by progressive muscle wasting and weakness without clinical, electrophysiological, or morphological sensory involvement due to anterior horn cell degeneration and is also referred to as the spinal subtype of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) or Charcot&#x02013;Marie&#x02013;Tooth disease (CMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to clinical findings, age at onset, and mode of inheritance, seven subtypes of HMN have been defined (HMN I&#x02013;VII) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A genetic classification of HMN is gradually evolving with the identification of eight genes and 14 loci, associated with distal HMN (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Several of these genes are also associated with HMSN subtypes, hereditary motor neuron diseases, and hereditary spastic paraplegias, indicating an overlapping clinical spectrum. For instance, mutations within the N-glycosylation site of <italic>BSCL2</italic> (<italic>Bernardinelli&#x02013;Seip congenital lipodystrophy</italic>) gene are believed to cause a gain of function with accumulation of unfolded protein in the endoplasmatic reticulum leading to aggregate formation and neurodegeneration. These mutations are associated with HMN as well as Silver syndrome, an autosomal dominant spastic paraparesis with marked atrophy of the hand muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The <italic>senataxin</italic> gene (<italic>SETX</italic>), primary associated with autosomal dominant juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS4) and spastic paraplegia without neuropathy (SPG19), has now also been associated with distal HMN with pyramidal features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Nonsense mutations in s<italic>enataxin</italic> cause ataxia-oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2), a neurodegenerative disorder with cerebellar ataxia and severe axonal neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, mutations in genes encoding <italic>small heath shock protein</italic> (<italic>HSP1</italic>, <italic>HSP8</italic>) were reported in HMN type 2 as well as in two axonal HMSN subtypes, CMT2F and CMT2L. HMN type V and CMT2D, both predominantly involving the hands, appeared to be allelic disorders, with mutations in the <italic>glycil tRNA synthetase</italic> (<italic>GARS</italic>) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. <table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Classification of distal hereditary motor neuronopathy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>HMN subtype (alias)</th><th>Locus</th><th>Gene</th><th>Inheritance</th><th>Clinical hallmarks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>I</td><td>Unknown</td><td>Unknown</td><td>AD</td><td>Juvenile onset</td></tr><tr><td>II (CMT2L)</td><td>12q24.3</td><td>HSP22</td><td>AD</td><td>(Early)-adult onset</td></tr><tr><td>(CMT2F)</td><td>11q11-q21</td><td><italic>HSP27</italic></td><td>AD</td><td>(Early)-adult onset</td></tr><tr><td>III</td><td>11q13</td><td>Unknown</td><td>AR</td><td>Early-adult onset, slowly progressive</td></tr><tr><td>IV</td><td>11q13</td><td>Unknown</td><td>AR</td><td>Juvenile onset, severe course, paralysis diaphragm</td></tr><tr><td>V (CMT2D)</td><td>7p15</td><td>GARS</td><td>AD</td><td>Upper limb predominance, pyramidal features may occur</td></tr><tr><td>(Silver syndrome)</td><td>11q12&#x02013;q14</td><td><italic>BSCL2</italic></td><td>AD</td><td>Prominent atrophy of hands, spasticity of lower limbs</td></tr><tr><td>VI (SMARD1)</td><td>11q13.2&#x02013;13.4</td><td><italic>IGHMBP2</italic></td><td>AR</td><td>Infantile onset, severe course, involvement diaphragm (SMA-<italic>RD</italic>: <italic>respiratory distress</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td>VII</td><td>2q14</td><td>Unknown</td><td>AD</td><td>Adult onset, vocal cord paralysis</td></tr><tr><td>VII</td><td>2p13</td><td>DCTN1</td><td>AD</td><td>Adult onset, vocal cord paralysis, facial weakness</td></tr><tr><td>n.a.

Two individuals, who were reported to be affected (II:3, III:8) could not be examined; however, we were able to obtain medical records confirming the diagnosis. DNA samples of these two patients as well as a sample from stored DNA of a deceased relative who was also reported to be affected (II:1) were obtained. Three asymptomatic relatives did not have HMN features upon neurologic examination. In three clinically affected (II:5, II:7, and III:1) and one clinically unaffected relative (II:9), nerve conduction studies (NCS) and concentric needle myography were performed, including an electrophysiological muscle scan (EMS) in II:5 and II:9. An EMS is a detailed stimulus intensity&#x02014;compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude response curve&#x02014;representing the contribution of individual motor units (MUs) to the CMAP. This test was recently developed in our clinic and can detect large MUs due to chronic reinnervation, which might be missed in concentric needle examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

There was mild weakness of ankle dorsiflexors, without atrophy or pes cavus. Hyperreflexia of the legs with bilateral Babinski&#x02019;s signs were present.

These two patients lacked pyramidal signs. IV:1 also displayed mild weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors. NCS in IV:1 at age 14 showed reduced to absent CMAP amplitudes in upper and lower extremities. Myography of <italic>tibialis</italic> and first <italic>interosseus dorsalis</italic> muscles showed giant MU potentials (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

When multipoint linkage analyses were performed, several genomic regions displayed LOD scores above 2 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The highest LOD scores (2.7) were observed on chromosome 16 and 17.

One of them, the <italic>LITAF/SIMPLE</italic> gene, associated with CMT1C, was an obvious candidate for further analysis. Direct sequencing of the four exons plus part of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTR of the gene displayed only two DNA variants in the coding region of the gene Ile92Val (rs4280262), a known polymorphism and a novel silent change (p.Asn110Asn). Both variants were not co-segregating with the phenotype in this family and therefore are likely not pathogenic.</p><p>We then investigated whether copy number variants within <italic>LITAF/SIMPLE</italic> could have a role in causing the HMN phenotype. We performed quantitative real-time PCR on genomic DNA from four patients (III:1, III:3, III:4, and IV:1) and compared them to unaffected family members and controls. No evidence for deletions or duplication was found along the coding region of <italic>LITAF</italic>. Quantitative real-time PCR performed on cDNA detected upregulation (3-fold increase) in <italic>LITAF</italic> levels in two patients (III:1 and III:4) and in one unaffected (III:2) family member, while two other patients (III:6 and IV:3) and two asymptomatic relatives (II:9 and II:10) had normal levels. These results showed that changes in <italic>LITAF</italic> expression do not influence disease in this family.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p>We described an extensive family with autosomal dominant distal HMN showing a wide range in the severity and localization of neuromuscular symptoms. In nine examined patients, distribution of muscle weakness and atrophy included involvement of predominantly the feet (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), the hands (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), or both upper and lower extremities (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), often with split-hand type atrophy. Co-occurrence of pyramidal features was observed in three patients. In two patients, muscle involvement was asymmetric, and in one, strictly unilateral muscle weakness and atrophy was observed. Severity of the disease ranged from adolescent patients with disabling muscle weakness to an elderly patient with only mild weakness of the ankle dorsiflexors and bilateral pes cavus (II:5) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The asymmetrical involvement of muscle weakness, the pyramidal signs, and the absence of sensory deficits indicate spinal anterior horn cells involvement, as was supported by electrophysiology showing signs of chronic motor axonal injury with normal sensory conduction. <fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Pes cavus in individual II:5</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10048_2009_193_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>The recently introduced and promising technique of the EMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] showed signs of chronic motor neuron involvement in the upper extremities in one patient (II:5) with a relatively mild phenotype, whereas motor NCS studies and myography were normal in this patient. The EMS may therefore be considered as a sensitive technique to detect subtle or even subclinical motor neuron dysfunction. This should be confirmed with further NCS and EMS studies in affected and healthy relatives.</p><p>In this family, one of the two reported mutations in exon 3 of the <italic>BSCL2/Seipin</italic> gene associated with HMN and Silver syndrome was identified in all 12 clinically affected individuals. Functional (in vitro) evidence is indicating that the N88S and S90L mutations destroy a predicted N-glycosylation site of the protein at positions 88&#x02013;90, resulting in aggregates formation, cell death, and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p><p>Van de Warrenburg et al. describe two other Dutch families with the same c.236A &#x0003e; G mutation, showing a similar age at onset and intrafamilial variability in localization as observed in our family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the unilateral involvement observed in this study has not been described previously. As illustrated in Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, in the majority of the patients, onset of clinical features occurs at age 10&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years. However, the three patients of the youngest generation seem to display a severe phenotype considering their age, mostly with bilateral involvement of both hand and feet. This suggestion of possible anticipation could not be explained by the 16p haplotype shared by all affected relatives.</p><p>Auer-Grumbach et al. described the variability of the clinical phenotype in 90 patients with the p.N88S mutation, indicating that approximately 25% of the patients were not affected or were subclinically affected, sometimes only displaying NCS abnormalities. In addition, patients with this specific mutation have been diagnosed as a hand-type d-HMN (31.1%), classical Silver syndrome (14.5%), CMT-phenotype (20%), or pure spastic paraparesis (10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>This extreme variability in phenotype in a disorder related so far to only two mutations in the <italic>BSCL2</italic> gene is remarkable and suggests influence of genetic or environmental modifiers. The digenic inheritance of the pathogenic mutation in the <italic>BSCL2</italic> gene and the locus on chromosome 16p suggests that the latter may contain a gene-modifying disease expression in this family. The 16p region was shared by 14 relatives: 12 definite patients and two clinically unaffected twin sisters II:9 and II:10 without the p.N88S mutation. Electrophysiological studies in the unaffected II:9 did show motor neuron damage with a diminished CMAP amplitude of the median nerve and signs of reinnervation in myography. These abnormalities are not likely to be attributable to an asymptomatic carpal tunnel syndrome because sensory NCS of the median nerve were normal. Furthermore, the EMS in II:9 showed similar signs of motor neuron involvement as in her mildly affected sister II:5, who is carrying both the <italic>BLCS2</italic> mutation and the chromosome 16p haplotype. These findings suggest that the 16p locus may be associated with attenuated forms of HMN. Alternatively, these observations may indicate that the 16p locus is not sufficient for disease causing but has additive pathogenic effect.</p><p>An obvious candidate gene, the <italic>LITAF</italic>/<italic>SIMPLE</italic> gene, maps to the 16p region. The gene was associated with a demyelinating HMSN-subtype (HMSN1C). Also, a CMT2 phenotype, displaying asymmetric distal muscle weakness and normal NCV, has been associated with a <italic>LITAF</italic> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In our family, mutations in the coding region of the <italic>LITAF</italic>/<italic>SIMPLE</italic> gene were excluded by direct sequencing, and no copy number variants (genomic DNA) were detected. Differences in gene expression (RNA-cDNA) were found but were not related to disease status.</p><p>The Ingenuity database (Ingenuity Systems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) identified 33 of the 49 genes located on the chromosome 16 locus. Among those 33 genes, there are some possible candidate genes involved in DNA damage response and double-strand break repair pathways previously associated with neurodegeneration (i.e., <italic>CARHSP1</italic> (<italic>calcium-regulated heat-stable protein</italic>), <italic>GRIN2A</italic> (<italic>N-methyl-</italic><italic><sc>d</sc></italic><italic>-aspartate glutamate receptor 2A</italic>), <italic>SOCS1</italic> (<italic>suppressor of cytokine signaling 1</italic>), <italic>SNN</italic> (<italic>stannin</italic>), and <italic>TNFRSF17</italic> (<italic>tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily</italic>, <italic>member 17</italic>), <italic>A2BP1</italic> (<italic>ataxin 2-binding protein 1</italic>), <italic>CIITA</italic> (<italic>class II</italic>, <italic>major histocompatibility complex</italic>, <italic>transactivator</italic>), and <italic>RSL1D1</italic> (<italic>ribosomal L1 domain containing 1</italic>))<italic>.</italic></p><p>In conclusion, clinical and molecular studies of a large Dutch family with HMN detected a concomitant pathogenic mutation p.N88S in the <italic>BSCL2</italic> gene and linkage to a locus on chromosome 16p associated with a wide variation in severity and presentation of the neuromuscular features. The role of the locus on chromosome 16p in HMN pathogenesis remains to be elucidated; it may act as a disease modifier, possibly explaining the phenotypic variability ranging from strictly neuropathic weakness to a spastic paraplegia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all family members for their participation in the study.
