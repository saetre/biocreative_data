However, p6 contains an additional PTAP L-domain that promotes HIV-1 release by binding to the tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101). The notion that structures found in p9 differ form that of p6 further support the idea that different mechanisms regulate binding of ALIX to primary versus secondary L-domains types.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a retrovirus of the lentivirus subfamily which also includes HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). Compared to the primate lentiviruses the EIAV genome is the smallest (~8.2 kb) and genetically simplest as it contains only three accessory genes (<italic>rev</italic>, <italic>tat</italic>, and <italic>S2</italic>) in addition to the canonical retroviral elements <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pol</italic>, and <italic>env</italic>. As with other retroviruses the Gag polyprotein Pr55 of EIAV is required and sufficient for assembly and budding of virus like particles. The cleavage of the Pr55 Gag-precursor by the virus-encoded protease thereby yields the four major internal structural proteins: the matrix (MA, p15), capsid (CA, p26), nucleocapsid (NC, p11), and p9 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The Gag proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and targeted to the plasma membrane where they assemble into immature budding particles that consist predominantly of uncleaved polyproteins and are released from the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Maturation of the EIAV particle occurs concurrently with or shortly after release of the progeny virion in concert with protease activation.</p><p>The genomic position of p9 is analogous to that of the HIV-1 p6 protein and other similar proteins from different lentiviruses. Compared to HIV-1 p6, EIAV p9 has only minimal amino acid sequence homology and a considerable variation in the predicted secondary structure. Besides the function of p9 in viral DNA production and processing of the provirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], p9 plays, like p6 of HIV-1, an essential role in virus release, which are governed by late assembly domains (L-domains). Proline-rich L-domains, such as PTAP and PPPY have been identified in HIV-1, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), and a variety of other enveloped viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The HIV-1 PTAP motif specifically interacts with the N-terminus of the tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101), a component of the host endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT I), a system that regulates membrane fission during multivesicular body (MVB) formation and cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Interestingly, the EIAV YPDL L-domain motif has been shown to interact with two cellular proteins, the ALG-2-interacting-protein-X (ALIX/AIP1; ALIX is used hereafter) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and the &#x003bc;2 subunit of the AP-2 adaptor protein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Although L-domains appear to interact with different cellular proteins, a certain functional interchangeability has been reported. For example, both PTAP and PPPY motifs can substitute for the YPDL domain to support EIAV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These observations indicate that retroviruses, along with other enveloped viruses, have evolved different L-domains to specifically exploit certain host cellular machineries for virus budding and release.</p><p>Recently, we have characterized the structure of the HIV-1 p6 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and others have studied the structure of p6 fragments in complex with binding partners Tsg101 and ALIX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Among known lentiviruses, the 51-amino acid EIAV p9 protein is one of the smallest proteins and the molecular structure has not been defined hitherto. With the goal of understanding the molecular mechanism involved in the biological function of p9, we have explored the high resolution structure and folding of p9, derived from the EIAV<sub>WYOMING </sub>isolate<sub>, </sub>under various solution conditions. Although the molecule exhibits a high degree of flexibility in a pure aqueous environment it adopts &#x003b1;-helical structures in an hydrophobic environment simulated by organic solvents. According to high resolution NMR data, p9 consists of two independent structural domains, an unstructured N-terminus and an extended C-terminal helix. The structure of p9 was compared with that of HIV-1 p6, and their similarities and differences are discussed in terms of differences in their L-domain functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Synthesis and purification of synthetic p9 (sp9)</title><p>An overview of the previously reported binding domains for ALIX and AP-2 within the EIAV p9 protein and their relationship to the primary structure derived from the EIAV<sub>WYOMING </sub>sequence, together with the predicted sites of post-translational modification, are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular characteristics of p9</bold>.

The predicted helix is located in the C-terminal region, while the N-terminus of the molecule contains very little secondary structure if any.

We simulated a hydrophobic environment by using the organic solvent trifluoroethanol (TFE) to assess the degree of secondary structure under hydrophobic conditions. TFE is chosen for its well known characteristics as it favors intramolecular interactions and stabilizes secondary structure, particularly &#x003b1;-helices in domains of a peptide that have a propensity for such secondary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As TFE tends to disrupt quaternary structure and dissociate peptide aggregates, it can alleviate problems occurring with intermolecular interactions in the higher concentration ranges required for NMR investigations and provide a platform to perform CD and NMR studies under similar solution conditions.</p><p>The far-ultraviolet CD spectra of the full length molecule and its fragments are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The spectrum of <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>1-51 </sup>shows a strong ellipticity minimum at 196 nm with a small shoulder near 216 nm under aqueous (pure water, pH 3.0) conditions, which is characteristic of a random coil conformation with very little evidence of secondary structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Although a negative signal near 200 nm could be associated with disordered structure, the broad nature of the band suggests the presence of some structure. A similar spectrum was obtained when the molecule was analyzed at physiological pH (phosphate buffer, pH 7.2). However, addition of 50% TFE (at pH 3), affords two sharp signals at 208 nm and 222 nm and a positive signal at ~189 nm, indicating establishment of an &#x003b1;-helical structure under these hydrophobic conditions. Yet, the full length molecule looses significant &#x003b1;-helical content in 50% TFE at neutral pH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Thus, the CD data suggest that <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>1-51 </sup>adopts &#x003b1;-helical structure in the presence of a hydrophobic environment under acidic conditions that is less stable in neutral pH.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Far UV CD spectra of <italic>s</italic>p9 and fragments thereof</bold>.

In 50% TFE (pH 3.0) the N- and C-terminal fragments showed ca. 7.0% and 34.3% helical content, respectively, indicating secondary structure is predominantly located in the C-terminal section of the molecule (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) whereas the N-terminal fragment <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>1-21 </sup>showed no evidence of secondary structure under any of the conditions used, suggesting it is largely unstructured and does not contribute to the secondary structure of the molecule.

Initially, we have analyzed the structural characteristics of the peptides on the basis of <sup>1</sup>H<sub>&#x003b1; </sub>chemical shift data, which correlate with the chemical environment of the respective amino acid residues and therefore have proven to be useful for determining the presence, nature and exact position of secondary structure elements in such molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For instance, a minimum of four adjacent residues, showing pronounced upfield shifts relative to random coil values (&#x0003c; -0.1 ppm) indicate local helical structure while downfield shifts (&#x0003e; 0.1 ppm) of three or more adjacent residues are indicative of &#x003b1;-helical structures. In order to obtain these data a set of one- and two-dimensional (1D, 2D) <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra was recorded for each peptide. Signal assignments of the NMR spectra were accomplished using a standard procedure combining homonuclear 2D TOCSY and 2D NOESY NMR spectral data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Individual spin systems were identified from 2D TOCSY spectra, starting from the backbone amide protons. Sequence-specific assignments were determined from cross-peaks in the 2D NOESY spectra based on short observable distances between <sup>1</sup>H<sub>N</sub>, <sup>1</sup>H<sub>&#x003b1; </sub>and <sup>1</sup>H<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>nuclei of amino acid residue i and <sup>1</sup>H<sub>N </sub>of residue i+1. Spin systems that could readily be recognized were used as starting points to establish residue positions in the peptide sequence.</p><p>For each peptide the <sup>1</sup>H<sub>&#x003b1; </sub>chemical shift differences relative to random coil values were determined and plotted against the respective sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

The only pronounced downfield shifts observed for Glu-15 and Thr-16 can be explained by the presence of a proline residue in position 17. As demonstrated previously in the context of HIV-1 Vpr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] proline residues generally cause unusual intrinsic downfield shifts of 0.28 ppm &#x000b1; 0.1 ppm in the preceding residues and of 0.08 ppm &#x000b1; 0.03 ppm in residues two positions towards the N-terminus. Taking this proline-effect into consideration clearly rationalizes the downfield shifts of Glu-15 and Thr-16 and implies that these residues are in an unstructured environment.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Chemical shift differences of &#x003b1;-protons</bold>.

Even though residues Glu-28 and Glu-42 exhibit upfield shifts of only - 0.042 and - 0.079, respectively, it seems most likely that they are both part of a continuous helix, which in the case of Glu-28 becomes evident by the presence of very pronounced upfield shifts of the neighboring residues Ser-27 and Ile-29, and in the case of Glu-42 by a further stretch of seven weakly helical residues located directly to the C-terminal side of Glu-42. However, as the upfield shifts of these residues (Glu-42/Asp-43 to Leu-49) are distinctly less pronounced we assume that this part of the helix possesses decreased stability. At its N-terminus the helix is delimited by Pro-24, a residue that is often considered to be a helix-breaker.</p><p>A comparison of the <sup>1</sup>H<sub>&#x003b1; </sub>chemical shift differences of the full length molecule with those of the two fragments reveals that they are almost identical apart from residues Leu-22 to Leu-26.

Although there was no full sequence coverage with the required signals from the NOESY spectrum it can readily be deduced from the plot that no marked and well defined secondary structure is present in the N-terminal section of the molecule. Even though most dipeptides in the region Pro-1/Ile-2 to Asn-21/Leu-22 show a weak propensity for helix formation the merely moderate increase of values suggest a more random rather than a stable helical conformation. These change towards the C-terminus (Asp-25/Leu-26 to Trp-50/Glu-51) where a large majority of the observed distance combinations results in clearly increased values thereby implying the presence of an &#x003b1;-helix in this region.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Probabilities for helical, extended or random conformation in <italic>s</italic>p9 calculated from the ratios of the interproton distances <italic>d</italic><sub>NN </sub>(i, i+1) and <italic>d&#x003b1;</italic><sub>N </sub>(i, i+1) in the respective dipeptidic segments of <italic>s</italic>p<sup>1-51 </sup>in 50% TFE at 300 K</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6807-9-74-5"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Structure calculations from quantitative NOE data</title><p>The problem observed above for the full length molecule was caused by the overlap of signals that could therefore not be unambiguously identified or accurately quantified in the 2D spectra. Most likely, this problem arose from the high proportion of similar amino acids in the p9 sequence (Asn/Asp, Gln/Glu and Leu/Ile) that are distributed throughout the molecule. As all the qualitative data indicate the sole structured region in the molecule is restricted to the C-terminal region we focused our attention on the C-terminal peptide.

Therefore, a comparison of the structural properties of these two analogous proteins is required to understand their structure-function relationships and their interactions with the same cellular factors such as ALIX. In water, p6 adopts a random coil conformation without any preference for secondary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] while in a hydrophobic environment specific regions, residues 14-18 (helix 1) and residues 35-44 (helix 2), of the molecule adopt helical structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Helix 2 of HIV-1 p6 appears to be important for specific binding interactions with ALIX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In the quest to establish the structural details of the EIAV p9 molecule, CD analysis of <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>1-51 </sup>shows that the molecule has no significant or very little secondary structure when dissolved in pure water at pH 3 or in buffer at physiological pH 7.2. However, secondary structure is observed and clearly stabilized in the presence of increasing amounts (up to 50%) of TFE used to introduce a more hydrophobic environment that is assumed to more closely simulate <italic>in vivo </italic>conditions where p9 is exposed to the hydrophobic surfaces of other proteins. However, for <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>1-51 </sup>maximum &#x003b1;-helical content was found at room temperature in 50% aqueous TFE at pH 3 that decreased upon changing the pH to 7.2, irrespective of the hydrophobic environment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The CD data for the N- and C-terminal fragments clearly indicate secondary structure formation in solution is restricted to the C-terminus of the molecule. This fragment also behaves in a similar manner to the full length molecule in that maximal structure is found in 50% TFE and is less stable at physiological pH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>As in our previous structural elucidation of HIV-1 p6 we completely assigned the 1D and 2D <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>1-51</sup>, in conjunction with its N- and C-terminal fragments, to afford the position and nature of structured regions in the molecule.

According to the chemical shift differences in both the full-length <italic>s</italic>p9 and the shorter C-terminal peptide <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>22-51 </sup>there is some indication that the structured region extends back to residue Leu-26. The smaller negative differences observed towards the C-terminus indicate a weakening of the helical interactions in this region. A probability analysis for helical or extended conformation of dipeptidic segments for a limited number of interproton distances in the full length molecule support this conclusion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The C-terminal fragment exhibited 34.3% helical content in 50% TFE. In contrast to the C-terminal peptide there was no evidence of any structured region in the N-terminus either in the full length molecule or its N-terminal peptide. This was apparent even under the most favorable conditions (50% TFE at pH 3) independently from both the CD and NMR data.</p><p>Based on the above and the limited number of unambiguously assigned medium range NOEs caused by signal overlap of similar amino acid spin systems in <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>1-51</sup>, structural calculations were undertaken of the C-terminal fragment <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>22-51</sup>, which contains the L-domain and the only structured region of the molecule. The molecular dynamic calculations, using a total of 358 quantitative NOEs that included 137 sequential and 108 medium range NOEs, afford a central arrangement that confines the helical structure to the region between Glu-28 to Asp-47 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of the structure of EIAV p9 and HIV-1 p6</title><p>A considerable amount of literature now exists suggesting that EIAV p9 and HIV-1 p6 have several functions in common. Interestingly, these two functionally analogous proteins possess quite different biochemical and biophysical properties i.e. primary sequence, hydrophilicity and net charge, which would be expected to lead to different protein-protein interactions in the respective host cell system. Both proteins possess little sequence homology (only ~7% identity) and are predicted to differ significantly in their phosphorylation propensities. HIV-1 p6 was characterized as a largely phosphorylated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Similarly, both molecules have two ubiquitinylation sites and were shown to become mono-ubiquitinylated, and in the case of p6, sumoylated, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In their most structured states both molecules possess stable secondary structure although neither molecule possesses a stable tertiary structure. In a hydrophobic environment at low pH, both adopt helical secondary structure in their C-termini, although the helical region in p9 is longer (22 residues) than that of p6 (12 residues) under the same conditions. In each case the molecules are highly flexible and, unlike most structured proteins, must be considered as a dynamic equilibrium of many different conformers that have the overall propensity for secondary structure in the regions depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. Nevertheless, in its most structured form, the p6 molecule adopts a helix-turn-helix conformation in its C-terminal region whereas p9 assumes a single continuous helical conformation. The charge distribution within p6 and p9 is also distinctly different as the helix of p9 contains more charged residues than p6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Such differences in this helical region will be important for specific interactions with host cell factors (see below).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic comparison of the Tsg101- and ALIX-binding domains of p6 and p9 in relation to the experimentally determined secondary structures in 50% TFE</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6807-9-74-8"/></fig><p>The L-domains of p9 and p6, as well as similar domains from other viral systems, have received considerable attention as they play critical roles in controlling the interaction with the host system that finally promotes viral budding and particle release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These interactions involve the binding of specific regions of each molecule with components of the ESCRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Of particular relevance is the well-defined interaction of both molecules with ALIX, an ESCRT associated, multifunctional protein that interacts with both ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III. The ALIX-binding motif in both molecules responsible for this interaction has been defined recently as (L) [FY]PX<sub>1-3</sub>LXX [IL] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and corresponds in our case to <sup>22</sup><bold>LYP</bold>D<bold>L</bold>SE<bold>I </bold>in p9 and <sup>35</sup>LYPLAS<bold>L</bold>RS<bold>L </bold>in p6 in which essential residues are in bold. Recently, the structure of ALIX has been worked out in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and its interaction with p6 was modeled based on NMR data of p6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this model the C-terminal helix found in hydrophobic environments aligns coaxially with three helices in the ALIX V domain long arm to form a four-helix bundle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The presence of a similar helical motif in the C-terminus of p9 presumably affords the same binding interaction. It is important to note that the ALIX-binding domain of p6 is located within the helical region of the molecule while in p9 it is located in a partially unstructured region.</p><p>The structural investigations on p6 and p9 offer a rationale for the different spacing of the essential residues in the ALIX-binding domains pointed out by Munshi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. During ALIX binding hydrophobic conditions pertain and both molecules will adopt their most structured conformations. In p9 the ALIX-binding domain <sup>22</sup>LYPDL<sup>27</sup>SEI motif is at the junction of an unstructured and beginning of the helical region (Ser-27) of the molecule in this conformation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), while in p6 the whole <sup>35</sup>LYPLASLRSL motif is found within the helical region under the same conditions, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In this helical conformation the essential lysine residue at position 42 in p6 is brought into the proximity of the 3 amino acid sequence LYP through the introduction of one helix turn, the intervening two residues are now on the opposite side of the helix away from the hydrophobic interaction site of the ALIX V domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This re-arranged recognition site of adjacent residues <sup>35</sup>LYP <sup>40</sup>SLRS<bold>L </bold>now imitates the ALIX motif LYPDLSEI of p9. Thus, the helical conformation in p6 is required to position the essential residues correctly and maintain the ALIX-p6 functional interaction by re-orienting the <sup>39</sup><bold>LA </bold>residues to the other side of helix away from the interaction site, while this is not necessary for p9. In addition, the C-terminal helix of p9 is substantially longer than the corresponding helix in p6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) and thereby has a larger surface for potential interaction with the ALIX V domain. These structural differences in the ALIX-binding domains of the two molecules are reflected in the considerably higher thermodynamic stability of the p9-ALIX complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] suggesting p9 has an optimized ALIX-binding site compared to that of p6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Recently, the X-ray structures of the complexes of ALIX with short synthetic peptides corresponding to the L-domains of HIV-1 p6 and EIAV p9 have been elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In these studies, the conserved tyrosine residue of the L-domains plays a crucial role in positioning the peptides in the same hydrophobic groove of arm 2 of the ALIX V domain. In keeping with our analysis of the solution structures an extra helical turn is observed in the crystal structure of p6 to position Leu-42 in the same position as Leu-26 in p9. These structures also define the orientation of the peptide chains and indicate the ALIX V domain is able to accommodate the short peptides without any major helical movements between the free and bound forms. According to our solution data the C-terminal helical region of both p6 and p9 could be accommodated towards the open neck of the ALIX V domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] while the flexible N-termini would allow these to be accommodated in the loop region. It remains to be determined whether these interactions of the full length proteins in the context of the uncleaved Gag polyprotein cause unfolding of ALIX.</p><p>Until recently the L-domains of p9 and p6 have usually been defined as those regions containing the YPDL and PT/SAP motifs, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Clearly this implies the ALIX-binding domain and L-domain motifs overlap (or are identical) in p9, but are separated in p6 where the L-domain is positioned proximal to the PTAP motif, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>.</p><p>For p6, the PTAP L-domain binds to Tsg101, the human equivalent of Vps23 of the yeast ESCRT-I complex that has recently been completely defined structurally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Currently, there is no evidence of an equivalent interaction for p9. Indeed, the optimized ALIX binding site in p9 implies EIAV requires only a single L-domain for budding while the suboptimal binding site found in p6 requires the presence of a second site that functions through binding to Tsg101. This is corroborated by sequence data for p6 derived from different SIV strains where those containing high affinity ALIX binding sites do not have a Tsg101 binding site and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Thus, it can be argued that the YPDL L-domain of EIAV does not require an independent ESCRT-I interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] as the interactions between ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III are bridged through an appropriate conformation of ALIX stabilized by the strong interaction of p9. Presumably, in this bound form the N-terminal domain of ALIX binds to the ESCRT-III complex while the C-terminal proline-rich region binds the Tsg101 binding domain of ESCRT-I.</p><p>In summary, p9 from EIAV, like p6 from HIV-1, is structurally very labile and can exist in a number of conformational states that depend on its environment and the presence of binding partners that interact with specific domains in the molecule.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although p9 and p6 are sequentially quite different, both possess C-terminal helical structures in their most structured states that must be present during binding to the hydrophobic pocket of ALIX, a central control node in viral budding.

All spectra were internally referenced to the residual TFE-H<sub>2 </sub>methylene signal at 3.95 ppm. The unambiguous amino acid spin systems and the sequential assignments (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) were established using a standard procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The complete signal assignments and <sup>1</sup>H chemical shifts of <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>22-51 </sup>have been deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank under accession number RCSB100795.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural calculations</title><p>The structure of <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>22-51 </sup>was determined from quantitative NOE data as described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Structures were calculated on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station using the program CNS 1.0 with standard CNS parameters for protein data sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A total of 346 distance restraints were used to generate 100 conformations of which 20 conformations, exhibiting no restraint violations greater than 0.2 &#x000c5; and having the lowest energy values, were used for the final fitting analysis.</p><p>The heterogeneity within the final set of 20 structures was visualized using the consecutive segment approach which allows fitting regions for alignments to be defined (19). The central structure showing the lowest root mean square deviation (rmsd) of its fitting region to those of the other structures was then determined using the programs LSQMAN and MOLEMAN2 (Uppsala Software Factory) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Finally, alignments were performed by superimposing the fitting regions of all other structures to that of the central structure and these were visualized with the PYMOL program <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link>. The final structure of <italic>s</italic>p9<sup>22-51 </sup>has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under code PDBID <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2K84">2K84</ext-link>.</p><p>In this study the probability for helical or extended conformation of dipeptidic segments in the full length <italic>s</italic>p9 molecule was analyzed using the distances between <sup>1</sup>H nuclei of adjacent residues, namely H<sub>N </sub>and H<sub>&#x003b1; </sub>of residue i and H<sub>N </sub>of residue i+1 (<italic>d</italic><sub>NN</sub>(i, i+1), <italic>d</italic><sub>&#x003b1;N</sub>(i, i+1)) (22). The distances <italic>d </italic>which strictly correlate with signal intensities I (I ~1/<italic>d</italic><sup>6</sup>) were obtained by transferring the intensities of the respective NOE signals into interproton distances using the Bruker program AURELIA. Only unambiguous signals were used for this analysis. For a few signals that were weakened by the pre-saturation of the water resonance a correction was applied (-1.5 &#x000c5; when within 0.005 ppm of the water signal, -1 &#x000c5; when within 0.025 ppm, and -0.5 &#x000c5; when within 0.05 ppm), and a similar correction was made in cases where two or more signals could not be resolved individually due to close signal overlap. An equation given by Bradley <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] was then used to calculate probabilities for helical or extended conformations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
