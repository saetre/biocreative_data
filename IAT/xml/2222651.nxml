There is some controversy regarding both <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels and the nature of periostin-producing cells within tumors. In this study, we used quantitative RT-PCR to assess periostin gene expression in normal tissues, primary cell cultures, tumor tissues and tumor cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Periostin expression levels are highly variable in both normal tissues and tumors and strong <italic>POSTN </italic>overexpression is mostly detected in tumors from pancreas and liver. <italic>POSTN </italic>is not expressed in blood cancers. In melanoma samples, average periostin expression is not increased in primary tumors whereas <italic>POSTN </italic>overexpression was detected in about 60% of melanoma metastatic tumors in the liver or lymph nodes. Identification of the cellular source of periostin production in melanoma metastases -cancer cells or stroma- was assessed by comparing periostin expression in 23 newly-established melanoma cell lines and matched tumors. In contrast to the reduction by more than 99% of <italic>COL6A3 </italic>stromal marker mRNA in all cell lines, significant <italic>POSTN </italic>transcription was maintained in some melanoma cell lines, suggesting that both stromal cells and melanoma cells express periostin. The high level of periostin expression in primary cultures of skin fibroblasts suggests that fibroblasts may contribute for a large part to periostin production in melanoma-associated stroma. On the other hand, periostin expression in melanoma cells is probably acquired during the tumorigenic process as 1) normal melanocytes do not express <italic>POSTN </italic>and 2) melanoma cells from distinct metastases of the same patient were associated with very different levels of periostin expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our comparative analysis suggests that, although periostin overexpression is clearly detected in some cancers, it is not a general feature of tumors. In melanoma, our study identifies both stromal and melanoma cells as sources of periostin production and correlates <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels with increased primary tumor thickness and metastatic process development.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma and cancer progression in general is undoubtedly a major challenge in the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, underlying the necessity to identify new molecular targets. During the past decade, global gene expression profiling studies on various human cancer types, mainly relying on cDNA microarray technology, led to the identification of new candidate genes involved in cancer progression. These included periostin (<italic>POSTN</italic>), a gene encoding a secreted 90 kDa protein initially identified in a mouse osteoblastic library as a putative bone adhesion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This protein shows sequence similarity to fasciclin I, an insect cell adhesion protein involved in central nervous system development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and human &#x003b2; IgH3, a TGF-&#x003b2; 1-induced protein promoting adhesion and spreading of dermal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Binding of periostin to &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>and &#x003b1;<sub>V</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5 </sub>integrins has been reported to promote cell adhesion and spreading and to activate the Akt/PKB signaling pathway leading to increased cellular survival and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In pancreatic cancer cells, periostin was shown to bind to &#x003b1;<sub>6</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>4 </sub>integrin, thereby promoting phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and PKB through activation of the PI3 kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Over the past seven years, periostin was proposed to be a novel therapeutic target for cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Indeed, <italic>POSTN </italic>gene was found to be overexpressed in various human cancers such as ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], thyroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], oral squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and neuroblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and higher <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels were correlated with increased tumor aggressiveness and/or poorer survival in NSLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], SCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], neuroblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], colon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], thyroid carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], oral squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, other studies reported a down-regulation of <italic>POSTN </italic>transcription in bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] cancer. The functional role of periostin in cancer is also under debate as both tumor-promoting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and tumor-suppressing activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] have been reported: on one hand, periostin was reported to increase invasiveness of tumor cell lines <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] but, on the other hand, periostin expression reduced invasiveness of bladder cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and decreased anchorage-independent growth of T24 bladder cancer cells and SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, two reports demonstrated that <italic>POSTN </italic>overexpression in tumor cell lines increases metastasis and angiogenesis in nude mice and reduces stress-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] while another report provided evidence that periostin suppresses lung metastasis of mouse melanoma cell line B16-F10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Although <italic>POSTN </italic>overexpression does not seem to be systematic in human tumors, studies agree on the low level of periostin expression in most tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Lower levels of <italic>POSTN </italic>expression in tumor cell lines compared to tumor tissues are in agreement with studies showing a production of periostin by stromal cells -and not cancer cells- in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

We next focused on cutaneous melanoma to quantify periostin transcripts in a total of 113 tumor samples, including primary and metastatic lesions, and we correlated periostin expression with Breslow thickness of melanoma primary tumors. Finally, to investigate the source of periostin production in melanoma, we analyzed <italic>POSTN </italic>transcription level in 23 newly-established melanoma cell lines and matched tumors and compared the results with the expression level of <italic>COL6A3</italic>, a melanoma-associated stromal marker encoding the &#x003b1;3 chain of collagen VI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>POSTN </italic>expression in normal tissues</title><p>We used qRT-PCR to quantify periostin expression in various normal human tissues.

Together with previous observations that fibroblasts may be the source of periostin expression in various tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], this suggests that fibroblast content may modulate <italic>POSTN </italic>expression level in normal tissues. To evaluate <italic>POSTN </italic>expression in fibroblasts, we extracted RNA from fibroblast primary cultures derived from either fetal lung (IMR90), newborn foreskin (HFF2) or adult abdominal skin (LB2924). <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels as high as, respectively, 1547 &#x000b1; 213, 1391 &#x000b1; 142 and 1267 &#x000b1; 57 were measured in these samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This high level of <italic>POSTN </italic>expression in fibroblasts was not a consequence of establishing primary cultures as embryonic stem cell primary cultures (HUES) were characterized by very low periostin expression level (4.2 &#x000b1; 0.5), further suggesting that periostin expression is not required at the blastocyst embryonic stage.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>POSTN </italic>expression in various tumors</title><p>To evaluate the extent of periostin expression in tumors, we measured the amount of <italic>POSTN </italic>and <italic>ACTB </italic>cDNA molecules in hematological malignancies and tumors from pancreas, testis, liver, bladder, prostate, colon, stomach, ovary, lung, kidney and breast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of <italic>POSTN </italic>expression in normal tissues and tumors</bold>. <italic>POSTN </italic>and <italic>ACTB </italic>cDNA levels were measured in triplicate in various normal tissues and tumors as described in Fig. 1 legend.

Overall, our data reveal the huge variability of <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels in most solid tumors and normal tissues. Hence, increased periostin expression was only nearly significant in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (656 &#x000b1; 819 <italic>vs </italic>9.1 &#x000b1; 6.9 for normal pancreas, <italic>P </italic>= 0.06). In liver cancer, average <italic>POSTN </italic>expression was also increased (902 &#x000b1; 1308, <italic>n </italic>= 6) compared to normal tissue samples (14 &#x000b1; 11, <italic>n </italic>= 5) (<italic>P </italic>= 0.16). In ovarian tumors, <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels were about 15-fold higher than the average level measured in a total of seven (three separate ovaries and one pool of four) normal tissues (759 &#x000b1; 708 <italic>vs </italic>52 &#x000b1; 66) (<italic>P </italic>= 0.14).

Notably, very low expression levels (&#x0003c;10) were measured in 9% of melanoma metastases while 15% of them showed very high levels of <italic>POSTN </italic>expression (&#x0003e;2000) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). To further compare periostin expression in primary tumors and metastases, we measured the level of <italic>POSTN </italic>transcripts in metastases and matched primary tumors from 11 patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). No correlation was found: <italic>POSTN </italic>expression was either reduced (by up to 280-fold), maintained or increased (by up to 11-fold) in metastases compared to primary melanoma. Further analysis also revealed that <italic>POSTN </italic>transcription levels may vary significantly between distinct metastases isolated from the same individual (patients LB2174, LB2201 and LB2077, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These variations may be explained by distinct localization of melanoma metastases as normal skin produces significant amounts of periostin unlike other organs with very low endogenous levels of periostin, like lymph nodes or the liver. Strikingly, our analysis revealed a significant increase of <italic>POSTN </italic>expression in more than 60% of tumor-invaded lymph nodes (<italic>P </italic>= 0.003) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Conversely, tumor-invaded lymph nodes with low <italic>POSTN </italic>expression account for the low levels (&#x0003c;100) measured in a subset of melanoma metastases. Similar observations were made with hepatic melanoma metastases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Hence, these data demonstrate the <italic>POSTN </italic>overexpression in about 60% of melanoma metastases in the liver or lymph nodes. Periostin overexpression in (sub)cutaneous melanoma metastases is more difficult to assess as <italic>POSTN </italic>transcripts are already abundant in normal skin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). <italic>POSTN </italic>overexpression in metastatic tumors was confirmed by an analysis of 19 hepatic metastases from intraocular melanoma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) (<italic>P </italic>= 0.002).</p><p>Earlier reports suggested that periostin expression level was correlated with tumor aggressiveness and/or poorer survival in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], SCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], neuroblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], colon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], thyroid carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], oral squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

However, six cell lines, LB2077-1, LB2077-4, LB2730-1, LB2174-3, CP50-1B and LB2800, were characterized by higher periostin expression (between 149 &#x000b1; 21 and 3941 &#x000b1; 362) and, as expected for a secreted protein, periostin was detected in the conditioned medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Interestingly, independent cell lines derived from distinct metastases of the same patient were associated with very different levels of periostin expression (LB2077 and LB2174 patients, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Notably, <italic>POSTN </italic>expression level was &#x0003c;1 in LB2077-2 cell line derived from a breast metastasis whereas periostin was expressed at very high level in LB2077-1 (3941 &#x000b1; 362) and LB2077-4 (680 &#x000b1; 73) cell lines derived from metastases located, respectively, in scalp sub-cutaneous tissues and heart of the same patient. Data also suggest that high level of periostin expression in metastatic tumoral cells is not time-dependent as variable expression levels were observed during the tumor resection history of melanoma patients LB2174 and LB2077 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of <italic>POSTN </italic>expression in melanoma tumors and cell lines</bold>.

The detection of <italic>POSTN </italic>expression in a fraction of melanoma cell lines suggests either that normal melanocytes express periostin and that the expression is maintained in some melanoma cells or that normal melanocytes do not express periostin but may acquire the ability to express the gene during the tumorigenic process. To address that issue, we quantified periostin expression in normal human melanocytes. Unlike the expression profile detected in skin fibroblasts, <italic>POSTN </italic>expression was not detected in melanocytes and <italic>COL6A3 </italic>expression was very low (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

Salivary gland, thymus and embryonic stem cells were also characterized by very low expression levels. The highest <italic>POSTN </italic>cDNA levels were measured in colon, small intestine, breast and skin. However, in the three latter organs, as well as in kidney and ovaries, expression levels were highly fluctuating between tissue samples, providing a possible explanation for the discrepancies between previous studies. The diversity in cell type content among samples may possibly account for this variability. In that respect, skin samples contain different cell types including fibroblasts, keratinocytes and melanocytes for which we have measured <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels of, respectively, about 1500, 50 (data not shown) and 0.</p><p>In tumors, leukemia and myeloma showed negligible levels of periostin expression whereas <italic>POSTN </italic>transcripts were detected in all solid tumors. We detected a 72-fold increase of <italic>POSTN </italic>transcription in pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared to normal tissues (<italic>P </italic>= 0.06), in line with previous studies reporting a 42- to more than 100-fold increase of <italic>POSTN </italic>mRNA level in pancreatic tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In liver and ovarian tumors, average expression levels were increased by 65- and 15-fold respectively. The only evidences for increased periostin expression in liver cancer reported so far come from immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In ovarian tumors, tumor-derived epithelial cells and ascites, previous semi-quantitative studies reported elevated levels of periostin mRNA and protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Previous studies reported <italic>POSTN </italic>up-regulation in about half of the NSCLC tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and a slight increase in periostin serum levels from NSCLC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Higher periostin serum levels were also correlated with increasing T- or N-stage in SCLC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] but, on the other hand, <italic>in situ </italic>mRNA hybridization suggested a down-regulation of <italic>POSTN </italic>gene transcription in SCLC tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our data suggest that <italic>POSTN </italic>transcription is increased by 5-fold in NSCLC tumors. No significant difference was measured for SCLC and NET tumors although more samples should be analyzed. Analysis of six colorectal tumors and three normal colon samples revealed only a 2-fold increase in <italic>POSTN </italic>expression (<italic>P </italic>= 0.16). The modest increase in <italic>POSTN </italic>transcription that we measured in colorectal tumor samples does not match previous data from a semi-quantitative study reporting considerable periostin overexpression in 25/29 pairs of matched normal colon tissue and colon tumor samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The reason for this is unclear but may be related to the fact that Bao <italic>et al. </italic>mainly focused on colon cancers with hepatic metastases. In breast and kidney tumors, the difference in periostin expression was not significant due to the highly variable <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels measured in both normal and tumoral samples. The absence of significant increase in <italic>POSTN </italic>expression in breast tumors contrasts with the conclusions from a previous study in which expression in tumors was compared to the low level of <italic>POSTN </italic>mRNA in primary mammary epithelial cultures as reference for normal breast tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Overall, for most tumor types tested in this study, our data revealed highly variable <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels in both tumors and normal tissues, suggesting that larger numbers of samples should be tested to address periostin expression in tumors more significantly.</p><p>In normal skin, melanocytes do not express <italic>POSTN </italic>but fibroblasts express the gene at high level. Investigation of 46 primary cutaneous melanoma lesions did not reveal any significant difference in average <italic>POSTN </italic>expression compared to normal tissues although we found that, in primary melanoma, thicker tumors (&#x0003e; 4 mm) may be correlated with increased periostin expression (<italic>P </italic>= 0.07). However, melanoma cell content of tumor samples is difficult to estimate and may vary with tumor thickness, leading to possible distortion of the data. In metastatic melanoma lesions, <italic>POSTN </italic>expression ranged from very low to very high levels compared to normal skin. Classification of melanoma metastases showed that very low <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels are found in metastases located in organs with low endogenous periostin expression, like the liver or lymph nodes. In these organs, low <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels are expected if melanoma cells do not produce periostin. Conversely, periostin levels should be high if melanoma metastases overexpress <italic>POSTN </italic>either through acquisition of <italic>POSTN </italic>expression by melanoma cells or to increased periostin expression in tumor-associated stromal cells. In that respect, about 60% of melanoma metastatic tumors in the liver or lymph nodes showed a clear <italic>POSTN </italic>overexpression compared to normal organs.</p><p>The nature of periostin-producing cells in tumors is still under debate as separate studies reported a production of periostin by stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] whereas other experiments suggested that <italic>POSTN </italic>mRNA is detected in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To investigate the nature of periostin-producing cells in melanoma, periostin expression was measured in newly established melanoma cell lines and matched tumors. In cell lines, expression of <italic>COL6A3 </italic>stromal cell marker was reduced to less than 1% of the value measured in matched tumors whereas periostin was expressed (at either low or high level) in about half of the melanoma cell lines. Given that normal melanocytes do not express periostin, this study suggests that melanoma cells sometimes acquire the ability to express the gene during tumorigenesis. Our data also indicate that cell lines isolated from distinct metastases of the same patient may be characterized by either negligible or high <italic>POSTN </italic>expression, suggesting that periostin expression is acquired by melanocytes during the metastatic process. Previous studies reported low <italic>POSTN </italic>expression in most tumor-derived cell lines, whatever their origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] but most cancer cell lines tested had been established a long time before and subjected to extensive culture, making it difficult to establish whether the decreased expression in cancer cell lines was reflecting a loss of stromal-associated <italic>POSTN </italic>expression as suggested by some authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or artifacts due to prolonged cell culture. The induction of periostin expression in melanoma cells may be a consequence of mutagenic events occuring during the tumorigenic processes or may be the result of interactions with stromal components previously reported to influence development and progression of carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In that respect, earlier experiments showed an induction of <italic>POSTN </italic>expression in tumors recovered from nude mice injected with periostin-negative transformed cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] (although one cannot rule out the possibility that stromal cells themselves may be the source of periostin expression in these tumors). On the other hand, our data indicate that stromal cells are an important source of periostin production in melanoma tumors. In some instances, periostin expression levels were higher than 3000 in the tumor but negligible in matching cell lines, suggesting that periostin expression may be very high in tumor-associated stromal cells. In line with this, a significant increase in periostin expression was measured in fibroblast-like stellate cells from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors, a cancer characterized by excessive desmoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Stromal cells have a prominent role in cancer progression and cancer-associated fibroblasts are believed to play a crucial role by producing growth factors, chemokines and extracellular matrix components that promote tumor angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The increased expression of periostin in melanoma metastatic lesions that we identified in this study is in agreement with <italic>in vivo </italic>studies revealing that periostin overexpression promotes metastatic growth of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Hence, this work suggests that, in melanoma, periostin overexpression may also be involved in the process of metastasis. In line with this, two previous studies identified an up-regulation of integrin &#x003b1;V (ITGAV), one of the subunits of periostin receptor, as a predictive marker for melanoma metastasis in primary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Periostin was reported to promote cell survival and angiogenesis in tumors. Although cancer-associated <italic>POSTN </italic>overexpression is well documented for some tumor types, it is still uncertain for other ones. To date, no quantitative comparison of periostin expression in a large panel of normal and tumor tissues was available. In this study, we detected considerable variability of <italic>POSTN </italic>transcript levels among samples from the same tissue type, especially for tissues with variable stroma content. Overall, our results support previously reported increase of periostin expression in tumors from pancreas, liver and NSCLC but suggest that <italic>POSTN </italic>overexpression is not a general feature of tumors. In melanoma, <italic>POSTN </italic>transcription was not increased in primary lesions compared to normal skin but was correlated with Breslow thickness. On the other hand, about 60% of melanoma metastases from lymph nodes or the liver overexpress <italic>POSTN</italic>. Analysis of newly-established melanoma cell lines and matched metastases revealed that, although stromal cells -presumably fibroblasts- are mostly responsible for periostin production in melanoma metastases, melanoma cells sometimes acquire the ability to express <italic>POSTN </italic>at high level. This acquisition is associated with the metastatic process as distinct metastases from the same patient were associated with very different <italic>POSTN </italic>expression levels. Hence, this work reconciles previously published studies reporting conflicting data about the nature of periostin-producing cells in tumors (stromal or cancer cells) and identifies <italic>POSTN </italic>as a marker of metastasis in melanoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM), Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), trypsin-EDTA and essential amino acids were purchased from GIBCO (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium); fetal calf serum was from HyClone (Perbio Science, Aalst, Belgium); TriPure reagent from Roche Applied Science Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany) and all other reagents were from Sigma Aldrich (Bornem, Belgium).</p></sec><sec><title>Primary cultures, normal tissues, tumors and cell lines</title><p>IMR90 fetal lung fibroblasts were kindly provided by M.

LB2181-2 and LB2667-1a cell lines were used as negative controls. Four ml-supernatants from 400 000 cells were collected after 72 hours and concentrated 10 times using the Microsep centrifugal devices 10 K (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). Equal volumes of concentrated supernatants were subjected to 7% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated successively with rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab14041, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) specific for periostin and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI).
