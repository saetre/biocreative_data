Deletion of the two genes encoding L12 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> resulted in a very slow-growth phenotype. Gene <italic>RPL12B</italic>, but not the <italic>RPL12A</italic>, cloned in centromeric plasmids fully restored control protein level and the growth rate when expressed in a L12-deprived strain. The same strain has been transformed to express <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> protein EcL11 under the control of yeast <italic>RPL12B</italic> promoter. The bacterial protein has been found in similar amounts in washed ribosomes from the transformed yeast strain and from control <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, however, EcL11 was unable to restore the defective acidic protein stalk composition caused by the absence of ScL12 in the yeast ribosome. Protein EcL11 induced a 10% increase in L12-defective cell growth rate, although the <italic>in vitro</italic> polymerizing capacity of the EcL11-containing ribosomes is restored in a higher proportion, and, moreover, the particles became partially sensitive to the prokaryotic specific antibiotic thiostrepton. Molecular dynamic simulations using modelled complexes support the correct assembly of bacterial L11 into the yeast ribosome and confirm its direct implication of its CTD in the binding of thiostrepton to ribosomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ribosomal stalk is an essential and highly conserved ribosomal structure directly involved in translation supernatant factor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). High-resolution cryo-EM models of bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and eukaryotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) ribosomes show two clearly different stalk domains, a highly mobile elongated protrusion connected to a more static but conformational change prone base. The mobile domain of the prokaryotic stalk is formed by the CTD of either two or three dimers, depending on the species, of the acidic 12 kDa L7/L12 protein, which are linked to their corresponding NTDs by an unstructured and very flexible, hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>The L7/L12 NTDs interact with the protein L10 CTD and the complex binds to the conserved 23S rRNA GTPase associated region (GAR) formed by helices 42&#x02013;44 through the L10 NTD. The GAR domain, together with the L10 NTD and the adjacently bound protein L11, forms the stalk base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>The L7/L12 CTDs, involved in the binding and function of the translation-soluble factors, are considered to be the functional domain of the stalk. The reason for the existence of multiple copies of the same active domain in the ribosome is not presently understood. Cross-linking results have led to the proposal that two of the L7/L12 CTDs are immobilized by interacting with protein L11 at the stalk base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) suggesting that not all the copies have the same role. Moreover, it has recently been proposed that one L7/L12 CTD interacts with protein L11 and with the G' domain of elongation factor EFG, forming a previously observed arc-like connection at the stalk base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure of L11&#x02013;GAR fragment complexes has confirmed a tight interaction of the protein CTD with the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), which is essential to determine its tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In contrast, the L11NTD makes only limited contacts with the rRNA and shows a high mobility. It has been proposed that the L11NTD might function as a switch by reversibly binding to the rRNA and in this way determining the conformational changes detected in this important ribosomal domain during translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">10&#x02013;15</xref>). Each one of the two elongation factors, EFG and EFTu are supposed to recognize one specific conformation of the GAR domain, thus producing a different chemical modification protection pattern in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In spite of its structural and functional relevance, protein L11 is not absolutely essential for ribosome activity since bacterial strains lacking this protein are viable, although they grow very poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>In addition, protein L11 is also physiologically relevant due to its key role in the activity of thiostrepton and related compounds, a family of classical inhibitors of protein synthesis in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). These compounds bind to the RNA, although their interaction is markedly increased by protein L11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The primary target site of thiostrepton has been located in the 23S rRNA GAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), involving also the NTD of protein L11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The drug and its analogues seem to bind to a cleft formed by the two stem-loops in the 3D structure of the GAR domain and by a proline-rich helix in the L11NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This model accounts for the resistance effects caused by A1067 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and L11 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) as well as for A1095 chemical protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These antibiotics seem to block the L11NTD&#x02013;GAR complex in a fixed position, hindering conformational changes in the stalk base, which seem to be essential for elongation factor activity, inhibiting in this way protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The eukaryotic ribosome is insensitive to thiostrepton and its resistance has been mainly linked to the presence of a G instead of an A at the position corresponding to 1067 in <italic>E. coli</italic> 23S RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>A model of the eukaryotic ribosomal stalk structure equivalent to that reported for prokaryotes is not yet available. Cryo-EM data show that the overall stalk structure is conserved in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). However, the characterization of its components indicates that the eukaryotic stalk is considerably more complex than the bacterial one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Thus, the acidic proteins have evolved into two families of independently coded proteins, P1 and P2, formed by a variable number of members depending on the eukaryotic organism; in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> there are two proteins of each type, P1&#x003b1;/P1&#x003b2; and P2&#x003b1;/P2&#x003b2;. In contrast to L7/L12, proteins P1 and P2 are not found in the ribosome as homodimers but mainly as P1/P2 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In addition, protein P0 is notably larger than its bacterial L10 counterpart due to a C-terminal extension, which has structural and functional similarity to the acidic P1 and P2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Its higher structural complexity has apparently endowed the eukaryotic stalk with ribosome modulating capabilities than have not been detected in the bacterial one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p>Eukaryotic protein L12 is the counterpart of prokaryotic L11, although their amino acid sequences show very low homology. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, protein ScL12 is encoded by two genes, <italic>rpL12A</italic> and <italic>rpL12B</italic>, which express an identical protein. Both genes can be simultaneously disrupted seriously affecting the cell growth but leaving the disrupted cells viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The eukaryotic stalk base also undergoes important conformational changes during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), suggesting that protein L12 must also have a relevant function.</p><p>In contrast to the proteins, the stalk rRNA moiety, the GAR domain, is functionally well conserved among all species. Thus, the bacterial and yeast GAR regions have been shown to be functionally interchangeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>It has also been shown that bacterial protein L11 can bind <italic>in vitro</italic> to eukaryotic GAR rRNA fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In order to test whether this binding is functional in the cell, <italic>E. coli</italic> protein L11 has been expressed in a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain lacking protein L12. The results show that the bacterial protein is assembled into the yeast ribosome; however, its capacity to functionally complement the protein L12 absence is low, indicating that contrary to the RNA&#x02013;protein interactions, the protein&#x02013;protein interactions are poorly conserved. Nevertheless, in spite of its low functional activity, protein EcL11 makes the yeast ribosome partially sensitive to thiostrepton.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> 6EA1 (<italic>leu2-3,112, trp1-1, ura3-1, can1-100, RPL12A::KanMX4, RPL12B::HIS3</italic>) originally called A6K1O-6EA1, was derived from strain W303 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).

Finally, the structure of thiostrepton was extracted from the file 1OLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). With all these elements, the two ternary complexes were assembled as follows: using 1S1I as a template EcL11, ScL12 and RNA GAR domain were superimposed on their counterparts and the coordinates of thiostrepton were then exported.

SHAKE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) was used to constrain all the bonds at their equilibrium distances. Periodic boundary conditions and the Particle Mesh Ewald (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) methods were used to treat long-range electrostatic effects. AMBER-99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) and TIP3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) force-fields were used in all cases. All the trajectories were performed using the AMBER 8 computer program and associated modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The three models were built as discussed in the previous paragraph. The three complexes were hydrated by using boxes containing explicit water molecules, optimized, heated (20 ps) and equilibrated by following the trajectories by principal component analysis (PCA, see below). After equilibration, MD trajectories were continued for 25 ns of unrestrained MD simulation. Snapshots were sampled every 1 ps for the last 5 ns of the trajectories.</p><p>Thiostrepton-effective binding free energy to EcL11-EcGAR, ScL12-ScGAR and EcL11-ScGAR was qualitatively estimated using the MM-GBSA approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). The MM-GBSA method approaches free energy of binding as a sum of a Molecular Mechanics (MM) interaction term, a solvation contribution thorough a Generalized Born (GB) model, and a Surface Area (SA) contribution to account for the non-polar part of desolvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). These calculations were performed for each snapshot from the simulations using the appropriate module within AMBER 8.</p><p>At the same time, due to the considerable flexibility of the system observed during the simulation, the free energy landscape explored by thiostrepton and the inherent flexibility of each complex was studied by representing MM-GBSA interaction energies as a function of the first and second principal components obtained from PCA of the trajectories of the tertiary complex. The components were extracted from the spectral decomposition of covariance matrix using an averaged structure over the entire trajectory as reference. PCA computations were done using the C alpha atoms from the proteins and P atoms from the RNA together. For graphical representation, landscapes were generated using the Fields library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) within R statistical package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). This library uses a smoothing procedure based on the use of non-parametric regression to allow estimation of the expected energy landscape in those regions of the map not properly sampled during the simulation. The results should be interpreted more in a qualitative than in a quantitative sense.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Effect of <italic>RPL12</italic>A and <italic>RPL12B</italic> genes on cell growth</title><p>The yeast ribosomal protein ScL12 is not essential for cell viability, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 6EA1, a yeast strain totally lacking this ribosomal component, is able to grow in rich YEPD medium with a doubling time of around 5 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).

To gain a better understanding of the association of EcL11 with the yeast GAR domain at the molecular level, as well as the thiostrepton inhibitory activity, the structure of the heterologous complex was modelled based on the reported crystal structure of the L11-GAR complex in <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) using the nucleotide sequence of the yeast rRNA fragment (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 26S rRNA fragment G1225-C1282). In order to find a structural justification of their different thiostrepton affinities, we compared our modelled EcL11&#x02013;ScGAR complex with the equivalent complexes from the reported crystal structure of the <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) and from the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 80S ribosome obtained by combining cryo-EM reconstruction with rRNA and protein molecular information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, it became noticeable that protein ScL12 appears in the yeast 80S model in a position which is not consistent with the reported bacterial L11&#x02013;GAR complex crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Therefore, the structure of the ScL12&#x02013;ScGAR complex was remodelled. The binding of thiostrepton to the two modleled complexes, EcL11&#x02013;ScGAR and ScL12&#x02013;ScGAR, and the reported EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR structure were analysed using molecular dynamic simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel: Thiostrepton free energy of binding to EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR complex landscape as a function of two first principal components (C alpha and P atoms for the protein and RNA, respectively).

PCA analysis suggested a long equilibration period. Taking as reference the initial minimized structure, Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD) were also calculated for the protein, RNA, thiostrepton and for the whole complex. The RMSD values for the individual components of the complex were similar for EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR and EcL11&#x02013;ScGAR, but higher for ScL12&#x02013;ScGAR, suggesting a less structured complex.</p><p>The thiostrepton-binding energy landscapes as a function of the first two principal coordinates of the complexes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. The reference model (EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR) presents a wide, low-energy region for antibiotic binding. Analysis of the conformational transitions in this space suggests a closure or hinge-like movement in the apical GAR hairpin loop near the thiostrepton-binding site and in the proline-rich helix of the protein in order to better accommodate the antibiotic. Smaller, low-energy areas are found for EcL11&#x02013;ScGAR and ScL12&#x02013;ScGAR complexes. The three representative structures selected present similar induced movements upon antibiotic binding, mostly involving improved ordering of the proline-rich helix lining the thiostrepton-binding site. From an energetic point of view, and considering that only relative numbers are relevant, the MM-GBSA analysis showed that the predicted thiostrepton-binding affinities for the EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR, EcL11&#x02013;ScGAR, ScL12&#x02013;ScGAR correspond to &#x02212;76.52, &#x02212;67.88, &#x02212;63.24 kcal/mol, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Individual disruption of the <italic>RPL12A</italic> and <italic>RPL12B</italic> genes has shown that their respective contribution to the cell ScL12 protein content is not identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Thus, deletion of <italic>RPL12B</italic> results in a larger reduction of the growth rate and ScL12 content than deletion of <italic>RPL12A</italic>, however, the differences were not big (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). It was therefore unexpected to find a notable differences when the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 6EA1, lacking both genes, was transformed with centromeric plasmids carrying each one of them. While <italic>RPL12B</italic> restores the growth rate of strain 6EA1 to almost the parental strain level, <italic>RPL12A</italic> has very little effect on the disruptant strain growth. Consistent with the effect on growth, the amount of protein detected in the pFL30/L12B transformed strain is much higher than in the strains transformed with pFL38/L12A. Similarly, a high amount of protein was detected when the <italic>RPL12A</italic> ORF was expressed from the GAL1 promoter in the pYES2 plasmid indicating that the differences between both genes are not due to the presence of unusual codons in the gene A copy.</p><p>Since sequencing confirmed the absence of mutations in the cloned genes, it is reasonable to assume that some additional regulatory elements not present in the plasmids, which we are trying to identify, are acting in the genomic gene copies, and are responsible for the different expression from the genomic and plasmid-borne gene copies.</p><p>The results in this report show that when protein EcL11, the bacterial orthologue of eukaryotic ribosomal protein ScL12, is expressed in yeast it can be transported to the nucleolus and assembled into the ribosome. Moreover, EcL11 seems to be able to bind to the yeast ribosome with roughly the same affinity as the homologous component, since it withstands the same washing protocol.</p><p>A high conservation of the large subunit rRNA GAR domain has been previously reported by showing that it is functionally interchangeable between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Nevertheless, the low overall similarity of amino acid sequence of the corresponding proteins points to the conservation of the tertiary structure of the binding site. The crystal structure of the bacterial L11-GAR complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) clearly showed that the rRNA-binding site is located at the protein CTD, and a number of amino acids in and around the &#x003b1;5 helix, which are directly involved in the interaction, are conserved in prokaryotes and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This part of bacterial L11CTD binds the minor groove of the GAR RNA 1067 stem primarily through protein backbone-RNA backbone interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Based on the bacterial crystal structure, a model for the EcL11&#x02013;ScGAR complex has been generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Similarly, the ScL12&#x02013;ScGAR model derived from the reported <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 80S ribosome has been modified to obtain a better fit with the bacterial structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Both modelled complexes as well the equivalent complex, EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), obtained from the crystal structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) have been used to analyse the binding of thiostrepton by molecular dynamic simulation. The resulting model for the interaction of the antibiotic with the control <italic>E. coli</italic> complex agrees with previous structural information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and specially the recently reported NMR analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and will be later discussed.</p><p>Regarding the protein&#x02013;RNA interactions, the important hydrogen bonded pattern established between the base pair U1060(1234)-A1088(1262) and residues Gly130-Thr131 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) are well-maintained throughout the simulation in EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR and EcL11&#x02013;ScGAR, and to a lesser extend in ScL12&#x02013;ScGAR. In general, the protein&#x02013;RNA interactions predicted in the model support the idea that the structural stability of the heterologous complex formed by the EcL11 CTD domain and the yeast GAR fragment cannot be very different from the homologous bacterial complex. The overall energy of the interactions is similar supporting that their stability must be comparable in agreement with the biochemical data from total ribosomes reported here and from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using the GAR rRNA fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>In spite of its specific binding to the correct GAR RNA site, the bound EcL11 complements the ScL12 absence to a limited extent. The bacterial protein only causes an around 10% growth rate increase when it is expressed in the yeast strain lacking ScL12. Interestingly, although still low, the effect of EcL11 on the ribosome activity is proportionally higher, raising the activity of the ScL12-depleted ribosomes from 18 to 32% of the control. In contrast, the polysome profiles from the ScL12 depleted cells are practically unaltered by the presence of the bacterial protein and they show the accumulation of possible pre-ribosomal particles, which suggest that the exogenous protein might be less efficient at the level of ribosome assembly. All together, these results indicate that while the protein CTD&#x02013;rRNA interactions responsible for the protein assembly are conserved, the evolution of the protein&#x02013;protein interactions taking place mainly through the NTD during translation [with proteins L10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), L7/L12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and elongation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>)] and ribosome assembly have negatively affected the EcL11 functionality in yeast.</p><p>Nevertheless, EcL11 has a significant effect on the sensitivity of the yeast ribosome to thiostrepton, a classical prokaryotic specific antibiotic inactive in eukaryotes. Yeast ribosomes, either carrying or lacking protein ScL12, are practically insensitive to this antibiotic while the hybrid ribosome carrying EcL11 showed an IC50 close to 100 &#x003bc;M. This value indicates that the hybrid ribosomes are still substantially more resistant than the bacterial systems, but clearly indicate that thiostrepton is able to interact with them and block protein synthesis.</p><p>The critical role of A1067 in <italic>E. coli</italic> 23S rRNA, or the equivalent position in other organisms, for the binding of thiostrepton to the ribosome has been convincingly demonstrated and the insensitivity of eukaryotes to this drug has been mainly related to the presence of a G in that position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). However, when binding of the drug to naked rRNA was tested, the role of the nucleotide at position 1067 was found to be less relevant than expected, and the limited reduction caused by a G did not justify the high resistance of the eukaryotic ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). It was concluded that in the ribosome the active conformation of the thiostrepton binding site is determined by the large rRNA GAR domain as well as by protein L11. In eukaryotes, protein L12 would either occlude or distort the site, hindering the drug binding.</p><p>Our results clearly indicate that binding of protein EcL11 is enough to substantially increase the sensitivity of the yeast ribosomes to the drug. The results of the molecular dynamic analysis of the thiostrepton interaction with the reported EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR complex and with the modelled EcL11&#x02013;ScGAR and ScL12&#x02013;ScGAR complexes clearly indicated that the largest and smallest stabilization of thiostrepton correspond to EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR (&#x02212;76.52 kcal/mol) and ScL12&#x02013;ScGAR (&#x02212;63.24 kcal/mol), respectively, while the predicted binding affinities for EcL11&#x02013;ScGAR (&#x02212;67.88 kcal/mol) is someway in between. These results are in agreement with the available experimental data, which show that thiostrepton preferentially binds to the EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR complex, but it is still able to bind to the EcL11&#x02013;ScGAR complex at micromolar affinity. On the other hand, it does not apparently show significant affinity for the L12&#x02013;RNA complex and, consequently, it is unable to inhibit the yeast ribosome. Visual inspection of thiostrepton bound to the three protein&#x02013;RNA complexes indicates that while both the EcL11&#x02013;EcGAR and EcL11&#x02013; ScGAR complex share a similar set of interactions, the L12&#x02013;RNA complex lacks a number of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Significantly, in addition to the alteration at the important nucleotide at position 1067, the absence of the residues Pro21 and Pro22, mutated in both cases to Ala in L12, reduces the hydrophobic contact surface between the protein and the thiostrepton thiazolyl rings. This, together with the more open and polar site seen in L12 can help to explain the observed affinity differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm773_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm773_nar-01761-r-2007-File007.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was funded by Ministerio de Educaci&#x000f3;n y Ciencia, Spain (BFU2006-00365 to J.P.G.B., GEN2003-206420-C09-08 and BIO2005-0576 to A.R.O.); Fundaci&#x000f3;n Ram&#x000f3;n Areces (institucional grant to CBMSO).
