Although the genetic and environmental factors that lead to the initiation of breast cancer remain unclear, it is known that exposure to estrogens plays a crucial role in the development and progression of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It has been proposed that the causative link between estrogen and breast cancer is due to its potent mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, it is not fully understood how these effects are mediated at the molecular level. Such insight may provide clues to the mechanisms of estrogen-induced mitogenesis and cell survival, or resistance to endocrine therapies, or identify potential novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer, particularly in the settings of endocrine insensitivity and resistance. Thus, the identification and characterization of estrogen target genes is a major research priority.</p><p>The majority of breast cancers (about 75%) are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, and estrogen is a potent mitogen for human breast cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. The proliferation of ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells in culture is inhibited by antiestrogens, and this effect is reversed by estrogen. Estrogen and antiestrogens regulate cell cycle entry and rates of progression during early G<sub>1 </sub>phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and this is effected by modulation of G<sub>1 </sub>cyclin gene expression and activation of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, there is now evidence of converging activation of downstream estrogen signaling through crosstalk with growth factor-activated tyrosine kinase receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, there are compelling data suggesting that estrogen can mediate its growth effects by influencing the expression and function of genes critical to cell proliferation, by both 'genomic' and 'nongenomic' (cytoplasmic signaling) mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>One of the earliest transcriptional responses to estrogen is increased <italic>MYC </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Myc is a nuclear transcription factor that exhibits high-affinity and site-specific DNA-binding activity when complexed with its cellular partner Max, and it is rate-limiting for cell cycle progression through G<sub>1 </sub>phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], mediated in part through its effects on activation of cyclin-dependent kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Inhibition of c-Myc expression abrogates estrogen-stimulated breast cancer cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and blocks cell cycle progression leading to a G<sub>1 </sub>arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Estrogen-regulated induction of <italic>MYC </italic>may play a critical role in the initiation of breast tumorigenesis, because <italic>MYC </italic>was the first mammary oncogene to be demonstrated by transgenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These data strongly implicate c-Myc as an important mediator of the mitogenic function of estrogen, with a potential role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. This concept is supported by studies demonstrating that Myc over-expression confers resistance to antiestrogens <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and that inducible expression of c-Myc can replace estrogen in reinitiating cell cycle progression in antiestrogen-arrested breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Because c-Myc can mimic the effects of estrogen on cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we examined the transcriptional response to estrogen and to inducible c-Myc to identify novel targets of both estrogen and c-Myc in breast cancer cells (Musgrove EA, Sergio CM, Butt AJ, Sutherland RL; unpublished data). Here, we report an initial characterization of one such gene, namely HBV pre-S2 trans-regulated protein 3 (<italic>HSPC111</italic>). These studies reveal that <italic>HSPC111 </italic>is a direct transcriptional target of Myc, which is localized in the nucleolus and is over-expressed in several common cancers. Furthermore, elevated expression of HSPC111 is associated with reduced survival in breast cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Breast cancer cell lines and tissue samples</title><p>The human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, was routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin and 2.92 mg/ml glutamine under standard conditions.

To determine whether c-Myc was able to bind to any of these putative E-boxes, a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using double-stranded, radiolabeled oligonucleotides that encompass each of these sites or a known Myc consensus site from the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-aspartate transcarbamylase-dihydroorotase (CAD) promoter.

HSPC111 has been identified as a nucleolar protein of undefined function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We examined this more closely in parental MCF-7 cells and those expressing V5-tagged HSPC111 by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies against endogenous HSPC111 protein and the V5 tag. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> demonstrates prominent immunoreactivity of both endogenous and tagged HSPC111 in the nucleolus. Markers of different functional components of the nucleolus were used to define further its subnucleolar localization and hence provide insight into its possible function. The granular region of the nucleolus contains maturing ribosomes and can be identified by immunostaining with nucleophosmin (NPM)/B23, which is an abundant nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in mediating pre-rRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> shows no colocalization of HSPC111 and NPM/B23 within the nucleolus, indicating that HSPC111 is not present in the granular region and that HSPC111 and NPM/B23 probably reside within distinct protein complexes. Antibodies against fibrillarin were then used to label the dense fibrillar components, the site of newly synthesized preribosomal RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Dual staining for fibrillarin and HSPC111 expression again demonstrated that each protein resided in distinct compartments of the nucleolus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>), which suggests that HSPC111 is not localized in the dense fibrillar component.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>HSPC111 resides in high molecular weight protein complexes in the nucleolus. <bold>(a) </bold>Detection of endogenous and tagged HSPC111 by indirect immunofluorescence.

Nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells were subjected to sucrose density gradient fractionation to separate various nucleoprotein complexes, and then immunoblotted for HSPC111 expression. A significant proportion of HSPC111 was found in fractions of the gradient that also contained the 30S and 50S pre-preribosomal particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In contrast, fibrillarin was present in both the low molecular weight fractions at the top of the gradient and at the bottom of the gradient, near the 80S pre-preribosomal particle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Following treatment with RNaseA to disrupt ribonucleoprotein particles, the sedimentation of both HSPC111 and fibrillarin predominantly shifted toward the top of the gradient (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). The loss of pre-ribosomal peaks confirmed the disruption of ribonucleoprotein particles.

Thus, the acute transcriptional regulation of HSPC111 by Myc may represent part of a coordinated stimulation of ribosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], occurring concurrently with its stimulation of cell proliferation. However, whether HSPC111 has a role in the ribosomal biosynthesis pathway is not clear from these studies and requires further investigation.</p><p>Recent studies have emphasized an important link between nucleolar function, in particular ribosomal biogenesis, and cell cycle control, and several genes coordinately regulate both processes. For example, disruption of the nucleolar PeBoW complex, consisting of Pes1, Bop1 and WDR12, blocks both rRNA processing and cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Given the proliferative role of Myc in our model and our data suggesting HSPC111 interacts with RNA in the nucleolus, we questioned whether HSPC111 might play a role in Myc's effects on cell cycle progression. However, modulation of HSPC111 expression had no effect on cell proliferation end-points. We detected no effect of constitutive HSPC111 expression on proliferation, and although it is possible that the level of over-expression achieved was not sufficient for a detectable increase in proliferation rate, HSPC111 expression was not required for cell cycle progression, and neither was its downregulation required for antiestrogen inhibition of proliferation. These data are supported by Schlosser and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], who identified <italic>HSPC111 </italic>as a Myc target gene in the human B-cell line P493-6 under conditions in which Myc induces cell growth but not cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, they suggested that, even if HSPC111 does play a role in rRNA synthesis, there is either an element of functional redundancy in its role or it is not rate-limiting for cell cycle progression. Indeed, although adequate cell growth is essential for proliferation, it is not sufficient, requiring additional proliferative signals for cell cycle progression to proceed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. These data emphasize the complexity of the Myc phenotype, even within the relative restrictions of our model system, and support the concept that the coordinated regulation of multiple effector genes is required to recapitulate Myc functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>To address further a potential role of HSPC111 in cancer, we initially identified a strong positive correlation between <italic>MYC </italic>mRNA and both HSPC111 mRNA and protein in breast cancer cell lines, raising the possibility that HSPC111 expression might be a useful surrogate marker of Myc over-expression in breast cancer. However, the relationship at the mRNA level was less robust in primary breast cancer (r<sup>2 </sup>= 0.19 versus 0.60 for primary cancer versus cell lines). An extension of this analysis to published datasets from a number of other cancers identified that elevated expression of HSPC111 was a feature of several cancers including those of the breast, prostate, ovary, testis, liver, colon, and pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], but this was not always associated with <italic>MYC </italic>over-expression. Thus, HSPC111 over-expression appears to be a common feature of many cancers but its relationship to aberrant Myc function, which is only contributed in part by <italic>MYC </italic>mRNA levels, remains to be elucidated. More importantly, HSPC111 over-expression was a strong predictor of an adverse outcome in two cohorts of breast cancer patients on univariate analysis and remained significant in a multivariate model in the Uppsala cohort. These effects were independent of <italic>MYC </italic>mRNA over-expression, which is in support of our conclusions from other cancers. Whether HSPC111 over-expression is functionally associated with disease progression remains an open question. The data presented here failed to support a role in cell proliferation or endocrine sensitivity, but other aspects of the biology of tumor progression require further investigation. It is well established that aberrant cell growth (increased/dysregulated ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis) are common features of cancer. Because our preliminary data point to nucleolar localization of HSPC111 in association with ribonucleoproteins, it may be either functionally associated with these processes or a marker of aberrant cell growth regulation in general. In any event, further investigation of the normal physiological role of HSPC111 in nucleolar function and the functional consequences of overexpression on cellular growth control are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have identified <italic>HSPC111 </italic>as an estrogen-responsive, Myc target gene in breast cancer cells. Although the precise function of HSPC111 remains unclear from our studies, its over-expression is common in a number of cancer cell types, and its association with poor outcome in breast cancer cohorts warrants its further analysis as an effector of estrogen and Myc action in both normal and neoplastic growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>bp = base pairs; CAD = carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-aspartate transcarbamylase-dihydroorotase; ChIP = chromatin immunoprecipitation; CI = confidence interval; ER = estrogen receptor; GAPDH = glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; NKI = Nederlands Kanker Instituut; NPM = nucleophosmin; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; si = small interfering.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AJB, RLS, and EAM conceived the study, participated in its design, coordination and interpretation, and drafted the manuscript.
