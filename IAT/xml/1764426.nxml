Successful RCC tumor suppression by VHL requires the negative regulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF alpha) protein and its downstream targets. Thus, identification of HIF target genes responsible for RCC tumor progression will aid in the development of therapies for this disease. We previously identified membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) as a transcriptional target of HIF-2alpha in RCC cells null for VHL and showed that MT1-MMP is overexpressed in these cells. MT1-MMP is a key regulator of tumor progression through its functions as a matrix-degrading enzyme, as well as its ability to cleave factors, such as adhesion molecules and other MMPs. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of MT1-MMP to the invasive potential of RCC cells using <italic>in vitro </italic>type I collagen degradation and invasion assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We evaluated RCC cells wild-type (WT8) and null (pRc-9) for VHL for invasive characteristics and showed that the pRc-9 cells demonstrated a greater propensity for both invasion and degradation of a type I collagen matrix. Furthermore, overexpression of either HIF-2alpha or MT1-MMP in the poorly invasive cell line, WT8, promoted collagen degradation and invasion of these cells. Finally, using RNAi, we show that inhibition of MT1-MMP suppresses tumor cell invasion of RCC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that MT1-MMP is a major mediator of tumor cell invasiveness and type I collagen degradation by VHL RCC cells that express either MT1-MMP or HIF-2alpha. As such, MT1-MMP may represent a novel target for anti-invasion therapy for this disease.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Kidney cancer represents ~3% of cancer deaths worldwide and is the most deadly of the common urological diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. While combined nephrectomy and immunotherapy are standard care for localized primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumors, approximately 30% of these treated patients will eventually develop metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Additionally, one third of patients present with metastatic disease at time of diagnosis of the RCC primary tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Treatment of metastatic RCC remains difficult primarily due to the resistance of the tumors to adjuvant and immunotherapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. With the median survival of metastatic RCC patients being less than one year, investigation into more effective anti-metastatic therapies is clearly warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Renal cell carcinoma is classified into four histological subtypes, including clear cell, papillary, chromophobe, and collecting duct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Almost 80% of sporadic RCC is of the clear cell subtype and results from inactivation of the tumor suppressor, von Hippel Lindau (VHL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Loss of VHL function also manifests itself as a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome, impacting several organ systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Life expectancy is greatly reduced for ~40% of VHL patients who develop RCC, most commonly due to complications from metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The most well-characterized function of VHL is in controlling the oxygen-sensing mechanism of the cell through its regulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunits (1&#x003b1;,-2&#x003b1;,-3&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. HIF is a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of two subunits, HIF-&#x003b1; and HIF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While the &#x003b2;-subunit of HIF is constitutively expressed, the HIF-&#x003b1; protein is labile and detectable only under hypoxic conditions or when VHL is inactivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Under normoxic conditions, VHL negatively regulates the levels HIF-&#x003b1; subunit through ubiquitin-targeted protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, inactivation of VHL in RCC is associated with increased levels of HIF-&#x003b1; isoforms and a subsequent increase in hypoxia-inducible genes, such as those involved in angiogenesis (VEGF, PDGF), erythropoiesis (EPO), glycolysis (Glut1), cell growth and survival (Cyclin G2, TGF-&#x003b1;), and cell migration (CXCR4), suggesting that the genes upregulated by the VHL-HIF pathway are involved in the progression of renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Although the majority of VHL mutations abrogate the regulation of HIF-&#x003b1; protein, a few mutations exist that retain the ability for VHL to regulate HIF-&#x003b1;, and these mutations are not associated with the formation of RCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In fact, expression of such a VHL mutant, which retains the ability to negatively regulate HIF-2&#x003b1;, suppresses tumor formation of VHL null RCC cells <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These results demonstrate that successful tumor suppression in renal cells depends on the proper regulation of HIF-2&#x003b1; rather than on the presence of VHL. Further evidence suggests that HIF-2&#x003b1;, rather than HIF-1&#x003b1;, is the VHL target responsible for tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Indeed, inhibition of HIF-2&#x003b1; is required for tumor suppression by VHL in RCC <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These findings illustrate the importance of understanding the various roles that HIF-2&#x003b1; targets play in renal cell tumorigenesis.</p><p>Previously, we identified membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) as a target gene of HIF-2&#x003b1; in RCC cells mutant for VHL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. MT1-MMP is a membrane bound member of the family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases known as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which function in remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Due to their vast repertoire of substrates and functions in normal cellular processes, MMPs are strictly regulated to guarantee appropriate, homeostatic proteolytic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Elevated levels of MMPs have been linked to the invasive behavior of most human cancers as well as to other characteristics of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition to pericellular proteolysis of type I collagen, MT1-MMP is known to control cell-ECM contacts, localize to the leading edge of invasive cells, cleave adhesion molecules, and activate latent MMP-2 and MMP-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As a result, MT1-MMP plays multiple roles in tumorigenesis, including tumor invasion, regulation of tumor cell growth, cell migration, and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Our previous data suggest that the loss of the VHL tumor suppressor, and subsequent stability of HIF-2&#x003b1;, leads to the induction of MT1-MMP expression in RCC. Interestingly, MT1-MMP expression has been linked to advanced stages of RCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Given the important role of MT1-MMP in the progression of other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we hypothesized that as a HIF-2&#x003b1; target, MT1-MMP may play a role in the progression of VHL-/- RCC tumor invasion to metastatic disease. A metastatic tumor cell must invade through two main extracellular matrix barriers: interstitial collagen in the stromal environment (comprised mainly of type I collagen) and basement membrane (comprised primarily of type IV collagen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Koochekpour <italic>et al</italic>. showed <italic>in vitro </italic>that VHL-/- RCC cell invasion of type IV collagen is enhanced by the addition of neutralizing antibodies to TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases), the natural inhibitors of MMP activity, thereby implicating a role of MMPs in this invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These authors also showed that VHL mutant RCC cells overexpress the gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9, which function to degrade type IV collagen found in basement membrane. In our previous studies, we reported that MT1-MMP is the main type I collagenolytic enzyme expressed by VHL null RCC cells, suggesting that this enzyme may mediate RCC invasion of type I collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, in this report, we specifically investigated the role of MT1-MMP in VHL RCC tumor cell invasion using <italic>in vitro </italic>assays to measure the ability of the cells to degrade type I collagen and to invade through a type I collagen matrix. Using gene overexpression studies and RNAi, our data directly link HIF-2&#x003b1; and MT1-MMP expression to an invasive phenotype of RCC cells, and targeted inhibition of MT1-MMP is required to block this invasion. We conclude that MT1-MMP is the primary mediator of both tumor cell invasion and degradation of type I collagen in these RCC cells and may represent an effective target for the treatment of invasive renal cell carcinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>VHL expression inhibits invasive properties of RCC cells</title><p>In previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we used human RCC cells derived from a VHL null parental cell line (786-0), which was stably transfected with the pRc/CMV vector expressing a wild-type copy of VHL (WT8) or with the vector alone (pRc-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Notably, these cells only express HIF-2&#x003b1; and do not express the HIF-1&#x003b1; isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We determined that the lack of VHL tumor suppressor activity stabilized HIF-2&#x003b1; protein and increased MT1-MMP expression through direct transcriptional transactivation by HIF-2&#x003b1; (summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These data provide a link between the loss of VHL function and the overexpression of an enzyme responsible for pericellular proteolysis of type I collagen and the activation of pro-MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition, our studies showed that MT1-MMP is the primary type I collagenolytic enzyme expressed by the VHL null cells. MMP-2 and MMP-9, which degrade type IV collagen in basement membrane, are also upregulated in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Since metastatic tumor cells must invade through both interstitial collagen in the stromal environment and basement membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], we hypothesize that MT1-MMP may contribute to the invasiveness of renal cell carcinoma in the context of VHL inactivation by mediating type I collagen invasion.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Renal cell carcinoma cell lines</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Designation</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Transfectant</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>VHL status</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>HIF-2&#x003b1; protein</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>MT1-MMP levels*</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">786-0</td><td align="center">none</td><td align="center">null</td><td align="center">stable</td><td align="center">+++</td></tr><tr><td align="center">WT8</td><td align="center">pRc/CMV-VHL</td><td align="center">wild-type</td><td align="center">not detectable</td><td align="center">+</td></tr><tr><td align="center">pRc-9</td><td align="center">pRc/CMV-empty</td><td align="center">null</td><td align="center">stable</td><td align="center">+++</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* Petrella, et al. 2005</p><p>"+" and "+++" indicate relative mRNA expression levels between cell lines</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>To begin our investigations, we characterized the WT8 and pRc-9 cells for differences in tumor cell invasion and matrix degradation that would suggest a role for MT1-MMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We first compared the ability of the WT8 and pRc-9 cells to invade through a type I collagen matrix using a Transwell<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>insert assay system. Neither cell line invaded towards serum-free media. However, the pRc-9 cells, mutant for VHL, invaded approximately twice as effectively towards a serum chemoattractant when compared to the WT8 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). These data suggest that VHL expression suppresses tumor cell invasion through type I collagen. In similar <italic>in vitro </italic>invasion assays using Matrigel or type IV collagen, RCC cells mutant for VHL were also shown to be more invasive than RCC cells expressing wild-type VHL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of VHL inhibits collagen invasion and degradation</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

The lower chambers contained either serum-free DMEM as a negative control or DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. At time of harvest, the non-invaded cells and collagen matrix on top of the membranes were removed, and invaded cells on the bottoms of the membranes were stained with methylene blue. A representative picture is shown of cells invading towards serum-free versus serum-containing media. Cells were counted from 3 fields per sample at 100&#x000d7; and averaged.

To ask whether the observed increase in cell invasion by the pRc-9 cells involves increased matrix degradation, we measured the ability of these cells to degrade a type I collagen matrix using an <italic>in vitro </italic>collagen degradation assay. This assay is based upon the fact that when a fibrillar collagen gel is degraded by cells embedded in it, culture medium is liberated. This medium can be recovered and weighed, and the amount of medium liberated provides a simple, but accurate, measure of matrix destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Indeed, we found that collagen degradation was increased by approximately 25% (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.005) in the VHL null cell line, pRc-9, as compared to the WT8 cells expressing wild-type VHL, indicating that the lack of VHL function promotes type I collagen degradation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). A similar increase in collagen degradation was observed in the VHL null 786-0 parental line (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of HIF-2&#x003b1; or MT1-MMP is sufficient to increase the invasive potential of RCC cells wild-type for VHL</title><p>Although the most well-described function of VHL is the negative regulation of HIF-&#x003b1; isoforms, VHL has many HIF-independent functions as well, including assembly of actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], fibronectin matrix assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], regulation of PKC isotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and endocytosis of FGFR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Each of these VHL functions has been implicated in either RCC cell migration (cell movement in the absence of matrix) or invasion (cell movement through a matrix). To test whether the increased invasion and degradation of type I collagen observed in VHL null cells was due to the overexpression of HIF-2&#x003b1; target genes or to the loss of HIF-independent functions of VHL, we overexpressed HIF-2&#x003b1; in the context of wild-type VHL. Previously, we showed that transient overexpression of pCMV-HIF-2&#x003b1; in the WT8 cells was sufficient to drive transcription of a reporter construct containing HIF binding sites even in the presence of wild-type VHL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, we introduced a pCMV-HIF-2&#x003b1; expression construct into the WT8 cells by transient transfection and measured the ability of these transfectants to degrade a collagen matrix. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, overexpression of HIF-2&#x003b1; in the WT8 cells increased collagen degradation of these cells by ~30% (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001), similar to the difference in collagen destruction between the WT8 and the pRc-9 cells (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These results indicate that HIF-2&#x003b1; expression is sufficient to increase the collagen-degrading ability of cells that are wild-type for VHL, thereby suggesting that the increased invasion and matrix degradation measured in the pRc-9 cells may be due to aberrant expression of a HIF target gene(s) rather than the dysregulation of other VHL targets. These data support our hypothesis that as a target of HIF-2, MT1-MMP may contribute to VHL RCC tumor cell invasion.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of HIF-2&#x003b1; or MT1-MMP in WT8 cells increases matrix degradation and invasion</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

These data indicate that MT1-MMP may be the HIF target gene responsible for the increased collagen degradation by the VHL mutant cells since, to our knowledge, no other HIF target with the ability to cleave type I collagen has been identified in these cells.</p><p>Next, we tested whether MT1-MMP expression was sufficient to promote collagen invasion of the WT8 cells by transient expression of the MTpc3SE construct in these cells and measured the ability of the transfectants to invade through a type I collagen matrix using the assay system as described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

Importantly, the difference in invasiveness between the WT8 transfectants mimics the difference in collagen invasion observed between the WT8 and pRc-9 cells (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Together with our previous finding that MT1-MMP expression is regulated by HIF-2&#x003b1; in VHL null cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], our data suggest that one mechanism by which VHL may inhibit tumor invasion is by suppressing MT1-MMP expression through the negative regulation of HIF-2&#x003b1; protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of MT1-MMP is necessary to decrease invasive properties of RCC cells expressing MT1-MMP or HIF-2&#x003b1;</title><p>To extend these findings, we asked if MT1-MMP was necessary for VHL RCC cell invasion of collagen using RNAi to specifically inhibit MT1-MMP expression. We could not use the pRc-9 cell line for these experiments due to the sensitivity of these cells to transfection and subsequent manipulations. Although expression of MT1-MMP was effectively reduced by three different targeting siRNAs in the pRc-9 cells (data not shown), once transfected, the cells did not survive trypsinization and culturing on top of collagen for use in the invasion assays.</p><p>Alternatively, we performed the siRNA experiments using the WT8 cells transfected to express either MT1-MMP or HIF-2&#x003b1; in order to mimic the ability of the pRc-9 cells to degrade collagen (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, 2C</xref>). Specifically, we co-transfected the WT8 cells with MTpc3SE and one of three specific MT1-MMP siRNAs or a non-specific control siRNA and measured MT1-MMP mediated collagen invasion.

Specifically, MT1-MMP, TIMP-2 and pro-MMP-2 exist in a trimolecular complex at the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. When MT1-MMP levels are in excess of TIMP-2 and pro-MMP-2, a free MT1-MMP molecule cleaves the propeptide sequence of pro-MMP-2 (72 kDa), thereby generating the intermediate (69 kDa) form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Fully active (67 kDa) MMP-2 is achieved by either intermolecular autolytic cleavage or by the activity of other enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. WT8 cells express low levels of MMP-2 as well as TIMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. To confirm that the reduction in MT1-MMP protein by siRNA was reflected in an inhibition of MT1-MMP enzyme activity, we measured the presence of pro, intermediate, and active forms of MMP-2 in the conditioned media collected from the transfectants using gelatin zymography. Expression of MTpc3SE in the WT8 cells resulted in the presence of the intermediate and active forms of MMP-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Inhibition of MT1-MMP activity by each MT1-MMP siRNA was demonstrated by the absence of the MMP-2 intermediate and active species in these samples as compared to the media from the siRNA control transfectants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The only other MMPs constitutively expressed by these cells in addition to MT1-MMP are MMP-2 and MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to note that the MT1-MMP siRNAs have no effect on the expression levels of MMP-2 or MMP-9 as seen by the unchanged levels of the bands representing these proteins in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, confirming the specificity of these siRNAs against MT1-MMP.</p><p>Next, the ability of the siRNA transfectants to invade through a type I collagen matrix was measured using a similar <italic>in vitro </italic>invasion assay system described in the previous Figures. For these invasion assays, we used type I collagen-coated FluoroBlok&#x02122; membrane transwell inserts. FluoroBlok&#x02122; membranes block the transmission of light; therefore, non-invasive cells are not detectable, whereas invasive, pCMV-eGFP transfected cells can be counted by fluorescence imaging. By only visualizing GFP-expressing cells that have invaded, we could specifically quantitate the number of transfected cells that had invaded collagen while discounting the non-transfected cells. As before (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), WT8 cells expressing exogenous MT1-MMP displayed increased collagen invasion (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.005; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Co-transfection of the control siRNA oligo had no significant effect on this increased invasion by MT1-MMP, whereas each of the three specific MT1-MMP siRNA oligos inhibited collagen invasion of the MT1-MMP transfectants by greater than 85% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that MT1-MMP is important for tumor cell invasion by RCC cells.</p><p>We previously identified MT1-MMP as a target of HIF-2&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and our current data show that expression of HIF-2&#x003b1; in a wild-type VHL background induces the ability of the RCC cells to degrade type I collagen (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Together these results suggest that the increase in collagen destruction mediated by HIF-2&#x003b1; overexpression in the WT8 cells is due to the induction of MT1-MMP expression. To test this hypothesis, we transfected the WT8 cells with pCMV-HIF-2&#x003b1; and either the control siRNA oligo or one of the three MT1-MMP siRNAs. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, MT1-MMP protein levels were reduced by the target siRNAs in the HIF-2&#x003b1; transfectants by at least 50%. To ensure that the inhibition of MT1-MMP expression by the siRNAs was not due to non-specific effects of the siRNAs on HIF-2&#x003b1; protein levels, we measured HIF-2&#x003b1; protein in the transfectants. The WT8 cells do not endogenously express detectable levels of HIF-2&#x003b1; protein due to the presence of VHL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] as shown in the empty vector control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>); however, HIF-2&#x003b1; protein is detectable in these cells upon transfection of CMV-HIF-2&#x003b1;, and the MT1-MMP siRNAs had no effect on HIF-2&#x003b1; protein. Next, we employed the FluoroBlok&#x02122; invasion assay system described for Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> to measure the ability of these transfectants to invade type I collagen. Inhibition of MT1-MMP blocked HIF-2&#x003b1; mediated invasion of these RCC cells by &#x0003e;90% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). To our knowledge, the only other HIF-2&#x003b1; target gene identified in playing a role in RCC tumor cell migration and invasion is the chemokine receptor, CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. No effect of the MT1-MMP siRNAs on the expression of CXCR4 was detected in the HIF-2&#x003b1; transfectants (data not shown); thus, HIF-2&#x003b1; mediated cell invasion is blocked by specific inhibition of MT1-MMP. Together, these data imply that MT1-MMP is the HIF-2&#x003b1; target gene responsible for the increased tumor cell invasion observed in VHL mutant RCC cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Specific inhibition of MT1-MMP blocks HIF-2&#x003b1; mediated RCC tumor cell invasion</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Consequently, downstream targets of HIF, such as MT1-MMP, are constitutively transcribed, and activation of these targets causes RCC tumor formation in xenograph models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Defining the HIF-2 targets responsible for VHL null RCC tumor progression is important to understand the mechanisms of renal tumor development. It is not yet known whether elevated expression of MT1-MMP contributes to RCC tumorigenesis or progression to metastatic disease.</p><p>When compared to several of the secreted MMPs, MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP are the only MMPs able to confer collagen invasive capabilities to non-invasive cells, thereby suggesting that pericellular proteolysis is critical for tumor cell migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Furthermore, specific inhibition of MT1-MMP in tumor cells overexpressing MT1-MMP is sufficient to suppress tumor cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Recently, the importance of MT1-MMP in cancer progression has been demonstrated by the finding that overexpression of MT1-MMP in non-malignant cells was sufficient to drive tumorigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In keeping with these findings, we previously described a mechanism of MT1-MMP transcriptional upregulation in VHL mutant RCC cells and hypothesized that MT1-MMP may play a role in the invasion of renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Here, we provide evidence supporting the importance of MT1-MMP in the invasive properties of RCC cells. First, our data show that RCC cells null for VHL (pRc-9) have a greater propensity for collagen degradation and invasion than RCC cells wild-type for VHL (WT8), suggesting that the pRc-9 cells have increased invasive potential (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Further, overexpression of HIF-2&#x003b1; or MT1-MMP was sufficient to confer increased degradative and invasive abilities to the WT8 cells in type I collagen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Finally, inhibition of collagen invasion by WT8 cells transfected to express either MT1-MMP or HIF-2&#x003b1; required specific inhibition of MT1-MMP expression (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Importantly, collagen invasion of the HIF-2&#x003b1; transfectants was almost completely abrogated (&#x0003e;90%) by the MT1-MMP siRNAs, suggesting that MT1-MMP is the HIF-2&#x003b1; target primarily responsible for collagen invasion by these cells.</p><p>The process of matrix invasion by a tumor cell requires both degradation of ECM components as well as cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the pRc-9 cells, migration may result from the lack of VHL, which regulates migration through various mechanisms, including the regulation of actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], integrin fibrillar adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], and endocytosis of FGFR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. By performing siRNA experiments in a wild-type VHL background, we determined that invasion of the RCC cells was dependent on MT1-MMP rather than on the dysregulation of other VHL targets, suggesting that MT1-MMP may be responsible for RCC tumor invasion in the stromal compartment.</p><p>Our siRNA studies showed that inhibition of MT1-MMP expression prevented the activation of pro-MMP-2 as a measure of functional inhibition of MT1-MMP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Thus, it is plausible that MT1-MMP may also contribute to RCC invasion of basement membrane through its regulation of pro-MMP-2 activation since MMP-2 degrades type IV collagen, the main component of basement membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Interestingly, expression MMP-2 has been correlated with advanced stages of RCC, and MMP-2 activity, along with histological grade, stage, and T classification, has been identified as a significant predictor of RCC clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p><p>Since the expression of the MT1-MMP siRNAs inhibited the activation of pro-MMP-2 by MT1-MMP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), our data does not exclude the possibility that MMP-2 activity may be required for type I collagen invasion by these RCC cells. However, this situation seems unlikely. Although MMP-2 has been shown to cleave fibrillar type I collagen, its ability to do so is less effective than known collagenases and requires a cell-free, TIMP-free system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>], which was not the condition under which we performed our experiments. In particular, the WT8 cells used in the siRNA studies (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) express TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]; thus, MMP-2 may not cleave fibrillar type I collagen under our experimental conditions. Further, the intermediate form of MMP-2, a species generated only when MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 are present at specific ratios, is predominant in these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Thus, it is unlikely that in our system, MMP-2 is playing a substantial role in the type I collagen invasion by these cells. Nonetheless, since MMP-2 activity is dependent on MT1-MMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], we conclude from our data that MT1-MMP is required for type I collagen invasion by these RCC cells. Thus, we posit that MT1-MMP may initiate local invasion by RCC tumors by promoting both cell migration and invasion through cleavage of adhesion molecules, such as CD44 and integrins, pro-MMP-2, and by pericellular proteolysis of type I collagen fibrils in the stromal environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Supporting this hypothesis, MT1-MMP mRNA expression is increased in invasive RCC tumors when compared to tumors that remain localized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Our experiments using HIF-2&#x003b1; expression in the WT8 cells demonstrate that HIF-2&#x003b1; increased type I collagen invasion despite the presence of wild-type VHL, and this increased invasion was dependent on MT1-MMP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Kurban <italic>et al</italic>. recently showed that HIF-2&#x003b1; expression in a VHL wild-type background does not promote invasion of Matrigel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], a reconstituted basement membrane mainly comprised of type IV collagen and laminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. The authors concluded from their studies that invasion by VHL mutant cells is mediated via a HIF-independent mechanism, namely, by the loss of ECM assembly. In their Matrigel invasion assays, Kurban <italic>et al</italic>. used the RCC cell line, WTPA, which stably expresses a HIF-2&#x003b1; variant that is not degraded by VHL in a VHL wild-type background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In their study, WTPA cells did not invade Matrigel as effectively as VHL mutant cells. Importantly, the authors showed that the more invasive cell lines expressed MMP-2, whereas WTPA cells did not. In our previous studies, we showed that pRc-9 and WTPA cells have stabilized HIF-2&#x003b1; protein and high levels of MT1-MMP when compared to WT8 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Like Kurban <italic>et al</italic>., we found that MMP-2 expression in WTPA cells was similar to WT8 cells and much lower than pRc-9 cells (data not shown), suggesting that the mechanism of MMP-2 overexpression in pRc-9 cells may not be HIF-2&#x003b1; dependent. Furthermore, invasion of Matrigel likely requires MMP-2 gelatinolytic activity through the degradation of type IV collagen, whereas type I collagen invasion, as in our assays, may not require MMP-2 activity. Taken together, we conclude that while RCC cell invasion of Matrigel may be HIF-independent, HIF-2&#x003b1; mediates type I collagen of RCC cells through the regulation of MT1-MMP.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Metastatic renal cell carcinoma remains difficult to treat.

The target siRNA sequences are as follows: <italic>siRNA(1)</italic>: 5'-AAUUUGCCAUCCUUCCUCUCGUAGG-3'; <italic>siRNA(2)</italic>: 5'-AAGAGAGCAGCAUCAAUCUUGUCGG-3'; <italic>siRNA(3)</italic>: 5'-AAUGAUGAUCACCUCCGUCUCCUCC-3'. WT8 cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well as described under 'Transient transfections'. The following day, cells were transfected with 0.5 &#x003bc;g of pCMV-eGFP, 1 &#x003bc;g MTpc3SE or pCMV-HIF-2&#x003b1;, and 25 nM of either the control siRNA or one of the MT1-MMP target siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000&#x02122; Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions for co-transfection of plasmid DNA and siRNA oligos. Cells were transfected in the presence of serum for 24 hours before being washed three times with HBSS and switched to serum-free conditions for an additional 24 hours. Transfection efficiency was determined by GFP expression as described above before the cells were harvested for either protein expression or the collagen invasion assay as described under 'Fluoroblok&#x02122; invasion assay'. The average transfection efficiency was approximately 50% in all experiments. An empty vector control (pRc/CMV) was used to balance the amount of plasmid DNA in co-transfections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. All transfections were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Total cellular RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit with on-column DNase I treatment (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription and real-time PCR reactions were performed using the Taqman Reverse Transcription Reagent Kit and Syber Green Master Mix, respectively, following the manufacturer's protocol and as described previously (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. For each experiment, triplicate samples were obtained, and the cDNA for each was assayed in duplicate using a MJ Research DNA Engine Opticon thermal cycler. Data are presented as the average pg of MT1-MMP mRNA per ng of GFP mRNA and are representative of three or more experiments. Standard curves were included in each assay. Standards were prepared from serial log dilutions of plasmids carrying the appropriate cDNA as follows: MTpc3SE plasmid, 10 pg-0.001 pg; pCMV-eGFP plasmid, 1 ng-0.001 ng. Primer sequences are as previously published for MT1-MMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and for eGFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>ELISA</title><p>The Matrix Metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14) Biotrak Activity Assay System (GE Healthcare BioSciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ), a quantitative measure of MT1-MMP activity as a direct measure of MT1-MMP protein, was used to analyze MT1-MMP protein expression. The assay was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. A standard curve ranging from [0.125 ng/mL] to [8 ng/mL] was used to quantitate protein expression. Because the assay is colorimetric and does not require quenching, absorbance readings were taken at 6 hr, 9 hr, and 12 hrs after incubation with the substrate. The data presented represent the concentration of MT1-MMP in the samples at the timepoint at which the sample values fit the standard curve most appropriately. Total protein from the extracts was quantitated using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and used to normalize the MT1-MMP protein concentration in each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting and antibodies</title><p>Whole cell lysates were harvested from transfection experiments by washing the cells twice with cold 1&#x000d7; PBS, adding 100 &#x003bc;L of SDS reducing buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 14.4 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), and boiling for 5 minutes. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline 0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature for 1&#x02013;2 hours. Primary antibodies, HIF-2&#x003b1; polyclonal antibody, 1:1000 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and actin monoclonal antibody, 1:5000 (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with the membranes at room temperature for 2 hours. Appropriate secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with the membrane at room temperature for 1 hour. Proteins were visualized by Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA).</p></sec><sec><title>Gelatin Zymography</title><p>Transfectants were cultured in serum-free media for 24 hours, and conditioned media was concentrated approximately 30 fold using BioMax 30 K NMWL membrane ultrafree filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as per manufacturer's instructions. An equal volume of non-reducing buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added to the concentrated media before being applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE gel impregnated with [2.8 mg/mL] gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed two times for 30 min in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 &#x003bc;M ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, plus 2.5% Triton X-100 followed by an overnight incubation at 37&#x000b0;C in the same buffer without Triton X-100. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and then destained in 20% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid. Activity was detected as transparent bands. Recombinant human pro-MMP-2 (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used as a control for gelatinolytic activity at [1 ng/&#x003bc;L]. Active MMP-2 was obtained by incubation with 20 &#x003bc;M 4-Aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 37&#x000b0;C for 45 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Collagen invasion assays</title><sec><title>Transwell<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>invasion assay</title><p>Cells were serum-starved overnight before being harvested for invasion assays. Transwell<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>inserts (Costar, 24 mm, Corning, NY) with 8.0 &#x003bc;m pore polycarbonate membranes were coated with 50 &#x003bc;L per cm<sup>2 </sup>growth area with type I collagen diluted to [1 mg/mL] in serum-free DMEM. Collagen was prepared from purified bovine type I collagen (Cohesion Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, collagen was neutralized to pH 7.4 with the addition of 10&#x000d7; PBS and 0.1 N NaOH. The collagen was allowed to gel on top of the membrane at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 hour. Next, either DMEM+10% FBS or serum-free DMEM was added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Cells were plated on top of the collagen layer at a density of 3.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per insert in serum-free media. Cells were allowed to invade for 4&#x02013;6 hours. At time of harvest, media in the upper chamber was removed, and the upper surface of the membranes was scraped with a cotton swab to remove the collagen gel and remaining cells. The membranes were rinsed with 1&#x000d7; PBS and then removed from the inserts using a scalpel. The membranes were then stained with methylene blue and destained with water. Stained cells were viewed using an Olympus 1 &#x000d7; 50 inverted phase contrast microscope at 100&#x000d7; and counted from 3 fields. Pictures were taken with an Olympus Q Color 3 camera.</p></sec><sec><title>FluoroBlok&#x02122; invasion assay</title><p>siRNA transfected cells were serum-starved for 24 hours before being harvested for the invasion assay. HTS FluoroBlok&#x02122; inserts (BD Falcon Labware, 6.5 mm, Franklin Lakes, NJ) contain fluorescence blocking PET track-etched membranes with 8.0 &#x003bc;m pores. This invasion system allowed for real-time viewing of cell invasion without the need to end the experiment and process the membranes. The FluoroBlok&#x02122; membrane prevents the transmission of light to cells on top of the membrane; thus, only invaded, GFP-expressing cells invaded through the collagen-coated membrane can be viewed. FluoroBlok&#x02122; membranes were coated with 90 &#x003bc;L per cm<sup>2 </sup>growth area with type I collagen diluted to [0.8 mg/mL] in serum-free DMEM. Collagen was prepared from purified bovine type I collagen (Organogenesis, Inc., Canton, MA) and neutralized to pH 7.4 with a buffer containing 9.8% 10&#x000d7; EMEM, [200 nM] L-Glutamine, 2% lactalbumin hydrosylate, 7.5% sodium bicarbonate. The collagen was allowed to gel on top of the membrane at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Next, DMEM+10% FBS was added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Cells were plated on top of the collagen layer at a density of 2.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells per insert in serum-free DMEM. Invaded cells were viewed by GFP fluorescence using excitation from a 100 W Mercury lamp on an Olympus 1 &#x000d7; 50 inverted phase contrast microscope. Cells were counted from entire membranes at 40&#x000d7;.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Collagen degradation assay</title><p>Cells were serum-starved for at least 8 hours before being harvested for the assay. Cells were embedded as a mixture of fibrillar collagen and media in a 12-well assay format. Collagen was prepared from purified bovine type I collagen (Cohesion Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, collagen was neutralized to pH 7.4 with the addition of 10&#x000d7; PBS and 0.1 N NaOH. Next, 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells were mixed with 132 &#x003bc;L of neutralized collagen, and serum-free media was added to bring the total volume to 635 &#x003bc;L per well. The final concentration of collagen in the mixture was [0.5 mg/mL]. The collagen was allowed to gel for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C after which 635 &#x003bc;L of serum-free media was added to the top of the gel. Assays were harvested at 48 hours, and the overlying media was removed and weighed. The specific gravity of serum-free media was determined to be 1 mg/mL. Therefore, collagen degradation is reported as the volume of liberated media calculated by the difference of the weight of total media removed and weight of the original volume added (635 &#x003bc;g or 635 &#x003bc;L).
