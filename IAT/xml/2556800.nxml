However, HbA1c only explains &#x0003c;25% of the variation in risk of developing complications. Because HbA1c does not correlate with glycemic variability when adjusted for mean blood glucose, we hypothesized that transient spikes of hyperglycemia may be an HbA1c&#x02013;independent risk factor for diabetic complications. We show that transient hyperglycemia induces long-lasting activating epigenetic changes in the promoter of the nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) subunit p65 in aortic endothelial cells both in vitro and in nondiabetic mice, which cause increased p65 gene expression. Both the epigenetic changes and the gene expression changes persist for at least 6 d of subsequent normal glycemia, as do NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;induced increases in monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expression. Hyperglycemia-induced epigenetic changes and increased p65 expression are prevented by reducing mitochondrial superoxide production or superoxide-induced &#x003b1;-oxoaldehydes. These results highlight the dramatic and long-lasting effects that short-term hyperglycemic spikes can have on vascular cells and suggest that transient spikes of hyperglycemia may be an HbA1c&#x02013;independent risk factor for diabetic complications.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; cChIP, carrier ChIP; CVD, cardiovascular disease; GLO1, glyoxalase 1; H3k4me1, histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation; H3K4me2, H3K4 dimethylation; H3K4me3, H3K4 trimethylation 4; HAEC, human aortic endothelial cell; HG, high glucose; HMT, histone methyltransferases; LCM, laser capture microdissection; LG, low glucose; MCP-1 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TSA, trichostatin A; TSS, transcription start site; UCP-1, uncoupling protein 1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1.</p></fn><fn><p>D.

Hyperglycemia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) initiate the complex series of molecular events that result in diabetic tissue damage, and transgenic expression of superoxide dismutase prevents diabetic complications in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Consistent with this, multiple variations in SOD1 are significantly associated with persistent microalbuminuria and severe nephropathy in patients with Type 1 diabetes from the DCCT/EDIC (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Diabetes is also a major independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients with type 2 and type 1 diabetes both have a two- to fourfold higher risk of CVD compared with those without diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), and subjects with impaired glucose tolerance have a CVD risk almost as high as that seen in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>In the DCCT/EDIC study, reduction of time-averaged mean levels of glycemia, measured as HbA1c, decreased the risk of sustained retinopathy progression, the primary DCCT outcome, by 73%. However, for the entire study group, HbA1c only explained &#x0003c;25% of the variation in risk of developing this complication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Because chronic hyperglycemia has been shown to cause increased acetylation of various histone lysine residues, a general epigenetic marker associated with increased gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), we hypothesized that transient exposure to hyperglycemia would cause persistent increases in proatherogenic gene expression during subsequent periods of normal glycemia because of specific long-lasting epigenetic changes induced by ROS and its consequences. These transient spikes of hyperglycemia could be an HbA1c&#x02013;independent risk factor for diabetic complications. The p65 subunit of the pleiotropic transcription factor NF&#x003ba;B was selected for study because NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;driven proinflammatory gene expression appears to play a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), and p65 expression is significantly increased in aorta of diabetic ApoE-null mice and in circulating mononuclear cells of diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Transient hyperglycemia promotes p65 gene transcription and NF-&#x003ba;B activation</title><p>To create a model of transient hyperglycemia, we first incubated either primary bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) or primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) in high glucose (HG) for 16 h and then returned the media glucose concentration to physiological glucose levels for 6 d (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Transcription of p65 was increased by transient exposure to HG in both HAECs and BAECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref> and Fig. S1 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081188/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081188/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, transient hyperglycemia did not increase expression of the NF-&#x003ba;B subunits RElB, c-Rel, p50/p105, or p52/p100 (unpublished data). Remarkably, this increase in p65 transcription persisted during subsequent incubation at physiological glucose levels for the entire 6-d experimental period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref> and Fig. S1 a). Expression of p65 increased with glucose concentration from 5 to 30 mM (Fig. S1 b). Protein levels of p65 and NF-&#x003ba;B p65 activity were also increased by transient exposure to HG, and these also persisted for 6 d (Fig. S2). Addition of actinomycin D to the physiological glucose media after 16 h of HG reduced the elevated p65 expression to normal levels at 2 d, which is consistent with a primary role for transcription (unpublished data). To exclude the possibility that increased p65 expression occurs as a result of osmotic stress, vascular endothelial cells were incubated in 30 mM mannitol. In these cells, there was no change in p65 expression (unpublished data). Association of RNA polymerase II with the p65 promoter was also increased by transient exposure to HG, and this also persisted for 6 d (Fig. S3), confirming that p65 transcription was indeed increased.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Persistent increase in Set7-mediated histone methylation and p65 gene expression caused by transient hyperglycemia.</bold> (a) Schematic representation of experimental model.

Histone methylation is an important posttranslational modification involved in fundamental processes such as transcriptional regulation and genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In particular, methylation of H3K4 (lysine 4 of histone 3) favors transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In mammalian cells, H3K4 methylation is mediated by several histone methyltransferases (HMTs). The mammalian HMT Set7 has been shown to monomethylate histone H3K4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). In contrast, SET1a, SET1b, and four MLL-family HMTs function as tri- and dimethyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether Set7 is mobilized by HG to maintain the active transcriptional state, chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) were performed with antibody to Set7, and association with the proximal p65 promoter was determined by quantitative real time PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, c and d</xref>; and Fig. S1 c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Chromatin from both HAECs and BAECs exposed to transient hyperglycemia (16 h) was significantly enriched for Set7 on the p65 promoter when compared with antibody controls. Remarkably, the increased Set7 association with the p65 promoter, like the increased expression of NF-&#x003ba;B, persisted in a normoglycemic environment for the entire 6-d experimental period (P &#x0003c; 0.05). To exclude the possibility that recruitment of Set7 occurs as a result of osmotic stress, vascular endothelial cells were incubated in 30 mM mannitol. In these cells, there was no change in Set7 enzyme binding on the p65 promoter (unpublished data). To confirm that recruitment of Set7 did indeed result in increased H3K4 methylation, we analyzed methylation of histone H3K4. ChIP analysis indicated that there was a specific and persistent increase in histone H3K4 monomethylation on p65 chromatin compared with no antibody control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref> and Fig. S1 c).</p></sec><sec><title>Transient hyperglycemia increases a specific epigenetic mark, histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1), in the proximal promoter region of the p65 gene</title><p>Although neither di- nor trimethyl H3K4 was affected by transient hyperglycemia in the single amplicon we examined (unpublished data), these marks are frequently found downstream of transcription start sites (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). We therefore performed ChIP walking for H3K4me1, H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2), and H3K4 trimethylation 4 (H3K4me3) from nt 1 to &#x0002b;1500 of the p65 gene, as well as from nt &#x02212;1 to &#x02212;450 of the p65 promoter in HAECs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>). The only statistically significant change occurred with H3K4me1 in the proximal promoter near the TSS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>). This 2.5-fold increase was present after 16 h of HG and remained at this level after 6 d of subsequent exposure to low glucose (LG). Neither the small increases of H3K4me1 at &#x0002b;450 and &#x0002b;750 nor the slight increase of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 near the TSS were significantly different from LG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, c and d</xref>). To show that our optimized ChIP assays are specific for the indicated epitopes, we performed ChIPs using an antibody that recognizes unmodified histone 3 (unpublished data). Association of the trimethyl H3K4 binding partner NURF with the p65 promoter was also not increased by transient exposure to HG (unpublished data). Consistent with these data, neither MLL1 nor hSET1 association with the p65 promoter was changed at any time point (unpublished data). Because hyperacetylation of histones by p300 and other histone acetyl transferases has been associated with recruitment of chromatin remodeling proteins, we also examined levels of pan-acetylated H3, acetyl H3K9, and acetyl H3K14 associated with the p65 promoter. Transient hyperglycemia increased all three, and this increase also persisted during subsequent incubation at physiological glucose levels for 6 d (Fig. S4, a and b, respectively, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081188/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081188/DC1</ext-link>). To determine whether this increased histone acetylation is sufficient to induce the observed effects of HG, we used the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). TSA treatment of cells incubated in LG increased levels of pan-acetylated H3, H3K9, and H3K14 acetylation to acetylation levels observed in cells incubated in HG (Fig. S4 c). However, this increase in H3 acetylation was not associated with the Set7 recruitment and increased H3K4me1, which are both induced by incubation in HG (Fig. S4 d). Similarly, this increase in acetylation was also not associated with the increased expression of p65, MCP-1, or VCAM-1 induced by incubation in HG (Fig. S4 e). Together, these data indicate that increased histone acetylation is not sufficient to induce the effects observed after exposure to HG.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Partial quantitative PCR&#x02013;based chromosomal walking of the p65 gene by ChIP.</bold> (a) Schematic representation of the p65 proximal promoter and downstream sequence mapped.

As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 e</xref>, in Set7 knockdown HAECs (SET7 shRNA), transient hyperglycemia failed to induce increased H3K4 monomethylation. Similarly, knockdown of Set7 prevented the increase and persistence of NF-&#x003ba;B p65 expression induced by transient hyperglycemia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 f</xref>). Finally, we examined the effects of transient hyperglycemia on the expression of two NF-&#x003ba;B p65-activated genes relevant to hyperglycemia-induced arterial pathology, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). MCP-1 is a chemokine involved in the recruitment of plasma monocytes in the early stages of atherosclerosis, and VCAM-1 promotes monocyte adhesion to arterial endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Expression of both MCP-1 and VCAM-1 was increased by transient hyperglycemia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 g</xref>) and remained elevated during 6 d of subsequent incubation at physiological glucose levels. Expression of three other NF-&#x003ba;B p65-dependent proinflammatory genes, the cytokine IL-6, inducible NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase), and the proinflammatory adhesion molecule ICAM1, also increased after exposure to transient HG and this increase persisted for 6 d of subsequent exposure to 5 mM glucose (unpublished data).</p><p>To link this increased expression to the changes in p65 expression and activity, we measured the effect of p65 knockdown on hyperglycemia-induced MCP-1 and VCAM-1 expression. Similarly, to link this increased expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1 to Set7, we also determined the effect of SET7 knockdown on hyperglycemia-induced MCP-1 and VCAM-1 expression. Both knockdown of p65 and SET7 prevented the increase in MCP-1 and VCAM-1 expression induced by transient hyperglycemia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 g</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mitochondrial ROS and GLO-1 substrate participate in glucose-induced changes in p65 gene expression and in remodeling of the p65 promoter</title><p>Because mitochondrial overproduction of superoxide has been shown to initiate a large number of hyperglycemia-induced mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of diabetic complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), we next investigated the effect of inhibiting mitochondrial superoxide production on p65 expression. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>, the increase in p65 expression induced by transient hyperglycemia was completely prevented by overexpression of either uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) or manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), both of which prevent hyperglycemia-induced superoxide accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Transient hyperglycemia had no effect on endogenous MnSOD expression (unpublished data), a finding which is consistent with our observation that the NF-&#x003ba;B subunit c-Rel was not induced by transient hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In addition, we found that overexpression of the &#x003b1;-oxoaldehyde degradation enzyme glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) also prevented the increase in p65 expression induced by transient hyperglycemia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>). The major physiological substrate for GLO1, methylglyoxal, is a highly reactive dicarbonyl that accumulates in several cell types exposed to hyperglycemia as a consequence of increased mitochondrial superoxide production. This results in functionally significant covalent modifications of intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Overexpression of UCP-1, MnSOD, or GLO1 also prevented the increased association of Set7 and H3K4me1 with the p65 promoter in response to transient hyperglycemia alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>UCP1, MnSOD, and GLO1 prevent persistent increases in Set7-mediated histone methylation and p65 gene expression.</bold> (a) p65 mRNA after transient hyperglycemia, measured by quantitative PCR.

HAECs were infected with UCP-1, MnSOD, or GLO1 adenovirus and then treated as described previously. Nuclear extracts were digested with the restriction endonuclease Eag1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>), and a 161-bp fragment of the p65 promoter was quantified by quantitative PCR amplification. Transient hyperglycemia caused active remodeling of the p65 promoter, proximal to the TSS, with an increased susceptibility to Eag1 digestion indicating transition to an open chromatin conformation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 c</xref>). This remodeling of the p65 promoter also persisted for 6 d of normoglycemia and was prevented by overexpression of UCP-1, MnSOD, or GLO1.</p></sec><sec><title>In nondiabetic mice, transient hyperglycemia induces increased H3K4me1 at the p65 promoter and increases p65 gene transcription</title><p>To validate our in vitro observations in an animal model, we examined the effect of transient hyperglycemia on H3K4me1 and p65 expression in aortic endothelial cells of nondiabetic mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Mice were exposed to hyperglycemia (20 mM glucose) for 6 h using pancreatic insulin clamps and killed immediately and after 2, 4, and 6 d of subsequent euglycemia. Aortic endothelial cells were isolated from these mice by laser capture microdissection (LCM), and the levels of H3K4me1 at the NF-&#x003ba;B p65 promoter were determined by carrier ChIP (cChIP; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Transient hyperglycemia induced an increase in this activating H3K4 methylation, which persisted for the subsequent 6 d of exposure to normal levels of blood glucose. These epigenetic changes were associated with an increase in NF-&#x003ba;B p65 expression that also persisted for the subsequent 6 d of exposure to normal levels of blood glucose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 b</xref>). Because both of these hyperglycemia-induced effects were prevented by overexpression of UCP-2 in vitro, we also analyzed aortic endothelial cells isolated from nondiabetic <italic>UCP-2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which produce excess intracellular ROS at normal glucose levels. In the absence of hyperglycemia, both the level of H3K4me1 at the NF-&#x003ba;B p65 promoter and the level of p65 expression were increased to the same extent as they were in WT mice exposed to transient hyperglycemia. Expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1 was also increased (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, c and d</xref>, respectively). Similarly, because these hyperglycemia-induced effects were also prevented by overexpression of glyoxalase 1 in vitro, we analyzed the same variables in aortic endothelial cells isolated from nondiabetic glyoxalase 1 knockdown mice. The effects on both H3K4m1 at the NF-&#x003ba;B promoter and p65 expression were qualitatively similar to those observed with both transient hyperglycemia and in <italic>UCP-2</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, e and f</xref>, respectively). These results demonstrate that increased intracellular ROS, which normally are generated by hyperglycemia, are sufficient to induce both increased H3K4me1 at the NF-&#x003ba;B promoter and p65 expression in the absence of hyperglycemia. Similarly, they show that increased glyoxalase 1 substrate, which normally occurs as a consequence of hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), is sufficient to induce both increased H3K4me1 at the NF-&#x003ba;B promoter and p65 expression in the absence of hyperglycemia. Thus, the proximate mechanistic events mediating increased p65 expression are HG-induced ROS and subsequent methylglyoxal formation. The distal mechanistic events are chromatin remodeling, Set7 recruitment, and increased H3K4 monomethylation in the p65 promoter.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Persistent increases in Set7-mediated histone methylation and p65 gene expression in nondiabetic mice.</bold> (a and b) WT mice were exposed to 20 mM glucose for 6 h using a hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemic clamp.

In the proximal promoter region of p65, increased monomethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 by the histone methyltransferase Set7 caused a sustained increase in p65 gene expression, leading to a sustained increase in expression of the NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;responsive proatherogenic genes MCP-1 and VCAM-1. These epigenetic changes are caused by increased generation of methylglyoxal because of hyperglycemia-induced ROS formation by the mitochondrial electron transport chain.</p><p>Our epigenetic findings are particularly novel for two reasons. First, to our knowledge there are no data about Set7 increasing H3K4 monomethylation modification of a promoter and altering gene expression. It has been commonly assumed, based on studies in yeast, that H3K4 methyltransferases function mainly during elongation after recruitment by elongating RNA polymerase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Although recent studies in animal cells have shown activator-dependent interactions and recruitment of other methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), thus indicating promoter-related functions that may complement the elongation-related functions, no studies have implicated Set7 and H3K4 monomethylation. Second, and most important clinically, our study is the first to demonstrate that transient hyperglycemia induces chromatin remodeling and vascular epigenetic changes that cause persistent increases in proatherogenic gene expression during subsequent normoglycemia.</p><p>Miao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>) reported that nine candidate genes displayed increased H3K4Me2 after chronic exposure of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 to HG. Three of these showed increased gene expression, four showed decreased expression, and two showed no difference in gene expression. Whether or not these changes persisted during subsequent normoglycemia was not investigated. During exposure to HG, they found no change in H3K4 dimethyllysine in the NF-&#x003ba;B p65 promoter sequence, which is consistent with the data reported here (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 c</xref>). In a separate publication, Miao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) reported that after chronic exposure of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 to HG, H3 acetylation at Lys 9 and Lys 14 was increased at the TNF-&#x003b1; and COX-2 promoters. However, in contrast to our findings with p65 expression (Fig. S4), the HDAC inhibitor TSA stimulated transcription of these two genes in normal glucose.</p><p>In addition to posttranslational modification of histones, DNA methylation may also play an epigenetic role in controlling gene expression in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In a recent study, Ling et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) provided a compelling example of how genetic and epigenetic factors may interact to confer an age-dependent susceptibility to insulin resistance. In muscle from young and elderly identical twins, a polymorphism in the promoter of a nuclear-encoded electron transport chain protein was associated with increased DNA methylation in this promoter in the older subjects, which correlated with lower levels of gene expression and increased insulin resistance. The role of DNA methylation in gene expression changes related to metabolic memory is a fertile area for future investigation.</p><p>Data from the EDIC study, which followed patients with type 1 diabetes after they completed the DCCT, show that early chronic exposure to a moderately high level of hyperglycemia has prolonged effects on diabetic complications during subsequent periods of improved glycemia, a phenomenon termed &#x0201c;metabolic memory.&#x0201d; For example, atherosclerotic changes not even present at the end of the DCCT appeared subsequently in the previously higher HbA1c group, followed by a twofold increase in myocardial infarction, strokes, and cardiovascular death. This occurred despite the fact that their HbA1c since the end of the DCCT was identical to that of the formerly intensive control group during the entire time that these arterial changes developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Whether persistent epigenetic changes induced by transient spikes of hyperglycemia play a role in metabolic memory remains to be determined by future investigations.</p><p>In summary, the observations reported here show that transient hyperglycemia causes persistent atherogenic effects during subsequent normoglycemia by inducing long-lasting changes in chromatin remodeling, recruitment of the histone methyltransferase Set7, and increased H3K4 monomethylation in the proximal NF-&#x003ba;B promoter, leading to increased expression of p65, MCP-1, and VCAM-1. Together, these results provide a molecular basis for understanding some of the variation in risk for diabetic complications that is not explained by HbA1c.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cells and reagents.</title><p>Primary HAECs (Cascade Biologics) were maintained in medium EGM-2MV bullet kit (Cambrex) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.
