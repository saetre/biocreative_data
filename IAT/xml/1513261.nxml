Infection of mice with mouse-adapted virus (MA-ZEBOV) involves primary target cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system, namely monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as target organs (spleen, lymph nodes, and liver), as seen in humans and NHPs, resulting in a disease comparable to that observed in the latter animals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

Serial passage of pre&#x02013;MA-ZEBOV in progressively older suckling mice yielded the fully mouse-adapted variant (MA-ZEBOV), which possessed nine additional nucleotide changes.

MA-RG differed from MA-ZEBOV by the three silent mutations in the NP, VP40, and L ORFs that were introduced during adaptation in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). We also generated a variety of recombinant viruses containing various subsets of the mutations found in MA-ZEBOV (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) to identify those mutations responsible for mouse adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The VP24 and NP Genes Determine ZEBOV Virulence in Mice</title><p>To identify the genetic determinants of ZEBOV virulence in mice, we inoculated groups of BALB/c mice (5 to 6 wk old; three to six per group) intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10 focus-forming units (FFU) of WT-ZEBOV, the original mouse-adapted virus (MA-ZEBOV), its counterpart generated using reverse genetics (MA-RG), or viruses containing subsets of the mutations found in MA-ZEBOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). This dose (10 FFU) corresponded to 1,000 MLD<sub>50</sub> (the amount of virus required to kill 50&#x00025; of the mice) for MA-ZEBOV. As expected, infection of mice with WT-ZEBOV did not produce a lethal infection or any clinical symptoms, unlike infection with either MA-ZEBOV or MA-RG. Interestingly, viruses containing the wild-type NP or VP24 genes in the background of MA-ZEBOV (MA-NP<sub>WT</sub>, MA-24<sub>WT</sub>) did not cause lethal infection or clinical symptoms in mice, suggesting a critical role for mutations in these proteins with respect to the virulence of MA-ZEBOV in mice. In contrast, substitution of the VP35, GP, and/or L genes of MA-RG with those of WT-ZEBOV did not dramatically reduce the virulence of the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Determination of the MLD<sub>50</sub>, by i.p. inoculation of mice with 10-fold serial dilutions of viruses, revealed almost identical MLD<sub>50</sub> values for all of these recombinant viruses with few exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). We, therefore, tested the inverse genotypes by introducing mouse-adapted NP and VP24 genes, separately and in combination, into the background of WT-ZEBOV. Only WT-NP/24<sub>MA</sub> resulted in a lethal phenotype; neither of the single gene introductions (WT-NP<sub>MA</sub>, WT-24<sub>MA</sub>) caused disease in mice. These findings identified the specific amino acid changes in NP and VP24 that are the critical determinants of ZEBOV virulence in adult mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Multiple Mutations in MA-ZEBOV Contribute to Enhanced Virulence in Mice</title><p>All mice infected with virulent viruses displayed the same clinical symptoms (ruffled fur, decreased activity, and weight loss), but notable differences were observed in the mean time to death and in the dose ranges that caused morbidity or mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Infection with MA-ZEBOV resulted in the shortest mean time to death, with lethal infection induced by a broad range of inoculum doses (10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> FFU/mouse). The artificially generated MA-RG virus was slightly attenuated, suggesting that the silent mutations in the NP, VP40, and L genes, by which this mutant differs from MA-ZEBOV, may make a minor contribution to virulence.</p><p>Similarly, the introduction of the mouse-adapted NP and VP24 genes into the background of WT-ZEBOV (WT-NP/24<sub>MA</sub>) did not bestow on WT-ZEBOV the fully pathogenic phenotype, as demonstrated by a prolonged time to death and a narrower dose range causing mortality than that of MA-ZEBOV. Insertion of the mutation into the 5&#x02032; NCR of the VP24 gene of WT-NP/24<sub> MA</sub> (i.e., WT-NP/24nc/24<sub>MA</sub>) reduced the time to death but did not appreciably expand the dose range for morbidity/mortality, indicating a rather minor contribution of this mutation to virulence in mice. In contrast, the nucleotide substitution in the 3&#x02032; NCR of VP30 caused a more appreciable effect on mouse virulence (compare MA-GP<sub>WT</sub> and MA-GP/30nc<sub>WT</sub>, which differ only in the VP30 NCR).</p><p>Single gene replacements of the mouse-adapted VP35, GP, or L with their wild-type counterparts (MA-VP35<sub>WT</sub>, MA-GP<sub>WT</sub> MA-L<sub>WT</sub>) led to different degrees of attenuation, indicating that all of the mutations contributed to some extent to the virulence of MA-ZEBOV in adult mice. Of these mutant viruses, MA-L<sub>WT</sub> showed the most pronounced attenuation, indicating that the two amino acid changes in the L protein of MA-ZEBOV are more critical for virulence in mice than those in the VP35 or GP proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Growth Characteristics in Mouse Organs</title><p>We next compared the growth characteristics of representative mutant viruses in mice infected with 5 FFU of virus by examining viral titers in the serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) and in two target organs of EBOV, the spleen and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g003">3</xref>C). As expected, WT-ZEBOV replicated poorly in mice, whereas the virus titers of MA-RG were the highest in all organs tested, again demonstrating that the full set of mutations is required to establish the fully pathogenic phenotype. Efficient virus replication required both the mouse-adapted NP and VP24 genes (compare WT-NP/24<sub>MA</sub> with WT-NP<sub>MA</sub> and WT-VP24<sub>MA</sub>), a finding that correlated well with virulence, as measured by lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g002">2</xref>B). Likewise, the introduction of either the wild-type NP or VP24 gene into the background of MA-ZEBOV attenuated the resulting recombinant viruses (MA-NP<sub>WT</sub>, MA-24<sub>WT</sub>), further emphasizing the critical role of these mutations for viral replication in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Do Mutations in VP24 and NP Affect Virus Sensitivity to IFN?</title><p>The suppression of viral multiplication by type I IFN-mediated antiviral responses has been demonstrated in many viruses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, including EBOV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. In fact, it is abrogation of the type I IFN (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) system that makes adult mice susceptible to EBOV infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. We and others have identified EBOV VP24 as being instrumental in this function (i.e., in inhibiting IFN signaling) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. To determine whether the amino acid changes in the VP24 and NP proteins of MA-ZEBOV facilitate evasion of the type I IFN-induced antiviral response, we compared virus growth of selected recombinant viruses in a mouse peritoneal macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7 cells) in the absence or presence of murine IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g004">Figure 4</xref>). WT-ZEBOV grew in nonstimulated cells, albeit to lower titers compared to the growth of the other viruses tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g004">Figure 4</xref>A); however, in cells stimulated with IFN at 2 h postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) or 12 h prior to and 2 h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), virus replication was severely reduced. In contrast, MA-RG grew to much higher titers even in IFN-stimulated cells, suggesting that its virulence in mice is linked to its ability to counteract IFN-induced antiviral responses. This ability clearly correlated with the mutations in the mouse-adapted VP24 and NP genes. In fact, WT-NP/VP24<sub>MA</sub> grew more efficiently in IFN-stimulated cells than did MA-RG, for unknown reasons. In cells that were stimulated with IFN postinfection, WT-NP<sub>MA</sub> or WT-VP24<sub>MA</sub> grew better than WT-ZEBOV. In contrast, WT-VP24<sub>MA</sub>, but not WT-NP<sub>MA</sub>, failed to replicate efficiently in cells treated with IFN prior to and after infection. These data indicate that the ability to counteract IFN-induced antiviral responses is responsible for the high virulence of MA-ZEBOV in this animal model and that IFN evasion may be critical for EBOV virulence in other animal models, as well as in humans. In addition, our findings show that while both mouse-adapted VP24 and NP provide the virus with the ability to counteract the IFN-induced antiviral responses, NP may be more critical for this effect in vitro. The concerted actions of both mutations, however, appear necessary for evading IFN-induced antiviral responses in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have identified molecular determinants of ZEBOV virulence in mice by using reverse genetics. We found VP24 and NP to be the primary determinants for adaptation of WT-ZEBOV in mice and found a correlation between virulence and the ability of the virus to evade the type I IFN-induced antiviral response. The ability to overcome the IFN-induced antiviral response is, therefore, a critical event in the pathogenesis of ZEBOV infection in mice and possibly in humans. Moreover, mutations in other viral proteins and NCRs also contribute to the virulent phenotype, indicating that virulence is a multifactor trait.</p><p>Recent in vitro studies suggest that VP24 functions as a type I IFN antagonist &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, but the significance of this finding had not been addressed in vivo until now. Here, we have demonstrated that single amino acid modifications in VP24 and NP of MA-ZEBOV are critical for virus evasion of IFN-induced antiviral responses. NP has not previously been considered as a potential IFN antagonist. However, given that it interacts with VP24 in the formation of nucleocapsids &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, it is not unreasonable to imagine that it may act as an enhancer and/or stabilizer of VP24 functions. Nevertheless, since the NP mutation acquired during mouse adaptation of WT-ZEBOV alone allowed the recombinant virus to replicate in IFN-treated cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), NP likely plays a more direct role in the evasion of the IFN-induced antiviral response. Interestingly, WT-NP/VP24<sub>MA</sub> grew more efficiently than MA-RG in IFN-stimulated cells, in contrast to our in vivo results. For this reason, it seems likely that the mutations in VP24 and NP are critical for resistance to IFN-induced antiviral responses, while the remaining mutations acquired during adaptation of WT-ZEBOV facilitate efficient virus replication and/or spread in mice despite their attenuated phenotype in cell culture systems.</p><p>VP35 and GP have previously been linked to EBOV pathogenicity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. VP35 is an IFN antagonist that interferes with type I IFN synthesis by inhibiting IRF-3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) activation, a necessary step for the transcription of IFN genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the mutation found in the mouse-adapted VP35 protein was not responsible for the enhanced virulence of MA-ZEBOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), this does not necessarily indicate that VP35-mediated regulation of IFN levels does not play a part in the pathogenicity of EBOV. This activity may still be important for EBOV to achieve high virulence. Likewise, GP is cytotoxic and is, therefore, thought to contribute to viral pathogenicity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. However, a recent report suggested that this cytotoxicity originated from overexpression of GP in cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. As with VP35, the lack of an adaptive mutation in the GP of MA-ZEBOV does not necessarily diminish the role of GP in viral pathogenicity.</p><p>Interestingly, the adaptation of ZEBOV in guinea pigs also resulted in amino acid changes in NP, VP24, and L and in a nucleotide substitution in the VP30 NCR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Although these mutations differed in their amino acid positions from those in MA-ZEBOV, it seems likely that they serve a similar role in adaptation and also function by counteracting innate antiviral responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. As with mice, additional mutations (e.g., in L and the VP30 NCR) likely contribute to virulence by affecting viral transcription/replication.</p><p>The mouse model using MA-ZEBOV does not exactly mirror all aspects of human Ebola hemorrhagic fever &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, determinants for virulence of ZEBOV may differ between mouse and primate models. However, since ZEBOV is naturally lethal to primates, but not to mice, this model provided an opportunity to decipher the roles of viral proteins in expression of high virulence in a host (i.e., mice). Our studies showed that ZEBOV VP24 and NP are inadequate for the expression of high virulence in mice, but upon mutation, optimally expressed this property. Thus, it is possible that these viral proteins play an important role in expression of high virulence in primates. Likewise, the lack of VP35 mutations correlating with pathogenicity in mice is interesting, indicating that ZEBOV VP35 optimally functions in both primates and mice without additional mutation in an IFN pathway. Since MA-ZEBOV is attenuated in NHPs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, one or more genes into which mutations were introduced during mouse adaptation of ZEBOV likely play a role in virulence in primates. Therefore, it will be interesting to examine the virulence of selected recombinant mouse-adapted variants in NHPs. Such studies will provide us with valuable information for understanding ZEBOV pathogenesis in humans.</p><p>Of note, we observed resistance in mice to infection with high infectious doses of MA-ZEBOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020073-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). A similar finding has been observed in a mouse model for rabies virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. The most likely explanation for this finding is that inoculation with high doses of virus causes a rapid stimulation of the innate immune response before virus replication or spread can occur. This topic presents an attractive research subject that may lead to control measures for EBOV infections through immunologic modulation of host responses to viral infection.</p><p>In conclusion, the combination of reverse genetics technology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020073-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d; and a small-animal model has allowed us to gain valuable insights into EBOV pathogenesis. Understanding the molecular basis of mouse adaptation of ZEBOV will likely lead to the identification of viral genetic determinants of EBOV virulence and to the elucidation of the roles of specific viral proteins in the pathogenic process. A more detailed molecular understanding of virulence and the host responses will also be crucial to improving our ability to control EBOV infections in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells.</title><p>Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney) cells, 293T (human embryonic kidney) cells, and RAW 264.7 cells (mouse peritoneal macrophages) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS, 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and penicillin (100 U/ml)-streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml).
