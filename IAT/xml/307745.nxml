Cell. Biol., (1992), 12, 2525-2533). To study a nuclear binding protein for this element, we screened cDNA libraries from a rat ascites hepatoma cell line by binding with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe and obtained several clones. One of them, designated SW, was studied in detail. A clone (SW2) of this series contained a near full length cDNA encoding a putative peptide with 463 amino acid residues. We isolated this peptide as a fusion protein. It was found that the protein strongly bound to the C-stretch of the DNA sequence in a single strand specific fashion, but absolutely did not to G-rich sequence. The protein bound weakly to the corresponding double-stranded DNA as well as to C-rich RNA sequence. This protein, though not the expected one, was found to be a novel protein whose DNA binding domain was located on the region containing at least 75 amino acid residues of the carboxyl terminus. A proline rich region was also observed in the middle part of the protein. Northern blot profiles indicated extensive and slight expression of both 2.0 kb and 2.7 kb mRNA species in some hepatoma cell lines and in the rat liver, respectively.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0070-a" xlink:role="56"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0070-b" xlink:role="56"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0071-a" xlink:role="57"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0071-b" xlink:role="57"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="53"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="54"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="55"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0070.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="56"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="57"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00025-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="58"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
