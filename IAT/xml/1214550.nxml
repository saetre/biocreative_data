Homeobox genes do not escape this bidirectional transcription, raising the possibility that such AS transcription occurs during embryonic development and may be involved in the complexity of regulation of homeobox gene expression. According to the importance of the <italic>Msx1</italic> homeobox gene function in craniofacial development, especially in tooth development, the expression and regulation of its recently identified AS transcripts were investigated <italic>in vivo</italic> in mouse from E9.5 embryo to newborn, and compared with the S transcript and the encoded protein expression pattern and regulation. The spatial and temporal expression patterns of S, AS transcripts and protein are consistent with a role of AS RNA in the regulation of Msx1 expression in timely controlled developmental sites. Epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal interactions were shown to control the spatial organization of S and also AS RNA expression during early patterning of incisors and molars in the odontogenic mesenchyme. To conclude, this study clearly identifies the <italic>Msx1</italic> AS RNA involvement during tooth development and evidences a new degree of complexity in craniofacial developmental biology: the implication of endogenous AS RNAs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Until very recently, the significance of natural antisense (AS) transcripts was underestimated. AS transcripts in prokaryotes have been known for at least two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) while a limited number of cases have been reported in eukaryotes. Recent data have established their importance in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Indeed, these transcripts are involved in gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) as exemplified by RNA interference, presently applied in numerous knockdown strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Natural AS transcripts are grouped into two classes: <italic>cis</italic> AS transcripts which are transcribed with the sense (S) transcripts from a unique gene locus, and <italic>trans</italic> AS transcripts which are transcribed from a different locus. Rare data are available on the physiological impact of AS RNAs during development. For example, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans let4</italic> controls the timing of post-embryonic cell division and fate [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>)]. In mouse, miR196a negatively regulates <italic>Hoxb8</italic> and restricts <italic>Hox</italic> homeogene expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Interestingly, these two AS RNAs belong to the specific subclass of small RNAs also named microRNA (21&#x02013;23 nt).</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted another subclass of AS RNAs: the long <italic>cis</italic> AS (containing &#x0003e;100 bp). <italic>In silico</italic> studies based on expressed sequence tag database have predicted that they may constitute &#x0223c;15% of the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and &#x0003e;20% of the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Long <italic>cis</italic> AS transcripts have been shown to exert regulatory functions on protein expression at various levels such as epigenetic imprinting, RNA maturation, edition and translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). However, the functional data on AS transcripts have been essentially generated <italic>in vitro</italic>. Very few long AS transcripts have been analyzed in the specific context of mammalian development. Some expression patterns have been reported: for instance, <italic>Hoxa11</italic> AS and S transcripts show complementary expression territories in developing limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>The mouse <italic>Msx1</italic> locus has been shown previously to undergo a bidirectional convergent and overlapping transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript belongs to the long <italic>cis</italic>-AS subclass (2184 nt, in mouse), and was proposed to control protein expression. This assertion was based on (i) <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence of protein down-regulation by the AS transcript, and (ii) <italic>in vivo</italic> expression patterns in newborn mouse osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Indeed, in the mandibular bone <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript evidenced a complementary expression pattern to the <italic>Msx1</italic> S transcript. More specifically, the <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript is expressed in the latest stage of osteoblast maturation (osteocytes) whereas <italic>Msx1</italic> S transcript is expressed in preosteoblasts and osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). According to these observations, it was hypothesized that <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript expression is instrumental in the regulation of osteoblastic cell differentiation. It would control the progressive reduction of Msx1 homeoprotein expression and therefore induce the interdependent cell cycle exit and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). This assertion is supported by several <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data on Msx1 homeoprotein. <italic>In vitro</italic>, Msx1 overexpression blocks myoblasts differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), induces myotubes dedifferentiation into myoblasts and promotes transdifferentiation into osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Consistently, <italic>in vivo</italic>, Msx1 expression is reversely correlated with cell differentiation progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>During embryonic development, Msx1 is instrumental in various systems, notably in the craniofacial complex where it acts as a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). <italic>Msx1</italic> expression is observed early in development in neural crest cells and their derivatives, including first branchial arch ectomesenchymal cells devoted to tooth formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). In mice, the first evidence of tooth morphogenesis occurs at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) as a thickening of the dental epithelium, called the dental lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). However, before this morphological event and as early as E10.5, the respective incisor and molar fields are already determined. Oral epithelium induces a site-specific combination of homeobox genes expressions in the subjacent dental mesenchyme, and these combinations are organized as an &#x02018;odontogenic homeobox code&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). <italic>Msx1</italic> has been shown to be a key element within this code, specifying the incisor presumptive region at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). After E11.5, tooth morphogenesis is already initiated and the dental lamina epithelium progressively invades the subjacent mesenchyme and forms the dental bud (E12.5&#x02013;E13.5). Thereafter, dental development progresses through the cap (E14.5) and bell stages (E16.5), characterized by tooth-specific morphogenesis and cell differentiation. Tooth morphogenesis is orchestrated by successive organization centers, called primary and secondary enamel knots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). This overall process of tooth morphogenesis is driven by sequential and reciprocal interactions between dental epithelium and mesenchyme [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>)]. Msx1 plays a central role in these epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal interactions as evidenced by molar tooth development arrest at the bud stage in mice lacking Msx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>).</p><p>Finally, during tooth development, Msx1 is important for two major processes, firstly, the dental field determination and secondly, the tooth morphogenesis. Msx1 is, therefore, an exemplary model to analyze cell&#x02013;cell communication leading early determination and subsequent morphogenesis in mammals. Based on this conclusion and on the recent discovery of the endogenous AS transcript of <italic>Msx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), the present study aimed to delineate the timing and impact of this AS transcript in these established developmental cascades; firstly, to determine whether <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript is expressed prior to the late terminal differentiation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), and secondly, whether <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript is instrumental in epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal interactions leading to the two distinct steps of odontogenesis, namely, tooth field determination (E10.5) and tooth morphogenesis (E11.5&#x02013;E16.5). Using different approaches we have proposed a novel role for <italic>Msx1</italic> AS in tooth development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Embryo collection</title><p>Timed matings were set up such that noon of the day on which vaginal plugs were detected was considered as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).

Inside this family, a variable number of members have been reported for different species, corresponding to evolutionary duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). These genes exhibit a simple genomic structure with two exons separated by a single intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). The <italic>Msx1</italic> gene appears to be the most conserved gene within the <italic>Msx</italic> family of mammals and avians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Interestingly, a bidirectional overlapping and convergent transcription was identified for this <italic>Msx1</italic> gene in mouse and human and might also be conserved in at least three other species: rat, bovine and chicken. Such a possibility was suggested by the existence of a conserved identical 60 bp sequence containing a TATA box and corresponding to the AS promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). According to the importance of Msx1 homeoprotein during development and the preliminary <italic>in vitro</italic> observation that the <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript has the ability to interfere with Msx1 homeoprotein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), the investigation of the physiological significance of the bidirectional transcription of the <italic>Msx1</italic> locus during development appeared to be important. The experimental strategy was to investigate the presence of the <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript during mouse embryogenesis by RT&#x02013;PCR, to analyze its expression pattern in comparison with the <italic>Msx1</italic> S transcript and the protein in tooth and other significant developing systems where <italic>Msx1</italic> signaling pathways are instrumental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), and finally to analyze its potential regulation by epithelial signals.</p><sec><title>Evidence for <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript expression during embryonic development</title><p>The <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript was originally identified in newborn and young adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), in association with skeletal growth. <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript was proposed to be instrumental postnatally in terminal differentiation, by inhibiting Msx1 protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Indeed, Msx1 homeoprotein expressing cells were considered as undifferentiated cells, based on <italic>in vitro</italic> observations that Msx1 (i) inhibits master gene expression such as MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) and Runx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), (ii) modulates the expression of cell cycle determinants such as cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>) and p19(INK4d) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>), (iii) induces dedifferentiation of myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), and (iv) is specifically present in progenitor cell niches in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Interestingly, the initial analysis of <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript expression during antenatal mouse development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) revealed that, similar to the S transcript, the <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript was already expressed at E9.5 before the initial steps of skeleton morphogenesis and cell differentiation, and continuously up to birth. These data suggest that the <italic>Msx1</italic> bidirectional convergent and overlapping transcription may not only be linked to the control of cell terminal differentiation but also implicated in more complex processes during development, such as dental and skeletal morphogenesis.</p><p>In the past, <italic>Msx1</italic> gene expression has been documented in numerous developing organs and systems, notably, heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>), brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>), limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>), mammary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) and teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Due to the detailed analysis of the role of <italic>Msx1</italic> during odontogenesis, experimental studies of <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript were carried out in this developmental model system. In addition, Msx1 protein expression was compared with the AS transcript throughout tooth morphogenesis stages and showed a continuous expression until late bell stage (E16.5). The results suggest that, during tooth development, <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript may not only be involved in cell terminal differentiation control as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), but also in tooth initiation and subsequent morphogenesis through the control of Msx1 homeoprotein expression and function.</p><p>The most important result obtained here was that both S and AS <italic>Msx1</italic> transcripts were present during embryonic development.

This observation was not only verified in tooth but also in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), hair follicles (data not shown), neural tube (data not shown) and limb bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript and tooth initiation</title><p><italic>Msx1</italic> (S transcript) has been proposed to be an important factor in the odontogenic homeobox code proposed to define the different tooth fields at E10.5 in mouse prior to the morphological appearance of tooth formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). This homeobox code is based on combinations of homeobox gene expression patterning territories in the first branchial arch neural crest derived mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>).

This assertion is exemplified in <italic>Msx1</italic> knock out mice which exhibit no initiation of incisor development in contrast to molars where development is blocked later at the bud stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). To understand further the means of spatially restricting the expression of the Msx1 homeoprotein, the role of <italic>Msx</italic>1 AS transcript in the control of protein expression was considered. Our data showed that at E9.5 <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript was not expressed in the mandibular arch in contrast to the S transcript, whereas at E10.5 <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript was detected and presented an expression pattern complementary to the S transcript and protein. Such a result suggests that <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript could participate to Msx1 homeoprotein expression restriction within the distal region of the mandible. At this stage, some homeobox containing gene expression patterns in the mesenchyme are driven by epithelial signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). Two major signaling molecules implicated are growth factors BMP4 and FGF8. They are secreted by the distal and proximal parts of the mandibular oral epithelium, respectively. Effects of these diffusible growth factors on <italic>Msx1</italic>, <italic>Barx1</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> expression have been established by application of protein soaked beads in mandibular explant cultures. These experiments show that mesenchymal expression of <italic>Barx1</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> is induced by FGF8 while inhibited by BMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Msx1</italic> S transcript appears to be induced around both FGF8 and BMP4 soaked beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) raising the question of <italic>Msx1</italic> S transcript expression control (inhibition) in the mandible proximal parts <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, at E10.5, <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript showed an expression pattern in the mesenchyme of the mandible similar to those of <italic>Barx1</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B and D</xref>) and in opposition to <italic>Msx1</italic> S transcript and homeoprotein expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The presently reported expression of <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript lead to propose a hypothesis: the AS RNA would inhibit S RNA and protein expression in the proximal parts of the mandible by a mechanism that still remains to be elucidated but that could occur at transcriptional level according to the absence of S transcript detection. The present soak-beads experiments provided evidence that the mesenchymal expression of <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript at E10.5 is indeed responsive to FGF8 and not BMP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, I and K</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript activation by FGF8 at E10.5 appears to be correlated to an absence of <italic>Msx1</italic> S transcript response to this growth factor, while beads experiments suggest that <italic>Msx1</italic> S transcript should be activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> overexpression experiments in mesenchymal MD10-H1 dental cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) show that <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript expression may be regulated by Dlx2 but not by Barx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>), suggesting that Dlx-2 could act as an intermediary in the pathway between FGF8 and <italic>Msx1</italic> AS.

Moreover, the importance of Msx1 homeoprotein expression in dental mesenchyme is evidenced by the observation of molar development arrest at the bud stage (E13.5) in <italic>Msx1</italic> null mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Recombination experiments between wild-type and <italic>Msx1</italic> null mutant dental tissues showed that <italic>Msx1</italic> mesenchymal expression is transiently necessary at the early bud stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) mainly to induce BMP4 expression in the dental mesenchyme as validated by BMP4 complementation experiment using transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>). Indeed, the important function of Msx1 homeoprotein in tooth morphogenesis is its implication in epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal interactions and the question of the AS transcript part in this function control is raised from this point of view. Our results showed that <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript was continuously expressed during tooth morphogenesis with a stage-specific pattern. At the dental lamina stage (E11.5), the AS transcript was detected jointly with the S transcript in the mesenchyme and by E12.5, its expression was progressively restricted to the mesenchyme area surrounding the epithelial invagination, as reported previously for the S transcript. At the following stages (cap and bell stages), the <italic>Msx1</italic> S and AS transcripts expression patterns diverge showing a complementary in the mesenchyme. The S transcript was expressed in the dental cells which will differentiate into odontoblasts and pulp cells whereas the AS transcript was expressed in cells which will give rise to the follicular sac and alveolar bone. However, the function associated to such a distribution of the two transcripts remains unclear. Concerning <italic>Msx1</italic> S and AS transcript expression in dental epithelium (detected only with certain probes), the situation is even more complex and discussed below. Indeed, according to our data whatever be the stage of tooth morphogenesis Msx1 homeoprotein expression was restricted to the mesenchyme. Finally, our result establishes that during tooth morphogenesis, <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript showed a dynamic expression pattern relative to the S transcript and the protein suggesting its implication in the protein localization and expression level.</p><p>In conclusion, regarding <italic>Msx1</italic> transcripts and relative protein expression during tooth morphogenesis, five distinct situations were identified depending on the developmental stages, areas and tissues: no expression (at E11.5&#x02013;E12.5 in the epithelium), exclusive expression of S transcript (at E14.5 and E16.5 in dental mesenchyme), exclusive expression of AS transcript (at E16.5 in epithelial regions such as stellate reticulum and stratum intermedium), coexpression of S and AS (i) with all probes (E11.5&#x02013;E12.5) or (ii) with certain probes (at E13.5, E16.5 and D0). The differences observed with the set of probes used could be explained by the complementarities of S and AS exon 2 sequences. Indeed, the exclusive results obtained with S and AS specific probes suggest that at E13.5, E16.5 and D0 the overlapping sequence from both transcripts are not accessible to exon two probes. So, we hypothesized that S and AS transcripts could physically interfere and impair riboprobe hybridization in this area. Functionally, the five situations should be considered through the narrow window of AS RNA knowledge. Several transcriptional and post-transcriptional events are candidates for the inhibition of Msx1 homeoprotein. These events have been recently reviewed and classified in four categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Transcriptional interference and S gene silencing ends with exclusive expression of AS RNA. Posttranscriptional mechanisms (RNA masking and degradation) are those which involve S&#x02013;AS coexpression and finely tuned ratios of S/AS transcripts or modifications in RNAs overlapping sequences. According to coexpression or distinct expression patterns of both <italic>Msx1</italic> transcripts, the bidirectional convergent and overlapping transcription system would function differently. In the case of distinct expression pattern of S and AS transcripts, transcriptional interference or gene silencing could be implied, whereas, in the case of coexpression, RNA masking and degradation could be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>). Hence two types of ratio threshold could be defined. A macrothresholding when only one kind of <italic>Msx1</italic> transcript is expressed (E9.5&#x02013;E10.5) and a microthresholding (E13.5&#x02013;E16.5-D0) when the two transcripts are coexpressed. Further complementary studies at the cellular level would be necessary to clearly establish the presumably distinct mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Natural antisense transcripts: a growing list</title><p>The <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript is not an isolated case of large natural AS RNA. Bidirectional convergent and overlapping transcription is an emerging field opening a previously unsuspected level of complexity in protein expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). AS transcripts have been associated with different processes during development including parental imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>), developmental clock control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The precise molecular modalities of such a control are not clarified. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have established the importance of the relative ratio of the two transcripts. This has been shown previously for <italic>Msx1</italic> by <italic>in vivo</italic> observations of the two transcripts distribution during osteoblast differentiation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>Msx1</italic> is not the only gene implicated in maxillofacial and limb development showing a bidirectional convergent and overlapping transcription. Thus, homeobox containing genes belonging to the <italic>Dlx</italic> gene family have also AS transcripts. This is the case for <italic>Dlx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>) and <italic>Dlx6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>) genes. AS transcripts were also described for other divergent homeobox genes as <italic>Otx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>) and members of the Hox clusters such as <italic>HoxA11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and <italic>HoxD3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>), raising the question of the general importance of bidirectional convergent and overlapping transcription during development. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have established that (i) Msx and Dlx homeoproteins can form heterodimers through their homeodomains and consequently inhibit each other's transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) (F. Lezot, unpublished data) and (ii) that Dlx5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and Dlx2 (this study) homeoproteins can differentially modulated <italic>Msx1</italic> AS transcript expression, and thus Msx1 homeoprotein expression. These <italic>in vitro</italic> observations strongly suggest that understanding AS transcript integration in developmental signaling pathways will be a difficult, but necessary challenge for the next decade. Interestingly, 9 out of 248 genes shown to be involved in tooth development (indexed on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bite-it.helsinki.fi"/>) have so far been shown to have AS transcripts. Moreover, computer analysis of available human and mouse genome sequences have shown that 15 and 20% of the mouse and human genes can have AS transcript, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Finally it appears that the importance of AS transcripts is largely underestimated concerning development and more precisely during tooth development. &#x02018;Making sense with antisense&#x02019; may be operative for the understanding of morphogenetic gradients in developmental biology.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs Isabelle Miletich, Agamemnon Grigoriadis and Stephanie Ricaud for discussions and critical reading of the manuscript.
