We have analyzed the structure and hormonal regulation of a 35 Kb region of genomic DNA in which the uteroglobin gene is located. The complete sequence of 3,700 nucleotides including the uteroglobin gene and its flanking regions has been determined, and the limits of the gene established by S1 nuclease mapping. Several regions containing repeated sequences were mapped by blot hybridization, one of which is located within the large intron in the uteroglobin gene. Analysis of the RNAs extracted from endometrium, lung and liver, after treatment with estrogen and/or progesterone shows that within the 35 Kb region, the uteroglobin gene is the only DNA segment whose transcription into stable RNA is induced by progesterone.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0036-a" xlink:role="2262"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0037-a" xlink:role="2263"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0038-a" xlink:role="2264"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0039-a" xlink:role="2265"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0040-a" xlink:role="2266"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2257"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2258"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2259"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2260"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2261"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2262"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2263"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2264"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2265"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2266"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2267"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2268"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2269"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2270"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00353-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2271"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
