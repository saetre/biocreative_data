TRAF6 is an intracellular signaling adaptor molecule for these receptors, but its role in B cells has not been clarified by previous genetic approaches, as the systemic deletion of the <italic>TRAF6</italic> gene results in perinatal lethality. Here we show that B cell-specific TRAF6 deficiency results in a reduced number of mature B cells in the bone marrow and spleen. Optimal T cell-dependent (TD) antigen responses, as characterized by isotype switching and long-lived plasma cell generation, are also impaired in B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice. B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice also exhibit lower levels of serum IgM and IgG2b and defective antigen-specific IgM production in response to T cell-independent (TI) antigens. Unexpectedly, TRAF6-deficient B cell progenitors are unable to generate CD5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B-1 cells. These results reveal critical roles for TRAF6 in TD and TI humoral immune responses and in inductive fate decisions necessary to generate the B-1 B cell compartment.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ligands for the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CpG-DNA, are powerful B cell mitogens, and they also induce proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and the surface molecules CD40, B-7 and MHC class II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Akira1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-DeFranco1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Krieg1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Medzhitov1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

It has been shown that the various TRAFs have some unique and some overlapping functions <italic>in vitro</italic>; however, the roles of each TRAF downstream of CD40 in B cells are not fully understood. Recently, two separate groups examined transgenic mice with CD40 mutations that lack one or both TRAF binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Ahonen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Jabara1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. One study found that TRAF6 plays a critical role in antibody affinity maturation and the generation of plasma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Ahonen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas the other study concluded that TRAF6 has no discernible role in CD40-mediated activation and antibody class switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Jabara1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. It is difficult to establish the importance of TRAF6 in B cell function from these two studies. The functional readouts examined were different; in addition, in one study the mutant CD40 molecule was widely expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Ahonen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, while in the other it was expressed exclusively in B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Jabara1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, neither of these studies was designed to determine CD40-independent functions of TRAF6 in B cells.</p><p>There are difficulties associated with examining the role of different TRAFs in mature B cells using <italic>TRAF</italic> gene deletions. TRAF2-, 3-, 6-deficient mice die <italic>in utero</italic> or shortly after birth, suffering from multiple abnormalities in various organs. TRAF6-deficient mice develop osteopetrosis and occlusion of the bone marrow (BM) cavities from a lack of osteoclast function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Lomaga1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Naito1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The BM is an anatomically important site for early B cell development and for antibody production by plasma cells. Moreover, TRAF6-deficient mice lack lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004736-Naito1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and therefore cannot support normal T cell-B cell interactions during the course of an immune response. Not unexpectedly, there are very few splenic B cells in these mice (approximately 5&#x00025;, data not shown). Hence, analysis of the physiologic function of TRAF6 in B cells has not been amenable to genetic approaches.</p><p>In order to clarify the physiologic role of TRAF6 in the regulation of B cell development and function, we created B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice by crossing floxed TRAF6 mice (in which a <italic>TRAF6</italic> exon is flanked by <italic>lox</italic>P sites) with CD19-Cre mice. TRAF6 appears to influence several processes in B cell development and function. The mutant mice have fewer mature B cells in the BM and spleen and mount sub-optimal TD-antigen responses. Additionally, baseline IgM production as well as T cell-independent (TI) antigen-specific IgM production is severely impaired, most likely as a result of the complete absence of CD5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B-1 cells (B-1a cells) in the peritoneal cavity. Our findings suggest novel functions for TRAF6, which appears to be required for both B-1 and B-2 cell homeostasis and to play a role in both in TI and TD humoral immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice</title><p>In order to study the physiologic functions of TRAF6 in B lymphocytes, we generated B cell-specific TRAF6-deficient mice (TRAF6-&#x00394;B mice).
