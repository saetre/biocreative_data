We: 1) undertook the most comprehensive meta-analysis of genetic polymorphisms in ischemic stroke to date; 2) compared genetic determinants of ischemic stroke with those of ischemic heart disease, and 3) compared effect sizes of gene-stroke associations with those predicted from independent biochemical data using a mendelian randomization strategy. Electronic databases were searched up to January 2009. We identified: 1) 187 ischemic stroke studies (37,481 cases; 95,322 controls) interrogating 43 polymorphisms in 29 genes; 2) 13 meta-analyses testing equivalent polymorphisms in ischemic heart disease; and 3) for the top five gene-stroke associations, 146 studies (65,703 subjects) describing equivalent gene-biochemical relationships, and 28 studies (46,928 subjects) describing biochemical-stroke relationships. Meta-analyses demonstrated positive associations with ischemic stroke for factor V Leiden Gln506, ACE I/D, MTHFR C677T, prothrombin G20210A, PAI-1 5G allele and glycoprotein IIIa Leu33Pro polymorphisms (ORs: 1.11 &#x02013; 1.60). Most genetic associations show congruent levels of risk comparing ischemic stroke with ischemic heart disease, but three genes&#x02014;glycoprotein IIIa, PAI-1 and angiotensinogen&#x02014;show significant dissociations. The magnitudes of stroke risk observed for factor V Leiden, ACE, MTHFR and prothrombin, but not PAI-1, polymorphisms, are consistent with risks associated with equivalent changes in activated protein C resistance, ACE activity, homocysteine, prothrombin, and PAI-1 levels, respectively. Our results demonstrate causal relationships for four of the most robust genes associated with stroke while also showing that PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism influences cardiovascular risk via a mechanism not simply related to plasma levels of PAI-1 (or tPA) alone.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stroke is one of the leading causes of death, disability, and health finance cost in both developed and developing world countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Johnston1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Understanding the genetic contributions to ischemic stroke is important not only so as to explain, or predict, the minority of cases that occur in the absence of well-established risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension and diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Chiuve1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, but also to account for wide variability of stroke incidence within individuals who do harbour these common, acquired risk-factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Arason1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, appreciating the biochemical basis for risk-associated genes can motivate novel therapeutic strategies, including pharmacogenomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Arnett1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As the cumulative number of studies reporting positive genetic associations with stroke increases, the main challenges are deciding which associations are reliable and robust, and then deciphering the role of putative gene effects in terms of causation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Ioannidis1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The present study attempts to address these issues by firstly, presenting the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date of all candidate genetic polymorphisms associated with ischemic stroke. Secondly, we relate these observed gene effect sizes with those predicted from pathophysiologically-related studies.</p><p>Since many of the candidate genes tested for an association with ischemic stroke have originated from studies in ischemic heart disease, and given overlapping pathophysiologies of these two diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Fisher1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, it is meaningful to investigate whether specific genetic polymorphisms associate with clinical arteriopathic syndromes in general, e.g. due to a tendency to stiffen arteries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Kingwell1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, or whether certain genes exert organ-specific effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Jood1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Rao1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, where positive associations do exist between genes and stroke it is critical to validate whether these effects are consistent with the risks attributed to their putative biological intermediates. For example, if a stroke-associated gene is also associated with a prothrombotic tendency, then does the degree of thrombophilia imparted by the genotype-in-question associate with a similar degree of risk of stroke, using independent data sets? We attempted to answer this question for all robust positive gene associations using a method based upon mendelian randomization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Casas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ischemic Stroke Candidate Gene Meta-Analysis</title><p>We identified 187 candidate genetic polymorphism case-control studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009136.s002">References S1</xref>), incorporating 37,481 ischemic stroke cases and 95,322 controls that fulfilled the inclusion criteria.

The results of these calculations for expected risk of the genotype comparisons of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009136-g016">Figure 16</xref>, 4<sup>th</sup> column) were then compared with the observed risk for each of the same genotype contrasts, based upon data used in the first part of this paper (5<sup>th</sup> column).</p><p>As an example, Factor V Leiden 506 mutation ArgGln, relative to wild-type ArgArg, is associated with a weighted mean average of 0.74 APTT ratio decrease in the activated protein C resistance test in healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009136-g010">Figure 10, upper</xref>). Independent data from ischemic stroke case &#x02013; control studies suggest that a 0.74 decrease in APTT ratio using the same test is associated with a risk odds-ratio of 1.31 (1.11 &#x02013; 1.54) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009136-g010">Figure 10, lower</xref>). This estimated OR is very close to the observed OR of 1.30 (1.11 &#x02013; 1.51) noted from our earlier meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009136-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>For each of the gene &#x02013; biomarker pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009136-g016">Figure 16</xref>), the mean level of expected risk fell close to, and certainly within the 95&#x00025; confidence intervals, the observed risk, with the exception of PAI-1. For this latter pairing, the expected risk of the genotype comparison 5G5G vs 4G4G based upon PAI-1 levels was significantly lower than that observed. This arose because whilst PAI-1 levels are found to be higher in stroke than in controls, the 5G5G genotype &#x02013; that itself is associated with elevated stroke risk relative to 4G4G - was associated with a &#x0223c;25&#x00025; reduction in PAI-1 levels relative to 4G4G. This result was unaffected by whether PAI-1 levels were derived from antigen concentration or enzyme activity data. We also estimated expected stroke risk on the basis of tPA levels, and its relationship with the PAI-1 4G/5G genotype. The 5G5G relative to 4G4G genotype was associated with a slight, albeit non-significant, increase in tPA levels, which itself is independently associated with stroke. However, the expected stroke risk using tPA data was also less than that observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study takes a meta-analytic approach to identify the totality of candidate genetic polymorphisms reliably associated with ischemic stroke.

In order to increase reliability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Ioannidis1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> we confined our results to gene variants studied in over 1000 patients, and to studies where ischemic stroke was confirmed radiologically, and that were based predominantly in Caucasian adults. We discounted studies where there was publication bias, and applied random-effects models to allow for between-study heterogeneity. After applying these criteria we found positive associations with polymorphisms in the following six genes: Factor V Leiden, ACE, MTHFR, prothrombin, PAI-1, and glycoprotein-III.</p><p>As well as identifying two further genetic associations not identified reliably in our earlier meta-analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Casas3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, our study supports the validity of the meta-analysis technique by finding very similar effect sizes for the four positive associations identified previously in the face of an increase in patient numbers by approximately 50&#x00025;.

The sum of the population attributable risks across all the gene associations identified here was &#x0223c;30&#x00025;. These results are in keeping with models of common complex diseases in which relatively small numbers of common polymorphisms, each with only small hazard ratios, can account for large proportions of population attributable risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Yang1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, certain well-described single-gene mutations may confer a high relative risk of stroke, e.g. CADASIL, but contribute very little to overall stroke occurrence by virtue of their rarity.</p><p>It is likely that future discovery of disease-associated genes will rest increasingly with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rather than candidate-gene strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Ikram1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, the recent finding from genome-wide searches that polymorphisms on chromosome 9p are associated with myocardial infarction, has prompted preliminary testing of the same polymorphisms in ischemic stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Matarn1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Karvanen1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, we found that an increasing proportion of recruited cases to candidate-gene studies over time are testing genetic polymorphisms that, after pooling over large numbers, fail to show associations. This is unlikely to reflect a publication bias towards positive results amongst earlier publications since we found no association between effect magnitude, or sample size, and publication date; moreover, the summary ORs for candidate polymorphisms have not changed significantly over five years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Casas3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In the last two years the overall number of candidate-gene studies, and recruited patients, has fallen that may reflect increasing inefficiency in selecting candidate genes and increased employment of GWAS strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Comparison of Genetic Effects with Ischemic Heart Disease</title><p>Given overlapping pathological substrates for ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke, as well as a common set of acquired risk factors and treatment strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Ikram1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, we expected a broadly similar set, and relative strength, of genetic associations. For the majority of polymorphisms reported here this is what was found. Polymorphisms were found to impose similar degrees of risk for ischemic heart disease and stroke, or were found to show no associations for both. In some cases, a similar risk was found for both disease types, but significance was only achieved for ischemic heart disease, probably due to inadequate power of pooled stroke studies.</p><p>Three genetic polymorphisms tested in both ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke showed differing effects between diseases that did not seem to arise from inadequate power in either group. We are cautious in our interpretation of these apparent disease &#x02018;dissociations&#x02019; as the two sets of meta-analyses are not strictly controlled for confounders such as age, sex, or co-morbidities, and case ascertainment methods differ, as are likely to be the thresholds at which coronary versus cerebrovascular ischemia manifest themselves clinically. Nevertheless, both our meta-analyses in stroke, and those cited in heart disease, are based predominantly in non-selective Caucasian adult populations; required both clinical and confirmatory diagnostic procedures; and checked for publication bias. Furthermore, in the cases of PAI-1 and angiotensinogen polymorphisms, it is difficult to account for how the same genotype could produce <italic>opposite</italic> effects on risk comparing the two disease types on the basis of confounding or bias alone.</p><p>Further studies, ideally within the same populations, will be needed to confirm whether these three gene-disease dissociations are real, or whether they reflect methodological differences. The fact that these dissociations relate to proteins in three different physiological systems, viz. platelets (glycoprotein IIIa), clotting (PAI-1) and blood pressure (angiotensinogen) - for which there also polymorphisms showing concordant disease effects, e.g. glycoprotein 1b-alpha, factor V Leiden and ACE, respectively &#x02013; suggests that differences in risk-profile between ischemic heart disease and stroke cannot be attributed simply to a single pathophysiology e.g. hypertension. Differences between ischemic stroke and heart disease in terms of these three pathophysiologies has support from other sources. For example, ischemic stroke relative to ischemic heart disease has a stronger relationship with hypertension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Kannel1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Law1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, whilst the protective profile of anti-platelet and thrombolytic drugs differs between these two diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Ikram1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Wolff1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

The method used here was based upon mendelian randomization in which one starts with an observational association between an environmental (e.g. biochemical) factor and disease, and then secondarily investigates whether a concordant level of risk occurs for a genotype that simulates the environmental factor - thereby making a stronger case for the factor being causative of the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-DaveySmith1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In the current paper, we start with positive gene-stroke associations and then subsequently interrogate independent biochemical data with the expectation of finding concordant levels of risk.</p><p>For the four strongest positive gene-stroke associations&#x02013; factor V Leiden, MTHFR, ACE and prothrombin - concordance between observed risk and that predicted from their associated biochemical changes was found. Moreover, the mean levels of predicted and observed risks for these genotypes lay very close to each other. Importantly therefore, we show here, for the first time, that the four genetic variants most reliably associated with ischemic stroke are also associated with biochemical changes that themselves are related to equivalent levels of risk. This concordance both validates our original gene &#x02013; stroke positive associations, and furthermore, suggests that the risk imparted by each genotype variant is the direct consequences of each gene's understood biochemical actions. The fact that each of these genes exerts biochemical or haematological changes that are measurable systemically (i.e. from venous plasma samples), rather than being specifically cerebrovascularly based, is in keeping with our other finding that these four gene variants exert similar levels of risk on ischemic heart disease as on ischemic stroke. In the case of the concordant relationship between MTHFR genotype and homocysteine in their separate associations with stroke risk, we have replicated our earlier findings in the face of more than a fourfold increase in meta-analysis size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Casas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to concordant gene-biochemical risk estimates observed for the four largest genetic associations, we observed a discordant gene &#x02013; biochemical relationship for the PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism. Specifically, the variant 5G5G, relative to 4G4G, was associated with an elevated risk of ischemic stroke, but <italic>decreased</italic> PAI levels. However, in separate case-control studies, stroke - as well as atherothrombosis and ischemic cardiac disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Hamsten1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Thgersen1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> - is associated with <italic>increased</italic> PAI-1 levels. Indeed we saw earlier how in ischemic heart disease, it is the 4G allele - associated with higher PAI-1 levels &#x02013; that is associated with risk. The expected risk of stroke of the 4G/5G PAI polymorphism was also less than that observed using tPA levels, that are strongly influenced by PAI-1 levels.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the apparent PAI-1 gene-biochemical paradox in the case of stroke. Firstly, it is possible that the PAI-1 5G allele association with stroke is false, e.g. because of reporting bias. However, it is unclear why such a false association should emerge in the opposite direction to that expected from ischemic cardiac disease and PAI-1 level data, and Egger's regression test argues against publication bias here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Egger1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Secondly, the finding that 5G polymorphism depresses PAI-1 levels over the course of the subject's life may have different pathophysiological implications, e.g. by predisposing to stroke, than the same depression of PAI-1 levels found at a single point in later life, when this is found to be protective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-DaveySmith1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. A third possibility is that the PAI-1 genetic 4G/5G polymorphism is associated with a brain-specific factor that influences stroke more strongly than does its actions on PAI-1 levels. This may occur because of linkage disequilibrium with an as-yet unidentified gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Attia1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, or because of pleiotropy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-DaveySmith1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, while raised PAI-1 levels in plasma may raise thrombotic risk, raised PAI-1 levels in carotid vessel wall may serve to stabilise atheromatous plaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Hoekstra1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. If the PAI 4G/5G polymorphism influences both tissue and plasma PAI-1 levels, whilst the latter is also unduly influenced by environmental variables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Henry1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, this could explain the paradox. Furthermore, postulating that PAI-1 4G/5G exerts different phenotypic effects on cerebral versus other vascular beds might explain why its influences on ischemic stroke and ischemic heart disease are in opposite directions.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study provides a comprehensive meta-analysis of common genetic polymorphisms associated with ischemic stroke that were identified through the candidate gene approach.

For example, for the ACE polymorphism we searched for: 1) (<italic>ACE</italic> OR <italic>angiotensin converting enzyme</italic>) AND (<italic>gene</italic> OR <italic>genetic</italic> OR <italic>genotype</italic> OR <italic>polymorphism</italic> OR <italic>mutation</italic>), in combination with (<italic>ACE</italic> OR <italic>angiotensin converting enzyme</italic>) AND (<italic>activity</italic> OR <italic>level</italic>); and 2) (<italic>ACE</italic> OR <italic>angiotensin converting enzyme</italic>) AND (<italic>activity</italic> OR <italic>level</italic>) in conjunction with (<italic>cerebrovascular disease</italic> OR <italic>brain infarction</italic> OR <italic>stroke</italic> OR <italic>cerebral ischemia</italic>). As for part 1, we restricted studies to those based in adults from predominantly Caucasian populations.</p><p>From these two sets of studies we performed two types of analyses: 1) From the first set of studies we extracted from each the difference in levels (or biological activity) of the IP between the two homozygous variants, or between the wild-type and heterozygous variants in cases of dominant polymorphisms. These values were entered into a meta-analysis to obtain a weighted mean average using a random-effects model. For those IPs where different measurement units had been employed between studies (viz. ACE activity; prothrombin levels, plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 levels and tissue plasminogen activator levels) we calculated the percentage change for the rarer, relative to the commoner, genotype. 2) From the second set of studies we obtained an OR of ischemic stroke for a given change in the level of that IP used in the first analysis. Where studies reported different ORs for different ranges of IP level, we chose the OR reported for the range closest to that applying to the control group (i.e. healthy population). The ORs between studies were pooled using a generic inverse variance procedure in which the logarithms of the ORs are weighted according to variance in a random-effects model. Since the ORs reported between these studies usually refer to different amounts of IP change, we first scaled the OR values for each study in proportion to the pooled change in IP level for the genotype comparison of interest (from the first analysis) assuming a log-linear relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009136-Casas1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. For the relationship between homocysteine levels and ischemic stroke we used a summary OR from a previous meta-analysis <xref ref-type="bibr"
