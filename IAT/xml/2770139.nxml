IL-1 can act on several different hematopoietic cell types and plays a role in regulating their proliferation and differentiation, depending on the target cell and the presence of additional cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. IL-1 has also been shown to play a role in the migration and radioprotection of immature hematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], indicating its versatile role within the hematopoietic system. Moreover, IL-1 plays an important role in inflammatory reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. IL-1 is a potent inducer of fever and acute phase response in the adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and importantly, IL-1 has been implicated in several inflammatory-related diseases, such rheumatoid arthritis, the neurodegenerative Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The regulation of these different biological processes by IL-1 is mediated via signalling from the IL-1RI towards downstream signalling pathways, including the NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Signalling via NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B members results in the regulated expression of various genes including those of cytokines and receptors involved in hematopoiesis and inflammation, as well as apoptosis and cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B signalling induced by IL-1 in concert with other signals from the IL-1R and other cytokine receptors determines the biological outcome of the IL-1 induced response.</p><p>Activation of the NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B pathway by IL-1 is mediated via the transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) activated kinase 1 (TAK1; also known as mitogen activated protein 3 kinase 7 (MAP3K7)) together with three TAK1 binding proteins (TAB1, TAB2 and TAB3). TAB1 is a regulator of TAK1 kinase activity and is widely expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. TAB2 was originally reported as an adapter protein required for the recruitment of TAK1 and TRAF6 to the IL-1 receptor. More recent studies showed that TAB2 plays a similar role in the LPS, Toll and TNF signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. TAB3 is highly homologous to TAB2 and also functions as an adapter protein linking TAK1 to similar receptors as reported for TAB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The role for TAB2 as an adapter protein has been questioned by more recent studies with TAB2 deficient cells and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Upon IL-1 stimulation, TAB2-deficient cells responded similarly to wildtype cells in the expression of IL-1 target genes and the activation of the cytoplasmic JNK and NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B signaling pathways.</p><p>Besides its role as a TAK1 adapter protein, another role for TAB2 was provided by studies in which TAB2 was shown to act as modulator of NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B-mediated gene activation in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Upon IL-1 stimulation, TAB2 was transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and TAB2-mediated repression of NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B target genes was thereby relieved. Altogether, these different studies show that TAB2 could be playing different roles in IL-1 receptor signaling and NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B-mediated gene regulation depending on the subcellular localization of TAB2.</p><p>Although the cellular pattern associated with IL-1 receptor expression and NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B activation in the adult mouse tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] is known, little information is available concerning the expression pattern of TAB2 or the role it plays in physiological processes. As the expression pattern of TAB2 could provide more insight into its <italic>in vivo</italic> role in IL-1 and NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B signaling, we studied the TAB2 expression in the adult mouse. Protein analysis revealed TAB2 expression in all adult tissues examined, with a distinctive spatial expression of TAB2 in brain, thymus and spleen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mice, cell enrichment and cell culture</title><p>Animals were housed according to institutional guidelines, with free access to water and food.

To confirm that we were indeed detecting TAB2, to verify its molecular weight and to determine its subcellular localization, we generated HA-tagged mTAB2 constructs that could be used for overexpression studies. Transient overexpression of HA-tagged full length and N-terminally truncated mTAB2 constructs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) in 3T3 fibroblast or CHO cells was followed by Western blotting to detect the HA-tagged proteins. As a positive control for the HA antibody, we used a lysate from cells expressing HA-tagged Oct6 protein. As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, the protein lysate from HA-mTAB2 full length transfected cells yielded a band on Western blot with a molecular weight of approximately 80 kD, consistent with the expected size of the mTAB2 protein with the HA-tag (76 kD plus 3 kD). Additionally, overexpression of the truncated HA-mTAB2C construct yielded the expected smaller protein product (approximately 37 kD) on Western blot. <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>HA-mTAB2 overexpression in cell lines.

No clear difference in subcellular localization was observed between the truncated and the full-length mTAB2 protein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>mTAB2 protein is expressed in adult mouse tissues</title><p>Previously we reported that the TAB2 gene (Map3k7ip2) is transcribed in all adult mouse tissues ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]: see also Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). To determine whether the mTAB2 protein is expressed similarly, we performed Western blot analysis for mTAB2 using cell lysates from adult mouse tissues. We used two commercially available antibodies successfully used by others to detect endogenous TAB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Both &#x003b1;-TAB2 antibodies yielded similar results on Western blots. We detected a protein band with a molecular weight of approximately 76 kD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Based on the HA-tagged TAB2 protein size (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), we conclude that the 76 kD band corresponds to TAB2. High levels of TAB2 protein are present in the non-hematopoietic tissues &#x02014; liver, kidney and heart (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, top panels). A longer exposure of the blot was necessary to obtain bands of similar intensity in the other tested tissues. Relatively lower levels of TAB2 protein are present in hematopoietic tissues &#x02014; BM, spleen and thymus &#x02014; and the brain and lungs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, lower panels).

Cryosections of several adult mouse tissues were incubated with TAB2 antibody and staining was visualized with the peroxidase substrate DAB chromogen. For these analyses we used the two different TAB2 antibodies which both gave similar TAB2 expression patterns in the tissues tested. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin to visualize individual cells and the overall morphology of the tissues.</p><p>In coronal adult brain sections, TAB2 is expressed in cells scattered throughout the grey matter of the cerebellum. High expression is observed in cells in the outer layers of the cortex, excluding the outermost layer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). The expressing cortical cells are mainly neuronal and almost all these cells express TAB2. The highest percentage of TAB2 expressing cells is localized immediately beneath the outermost layer of the cortex. Interestingly, TAB2 staining overlaps with the nuclear hematoxylin staining (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>), suggesting that in neuronal cells of the adult brain TAB2 protein is predominantly in the nucleus. In addition, in the midgestation mouse embryo, high TAB2 protein expression is detected in the dorsal root ganglia, the lateral motor column and in nerve tissue near the neural tube (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). <fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>TAB2 is expressed in the adult mouse in neuronal and hematopoietic tissues.

The white pulp is separated from the red pulp by the marginal zone, where macrophages are localized. In the spleen, we observed TAB2 expression in the endothelium of the blood vessels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>, arrow heads), most likely the central arterioles and the trabecular arteries (those vessels containing blood cells entering the spleen). No expression was found in the sinusoids (where blood cells re-enter circulation). Expression of TAB2 at lower levels was also observed in small mononuclear cells scattered throughout the spleen (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>, arrows) and in larger granular macrophage-like cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>, arrow heads). Most of these TAB2 expressing cells are located near blood vessels or at the border of the white and red pulp areas, the marginal zone.</p><p>The thymus is also an important lymphoid tissue and can be morphologically separated into the outer cortex, which contains less differentiated lymphocytes, and the inner medulla area, which contains more mature differentiated lymphocytes. Similar to the spleen, TAB2 expression in the thymus is observed in the endothelium of blood vessels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4I</xref>, arrow heads). Some cells with the morphology of lymphocytes also appear to express low levels of TAB2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>, arrow). Additionally, a low percentage of cells scattered throughout both the cortex and the medulla regions show TAB2 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4I</xref>, arrow heads). This small population of TAB2 expressing cells may represent macrophages.</p><p>TAB2 expression was also found in the endothelium of blood vessels and some bronchioli in the adult lung (low levels; data not shown). No TAB2 expression was observed throughout the myocardial tissue of the heart, but clear TAB2 expression was observed in the endothelium of blood vessels and in some cells located near blood vessels (data not shown). Due to high levels of background staining in the liver and kidney, we could not determine the TAB2 expression pattern in these tissues. Hence, TAB2 protein is highly expressed in endothelial cells lining blood vessels of most adult tissues examined. TAB2 is also expressed in neuronal cells of the adult brain and in some cells in the lymphoid tissues of the adult, the spleen and thymus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>TAB2 is localized in the cytoplasm of adult bone marrow and spleen cells</title><p>Previously, we reported TAB2 protein expression in the major hematopoietic tissues during early mouse development (AGM region and fetal liver) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study we investigated whether TAB2 is expressed in the bone marrow (BM), the main site of hematopoiesis in the adult. We performed RT-PCR analysis for TAB1, TAB2 TAB3 and TAK1 expression on adult BM cells separated into two hematopoietic fractions; mature (lineage maker positive) and immature (lineage maker negative) fractions. Expression of all three TAB genes and the TAK1gene was observed in both BM fractions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p>Next we examined adult BM populations for TAB2 protein expression by performing immunofluorescence analysis on cytospins of sorted hematopoietic (CD45<sup>+</sup>) and non-hematopoietic (CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) cells. TAB2 protein is expressed in most BM cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).

Original magnification 400&#x000d7;.</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="11_2006_Article_6058_Fig6" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p>Similarly, adult spleen cells unsorted (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">H</xref>) and sorted in CD45<sup>+</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">L</xref>) and CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6O</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">P</xref>) fractions were examined for TAB2 expression. Most splenocytes and cells in both the hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic fractions expressed TAB2. TAB2 expression appeared to be localized to the cytoplasm and in rare cells, in the nucleus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">P</xref>, arrows). Hence, TAB2 protein is expressed in adult BM and spleen predominantly in the cytoplasmic compartment of most cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>TAB2 expression pattern in the adult mouse</title><p>By Western blot analysis, we observed widespread TAB2 expression, consistent with our results showing widespread TAB2 mRNA expression in adult mouse tissues. We have shown here that TAB2 protein is expressed in all adult mouse tissues tested. Interestingly, in the adult mouse IL-1RI and IL-1RII proteins are also expressed widely and at high levels in non-hematopoietic tissues and at low levels in lymphoid tissues. Although TAK1 has been subject of a few expression studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], until our study, little was known about TAB protein expression patterns.</p><p>By immunostaining, we detected TAB2 expression in most adult tissues &#x02014; in specific cerebellar locations in the brain; in the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the spleen, thymus and heart; and in hematopoietic cells of the BM, spleen and thymus. Interestingly, the spatial expression pattern of TAB2 in adult mouse tissues shows many similarities with the previously reported IL-1R expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] as well as with the reported <italic>in vivo</italic> NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B activity pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Schmidt-Ullrich et al. analysed a transgenic mouse model containing a NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B-responsive promoter driving expression of the lacZ reporter gene and showed NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B activity in the adult mouse brain in a scattered pattern in the outer layers of the cerebellum. Moreover, the endothelial cells of several blood vessels and scattered cells in the spleen and thymus were lacZ positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The expression pattern of NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B activity also shows striking similarities to the TAB2 expression pattern in the embryo, thus suggesting that TAB2 expression, IL-1 signaling and NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B activity <italic>in vivo</italic> may be closely related. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This is supported by our studies in the early mouse embryo showing that the TAB2 expression pattern in the dorsal aorta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] overlaps with the IL-1RI expression pattern (Orelio et al. submitted).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>The subcellular localization of TAB2 suggests multiple functions</title><p>To date, TAB2 was shown to play a role in vitro as an adapter protein in the receptor proximal signalling events of the pro-inflammatory IL-1 and of several TNF-family members. These studies show that TAB2 is involved in the activation of the NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B pathway via the binding to ubiquitinated TRAF2 and TRAF6 in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. More recent studies with TAB2 deficient cells (Sanjo et al. 2003; Shim et al. 2005) were unable to confirm this crucial role for TAB2 in NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B activation. This is most likely due to redundancy of TAB2 function with its highly homologous family member, TAB3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, TAB2 deficiency <italic>in vivo</italic> does result in an embryonic lethal phenotype, suggesting that TAB2 plays other important, non-redundant roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Some insight into the other functions of TAB2 was provided by TAB2 deficient cells. In these cells it has been observed that IL-1 induced NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B DNA binding activity is higher than in wild type cells, suggesting that TAB2 plays an inhibiting role in the regulation of NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recent studies have confirmed a crucial role for TAB2 in the repression of NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B-mediated gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and have thereby confirmed that TAB2 has crucial nuclear function.</p><p>In this study we have found both a cytoplasmic and the nuclear localization of HA tagged TAB2 in overexpressing CHO cells. Preliminary studies examining the subcellular localization of endogenous TAB2 protein in cell lines, also show TAB2 protein localization in both compartments (unpublished data). In contrast, our immunostaining data presented here shows mainly a cytoplasmic localization of endogenous TAB2 expression in most adult BM and spleen cells. However, rare cells in the BM (endothelial, myeloid) may also contain nuclear TAB2. Thus, careful analysis of specific lineages of TAB2 expressing cells in specific tissues is required before it can be concluded whether TAB2 expression in one or both of the compartments is related to different functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. This will also require knowledge of the specific expression pattern of the other TAB family members to determine whether there is functional redundancy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>The TAB2 expression pattern suggests a role in inflammatory-related diseases</title><p>The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 has been shown to play a role in several inflammatory-related diseases, including the neurodegenerative Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. More interestingly, based on in vitro studies TAB2 has also been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease by regulating NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B-mediated gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To date, there are still large gaps in our understanding of the molecular processes that are playing a role <italic>in vivo</italic> in the pathogenesis of such diseases. Here we show that, similar to the IL-1 receptor, the IL-1 signalling component TAB2 is expressed in the brain and vascular endothelium. Future studies examining the co-expression of TAB2, IL-1 and its receptor and NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B activity will determine whether these components together play a pivotal role in the normal physiological regulation as well as in the pathogenesis of these tissues/cell types.</p><p>Taken together, the expression pattern and subcellular localization of TAB2 implicates it as an interesting regulator, perhaps serving different <italic>in vivo</italic> functions in various cell lineages most likely through the IL-1 and NF<sc>&#x003ba;</sc>B signalling pathways.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank D.
