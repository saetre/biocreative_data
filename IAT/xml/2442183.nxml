BK channels are thought to be regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) only through phospholipase C (PLC)&#x02013;generated PIP<sub>2</sub> metabolites that target Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stores and protein kinase C and, eventually, the BK channel. Here, we report that PIP<sub>2</sub> activates BK channels independently of PIP<sub>2</sub> metabolites. PIP<sub>2</sub> enhances Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-driven gating and alters both open and closed channel distributions without affecting voltage gating and unitary conductance. Recovery from activation was strongly dependent on PIP<sub>2</sub> acyl chain length, with channels exposed to water-soluble diC4 and diC8 showing much faster recovery than those exposed to PIP<sub>2</sub> (diC16). The PIP<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;channel interaction requires negative charge and the inositol moiety in the phospholipid headgroup, and the sequence RKK in the S6&#x02013;S7 cytosolic linker of the BK channel-forming (cbv1) subunit. PIP<sub>2</sub>-induced activation is drastically potentiated by accessory &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> (but not &#x003b2;<sub>4</sub>) channel subunits. Moreover, PIP<sub>2</sub> robustly activates BK channels in vascular myocytes, where &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits are abundantly expressed, but not in skeletal myocytes, where these subunits are barely detectable. These data demonstrate that the final PIP<sub>2</sub> effect is determined by channel accessory subunits, and such mechanism is subunit specific. In HEK293 cells, cotransfection of cbv1&#x0002b;&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and PI4-kinaseII&#x003b1; robustly activates BK channels, suggesting a role for endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> in modulating channel activity. Indeed, in membrane patches excised from vascular myocytes, BK channel activity runs down and Mg-ATP recovers it, this recovery being abolished by PIP<sub>2</sub> antibodies applied to the cytosolic membrane surface. Moreover, in intact arterial myocytes under physiological conditions, PLC inhibition on top of blockade of downstream signaling leads to drastic BK channel activation. Finally, pharmacological treatment that raises PIP<sub>2</sub> levels and activates BK channels dilates de-endothelized arteries that regulate cerebral blood flow. These data indicate that endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> directly activates vascular myocyte BK channels to control vascular tone.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: BK, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/voltage-gated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; C/A, cell-attached; DAG, diacylglycerol; DOG, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol; FA, fatty acids; GPCR, Gq-coupled receptor; HEDTA, 1.6 N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediamine-triacetic acid; I/O, inside-out; IP<sub>3</sub>, 1,4,5-trisphosphate; OA, okadaic acid; O/O, outside-out; PC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PIP<sub>2</sub>, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PPI, phosphoinositide; PS, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine; PSS, physiological saline solution; RT, reverse transcription; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; 4-AP, 4-aminopyridine.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Blood circulation depends on the myogenic tone of small, resistance-size arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meininger and Davis, 1992</xref>). While myogenic tone is regulated by endothelial, neuronal, and circulating factors, it is ultimately determined by the activity of ion channels and signaling molecules in the myocyte itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faraci and Heistad, 1998</xref>). Tone is increased by a rise in overall cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>) in the myocyte, which can be achieved by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx via depolarization-activated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels in the cell membrane and/or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaggar, 2001</xref>). Depolarization and increases in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> lead to activation of large-conductance, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/voltage-gated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (BK) channels, which generate outward currents that tend to hyperpolarize the membrane and thus close voltage-gated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels. Therefore, BK channel activation limits voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry and myocyte contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brayden and Nelson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaggar et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5&#x02013;bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) plays a key role as an intermediate molecule in many receptor-mediated signaling pathways, including those regulating myocyte contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tolloczko et al., 2002</xref>). PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis by PLC renders 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nahorski et al., 1994</xref>). IP<sub>3</sub> mobilizes sarcoplasmic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, while DAG activates PKC. Mobilized Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and activated PKC eventually regulate myocyte BK channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jaggar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaggar, 2001</xref>). It is thought that, by producing IP<sub>3</sub> and DAG, PIP<sub>2</sub> indirectly modulates BK channels, and thus myocyte contraction. However, PIP<sub>2</sub> also acts as a signaling molecule on its own through direct interaction with target proteins. In particular, PIP<sub>2</sub> directly modulates the activity of ion channels and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hilgemann and Ball, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan and Makielski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Runnels et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roh&#x000e1;cs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chemin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suh and Hille 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilgemann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roh&#x000e1;cs 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voets and Nilius, 2007</xref>). In spite of the key roles of PIP<sub>2</sub> and BK channels in cell excitability and signaling, it remains unknown whether PIP<sub>2</sub> can directly modulate BK channel function.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that PIP<sub>2</sub> directly (i.e., independently of PIP<sub>2</sub> metabolites and downstream signaling) increases BK channel steady-state activity, the pore-forming (cbv1) subunit being sufficient to sense the phosphoinositide (PPI). The cbv1&#x02013;PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction requires recognition of negative charges and the inositol moiety in the PIP<sub>2</sub> headgroup by a channel sequence that meets major criteria for a PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site. This interaction results in a drastic increase in the channel's apparent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity, with changes in both open and closed time distributions. PIP<sub>2</sub> action on cbv1 channels is drastically amplified by coexpression of the smooth muscle&#x02013;abundant, channel accessory &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, but not other (e.g., &#x003b2;<sub>4</sub>), subunit. PIP<sub>2</sub> robustly activates native BK channels in vascular myocytes where &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> is highly expressed, but not in skeletal myocytes, where &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> is barely detected. Using intact vascular myocytes under physiological conditions of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and voltage, we demonstrate that endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> plays a role in activating BK channels via the direct mechanism. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> levels dilates pressurized, resistance-size cerebral arteries, an effect that is prevented by selective BK channel block.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cerebral Artery Diameter Measurement and Myocyte Isolation</title><p>Sprague-Dawley rats (250 g) were decapitated, and middle cerebral and basilar arteries were isolated.

The diC4 and diC8 effect, however, differed from that of PIP<sub>2</sub> in two aspects. First, the potentiation of channel activity was much more robust for PIP<sub>2</sub> than those caused by the two more soluble analogues: 2,831 &#x000b1; 202, 308 &#x000b1; 56, and 230 &#x000b1; 34% of control for PIP<sub>2</sub>, diC8, and diC4, respectively. As discussed with inward rectifier K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roh&#x000e1;cs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2006</xref>), the increased effectiveness of PIP<sub>2</sub> in potentiating BK NP<sub>o</sub> likely reflects the increased partition of this hydrophobic analogue in the lipid environment and, eventually, more effective loading of the cell membrane with increased access to the channel target. Second, recovery from potentiation was much faster for diC4 and diC8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Conceivably, the fast relaxation of these analogues reflects elimination of bound diC4/diC8 monomers from a binding site(s) that is readily accessible from the aqueous phase. In contrast to diC4 and diC8, lipids with longer side chains such as PIP<sub>2</sub> are not only in monomeric but also (and mainly) in micellar form in the aqueous phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flanagan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, PIP<sub>2</sub> micelles can incorporate into the bilayer to form mixed micelles. Release of these micelles from the membrane should take times much longer than those corresponding to bound-monomer dissociation from a target site, resulting in slower channel recovery from activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roh&#x000e1;cs et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The increased NP<sub>o</sub> caused by PIP<sub>2</sub> application was not accompanied by any noticeable change in unitary current amplitude (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Slope unitary conductance remained constant in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> when evaluated across a voltage range at which the current was ohmic (&#x02212;60 to 40 mV in 1 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> and symmetric 130 mM K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>: 243 vs. 251 pS, control and PIP<sub>2</sub>). Thus, within this voltage range, any PIP<sub>2</sub> modification of macroscopic current should be attributed to PIP<sub>2</sub> action on NP<sub>o</sub>.</p><p>Because PIP<sub>2</sub> effects on NP<sub>o</sub> were recorded in cell-free patches (even &#x0003e;20 min after excision) in a highly buffered Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> solution containing no nucleotides, it is unlikely that cytosolic messengers mediate PIP<sub>2</sub> action. Rather, PIP<sub>2</sub> targets the BK channel itself, its proteolipid microenvironment, or a lipid&#x02013;protein interface. In contrast to I/O results, PIP<sub>2</sub> failed to consistently increase NP<sub>o</sub> when applied to the extra-patch membrane of C/A patches (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). This is consistent with the difficulty that a charged molecule (charge &#x02248; &#x02212;3 at physiological pH) may have in accessing a target located in the membrane within the pipette. The PIP<sub>2</sub> effect was also mild and inconsistent when the lipid was applied to the extracellular side of O/O patches (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The contrast between I/O and C/A or O/O results indicates that PIP<sub>2</sub> accesses its site of action most effectively from the cytosolic side of the membrane, where PIP<sub>2</sub> is naturally predominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laux et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Structural Determinants of PIP<sub>2</sub> Action</title><p>Negative charges and the position of the phosphates in the inositol ring are important for phosphoinositide interaction with Kir channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suh and Hille, 2005</xref>). In addition, the BK channel displays higher P<sub>o</sub> when reconstituted in lipid bilayers that include negatively charged phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we next probed phospholipids having different negative charges in their headgroups. Because PIP<sub>2</sub> chain length modified the magnitude and time course of BK channel activation (see previous section), we used lipid species having the same acyl chains. Dipalmitoyl chains were chosen because their length mimics that of phospholipid acyl chains prevalent in natural membranes. When applied to the intracellular side of I/O patches, all phosphoinositides readily increased NP<sub>o</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

Poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine itself, however, usually failed to readily (&#x0003c;3 min) modify NP<sub>o</sub> (unpublished data). Thus, poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine's blunting of PIP<sub>2</sub> action appears not to result from opposite modulation of NP<sub>o</sub> by the polycation and the negatively charged lipid. After 3 min of poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine application, BK NP<sub>o</sub> did decrease significantly (&#x02212;35 &#x000b1; 1.4%; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3).

Therefore, added to the negative charge, the inositol moiety favors channel activation.

This indicates that cbv1 and its immediate lipid environment are sufficient for PIP<sub>2</sub> activation of BK channels. Having established that headgroup negative charge plays a critical role in this action, we probed whether positively charged residues in cbv1 could recognize the negatively charged PIP<sub>2</sub>.

PIP<sub>2</sub> differential action on wt cbv1 vs. RKKcbv1AAA was also evident from single-channel data: PIP<sub>2</sub> caused a mild increase in RKKcbv1AAA NP<sub>o</sub>, which was drastically smaller than that in wt cbv1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Furthermore, exposing the mutant to increased PIP<sub>2</sub> (30 &#x003bc;M) raised NP<sub>o</sub> to &#x0223c;350% of control (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4), which is barely different from the response evoked by 10 &#x003bc;M PIP<sub>2</sub> in the mutant and significantly smaller than the response in wt cbv1. Therefore, the sequence RKK in the cbv1 S6&#x02013;S7 linker is involved in PIP<sub>2</sub> activation of the BK channel.</p><p>To determine whether PIP<sub>2</sub> activation of cbv1 channels specifically depends on the S6&#x02013;S7 RKK sequence or, rather, can also depend on positive amino acids located in other cbv1 cytosolic loops, we made the construct K239cbv1A. K239 is located in the S4&#x02013;S5 cytosolic loop and is thus readily accessible to PIP<sub>2</sub> negative charges when the phosphoinositide is applied to the cytosolic membrane leaflet. After expression in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, K239cbv1A rendered channel current events characteristic of BK (slo1) channels, such as high unitary conductance for K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1 A</xref>) and voltage dependence of channel gating (12.9 mV/e-fold change in channel activity) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Under conditions identical to those used in the studies of PIP<sub>2</sub> action on wt cbv1 and RKKcbv1AAA channels, PIP<sub>2</sub> potentiated K239A-mediated current when studied at both macroscopic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and single-channel levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Moreover, the magnitude of K239A channel activation in response to PIP<sub>2</sub> was identical to that observed with wt cbv1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Therefore, PIP<sub>2</sub> activation of cbv1 does not involve any positive amino acid residue that can be found in cbv1 cytosolic loops. Rather, the S6&#x02013;S7 RKK and its flanking sequence, which meet criteria for a PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site (see Discussion), appear specifically involved. As found with PIP<sub>2</sub>, PIP<sub>3</sub> action was also significantly blunted in RKKcbv1AAA, yet similar in wt cbv1 and the K239A mutant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>), suggesting a common site(s) of action for PIP<sub>2</sub> and PIP<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Notably, PIP<sub>2</sub> action on cbv1 expressed in oocytes was significantly smaller than that observed with native channels in myocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref> vs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>).

PIP<sub>2</sub> activation of cbv1 was consistently enhanced when &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> was coexpressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>).

Activated PLC via Gq, determined by either ligand binding to a Gq-coupled receptor (GPCR) or constitutive activity, cleaves PIP<sub>2</sub> into PIP<sub>3</sub>, IP3, and DAG. IP3 releases Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), raising Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>, whereas DAG activates PKC in the presence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. BK channel modulation by PKC and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> controls the degree of vascular myocyte contraction. Therefore, by generating DAG and IP3, PIP<sub>2</sub> indirectly modulates BK channels and, thus, vascular tone. We demonstrate that PIP<sub>2</sub> itself and other membrane phosphoinositides directly activate BK channels, that is, in the absence of cell integrity or organelles or in the continuous presence of cytosolic messengers. This activation involves the negative charges of the phosphoinositide headgroup and the sequence of positive residues RKK in the cbv1 S6&#x02013;S7 cytosolic linker. However, PIP<sub>2</sub> activation is drastically and distinctly amplified by the channel accessory subunit of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> type, which is abundantly expressed in smooth muscle. In intact myocytes, inhibition of PLC by U73122 increases paxilline-sensitive BK currents in the presence of a PI3 kinase blocker (wortmannin), PKC inhibitor (Ro 31-8220), and a selective blocker of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase (thapsigargin).

Therefore, the dramatic increase in BK current caused by PLC inhibition in addition to the PI3kinase block has to be primarily attributed to a direct PIP<sub>2</sub> activation of BK channels. Consistent with this interpretation, preincubation with paxilline precluded PI3kinase and/or PLC inhibition from affecting current (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, I and J</xref>).

This result indicates that cbv1 is sufficient to respond to PIP<sub>2</sub> and suggests that the subunit contains a PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site(s).</p><p>PIP<sub>2</sub> interacts with Kir channels at several intracellular sites, most of which have positively charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shyng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suh and Hille, 2005</xref>). Similarly, positive residues at the end of S6 are thought to contribute to the PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loussouarn et al., 2003</xref>). Positive residues at an equivalent location in TRP channels are also proposed for recognition of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roh&#x000e1;cs, 2007</xref>). It is noteworthy that Ala substitutions of RKK in the equivalent region of cbv1 drastically decreased PIP<sub>2</sub> action (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>) without modifying basic current phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Thus, the reduced PIP<sub>2</sub> action in the mutant is not due to an overall change in cbv1 protein conformation caused by the mutation. Rather, neutralization of RKK specifically prevents cbv1 from effectively sensing PIP<sub>2</sub>. Collectively, our data suggest that PIP<sub>2</sub> directly interacts with cbv1 at an RKK cluster via electrostatic interactions to activate BK channels. In the absence of crystallographic data of BK channels, it is not possible to determine whether the RKK cluster is an actual PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site or a transducing region that connects the channel gate with a PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site(s) located elsewhere in the cbv1 (&#x003b1;) subunit. From 25 crystallographic structures of proteins that bind PIP<sub>2</sub>, however, several major criteria for a PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site emerge: (1) it must contain at least two positively charged residues (Arg and Lys); (2) among these, at least one should be Arg; (3) the presence of at least one hydrophobic residue nearby; (4) involvement of at least five interacting residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosenhouse-Dantsker and Logothetis, 2007</xref>). Remarkably, the RKK and its nearby context in cbv1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) fulfill three out of these four criteria. While we did not test the fourth criterion, we note that the RKKcbv1AAA mutant is not completely insensitive to PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>), suggesting that residues other than the RKK triplet also play a role in PIP<sub>2</sub> sensing. Interestingly, cbv1 contains a large intracellular structure with 110 positive residues, many of which are potentially able to interact with membrane PIP<sub>2</sub>. Future studies using alanine scanning mutagenesis will help to clarify whether one or more of these residues are involved in PIP<sub>2</sub> regulation of BK channel activity.</p><p>A variety of BK &#x003b1; subunit isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of Slo1 have been identified in different tissues and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xie and McCobb, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salkoff et al., 2006</xref>), and their PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity remains to be determined. Following expression in <italic>X</italic>. oocytes, bslo (from bovine aorta) channel activity is significantly increased by acute exposure to brain phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, bslo subunits also contain the RKK sequence in their S6&#x02013;S7 cytosolic loop.</p><p>In contrast to Slo1, BK &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit cytosolic regions do not include RKK sequences. However, BK &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> cytosolic C and N ends both contain scattered, positively charged residues that are absent in BK &#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrens et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, we cannot currently rule out that PIP<sub>2</sub> occupation of additional binding sites located in BK &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> accessory subunits contributes to amplification of PIP<sub>2</sub> action on cbv1 activity by &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits. On the other hand, &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit-induced enhancement of the BK channel's apparent calcium sensitivity has been primarily attributed to changes in voltage-dependent gating of Slo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao and Cox, 2005</xref>), which occur with reduction in both gating charge and channel intrinsic open-to-closed equilibrium, and enhanced coupling between voltage sensing and channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Orio and Latorre, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Brenner, 2006</xref>). Disregarding the mechanistic underpinnings, amplification of PIP<sub>2</sub> action on cbv1 activity by BK &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits appears to indicate that conformational changes in cbv1 that occur upon PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction with RKK in the channel S6&#x02013;S7 cytosolic loop are functionally coupled to the channel voltage sensor movements.</p></sec><sec><title>PIP<sub>2</sub> Direct Activation of BK Channels Differs from that Caused by Other Negatively Charged Lipids</title><p>BK channel steady-state activity is regulated by negatively charged lipids other than PIP<sub>2</sub>, the best studied group being fatty acids (FA). FA direct activation of BK channels, however, differs from PIP<sub>2</sub>-induced activation in several critical aspects. First, FAs increase P<sub>o</sub> without a major effect, if any, on channel mean open time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarke et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, PIP<sub>2</sub> drastically enhances mean open time by stabilizing medium and long channel openings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Second, palmitoylcoenzyme-A (that is, &#x0201c;a membrane-impermeable fatty acid&#x0201d;) is effective only when applied to the extracellular membrane leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clarke et al., 2003</xref>). PIP<sub>2</sub>, however, activates BK channels by accessing the channel via its intracellular side (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), which likely allows phosphoinositide sensing by the RKK cluster of positive residues in the cytosolic S6&#x02013;S7 linker of the channel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;D</xref>). Third, FA action appears Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarke et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, PIP<sub>2</sub> increases activity through amplification of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>-driven gating. This mechanism is supported by the following observations: (a) PIP<sub>2</sub> action in solutions having zero nominal Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> plus 5 mM EGTA to chelate trace amounts of the metal is negligible (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>); (b) PIP<sub>2</sub> action is blunted by shielding negative charge with 300 mM Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the bath solution (Vaithianathan, T., P. Liu, and A. Dopico. 2006. <italic>Society for Neuroscience</italic>, <italic>Online</italic>. 627.5); (c) PIP<sub>2</sub> causes a parallel shift in the G/Gmax&#x02013;voltage plot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>); and (d) PIP<sub>2</sub> action is potentiated by &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, but not &#x003b2;<sub>4</sub>, subunits. Interestingly, PIP<sub>2</sub> readily and consistently activates BK channels only if applied to the cytosolic side of the channel, where the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensors are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Finally, BK channel activation by arachidonic acid and analogues has recently been linked to the ability of these FAs to remove &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>- or &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-mediated BK inactivation. Thus, these FAs fail to modulate slo1 channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, we demonstrate that (a) the BK channel-forming subunit is sufficient for PIP<sub>2</sub> action; (b) this action is amplified by &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits, which do not introduce channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meera et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner et al., 2000</xref>), and (c) PIP<sub>2</sub> action is poor on native skeletal muscle BK channels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) where &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> subunits are significantly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrens et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>As found here with PIP<sub>2</sub>, lithocholate and other structurally related cholane derivatives directly increase BK NP<sub>o</sub> by modifying both open and closed time distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bukiya et al., 2007</xref>). Differing from PIP<sub>2</sub> action, however, lithocholate fails to activate cbv1 channels even at concentrations that are maximally effective on native BK or cbv1&#x0002b;&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> channels; the presence of the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit is required for lithocholate to activate BK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bukiya et al., 2007</xref>). In conclusion, PIP<sub>2</sub> direct activation of BK channels shows unique structural and functional features when compared with the direct activation of these channels by other negatively charged lipids.</p></sec><sec><title>Pathophysiological Implications</title><p>Our study demonstrates for the first time that BK channels belong to the group of ion channels that PIP<sub>2</sub> directly regulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hilgemann and Ball, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan and Makielski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Runnels et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roh&#x000e1;cs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chemin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suh and Hille, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilgemann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roh&#x000e1;cs 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voets and Nilius, 2007</xref>). An important addition to current knowledge on PIP<sub>2</sub> regulation of ion channels is that the final PIP<sub>2</sub> effect is critically determined by channel accessory subunits, and such a mechanism can be subunit specific. Moreover, the differential expression of BK accessory subunits across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrens et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orio et al., 2002</xref>) raises the possibility that a direct PIP<sub>2</sub> modulation of BK channel function is specifically relevant in tissues where the &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit is highly expressed. Indeed, while PIP<sub>2</sub> robustly activates native BK channels in vascular smooth muscle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), where &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits are highly expressed, it mildly activates native BK channels in skeletal muscle, where &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits are barely detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behrens et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate a new mechanism for modulating BK currents in cerebrovascular smooth muscle: PIP<sub>2</sub> direct modulation of BK channel gating. Our data, obtained with recombinant proteins, cells, and intact arteries from the cerebrovascular system, opens the possibility of determining the role of the direct interaction between PIP<sub>2</sub> and BK channels in pathophysiological processes leading to disease, such as cerebrovascular spasm and ischemic stroke. Moreover, determining the structural requirements in PIP<sub>2</sub> and the BK complex for modulating channel function may pave the way for designing new agents to control myogenic tone.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Donald Hilgemann for helpful criticism and David Armbruster for critically reading the manuscript.</p><p>This work was supported by grants AA11560 and HL77424 (A.
