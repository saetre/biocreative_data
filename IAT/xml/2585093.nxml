During penicillin induced persistence of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, HtrA levels (as a ratio of LPS) were initially less than control acute cultures (20 h post infection) but increased to more than acute cultures at 44 h post infection. This was unlike IFN-&#x003b3; persistence where lower levels of HtrA were observed, suggesting <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis </italic>IFN-&#x003b3; persistence does not involve a broad stress response.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The heterologous heat shock protection for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and increased HtrA during cell wall disruption via penicillin and heat shock, indicates an important role for HtrA during high protein stress conditions for <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>HtrA is a highly conserved serine protease and chaperone found in both eukaryote and prokaryote organisms (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>Escherichia </italic>(<italic>E.) coli htrA </italic>was identified as essential for growth at temperatures higher than 42&#x000b0;C (<underline>h</underline>igh <underline>t</underline>emperature <underline>r</underline>equirement) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and as the locus required for <underline>deg</underline>radation of misfolded <underline>p</underline>roteins (hence it is also referred to as DegP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. HtrA has since been reported to be a periplasmic protease and chaperone during <italic>E. coli </italic>extracytoplasmic stress response, with a structural temperature switch to mediate between these two activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. HtrA has important functions for virulence and stress resistance in a variety of bacteria (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). Recently we characterised purified recombinant HtrA from <italic>Chlamydia </italic>(<italic>C</italic>.) <italic>trachomatis </italic>L2, demonstrating that it had biochemical features typical of a HtrA protease, and critically, that it was capable of both protease and chaperone activities at physiologically relevant temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The protease activity was temperature activated (&#x02265; 34&#x000b0;C) and specific for unfolded proteins. However, the physiological function of HtrA during the developmental cycle of <italic>Chlamydia </italic>is currently unknown.</p><p><italic>Chlamydia </italic>is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen, which is unable to be genetically manipulated, making traditional approaches such as gene deletion studies currently impossible. The bacterium undergoes a unique biphasic developmental cycle consisting of small (0.2 &#x003bc;m) extracellular, metabolically in-active, infectious particles called elementary bodies (EBs) and larger (0.8 &#x003bc;m&#x02013;1.0 &#x003bc;m) intracellular, metabolically active particles termed reticulate bodies (RBs) (approximately 12&#x02013;36 h post infection (PI) for <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>L2) (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). The RBs asynchronously reorganise back to EBs to enable continued infections. <italic>htrA </italic>expression may occur throughout much of the developmental cycle of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, as transcripts for the gene were detected from 8 h to 40 h PI, with much higher expression levels occurring later in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>Chlamydia </italic>can also enter a persistent phase of development whereby the RBs morphologically and metabolically adapt to remain indefinitely within the host cells, often in response to nutrient deprivation or other stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Persistence induced by the presence of the cytokine IFN-&#x003b3;, thought to correlate with <italic>in vivo </italic>chronic infections, has been widely used in laboratory studies to investigate the molecular basis of persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Depletion of host cell pools of tryptophan via IFN-&#x003b3; induction of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, the first enzyme in the catabolism of this amino acid has been characterised as the mechanism leading to persistence of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The IFN-&#x003b3; persistent <italic>Chlamydia </italic>typically are larger morphologically altered RBs, with fewer cells present in each inclusion and do not produce EBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The effect of IFN-&#x003b3; treatment on <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>transcriptome was analysed by Belland and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], who reported that HtrA transcript levels during IFN-&#x003b3; persistence were approximately 2 fold less than acute conditions at 24 h PI and were present at similar levels to acute cultures at 48 h PI. The gene for the major outer membrane protein (<italic>ompA </italic>gene, MOMP) transcript was also reduced during IFN-&#x003b3; persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. MOMP and LPS proteins were reported to decrease during IFN-&#x003b3; persistent cultures of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>although the decrease was most noticeable at time points beyond the scope of this investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast, HtrA protein levels increased during IFN-&#x003b3; persistent infection models with <italic>C. pneumoniae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, a key role of HtrA during heat stress was also suggested by the detection of 9.6 fold increased levels of HtrA during a proteomic analysis of heat shock response in <italic>C. pneumoniae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Penicillin is also known to induce persistence of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>by inhibition of binary fission of RBs from approximately 12 hours into development, although chromosome and plasmid replication continues, and enlarged RBs are formed in large inclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In the absence of a transformation system, genomic and proteomic approaches have been used to probe the function of many genes throughout the developmental cycle and persistence cultures of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. In the present study, we have analysed <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>L2 HtrA during development, persistence, and heat shock conditions using polyclonal sera generated against purified recombinant HtrA to test the protein levels by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The ability of the <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>L2 <italic>htrA </italic>to complement the heat sensitive phenotype of <italic>E. coli htrA</italic><sup>- </sup>was also demonstrated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>HtrA is highly conserved between <italic>Chlamydia </italic>species and is homologous to <italic>E. coli </italic>HtrA</title><p>There is considerable knowledge of the key residues and domains involved in the protease and chaperone activities for HtrA from <italic>E. coli </italic>(EcHtrA), and high conservation of these residues in other bacterial HtrA homologs has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. HtrA is highly conserved throughout the <italic>Chlamydia </italic>species (sp.) as multiple sequence alignment demonstrated 64% identity and 17% similarity of the amino acid sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The high homology of HtrA between the <italic>Chlamydia </italic>sp. is supported by the ability of the polyclonal sera generated to recombinant <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>L2 HtrA (this study, CtHtrA) to detect <italic>C. pneumoniae </italic>AR39 HtrA by immunofluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The three essential residues for serine protease activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and the two putative C-terminal PDZ domains are conserved in all of the <italic>Chlamydia </italic>HtrA homologs from the available genomes. PDZ domains function in protein-protein interaction and protein binding in a range of different proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. PDZ1 sequence is highly conserved between chlamydial HtrAs, functions in <italic>E. coli </italic>HtrA for coordinating substrate binding and access to the active site, including by binding of the carboxyl terminal of the protein substrates, PDZ2 is known to function in protein interaction within the <italic>E. coli </italic>HtrA hexameric structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The homology between the ancestoral relative <italic>Parachlamydiaceae </italic>HtrA sequences and <italic>Chlamydia </italic>was found to be not a lot greater than the homology to <italic>E. coli </italic>HtrA, suggesting whilst key features remain conserved, HtrA has evolved along with the <italic>Chlamydia </italic>genomes to suit the intracellular niche. The predicted cellular location of HtrA is within the periplasm for all <italic>Chlamydia sp</italic>, as determined using PSORT andSignalP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This suggests that <italic>Chlamydia </italic>HtrA has a similar physiological function to the homologs in other bacteria for maintenance of extracytoplasmic protein quality, by both protease and chaperone activities.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>HtrA conservation between <italic>Chlamydia </italic>and <italic>E. coli </italic>shows likely functional redundancy between bacterial species.</bold> (A) Schematic of the HtrA protein from <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>is shown.

A <italic>htrA</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant was generated in <italic>E. coli </italic>MG1655 for the purposes of this investigation using the &#x003bb; red recombinase method as described by Datensko and Wanner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The <italic>htrA</italic><sup>- </sup>strain was verified by PCR analysis using primers to the Kan cassette and to the chromosome flanking the <italic>htrA </italic>gene (primer sequences shown in Methods, data not shown), the strain showed the expected phenotype of lack of growth at 44&#x000b0;C when tested on LB agar plates, whereas the wild-type (MG1655) was able to grow (data not shown). The ability of the <italic>E. coli htrA </italic>(<italic>echtrA</italic>) and <italic>C. trachomatis htrA </italic>(<italic>cthtrA</italic>) genes supplied on the low copy number vector pACYC184 (constructed as described in Methods) to complement the heat sensitive phenotype of the <italic>E. coli htrA</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant was tested.

The <italic>E. coli htrA</italic><sup>- </sup>strain harbouring only pACYC184 (<italic>htrA</italic><sup>- </sup>pACYC184) was unable to grow at 44&#x000b0;C on LB agar plates (data not shown). Thus, both the <italic>E. coli htrA </italic>and <italic>C. trachomatis htrA </italic>genes are able to complement the heat stress phenotype of <italic>E. coli htrA</italic><sup>-</sup>.</p><p>During the initial stages of this investigation the <italic>C. trachomatis htrA </italic>was supplied on the higher copy number vector pBR322 which proved toxic to <italic>E. coli </italic>at 30&#x000b0;C, and was unable to complement the heat sensitive phenotype (data not shown). This finding is consistent with previous reports of a similar copy number dependent toxicity of the <italic>E. coli htrA </italic>gene during complementation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In order to ensure that no toxicity occurred with either <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>or <italic>E. coli htrA </italic>genes, the strains were further tested by determining growth curves at 30&#x000b0;C and 44&#x000b0;C on LB broth.

The findings reported here show that the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis htrA </italic>was able to protect <italic>E. coli htrA</italic><sup>- </sup>against its lethal high temperature phenotype. This suggests that the ability to chaperone and degrade unfolded proteins, regardless of specificity for residues at the site of peptide bond cleavage, is sufficient to protect against the damage caused by heat stress. Minor differences observed in complementation by <italic>echtrA </italic>and <italic>cthtrA </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) could be attributed to; differences in substrate specificities of the enzymes, potential differences in the 'switch' to chaperone activity at higher temperatures as <italic>E. coli </italic>has been previously reported to act only as a chaperone at temperatures below 30&#x000b0;C (Speiss et al., 1999) although more recent studies suggest EcHtrA may have chaperone activity at higher temperatures (Skorko-Glonek <italic>et al</italic>., 2007), or finally due to different copy number requirements for the two genes. However, regardless of the minor differences in complementation by growth curve, it is clear that <italic>Chlamydia htrA </italic>can protect <italic>E. coli htrA</italic><sup>- </sup>against the detrimental affects of heat stress. This data provides direct evidence for <italic>in vivo </italic>physiological functionality of <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>HtrA as a molecular chaperone and/or protease to protect against protein stress induced by high temperatures. The lack of a genetic manipulation system for <italic>Chlamydia </italic>limits the ability to collect <italic>in vivo </italic>physiological evidence, however we feel the use of this heterologous system has provided strong evidence that <italic>Chlamydia </italic>HtrA protects against protein stress <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Protein levels were examined in <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>L2 cultures under acute and heat stressed conditions to examine the role of the HtrA. Heat stress is an ideal laboratory model to induce protein level stress and is highly relevant for many bacteria, but it is important to note that <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>would more commonly encounter other forms of protein damaging stress such as, immune related oxidative and nitrosative stress, temperature flux in the genital tract, rapid pH changes during early development of the inclusion vacuole, and possibly osmotic flux. The increased level of HtrA during heat stress was observed both by western blot and immunofluorescence (relative to MOMP and LPS). The use of the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) as a comparative protein for molecular studies in <italic>Chlamydia </italic>is widely reported. MOMP levels have been reported to decrease during <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>persistence and stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, as different fixatives were required for the HtrA and MOMP antibodies used during this study, LPS was used in conjunction with HtrA immunofluorescence. The heat stress model we tested was consistent with previous studies on <italic>C. pneumoniae </italic>and <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>with both morphological similarity when examined by TEM and similar decreased levels of MOMP and LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, we tested under conditions for which it is known a high proportion of the <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>cells remain viable. That is, after 3 hrs heat shock at 42&#x000b0;C once heat stress is removed, <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>was able to complete the developmental cycle, and form infectious EBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This suggests that CtHtrA is important during heat stress and could be one of the key factors for protection of cellular envelope proteins sufficiently to allow restoration of normal growth once heat stress is removed. The protection is likely to be mediated by both the protease and chaperone functions we previously reported during <italic>in vitro </italic>investigations of HtrA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The data presented here clearly indicates a cell envelope or extracytoplasmic localisation of HtrA which seems likely to be periplasmic as indicated by in silico predictions. Further experimental data would be needed to confirm the exact location of HtrA (periplasmic, cytoplasmic membrane, outer membrane), however, regardless of the exact location it is clear that HtrA's protein maintenance function would still serve much of the extracytoplasmic proteome.</p><p>Two well established persistence models were used during this investigation to test for the potential significance of HtrA for persistent infections. The penicillin induced persistence model affects the development of <italic>Chlamydia </italic>by binding to three penicillin binding proteins halting binary fission and preventing later phases of the chlamydial developmental cycle (formation of EBs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This affect of penicillin on <italic>Chlamydia </italic>is somewhat paradoxical as there is no unequivocal evidence for the presence of peptidoglycan, although it is predicted that peptidoglycan synthesis functions in RBs during chlamydial cell division (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]). Thus, in the presence of penicillin at 20 h PI, the RBs will have no peptidoglycan (PG) or components thereof, and less MOMP and outer membrane cysteine rich proteins such as OmcB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] which normally contribute to the rigidity of the outer membrane by extensive disulfide crosslinking. The decreased outer membrane disulfide crosslinking and peptidoglycan likely results in reduced extracytoplasmic integrity, reduced protection from osmotic and redox stress for extracytoplasmic proteins due to these reduced physical and chemical barriers. Osmotic and redox stress is known to affect protein integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, HtrA may be present at increased levels during penicillin persistence to protect against this possible additional protein stress. These findings suggest that HtrA is less important for the initial adaptation to penicillin but rather functions during longer term persistence presumably via maintenance of extracytoplasmic proteins possibly required for ongoing viability or for the capability to return to normal development once the selective pressure is removed.</p><p>HtrA protein levels were reduced at both 20 h PI and 44 h PI during IFN-&#x003b3; persistence, possibly indicating that extracytoplasmic protein stress is less important during this form of persistence until at least 44 h PI. IFN-&#x003b3; persistence for <italic>Chlamydia </italic>is effectively a form of amino acid deprivation stress, which results in a lack of binary fission and prevention of RB development to EBs. The amino acid deprivation is not likely to result in direct stress on existing extracytoplasmic proteins, which could explain the reduced levels of HtrA under these conditions. The considerable reduction in HtrA during IFN-&#x003b3; persistence, when compared to acute, heat stress and penicillin data, suggests that IFN-&#x003b3; persistence doesn't involve chlamydial extracytoplasmic stress response, unlike previous suggestions for <italic>C. pneumoniae </italic>that IFN-&#x003b3; persistence is a stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The role of HtrA for <italic>Chlamydia </italic>likely involves both the protease and/or chaperone functions in protection, assembly, or degradation, of extracytoplasmic chlamydial proteins during intracellular development (RB), extracellular survival (EB), and stress conditions. The data presented here demonstrated the presence of HtrA during development, with increased HtrA levels during conditions which most likely induce protein stress, such as heat shock and penicillin induced persistence.

Western blots to analyse <italic>E. coli </italic>extracts were blocked in 0.5% skim milk powder in TBS, HtrA polyclonal sera was used as primary antibody at 1/7000 dilution (0.5% skim milk powder, TBS). Anti-rabbit HRP conjugate antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the secondary antibody (1/10000) and ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare, Australia) was used for detection. Western blot analysis of <italic>Chlamydia </italic>cell culture extracts were conducted using the same procedure, although 0.5% w/v casein (Roche, Australia) was used as the blocking agent and the HtrA polyclonal sera was used as primary antibody at 1/200 dilution and the MOMP monoclonal antibody was used at 1/1000. HRP conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1/10000 dilution (Sigma-Aldrich, Australia). Recombinant MOMP was generated as described by Barker and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence</title><p>Transmission electron microscopy was conducted on samples which were cultured concurrent to the experiments analysed by western blot. The cultures were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde (ProSciTech), 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3. After overnight fixative cells were scraped and washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Cells were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and embedded in Spurr expoy resin. Ultrathin sections (50 &#x02013; 100 nm) were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate stains prior to examination and photography using the JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope.</p><p>Immunocytochemistry samples were prepared using cells cultured on coverslips. Coverslips were washed in PBS prior to fixative for 15 mins (100% methanol for HtrA and LPS, 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS for MOMP). Cells were permeabilised by incubation in 0.5% v/v triton X-100, PBS for 15 mins prior to blocking in 1% w/v BSA for 20 mins. 0.1% BSA was used for LPS antibody staining and no permeabilisation step was used. Primary antibody was incubated for 1 hour in 1% BSA (LPS no dilution, HtrA 1/500 sera dilution, MOMP 1/1000 dilution). MOMP monoclonal antibody (MOMP mAb) was sourced from Biodesign International (C955135), LPS-FITC conjugated antibody was sourced from Cellabs, Australia. Washes were conducted using 0.2% Tween-20 PBS or PBS when the LPS antibody was used. Secondary antibodies were used at 1/600 dilution in 1% BSA for 1 hour. Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, USA). Co-labelling with LPS and HtrA was conducted in 0.05% BSA, washed in PBS, and the HtrA antibody was detected using a secondary anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568. Coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold antifade (Invitrogen, USA) and viewed under a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) with a 63 &#x000d7; oil objective 1.4 NA. Images were captured using the Leica application suite for advanced fluorescence. No immunofluorescence was detected in samples stained with either primary or secondary antibody alone. Quantification was conducted on the same day, to compare samples which were previously prepared (triplicate experiments; cultures, and slide preparations for direct comparisons were also conducted at the same time). Quantification of fluorescence was calculated using the Leica application suite.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WMH conducted the experiments, microscopy experiments were conducted in conjunction with CT.
