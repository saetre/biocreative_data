In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> the RNA polymerase specificity of the snRNA genes is determined by a few nucleotide differences within the proximal sequence element (PSE), a conserved sequence located &#x0223c;40&#x02013;65 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The PSE is essential for transcription of both RNA polymerase II-transcribed and RNA polymerase III-transcribed snRNA genes and is recognized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by a multi-subunit protein factor termed <italic>Dm</italic>PBP. Previous studies that employed site-specific protein&#x02013;DNA photocrosslinking indicated that the conformation of the DNA&#x02013;protein complex is different depending upon whether <italic>Dm</italic>PBP is bound to a U1 or U6 PSE sequence. These conformational differences of the complex probably represent an early step in determining the selection of the correct RNA polymerase. We have now obtained evidence that <italic>Dm</italic>PBP modestly bends the DNA upon interacting with the PSE and that the direction of DNA bending is similar for both the U1 and U6 PSEs. Under the assumption that <italic>Dm</italic>PBP does not significantly twist the DNA, the direction of the bend in both cases is toward the face of the DNA helix contacted by the 45 kDa subunit of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP. Together with data from partial proteolysis assays, these results indicate that the conformational differences in the complexes of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP with the U1 and U6 PSEs more likely occur at the protein level rather than at the DNA level.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcription of genes encoding the spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in higher eukaryotes is dependent upon a unique and essential proximal sequence element (PSE) at a conserved location &#x0223c;40&#x02013;65 bp upstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c9">9</xref>). The PSE is required for transcription of U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNA genes by RNA polymerase II as well as U6 snRNA genes by RNA polymerase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c12">12</xref>). In vertebrates the promoters of snRNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II lack TATA boxes, whereas U6 snRNA gene promoters contain TATA boxes. In the presence of the upstream PSE, the TATA box acts as a dominant element for determining the RNA polymerase III specificity of vertebrate U6 gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c14">14</xref>).</p><p>In other organisms, however, the RNA polymerase specificity of snRNA genes can be determined by different mechanisms. For example, plant snRNA genes transcribed by either RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III have TATA boxes, but the spacing between the PSE (specifically termed the USE in plants) and the TATA box determines RNA polymerase specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c17">17</xref>). Significantly, in vertebrates, sea urchins and plants, experiments have indicated that the PSEs of U1 and U2 genes are functionally interchangeable with the PSEs of U6 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c19">19</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, RNA polymerase specificity is determined by the actual sequence of the U1 or U6 PSE itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c20">20</xref>). Thus the U1 and U6 PSEs (termed more specifically PSEAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) are not interchangeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c20">20</xref>), even though the <italic>Drosophila</italic> U1 and U6 PSEAs have considerable sequence similarity that encompasses a 21 bp region. Indeed, the substitution of as few as 3 nt within the 21&#x000a0;bp region that constitutes the PSEAs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> U1 and U6 genes is sufficient to switch the specificity of these promoters from one RNA polymerase to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c20">20</xref>).</p><p>In the human system, the PSE-binding protein has been named PBP, PTF or SNAPc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c26">26</xref>). SNAPc consists of five subunits with molecular weights of approximately 19, 43, 45, 50 and 190 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c31">31</xref>), but little is known about the architectural arrangement of these subunits relative to the DNA.</p><p>As part of our studies in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system, we recently employed a powerful site-specific protein&#x02013;DNA photocrosslinking technique that identified three subunits (45, 49 and 95 kDa in size) of the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> PSEA-binding protein (<italic>Dm</italic>PBP) that are in close proximity to the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c32">32</xref>). The photocrosslinking data revealed the relative translational and rotational positions of the three protein subunits relative to the PSEA sequence and therefore relative to each other when bound to the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c32">32</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the photocrosslinking pattern of the three <italic>Dm</italic>PBP polypeptides to the DNA was different depending upon whether <italic>Dm</italic>PBP was bound to a U1 or U6 PSEA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c32">32</xref>). This indicated that the proximity of the polypeptides to the DNA was altered depending upon the PSEA sequence bound to the protein. Together with the fact that the PSEA acts as the dominant element to determine RNA polymerase specificity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these studies indicated that conformational differences exist in the overall DNA&#x02013;protein complex that are determined by whether the protein is interacting with a U1 or U6 PSEA.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of the nature of the conformational differences involved at U1 and U6 promoters, we have carried out DNA bending analysis and partial proteolysis assays to detect potential differences in DNA and&#x0002f;or protein conformation. Our results suggest that <italic>Dm</italic>PBP bends DNA modestly and that the direction of the DNA bend is similar in the U1 and U6 complexes; the partial proteolysis assays, on the other hand, are consistent with a model for conformational differences at the protein level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Source of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP</title><p>The <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> PSEA-binding protein (<italic>Dm</italic>PBP) was partially purified from the soluble nuclear fraction prepared from 0&#x02013;12 h <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c33">33</xref>). Briefly, fractionation involved chromatography steps on DEAE&#x02013;cellulose, heparin&#x02013;agarose, Affi-Gel Blue and Resource Q columns. The Resource Q fraction was used for all the experiments reported in this paper except for the minicircle binding assays.

Then synthetic double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleo&#x000ad;tides containing three phased A tracts with spacers of variable lengths were cloned between the <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Sal</italic>I sites. The sequences of the five non-template (relative to the PSEA) strand oligo&#x000ad;nucleotides used for cloning were as follows: d(GATCCTGCAAAACGGGCAAAAACGGGGCAAAAACGGG); d(GAT&#x000ad;CCTCGGCAAAAACGGGCAAAAACGGGCAAAAACGGG); d(GATCCTCGACGCAAAAACGGGCAAAAACGGGCA&#x000ad;A&#x000ad;AAACGGG); d(GATCCTCGACACGCAAAAACGGGC&#x000ad;AAAAACGGGCAAAAACGGG); d(GATCCTCGACTGA&#x000ad;CGCAAAAACGGGCAAAAACGGGCAAAAACGGG).

To minimize this effect, new constructs were prepared that had the sequence of the U1 PSEA changed from a T to a C at position 17. This particular change was chosen because the most common nucleotide in <italic>Drosophila</italic> U1, U2 and U4 PSEAs at position 17 is a C. The RNA polymerase II specificity of the U1 PSEA with this T&#x02192;C substitution was confirmed by transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> (unpublished data).

Six different primers were synthesized that contained <italic>Cla</italic>I restriction sites staggered at 2&#x000a0;bp intervals. These primers were used for PCR in appropriate pair-wise combinations so that after digestion of the PCR products with <italic>Cla</italic>I all DNA fragments were exactly 169 bp in length. By generating the substrates in this manner, torsional effects during ring closure from misaligned ends were avoided. Following gel purification of the <italic>Cla</italic>I-digested fragments, each was ligated overnight with T4 DNA ligase and the minicircles were purified from linear molecules by gel electrophoresis.</p><p>To examine the relative binding affinity of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP for the various minicircles and corresponding linear DNA probes, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed under three different experimental conditions. In one instance, the minicircle and linear probes were incubated separately with <italic>Dm</italic>PBP and subsequently loaded onto separate lanes of a gel. In the second instance, the minicircles were incubated with <italic>Dm</italic>PBP followed 5 min later by the addition of the corresponding linear probe to each reaction. In the third case, the order of the addition of the probes was reversed. These order-of-addition experiments were performed to ensure that two conditions were fulfilled: (i) equilibrium was attained in the reactions; (ii)&#x000a0;the concentration of free protein was identical in reactions with linear and circular probes (since the two probes were incubated together in the same reaction). After 30&#x02013;35 min incubation, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis through a native gel. Bands corresponding to unbound and protein-bound minicircular and linear DNA fragments were quantified by phosphorimager analysis.</p><p>The relative affinity of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP for the different minicircles relative to the linear DNA was estimated from the following relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c36">36</xref>): <italic>K</italic><sub>rel</sub> &#x0003d; <italic>K</italic><sub>circle</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>linear</sub> &#x0003d; (&#x0005b;unbound linear&#x0005d;&#x0005b;bound minicircle&#x0005d;)&#x0002f;(&#x0005b;bound linear&#x0005d;&#x0005b;unbound minicircle&#x0005d;).

However, circular permutation analysis does not differentiate between induction of a directional bend in the DNA versus a point of flexure. More importantly, the protein itself (particularly if elongated in shape rather than globular in structure) can alter mobilities in circular permutation assays in ways that mimic the effect of bent DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c38">38</xref>). Therefore, solution-based assays that involved minicircle binding and circularization were performed to more thoroughly assess the shape and conformation of the DNA when complexed with <italic>Dm</italic>PBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of pre-bent DNA to <italic>Dm</italic>PBP</title><p>Minicircle binding has been used as a solution-based technique to examine protein-induced bending of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c40">40</xref>). The minicircle binding assay is based upon the principle that a DNA-bending protein will bind with higher affinity to DNA that is pre-bent in the direction of the protein-induced bend but will bind with lower affinity to DNA pre-bent in the opposite direction. To examine the behavior of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP in a minicircle binding assay, two separate series of constructs were prepared in which the PSEA (U1 or U6) was spaced at varying distances from an intrinsic DNA bend provided by three phased A tracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f2">2</xref>A). In these constructs, the midpoint of the (U1 or U6) PSEA varied from 54 to 62 bp from the midpoint of the central A tract. DNA fragments were amplified from these templates by PCR using combinations of primers that contained <italic>Cla</italic>I restriction sites at appropriately staggered positions such that each of the PCR products would have <italic>Cla</italic>I sites separated by exactly 169 bp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f2">2</xref>A). After digestion with <italic>Cla</italic>I and purification, the fragments were circularized by treatment with T4 DNA ligase. This produced 169 bp long minicircles that contained the PSEA pre-bent in various directions that ranged over nearly a turn of the helix.</p><p>The minicircles, as well as the corresponding linear DNA fragments, were incubated with <italic>Dm</italic>PBP and subjected to electro&#x000ad;phoresis through a native polyacrylamide gel to separate protein-bound DNA from free DNA. Initial experiments were performed in which the minicircle and linear fragments were incubated separately with the <italic>Dm</italic>PBP fraction. However, other experiments were performed in which the protein was first incubated with the minicircles followed by addition of the linear fragments or, conversely, in the opposite order of DNA addition (see Materials and Methods). These order-of-addition experiments were done to ensure that equilibrium was attained in the binding reactions. Furthermore, this method ensured that the concentration of free protein was identical in the reactions with linear and circular fragments since the binding reactions were carried out in the same tube. Each protocol yielded results that were essentially identical. However, for simplicity, only the results from the gels in which the incubations were carried out separately are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f2">2</xref>B.</p><p>The linear U1 and U6 DNA fragments were bound by <italic>Dm</italic>PBP with affinities that were unaffected by the phasing between the PSEA and the intrinsic bend (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f2">2</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;5 and 11&#x02013;15). However, when minicircle DNA was used in the binding assay, the protein bound more tightly when the center-to-center distance between the PSEA and the intrinsic bend was 54 or 62 bp, as opposed to the intermediate separations of 56, 58 or 60 bp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f2">2</xref>B, lanes 6&#x02013;10 and 16&#x02013;20). This is most clearly evident in the fact that the bands that correspond to free probe had a notably diminished intensity in lanes 6, 10, 16 and 20 in comparison to the other lanes. Those lanes also contained an increased amount of DNA smearing between the bands corresponding to free and fully shifted probes which was not observed in the absence of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP (not shown). It is possible that the protein&#x02013;minicircle complexes have an unusual topology that contributes to their partial dissociation during passage through the gel matrix.</p><p>To estimate the relative binding affinities of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP for the different pre-bent DNAs in comparison to the linear fragments, bands corresponding to bound and free circular as well as bound and free linear fragments were quantified by phosphor&#x000ad;imager analysis. Relative binding affinities were calculated as described by Sitlani and Crothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c41">41</xref>; see Materials and Methods). The average of the relative affinities was normalized to a value of 1 and the corresponding relative affinities were plotted as a function of the separation between the PSEA and the intrinsic bend. The data points were then used to curve fit a cosine phasing function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c35">35</xref>) as described in Materials and Methods.</p><p>Significantly, the curves for the DNAs that contained the U1 and U6 PSEAs were in phase with each other and essentially overlapped (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f2">2</xref>C). Each was at a minimum when the center-to-center spacing between the PSEA and the intrinsic bend was 58 bp. Moreover, the phasing period (<italic>P</italic><sub>PH</sub>) determined from both the U1 and U6 fitted curves was 10.4 bp, which is the value expected for two independent bends (i.e. the intrinsic and protein-induced bends) separated by B-form DNA. Finally, the amplitudes of the fitted curves are a reflection of the relative affinity of the protein for the PSEA when the DNA is pre-bent in the most favorable versus least favorable direction. The values determined from the curve fitting suggest that there is up to an &#x0223c;20-fold difference in affinity of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP for either PSEA that is dependent upon the direction of DNA pre-bending.</p></sec><sec><title>Ligase-catalyzed circularization of U1 and U6 protein&#x02013;DNA complexes</title><p>As a complementary and independent method to confirm the DNA-bending properties of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP in solution, we next performed ligase-catalyzed circularization reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c43">43</xref>). In these assays minicircles are generated most efficiently when a protein-induced bend and an intrinsic DNA bend cooperate with each other to bend the DNA in the same direction (producing a C-shaped ligation substrate), as opposed to bending the DNA in opposite directions (forming an S-shaped molecule). Linear DNA fragments (each 169 bp in length to avoid torsional effects from misaligned ends) were prepared that contained the U1 or U6 PSEA phased at 2 bp intervals relative to an intrinsic DNA bend (the same fragments as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f2">2</xref>A). Each fragment was incubated with an excess of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP followed by the addition of T4 DNA ligase. The formation of minicircles in the reaction was monitored by autoradiography following exonuclease digestion and gel electrophoresis of the reaction products.</p><p>In the presence of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP, DNA fragments that contained either the wild-type U1 or U6 PSEA were circularized most rapidly when the center-to-center separation of the PSEA from the intrinsic DNA bend was 54 or 62 bp, whereas the rate of minicircle appearance was depressed when the separation was 58 bp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f3">3</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;10). In contrast, a fragment that contained a mutant PSEA to which <italic>Dm</italic>PBP could not bind did not exhibit this pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f3">3</xref>A, lanes 11&#x02013;15). Additional control reactions were carried out in the absence of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f3">3</xref>B); under these circumstances the fragments that contained the wild-type U1 or U6 PSEA did not exhibit the decrease in minicircle formation at the 58 bp separation relative to the 54 and 62 bp separations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f3">3</xref>B). Together these results indicate that the reduction in minicircle formation at the 58 bp separation is not intrinsic to the DNA and requires the binding of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP to a non-mutant PSEA.</p><p>The relative efficiencies of minicircle formation were quantified by phosphorimager analysis of the minicircle bands and the average of the efficiencies was normalized to a value of 1. The normalized efficiencies were averaged from three experiments and plotted versus the distance separating the midpoint of the PSEA from the midpoint of the intrinsic bend. A curve was then fitted to the data by applying the phasing function. The results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f3">3</xref>C) indicated that the curves for the U1 and U6 PSEAs were phased very similarly, with minimum circularization efficiency at a 57&#x02013;58 bp spacing (<italic>S</italic><sub>T</sub>) and phasing periods (<italic>P</italic><sub>PH</sub>) of &#x0223c;10.5 bp. These results imply that <italic>Dm</italic>PBP bends both PSEA sequences in essentially the same direction. Moreover, when &#x0223c;58 bp separate the midpoints of the PSEA and intrinsic DNA bend, the intrinsic bend and the protein-induced bend must be in opposite directions in three-dimensional space. Significantly, these results are entirely consistent with the results of the minicircle binding experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f2">2</xref>) and support the notion that <italic>Dm</italic>PBP bends the U1 and U6 PSEAs in similar directions.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential sensitivity of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP to proteases as a result of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP interaction with a U1 or U6 PSEA</title><p>The minicircle binding and circularization assays suggested that the U1 and U6 PSEAs have a similar conformation when complexed with <italic>Dm</italic>PBP. To detect possible differences in protein conformation, we next carried out experiments to determine whether the protein might be differentially susceptible to proteolysis when bound to a U1 or U6 PSEA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>). Following incubation of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP with DNA fragments that contained the U1 or U6 PSEA, the complexes were subjected to partial proteolysis with one of several different proteases prior to native gel electrophoresis. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>A shows the effects of partial proteolysis of these complexes by the endoproteinase Lys-C. As previously noted, complexes of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP with DNA fragments that contained the U6 PSEA migrated more slowly through native polyacrylamide gels than complexes with DNA fragments that contained the U1 PSEA (e.g. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>A, lanes 1, 2, 9 and 10). Digestion of these complexes with increasing amounts of Lys-C resulted in conversion of both the U1 and U6 complexes to forms that had identical mobilities but which ran slightly ahead of the native U1 complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>A, lanes 3&#x02013;8).</p><p>A similar but distinct partial digestion pattern was observed with the endoproteinase Glu-C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>B). The U1 and U6 complexes were converted to faster migrating products that had mobilities nearly identical to each other, but these partial digestion products migrated significantly ahead of the native U1 and U6 complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>B, compare lanes 11&#x02013;14). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>C portrays a side-by-side comparison of the native U1 and U6 complexes in relation to those that resulted from the most stringent digestions with endoproteinase Lys-C or Glu-C. Although each enzyme individually digested the U1 and U6 complexes to products having similar mobilities, the products of the Lys-C and Glu-C digestions were clearly distinct.</p><p>Partial digestion with chymotrypsin initially converted the <italic>Dm</italic>PBP&#x02013;U6 DNA complex to a form that had a mobility similar to that of the native U1 complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>D, lanes 3&#x02013;8). More complete chymotrypsin digestion resulted in the appearance of more rapidly migrating complexes in the case of both U1 and U6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>D, lanes 9&#x02013;12).</p><p>A unique digestion pattern was obtained by treatment of the U1 and U6 DNA&#x02013;<italic>Dm</italic>PBP complexes with the endoproteinase Asp-N (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>E). Initial digestion of the U6 complexes resulted in the appearance of an intermediate band that ran with approximately the same mobility as the native U1 complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>E, lanes 3&#x02013;6). However, digestion with higher amounts of Asp-N eventually eliminated the signal arising from the U6 complexes, but left a portion of the U1 complexes undigested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>E, lanes 9&#x02013;12). Thus, the U6 complexes appeared to be more sensitive to digestion by Asp-N than the U1 complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that the DNA&#x02013;protein complexes formed between <italic>Dm</italic>PBP and the U1 or U6 PSEAs on snRNA promoters have distinct functional and structural properties. First, the sequence of the PSEA itself was sufficient to functionally determine the RNA polymerase specificity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> U1 and U6 promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c20">20</xref>). Second, although identical subunits of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP were photocrosslinked to the phosphodiester backbone of the U1 and U6 PSEAs, the crosslinking patterns of these three subunits exhibited significant differences depending upon which PSEA (U1 or U6) was involved in the interaction. At the extreme, two contrasting models could account for the differences observed in the PSEA-specific DNA&#x02013;protein interactions. In one model, the conformation of the protein could remain constant but the route of the DNA and its contacts with the protein could vary, i.e. U1 and U6 DNA could be bent or twisted to different degrees or in different directions depending upon its differential interaction with the protein. At the other extreme, the DNA of the U1 and U6 PSEAs could follow identical paths, but the conformation of the protein could be altered as a result of the DNA sequence to which it binds. In this case the PSEA sequences would be acting as differential allosteric effectors of protein conformation. Models that combine either of these two extremes are equally plausible.</p><p>The experiments reported in this paper were undertaken to assess the relative contribution of protein or DNA conformational differences in the functionally distinct protein&#x02013;DNA complexes formed between <italic>Dm</italic>PBP and the U1 or U6 PSEAs. Results of circular permutation experiments were consistent with the possibility that <italic>Dm</italic>PBP might be a DNA-bending protein. Minicircle binding and ligase-catalyzed circularization assays confirmed the DNA-bending properties of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP. These two solution-based assays are believed to be more reliable than assays that rely on relative mobilities in poly&#x000ad;acrylamide gels since the shape of the protein, gel conditions and other factors can significantly affect mobilities in gel-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c41">41</xref>). Due to the uncertainties and problems inherent in all types of DNA-bending assays, however, we believe that an accurate and reliable quantification of the DNA bend angle is not feasible under the current circumstances. Nonetheless, our results provide strong evidence that the U1 and U6 PSEAs are bent when complexed with <italic>Dm</italic>PBP and that the direction of bending is similar in each case.</p><p>If we further assume that the bending of the DNA is planar and that <italic>Dm</italic>PBP does not twist the DNA, the results of our assays make it is possible to specify the direction of the <italic>Dm</italic>PBP-induced DNA bend relative to the PSEA sequence and relative to the <italic>Dm</italic>PBP subunits that bind to it. The three phased A tracts together produce a bend that is equivalent to a net bend toward the minor groove at the central A of the middle A tract. The protein-induced bend and the intrinsic DNA bend are maximally out-of-phase with each other when the separation between their midpoints is ~58 bp (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f3">3</xref>). Based upon a theoretical and experimentally determined phasing period of 10.5 bp&#x0002f;turn of the DNA helix (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f3">3</xref>), the 58 bp separation constitutes 5.5 turns of the helix. Thus, for a bend in the PSEA to be in the opposite direction in space compared to that of the intrinsic DNA bend, a bend at position 11 in the PSEA would also have to be toward the minor groove. Thus, although we do not know the exact location of the bend within the PSEA (it may be distributed throughout the PSEA), the overall global direction of the protein-induced bend is equivalent to a bend toward the minor groove at the midpoint of the PSEA (position 11 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f1">1</xref>B).</p><p>Previous work identified the faces of the DNA helix contacted by each of the three DNA-binding subunits of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c32">32</xref>). By combining that knowledge with the results of the DNA-bending assays, the direction of the DNA bend relative to the rotational position of these subunits on the PSEA can be determined. The bend toward the minor groove at position 11 (or any equivalent directional bend, e.g. a bend toward the major groove at position 16) will result in a bend toward the face of the helix that is contacted by the 45 kDa subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c32">32</xref>). This result is depicted schematically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f5">5</xref>. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, however, this interpretation is subject to the caveat that <italic>Dm</italic>PBP does not significantly writhe or twist the DNA.</p><p>The fact that the U1 and U6 PSEAs behave very similarly in both minicircle binding and circularization experiments suggests that the global trajectory of the DNA as it enters and exits <italic>Dm</italic>PBP is similar for DNA fragments that contain U1 and U6 PSEA sequences. These findings suggest that the predominant conformational differences in the <italic>Dm</italic>PBP&#x02013;DNA complexes are at the protein rather than the DNA level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f5">5</xref>). Data from the partial proteolysis assays are also consistent with this hypothesis while providing further evidence that the core structure of the U1 and U6 complexes are very similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>). Although the native U1 and U6 complexes migrated at different rates, partial digestion with Lys-C, Glu-C or chymo&#x000ad;trypsin resulted in their reduction to complexes that had similar mobilities. Although differences in the local DNA structure could contribute to this phenomenon, we favor a model in which <italic>Dm</italic>PBP exists in a more extended or strained conformation when bound to the U6 (versus the U1) PSEA and that after proteolytic clipping <italic>Dm</italic>PBP adopts a U1-like conformation even on the U6 PSEA. A more extended or strained conformation of native <italic>Dm</italic>PBP on the U6 PSEA is also consistent with the greater sensitivity of the U6 complex to digestion by endo&#x000ad;proteinase Asp-N (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd410f4">4</xref>E).</p><p>Our data do not definitively rule out the possibility that an additional factor in the <italic>Dm</italic>PBP fraction can associate with the U6&#x02013;<italic>Dm</italic>PBP complex and that this factor is preferentially removed as a result of partial proteolysis. In our experiments, however, we believe that scenario is less likely since the difference in mobility of the U1 and U6 complexes is observed with all fractions of <italic>Dm</italic>PBP obtained throughout the purification procedure (unpublished data). Moreover, recent photocrosslinking studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd410c32">32</xref>) provided no evidence for the presence of an additional factor in the U6 complexes, even with a less pure <italic>Dm</italic>PBP fraction than that used in the current experiments. However, in a more complete transcription preinitiation complex our model hypothesizes that allosteric conformational differences in <italic>Dm</italic>PBP induced by the PSEA are likely to play an important role in recruiting RNA polymerase II- or RNA polymerase III-specific factors to the U1 and U6 snRNA gene promoters, respectively.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd410f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Circular permutation assay with DNA fragments that contain a <italic>Drosophila</italic> U1 or U6 PSEA.
