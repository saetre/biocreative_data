This subunit has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. To further investigate involvement of this subunit, we previously produced mice with a global knockout of &#x003b2;3. However, developmental abnormalities, compensation, reduced viability, and numerous behavioral abnormalities limited the usefulness of that murine model. To overcome many of these limitations, a mouse line with a conditionally inactivated &#x003b2;3 gene was engineered.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Gene targeting and embryonic stem cell technologies were used to create mice in which exon 3 of the &#x003b2;3 subunit was flanked by loxP sites (i.e., floxed). Crossing the floxed &#x003b2;3 mice to a cre general deleter mouse line reproduced the phenotype of the previously described global knockout. Pan-neuronal knockout of &#x003b2;3 was achieved by crossing floxed &#x003b2;3 mice to Synapsin I-cre transgenic mice. Palate development was normal in pan-neuronal &#x003b2;3 knockouts but ~61% died as neonates. Survivors were overtly normal, fertile, and were less sensitive to etomidate. Forebrain selective knockout of &#x003b2;3 was achieved using &#x003b1; CamKII-cre transgenic mice. Palate development was normal in forebrain selective &#x003b2;3 knockout mice. These knockouts survived the neonatal period, but ~30% died between 15&#x02013;25 days of age. Survivors had reduced reproductive fitness, reduced sensitivity to etomidate, were hyperactive, and some became obese.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Conditional inactivation of the &#x003b2;3 gene revealed novel insight into the function of this GABA<sub>A</sub>-R subunit. The floxed &#x003b2;3 knockout mice described here will be very useful for conditional knockout studies to further investigate the role of the &#x003b2;3 subunit in development, ethanol and anesthetic action, normal physiology, and pathophysiologic processes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>&#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acting via GABA type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>-Rs), mediates the bulk of rapid inhibitory neurotransmission in the adult mammalian central nervous system. GABA<sub>A</sub>-Rs are pentameric chloride channels assembled from 19 different subunits, &#x003b1; 1&#x02013;6, &#x003b2;1&#x02013;3, &#x003b3;1&#x02013;3, &#x003b4;, &#x003b5;, &#x003c0;, &#x003c1;1&#x02013;3, and &#x003b8;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Most native receptors are formed from 2&#x003b1;, 2&#x003b2;, and 1&#x003b3; or 1&#x003b4; subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The &#x003b2;3 subunit is especially interesting because this subunit has been suggested to be a candidate gene for neurodevelopmental disorders such as Angelman Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and autism spectrum disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. &#x003b2;3 containing GABA<sub>A</sub>-R isoforms also are a crucial site of action for intravenous anesthetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and ethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and an important receptor involved in developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The &#x003b2;3 subunit is widely expressed in the developing rodent brain and spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the adult rodent, highest levels of &#x003b2;3 expression are restricted to hippocampus, cortex, olfactory bulb striatum, and lower levels are observed in numerous other brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>To elucidate the role of the &#x003b2;3 subunit in physiology and pathophysiology, we previously created and characterized a mouse line that harbored a null allele of the &#x003b2;3 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These global knockout mice ubiquitously lacked the &#x003b2;3 protein throughout development in the whole animal. High levels of neonatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and compensatory adaptations were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that limited the utility of the model. To overcome the shortcomings of the global &#x003b2;3 knockout model, we have now successfully created a mutant &#x003b2;3 mouse line that can be used to create tissue-specific and/or developmentally regulated &#x003b2;3 knockouts. Here, the production and characterization of the conditional knockout model, and the use of this model to gain new insight into the role of &#x003b2;3 containing GABA<sub>A</sub>-Rs in development, behavior, body weight control, and anesthetic action is described.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Gene targeting</title><p>A gene targeting construct (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells to modify the &#x003b2;3 locus. A total of 91 embryonic stem cell clones were screened by Southern blot analysis to identify correctly targeted clones. Eight clones were correctly targeted. Gene targeting at the &#x003b2;3 locus created an EcoRV restriction fragment length polymorphism; a 3' probe that was external to the targeting construct hybridized to a 17.1 kb fragment from the wild type allele (designated &#x003b2;3<sup>+</sup>) and to a 13.9 kb fragment from a correctly targeted allele (designated as &#x003b2;3<sup>Fneo</sup>; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Retention of the 5' loxP site was verified by the presence of a 2.1 kb BglII restriction fragment that hybridized to the &#x003b2;3&#x02013;10 probe. Correctly targeted clones were analyzed with several additional enzymes and probes and all results were consistent with targeting at the &#x003b2;3 locus (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Gene targeting strategy</bold>.

The targeting construct included a neomycin (neo) cassette that was flanked by two frt sites (blue triangles), two loxP sites (red triangles), a thymidine kinase (TK) cassette, and plasmid vector backbone (broken, wavy line).

The results presented here were derived from clone 77S8.</p></sec><sec><title>The unrecombined floxed &#x003b2;3 gene functioned normally</title><p>Heterozygous (&#x003b2;3<sup>+/Fneo</sup>) F1 mice were mated to an actin-FLPe transgenic deleter mouse line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] to remove the neo gene by FLPe-mediated site-specific recombination. This produced mice that were heterozygous for the wild type and the floxed (flanked by loxP sites) &#x003b2;3 alleles and lacked the neo gene (&#x003b2;3<sup>+/F</sup>). These mice were interbred to produce wild type (&#x003b2;3<sup>+/+</sup>), heterozygous (&#x003b2;3<sup>+/F</sup>) and homozygous floxed (&#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>) mice. &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F </sup>mice were born at the expected frequency, were viable, did not have cleft palate, and were overtly indistinguishable from control littermates. This is in direct contrast to mice with global disruption of the &#x003b2;3 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; most of these mice died as neonates, had cleft palate, and those that survived had multiple behavioral abnormalities. Thus, the floxed &#x003b2;3 gene did not grossly have an adverse effect on function of the &#x003b2;3 gene.</p></sec><sec><title>The recombined &#x003b2;3 gene is a null allele</title><p>&#x003b2;3<sup>+/F </sup>mice were subsequently crossed to an actin-cre transgenic deleter mouse line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] to recombine the floxed &#x003b2;3 allele and delete exon 3. Deletion of this 68 basepair exon was predicted to create a frameshift mutation and introduce a premature stop codon. The predicted product of the mutant &#x003b2;3 allele contains amino acids 1&#x02013;58 of &#x003b2;3 followed by a novel 13 amino acid sequence. This product, which is devoid of the amino terminal 415 amino acids (&#x003b2;3 protein is normally 473 amino acids in length), should produce a nonfunctional product as all four of the putative transmembrane domains would be absent. Mice that were heterozygous for the cre recombined allele (&#x003b2;3<sup>+/F</sup>) were interbred to produce &#x003b2;3<sup>+/+</sup>, &#x003b2;3<sup>+/F</sup>, and homozygous recombined (&#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>) mice. While the frequency of &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F </sup>offspring was close to that expected by Mendelian genetics [actual 11 of 61 (18%) vs expected frequency of 25%], 10 of the 11 offspring died 2 days postnatally and the survivor at day 21. Fifty-four percent (6 of 11) of these mice had cleft palate. These results were consistent with the phenotype of global &#x003b2;3 knockouts that were produced by traditional gene targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, the recombined &#x003b2;3 allele functioned as a null allele following cre-mediated recombination.</p></sec><sec><title>Production and analysis of pan-neuronal &#x003b2;3 knockout mice</title><p>Floxed &#x003b2;3 mice were also crossed to a synapsin I-cre (Syn-cre) transgenic mouse line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] to produce neuron-specific conditional knockout mice. This cre expressing mouse line induces widespread recombination exclusively in neurons starting at embryonic day 12.5.</p><p>To investigate the effects of embryonic, pan-neuronal knockout of &#x003b2;3, pups were collected before birth (embryonic day 17.5&#x02013;20.5) from &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre- by &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre+ mating pairs for genotype analysis. This study revealed that &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre+ pups were present at a frequency that was similar to &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre- pups (28/53 and 25/53, respectively). Visual analysis of the palates of a subset of these mice revealed that 0 of 9 &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre+ pups examined in detail had cleft palate. Thus, we conclude that pan-neuronal knockout of &#x003b2;3 is compatible with <italic>in utero </italic>survival and normal palate development.</p><p>To investigate the effects of pan-neuronal knockout of &#x003b2;3 on postnatal survival and development, a genotypic analysis of weanling mice derived from &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre- by &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre+ mating pairs was performed. This study revealed that only ~28% (108/384) of the mice genotyped were cre+, in contrast to the ~72% (276/384) that were cre-. This differs from the expected 1:1 ratio. These results suggest that ~61% of the &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre+ mice died before weaning. Many of the cre+ pups died within a few days of birth. Thus, we conclude that pan-neuronal inactivation of &#x003b2;3 by Syn-cre appears to result in a variably penetrant, non-cleft palate, neonatal lethality.</p><p>Gross behavior of the &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre+ mice that survived beyond weaning were observed while in their home cage and during handling. The cre+ mice were overtly indistinguishable from control, cre- littermates. Unlike the global &#x003b2;3 knockouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], these conditional &#x003b2;3 knockouts did not display foot clasping behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, or tremors. In addition, both sexes of &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre+ mice were found to be fertile and females displayed normal maternal care.</p><p>To examine the degree to which the &#x003b2;3 gene product was reduced in various brain regions of the knockouts, western blot analysis of hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum was performed using a &#x003b2;3 specific antibody.

General observation of these mice discovered no abnormal phenotype, but interestingly, of 39 cre+ mice that died prematurely, 72% were male.

Some of the cre+ mice that survived beyond weaning exhibited abnormal neurological behavior. These mice tended to be hyperresponsive to human contact, and at times appeared to be 'frozen' in their home cage, possibly having absence seizure-like behavior. This phenotype appeared to worsen with age and is similar to that observed in global &#x003b2;3 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>To examine the impact of &#x003b1; CamKII-cre mediated recombination on the &#x003b2;3 gene product, western blot analysis was conducted on hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and hypothalamus using a &#x003b2;3 specific antibody.

Thus, male reproductive fitness also seemed to be compromised.</p><p>During the course of these studies, we also noticed that some, but not all, &#x003b2;3<sup>F/F</sup>, cre+ became obese in adulthood. To quantify this, the body weights of mice from 4&#x02013;16 weeks of age were measured. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>, cre+ mice attained significantly greater body weights by ~8&#x02013;10 weeks of age compared to cre- controls. Furthermore, analysis of the distribution of body weights revealed that there was considerable variability in the body weights of the cre+ mice. For example, at 14 weeks of age, while some cre+ animals had body weights that overlaped with controls, others had body weights that were 1.75&#x000d7; average control values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C, D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Body weight and food consumption analyses of forebrain selective &#x003b2;3 knockouts</bold>.

This result agrees with studies that have reported a high frequency of cleft palate in mice that lack &#x003b2;3 due to traditional knockout of &#x003b2;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] or radiation-induced deletion of &#x003b2;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that ubiquitous expression of &#x003b2;3 alone on a &#x003b2;3 deficient background is sufficient to rescue this phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>While these global knockout/transgenic studies clearly define a role for &#x003b2;3 in normal palate formation, they do not distinguish between a neuronal and nonneuronal site of action. To dissect the contribution of neuronal vs nonneuronal &#x003b2;3 in palate formation, a conditional knockout mouse line which lacked &#x003b2;3 in most neurons was developed. In these pan-neuronal knockout mice, cre-mediated recombination was under the control of the rat synapsin I promoter. Although the time course of cre-mediated inactivation of &#x003b2;3 in these mice was not examined in detail, this same Syn-cre transgenic mouse line has been demonstrated to induce recombination primarily in neurons of the central nervous system starting at approximately embryonic day 12.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Cleft palate was not observed in this mouse line. These results lead us to suggest that neuronal &#x003b2;3 is not required for normal palate formation. This is consistent with the conclusions derived from a study where &#x003b2;3 was expressed only in neurons on a &#x003b2;3 knockout background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. That study demonstrated that neuronal expression of &#x003b2;3 was unable to rescue the animals from the clefting defect. Together, these results lead us to suggest, but do not prove, that GABAergic signaling through &#x003b2;3 containing GABA<sub>A</sub>-Rs in nonneuronal tissues is critical for normal development of the palate. An alternative explanation is that the time course and/or the extent of the genetic modification in the present study or in the study of Hagiwara et. al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] was not sufficient to modulate palate formation. Thus, an obligate neuronal requirement of &#x003b2;3 for normal palate formation cannot be excluded. Continued investigation of &#x003b2;3's role in palate formation is warranted as the &#x003b2;3 locus has been implicated in human clefting defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The results presented here also shed new light on the requirement of &#x003b2;3 for normal viability. Global deletion of &#x003b2;3 resulted in a very high frequency of neonatal mortality, a result that is consistent with earlier studies of global &#x003b2;3 knockouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These results confirm that &#x003b2;3 is not required for survival <italic>in utero </italic>but is required for the transition to life immediately after birth. A high level (~61%) of perinatal mortality in pan-neuronal &#x003b2;3 knockouts was observed. The fact that pan-neuronal knockout did not result in cleft palate indicates that the perinatal mortality is not due to a defect in the palate that prevents feeding. The cause of death in these animals has not been determined. Furthermore, forebrain selective deletion of &#x003b2;3 (initiated ~2 weeks after birth) rescues the mice from perinatal mortality, but it fails to ensure survival to adulthood. Approximately 30% of forebrain selective &#x003b2;3 knockout mice die between 2 and 4 weeks of age. These results reveal that neuronal &#x003b2;3 is required beyond the perinatal period for normal viability. Furthermore, these results confirm that the mortality is not due to aberrant embryonic development. Instead, we conclude that there is a role for &#x003b2;3 in neuronal function that is required for survival.</p><p>Those conditional &#x003b2;3 knockouts that survived to adulthood displayed a variety of abnormalities that varied considerably between animals. Forebrain selective deletion of &#x003b2;3 also resulted in deficits in reproductive fitness, maternal care, and overt behavior. These phenotypes were similar to that observed in global &#x003b2;3 knockouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Hyperactivity is a common observation in global &#x003b2;3 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although forebrain selective &#x003b2;3 knockout mice were not observed to be nearly as hyperactive as global knockouts, they exhibited a statistically significant increase in their total activity, compared to control mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). As previous studies on global &#x003b2;3 knockout mice found them to exhibit high baseline velocities and ambulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], these experiments were designed to likewise separate out the ambulatory component of the total activity measurements on the conditional knockouts. Subsequently, there was a trend for ambulatory activity to be higher in forebrain selective &#x003b2;3 knockouts compared to cre- controls. This observation is evidence that locomotor components other than ambulation strongly impacted the resultant total activity measurements taken on the forebrain selective knockout mice. For example, the conditional knockouts, compared to controls, may have focused more on locomotor activities related to rearing, grooming or exploring small regions of the test apparatus rather than participating in higher ambulatory activity.</p><p>Body weights were increased by forebrain selective knockout of the &#x003b2;3 subunit in both male and female mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This may have been due in part, at least in the males, to an increase in food intake and occurred despite an increase in locomotor activity. It is of interest to note that the response in both males and females was variable, with only a subset of animals showing a clear increase in weight. This is most likely due to the fact that animals in this study were of a mixed background. Given the large body of literature showing GABA or GABA<sub>A</sub>-R agonists to be stimulators of food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the increase in body weight was somewhat unexpected. It may be that deletion of the &#x003b2;3 subunit resulted in a compensatory GABA<sub>A</sub>-R response that increased the functional activity of GABA<sub>A</sub>-Rs in brain areas involved in regulating food intake, e.g., the hypothalmus. However, the role of GABA in the mechanisms governing food intake and body weight is unclear. GABA has been shown to be colocalized with neuropeptide-Y neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] which contact and inhibit arcuate proopiomelanocortin neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] that suppress food intake. We have observed that &#x003b2;3 is reduced ~50% in the hypothalamus of forebrain selective knockouts (data not shown). However, GABA<sub>A</sub>-R-containing neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus of the brainstem have also been postulated to be involved in GABA-mediated increases in food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. While GABA is clearly involved in regulating body weight, the ubiquitous nature of GABA in the brain makes determining the mechanisms involved difficult. The ability to manipulate expression of a predominant GABA<sub>A</sub>-R subunit in an anatomically-specific manner is an important first step in unraveling the role of GABA in regulating body weight.</p><p>A previous study revealed that global &#x003b2;3 knockout mice were less sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of etomidate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, because of the ubiquitious nature of the &#x003b2;3 knockout, developmental compensation was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that made it impossible to determine if the reduction in anesthetic sensitivity was due to deletion of a direct target of etomidate or due to a compensatory change in an unknown target. In the current study, we demonstrated that inactivation of &#x003b2;3 selectively in forebrain neurons after ~2 weeks of postnatal life also resulted in reduced sensitivity to the sedative/hypnotic response to etomidate. This result, together with results derived from gene knockin studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] lead us to suggest that &#x003b2;3, and not a compensatory change in an unknown target, is a direct target for some of the anesthetic effects of etomidate.</p><p>Reportedly, &#x003b2;3 containing GABA<sub>A</sub>-Rs are also important for mediating the effects of ethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the sedative/hypnotic effect of ethanol was not changed by conditional (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, D</xref>) or global inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] of the &#x003b2;3 gene. Thus, the &#x003b2;3 subunit is not necessary for the sedative/hypnotic effect of ethanol. Other behavioral effects of ethanol (e.g., motor incoordination, cognative impairment, etc.) remain to be tested in these mice.</p><p>It is unknown why the cleft palate, mortality, body weight, and behavioral phenotypes are variably penetrant within the various &#x003b2;3 mutant mouse lines. It is possible that animal-to-animal variability exists because of genetic heterogeneity in the background of the animals. None of the mutant mouse lines used here were maintained on a uniform, inbred genetic background. Genetic background has been demonstrated to substantially alter the incidence of cleft palate in global &#x003b2;3 knockouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Detailed investigation of &#x003b2;3 mutants maintained on a hybrid genetic background could be used to search for modifier genes that interact with the GABAergic system in palate development (and possibly in the other observed phenotypes).</p><p>Alternatively, a possibility exists that those &#x003b2;3 mutant animals that escaped from palate defects and neonatal mortality were able to invoke a compensatory pathway to overcome the genetic defect. Indeed, global knockouts exhibited substantial compensatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although deletion of &#x003b2;3 after birth would circumvent developmental compensation during early development, it is still possible (actually quite likely) that compensation also occurred in those mice. For example, we have observed that in the cortex of the forebrain selective knockouts, the amount of the &#x003b1;1 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-R was also reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). It is not clear if this is truly a compensatory change or if it reflects an obligate subunit partnership of &#x003b2;3 with &#x003b1;1 in this brain region. Nonetheless, while conditional knockout mice may circumvent some issues observed in global knockouts such as compensation during embryonic development, the conditional knockout approach is not without limitations.</p><p>The new line of genetically engineered mice described in this report, i.e., mice with a floxed &#x003b2;3 gene, will be invaluable for a wide variety of studies. As demonstrated in the current study, knockout of &#x003b2;3 by the traditional method of crossing the floxed mice to a cre recombinase expressing transgenic mouse can be used to make tissue specific and/or temporally regulated conditional knockouts. Addition of a regulated cre recombinase, such as cre-ER that is regulated by tamoxifen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], would provide even greater temporal control over the conditional nature of the knockout. The floxed &#x003b2;3 mice will also be useful for nontraditional methods of creating conditional knockouts such as stereotaxic microinjection of cre expressing viral vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] or in vivo electroporation of cre expressing plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This wide variety of approaches for producing mice that conditionally lack &#x003b2;3 will open up new avenues for investigating the role of &#x003b2;3 in normal physiology and pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A mutant mouse line that harbors a floxed &#x003b2;3 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-R was successfully produced. Pan-neuronal and forebrain selective knockout of &#x003b2;3 revealed new insight into the role of the &#x003b2;3 subunit in palate formation, embryonic and postnatal viability, behavior, body weight regulation, and etomidate sensitivity. The floxed &#x003b2;3 mice described in this report will be very useful for conditional knockout studies to further investigate the role of the &#x003b2;3 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-R in various developmental processes, normal physiology, and pathophysiologic disorders such as Angelman syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Gene Targeting</title><p>A gene targeting DNA construct was prepared from Strain 129/SvJ mouse genomic DNA. This construct contained ~9.7 kb of mouse genomic DNA from the &#x003b2;3 locus, a loxP site inserted into intron 2, a neomycin selectable marker gene from pK-11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] that was flanked by two frt sites and a single loxP site (all inserted into intron 3), and the MC1-thymidine kinase gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The 5' loxP site was introduced into a novel BglII restriction site that was added to intron 2 by site directed mutagenesis (MORPH Mutagenesis Kit, 5 Prime-3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). The neomycin cassette replaced a 321 bp BamHI fragment in intron 3. This construct was linearized with NotI and electroporated into R1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] embryonic stem cells as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

The actin-FLPe mice originated on a B6SJLF2 genetic background but were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for 3 generations. Following FLPe-mediated deletion of the neo cassette from the &#x003b2;3 locus, the actin-FLPe transgene was bred out of the pedigree by backcrossing to C57BL/6J for one additional generation. Mice that were heterozygous for the floxed &#x003b2;3 locus without the neo gene were subsequently mated to Syn-cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] or &#x003b1; CamKII-cre (line T29-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] transgenic mice to produce conditional &#x003b2;3 knockouts.

Briefly, mice were injected with 3.5 g ethanol (Pharmco, Brookfield, CT) or 20 mg etomidate (Bedford Laboratories, Bedford, OH) per kg body weight into the intraperitoneal cavity. When mice lost the righting reflex, they were placed in v-shaped troughs and the time until they were able to right themselves three times within 30 sec was recorded. Sleep time was defined as the duration of the loss of the righting reflex. Differences between genotypes were determined using a t-test.

Briefly, a TruScan activity monitor (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA) that included a removable Plexiglas insert was used. The insert divided the test arena into light and dark chambers. The floor of the test apparatus was made of steel rods that were used to deliver a footshock. Mice were placed in the lighted chamber and the time to enter the dark side was recorded. Upon entering the dark chamber, the mice were delivered a mild footshock (0.4 mA, 3 sec), removed from the test apparatus, and returned to their home cage. Twenty-four hours later, the procedure was repeated except that no shock was delivered. The latency to enter the dark chamber was calculated as the difference in latency between day 2 and day 1. Separate groups of mice were treated exactly as described except they did not receive a footshock upon entering the dark chamber. These mice were referred to as the "no shock" group. Data were analyzed by ANOVA.</p><p>Spontaneous locomotor activity was assessed using an automated open field test apparatus. Mice were allowed to acclimate to the test room for 30 min prior to testing. Mice were placed individually into clear plastic monitoring chambers measuring 72 &#x000d7; 32 &#x000d7; 32 cm. Locomotor activity was measured via seven sets of photoelectric sensors evenly spaced along the length of the monitoring chamber, 4 cm above the floor of the chamber (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). Total activity was recorded in arbitrary units reflective of the number of times a mouse interrupted the photoelectric sensors during a 10-min monitoring session. Data was automatically recorded and stored by computer. Data was collected in two bins, one representing the total activity and the other representing the ambulatory component of total activity. Total activity includes ambulatory activity as well as locomotor activities directed towards rearing, grooming and exploring small regions of the testing chamber. Data were analyzed by an unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test using the software program PRISM 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declares that there are no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CF and SLH performed experiments and analyzed data; DFW performed some western blot experiments and analyzed data; SMH directed body weight and food consumption studies; TMD performed and analyzed locomotor behavioral experiments; GEH conceived of the study, performed and/or directed experiments, analyzed data, and wrote the manuscript.
