At the same time, the outcome of chemical hypoxia was much worse in &#x00394;M-LDH/193gly-M-LDH phenotype than in the control one, and that was associated with increased loss of intracellular ATP in cells infected with &#x00394;M-LDH/193gly-M-LDH.

Introduction</title><p id="P3">ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels are gated by intracellular ATP and are viewed as a link between cellular metabolism and membrane excitability. In the heart, the activation of these channels protects the cells against metabolic stress, such as hypoxia and ischaemia. It is generally accepted that cardiac sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are composed of Kir6.2, an inward rectifier, and SUR2A, an ABC protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Inagaki et al., 1996</xref>). It has been recently suggested that <italic>in vivo</italic> these two subunits physically interact with enzymes regulating ATP production and glycolysis. One of these enzymes is a muscle form of lactate dehydrogenase (M-LDH), a minor form of LDH present in the heart (M-LDH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Carrasco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Crawford et al., 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Jovanovi&#x00107; et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Jovanovi&#x00107; and Jovanovi&#x00107;, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Dhar-Chowdhury et al., 2005</xref>). The physical interaction between M-LDH and Kir6.2 and SUR2A subunits has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation at the recombinant and native levels, immunofluorescence and FRET analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Crawford et al., 2002b</xref>). However, the functional significance of M-LDH physically associated with sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels is yet to be understood.</p><p id="P4">H9C2 cells are embryonic rat heart myocytes that have been used with success to study sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Ranki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Crawford et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we have taken advantage of this experimental model to determine the role that species of M-LDH physically associated with Kir6.2/SUR2A play in the regulation of sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and cellular resistance to metabolic stress. We report that not only that M-LDH-mediated regulation of sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels activity is crucial for cell survival during metabolic stress, but that ATP produced by sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channel protein complex mediates cytoprotection independently from the channel activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>2.1. H9C2 cells and viral constructs</title><p id="P5">Rat embryonic heart H9C2 cells (ECACC, Salisbury, UK) were cultured in a tissue flask (at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) containing Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine. For electrophysiological experiments, the cells were plated on a 35 mm &#x000d7; 10 mm culture dish containing 25-mm glass cover-slips. The cells were cultured in incubators (Galaxy, oxygen control model, RS Biotech, Irvine, UK). For the experiments H9C2 cells were infected with adenoviral constructs containing either green fluorescent protein (GFP, gift from C. Sunderland, University of Dundee; cells infected with GFP have served as control cells in this study), gly193-M-LDH (a catalytically inactive mutant of M-LDH, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Crawford et al., 2002b</xref>) together with truncated M-LDH (&#x00394;M-LDH) or Kir6.2AFA (a mutant form of Kir6.2 where the pore GFG was mutated into AFA leading to largely reduced K<sup>+</sup> conductance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Van Bever et al., 2004</xref>). When intracellular ATP levels were measured cells were infected with adenovirus containing luciferase gene. All adenoviruses were generated using the AdEasy XL Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. All of the genes were subcloned by PCR using primers containing restrict enzyme sites. Truncation of the first 19 N- and the last 48 C-terminal amino acids of mouse M-LDH was achieved using nested PCR of M-LDH gene and the following primers, sense 5&#x02032;-GGCAGATCTATGCAGAACAAGATTACAGTTGT-3&#x02032;, antisense, 5&#x02032;-GCCTCGAGTTAATTGATTCCATAGAGACCCT-3&#x02032;. gly193-M-LDH was already generated in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Crawford et al., 2002b</xref>) and we have subcloned this gene using the following primers: sense, 5&#x02032;-GGCAGATCTATGGCAACCCTCAAGGACCA-3&#x02032;, antisense, 5&#x02032;-GCCTCGAGTTAGAACTGCAGCTCCTTCT-3&#x02032; using gly193-M-LDH as a template. To generate Kir6.2AFA, Kir6.2 gene was subcloned using sense, 5&#x02032;-GCAGGATCCACCATGCTGTCCCGAAAGGGC-3&#x02032;, antisense, 5&#x02032;-GCATCTAG ATCAGGACAAGGAATCTGGAG-3&#x02032; and the QuickChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate Kir6.2AFA according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions; the mutagenic primers had the following sequences, sense, 5&#x02032;-TCCAGGTGACCATTGCATTCGCAGGGCGCATGGTGACA-3&#x02032;, antisense, 5&#x02032;-TGTCACCATGCGCCCTGCGAATGCAATGGTCACCTGGA-3&#x02032;.

PCR was performed by using the highest fidelity PfuUltra&#x02122; DNA polymerase (Stratagene) under the following condition: the PCR was run with a hot start for 2 min at 95 &#x000b0;C, followed by 25 cycles of 0.5 min at 95 &#x000b0;C, 0.5 min at 56 &#x000b0;C, and 1 min at 72 &#x000b0;C; and a final extension 10 min at 72 &#x000b0;C. The PCR products were cloned between the Bgl II and Xho I sites of the pShuttle-CMV vector. All of the positive clones containing DNA inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. After construction, the shuttle vectors were linearized with Pme I and transformed into BJ5183-AD-1 competent cells to perform homologous recombination in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> with these shuttle vectors and a large adenovirus-containing plasmid following electroporation. Recombinants were identified from single colonies, linearised, and then transfected into HEK293 cells to produce infective adenovirus virions. Adenoviral particles were obtained by cell extraction after 7-10 days of transfection, and the primary virus was further amplified by infection of AD-293 cultures. The virus titer was determined using QuickTiter Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay Kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Typical virus titers were in the 10<sup>9</sup>-10<sup>10</sup> pfu/ml range. To infect H9C2 cells, a solution of recombinant adenovirus was mixed with culture medium, and cells were exposed to the virus with a multiplicity of 10 viral particles/cell for 48 h. More specifically, we have added 25 &#x003bc;l of 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml of viral solution into each well containing ~2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>2.2.

Total RNA was extracted from H9C2 cells using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Extracted RNA was further purified by RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. The specific primers used to detect the total mRNA levels for muscle lactate dehydrogenase (M-LDH) were as follows: sense, 5&#x02032;-GCAGAACAAG ATTACAGTTGT-3&#x02032;, antisense, 5&#x02032;-CTTGATTCCATAGAG ACCCT-3&#x02032; (the size was 795 bp of the PCR product).

The specificity of primers was tested by melting curve analysis and for their ability to produce no signal in negative controls by dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Du et al., 2006</xref>). The RT reaction was carried out with ImProm-II Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI).

A SYBR Green I system was utilized in the reaction. The 25 &#x003bc;l reaction mixture contained: 12.5 &#x003bc;l iQ&#x02122; SYBR&#x000ae; Green Supermix (2&#x000d7;), 7.5 nM each primers, 9 &#x003bc;l of ddH2O, and 2 &#x003bc;l of cDNA. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95 &#x000b0;C for 3 min, followed by 38 cycles of 10 s of denaturing at 95 &#x000b0;C, 15 s of annealing at 56 &#x000b0;C, and 50 s of extension at 72 &#x000b0;C. The real-time PCR was performed in the same wells of a 96-well plate in the iCycler iQ&#x02122; Multicolor Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The data were collected following each cycle and displayed graphically (iCycler iQ&#x02122; Real-time Detection System Software, version 3.0A, BioRad, Hercules, CA). Threshold cycle (CT) values were determined automatically by software. The melting curve data were collected to check the PCR specificity. The cDNA sample was duplicated, the corresponding no-RT mRNA sample was included as a negative control. The calculation of relative mRNA expression was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Pfaffl, 2001</xref>).

All pipettes (resistance 3-5 M&#x003a9;), were filled with (in mM): KCl 140, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, EGTA-KOH 5, HEPES-KOH 5 (pH 7.3). Depending whether open or closed K<sub>ATP</sub> channels were required, 3 &#x003bc;M (for ATP-free pipette solution; this small amount of ATP was added to prevent the channel run-down) or 3 mM (to keep K<sub>ATP</sub> channels closed) of ATP was added. When the effect of LDH substrates on whole cell K<sup>+</sup> current was assessed NADH plus pyruvate (20 mM each) was added into the pipette solution. The effect of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP; 10 mM) on K<sup>+</sup> current in H9C2 cells was measured using perforated patch clamp electrophysiology with essentially the same pipette solution as above just ATP was omitted and amphotericin B (Sigma, 240 &#x003bc;g/ml; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Lippiat, 2008</xref>) added. For all cells monitored, the membrane potential was normally held at &#x02212;40 mV and the currents evoked by a series of 400 ms depolarising and hyperpolarising current steps (&#x02212;100 mV to +80 mV in 20 mV steps) recorded directly to hard disk using an Axopatch-200B amplifier, Digidata-1321 interface and pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Forster City, CA). The capacitance compensation was adjusted to null the additional whole-cell capacitative current. The slow capacitance component measured by this procedure was used as an approximation of the cell surface area and allowed normalisation of current amplitude (i.e. current density).

Cells infected with &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193-M-LDH had 11.3 times more M-LDH mRNA than the cells infected with GFP. It is calculated that in cells infected with &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193-M-LDH only 7.1% of M-LDH mRNA was native and 92.9% of mRNA was &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193-M-LDH. The immunoprecipitation with anti-Kir6.2 antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-LDH antibody or LDH assay has revealed that infection with &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193M-LDH has disrupted physical interaction between the channel subunit with M-LDH and that no LDH catalytic activity was found in anti-Kir6.2 precipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). As M-LDH regulates the activity of sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels by producing lactate, a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opener, we have tested whether infection of &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193-M-LDH would interfere with M-LDH-mediated regulation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. In cells expressing wild type of M-LDH, the presence of pyruvate (20 mM) and NADH (20 mM) has increased whole cell K<sup>+</sup> current despite intracellular presence of 3 mM ATP (the current at 80 mV was 821&#x000b1;91 pA in the absence and 1740&#x000b1;221 pA in the presence of pyruvate and NADH, <italic>n</italic> = 5-6, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). In contrast, in cells infected with &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193M-LDH, pyruvate (20 mM) and NADH (20 mM) did not increase whole cell K<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>; the current at 80 mV was 899&#x000b1;121 pA in cells expressing wild type of M-LDH and 952&#x000b1;104 pA in cells expressing 193gly-M-LDH, <italic>n</italic> = 5-6, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Taken all together, the performed experiments suggested that expression of &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193M-LDH has effectively generated a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel protein complex that is devoid of M-LDH regulation. At the same time, infection of H9C2 cells with &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193M-LDH did not affect total LDH activity (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title><italic>3.2.

Discussion</title><p id="P17">In the present study, we have shown that the species of M-LDH that physically associate with K<sub>ATP</sub> channels is cytoprotective due to regulation of the activity of sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and intracellular level of ATP. These two M-LDH effects do not seem to be interconnected and are likely to be independent of each other.</p><p id="P18">It has been recently shown that M-LDH, a minor LDH isoform in the heart, is an integral part of the sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channel protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Crawford et al., 2002b</xref>). The present study confirmed this notion, as Western blotting/LDH assay/patch clamp electrophysiology has shown both physical and functional connection between channel subunits and M-LDH in H9C2 cells. To address the functional significance of M-LDH species that physically interact with K<sub>ATP</sub> channels we have generated adenoviral constructs containing truncated and mutant forms of M-LDH that do not physically associate with the channel subunit (&#x00394;M-LDH) and is catalytically inactive (193gly-M-LDH). The real time RT-PCR as well as Western blotting/LDH assay/patch clamp electrophysiology has demonstrated that co-infection with &#x00394;M-LDH and 193gly-M-LDH effectively disrupts physical interaction between M-LDH and K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and inhibits M-LDH activity in microenvironment surrounding the channels in H9C2 cells.</p><p id="P19">It is well established that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are activated during metabolic stress, but the role of M-LDH in this activation remained elusive. Originally, it has been thought that the activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels is regulated solely by the intracellular levels of ATP. However, more recent research has demonstrated that the activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels is controlled by a complex interaction of many intracellular factors and signalling pathways. In addition to ATP, the activity of these channels may be regulated by other nucleotides, intracellular pH, lactate, cytoskeleton, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, and by the operative condition of the channel itself (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Zingman et al., 2007</xref>). It has been shown that lactate activates sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels despite physiological, millimolar, levels of intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Crawford et al., 2002b</xref>). A physical interaction between M-LDH and K<sub>ATP</sub> channel subunits secure such level of proximity between LDH and the channel proteins that a high level of lactate in the microenvironment surrounding the channel can be achieved, which can then activate the channel. The present study has revealed that M-LDH as a component of sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channel protein complex is required for the activation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels during chemical hypoxia, and this has never been shown before.</p><p id="P20">It has been reported in some studies that the inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels exacerbates the outcome of the stress, but in many other studies this has been disputed (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kane et al., 2005</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that a cellular phenotype lacking M-LDH has become dramatically more susceptible to chemical hypoxia. In cells where K<sub>ATP</sub> channels activity was inhibited, exacerbation of the cellular survival has never been reported to reach a magnitude that we have obtained with &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193-M-LDH. This has brought to our attention a possibility that a regulation of sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels activity might not be the only cytoprotective mechanism afforded by M-LDH. In principle, the main function of LDH is production of lactate, which is a K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opener, and ATP, which is the main source of energy in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Van Hall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Crawford et al., 2002b</xref>). It was, therefore, possible that ATP produced by M-LDH contributes to the cell survival during stress. In our recent study, we have shown that the inhibition of M-LDH catalytic activity in H9C2 cells not only inhibits hypoxia-induced K<sub>ATP</sub> channels activation, but also facilitates a decrease in subsarcolemmal ATP level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jovanovi&#x00107; et al., 2009</xref>). Here, a decrease of intracellular ATP in cellular phenotype expressing &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193-M-LDH was more pronounced then those in the wild type suggesting that a species of M-LDH physically associated with K<sub>ATP</sub> channels produces ATP during chemical hypoxia and that this could be an important factor in M-LDH-mediated cytoprotection.</p><p id="P21">To elucidate whether M-LDH-mediated regulation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels activity and ATP production is interconnected, we have compared the effects of Kir6.2AFA on cell survival with those of &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193-M-LDH. Kir6.2AFA is a mutant form of Kir6.2 that has largely diminished K<sup>+</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Van Bever et al., 2004</xref>). The cellular H9C2 phenotype expressing Kir6.2AFA does not respond to chemical hypoxia by increasing K<sup>+</sup> current, which is in accord with the idea that this current is flowing through K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. At the same time, Kir6.2AFA does not affect dynamics of intracellular ATP during chemical hypoxia suggesting that the activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels <italic>per se</italic> does not regulate intracellular levels of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jovanovi&#x00107; et al., 2009</xref>). This also suggests that the observed effect of &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193-M-LDH on ATP levels is independent from the &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193-M-LDH action on the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity. The effect of &#x00394;M-LDH/gly193-M-LDH on cellular survival was clearly more deleterious then those of Kir6.2AFA showing that the ATP producing properties of M-LDH are probably important for cell survival during stress.</p><p id="P22">The mechanism of cardioprotection afforded by K<sub>ATP</sub> channels is a long standing issue. The structural studies of these channels have shown that channel subunits <italic>in vivo</italic> are physically associated with enzymes that catalyse ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Carrasco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Crawford et al., 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Jovanovi&#x00107; et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Jovanovi&#x00107; and Jovanovi&#x00107;, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Dhar-Chowdhury et al., 2005</xref>), including M-LDH, which catalytic activity is particularly important under anaerobic conditions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Van Hall, 2000</xref>). Such composition of sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels would indicate that K<sub>ATP</sub> channel might serve as an ATP-producing machinery. The fact that Kir6.2AFA did not influence ATP levels would stand against a possibility that the change in the channel activity <italic>per se</italic> regulates ATP production. It seems that M-LDH physically associated with Kir6.2/SUR2A is involved in (1) the activation of sarcolemmal K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and (2) maintaining levels of ATP during stress.
