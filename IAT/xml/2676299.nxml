Previous studies in-vitro have shown that the pro-apoptotic P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor regulates growth of epithelial cells. The specific objective of the present study was to understand to what degree the P2X<sub>7 </sub>system controls development and growth of skin cancer in vivo, and what cellular and molecular mechanisms are involved in the P2X<sub>7 </sub>action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Skin neoplasias in mice (papillomas, followed by squamous spindle-cell carcinomas) were induced by local application of DMBA/TPA. Experiments in-vitro utilized cultured epidermal keratinocytes generated from wild-type or from P2X<sub>7</sub>-null mice. Assays involved protein immunostaining and Western blots; mRNA real-time qPCR; and apoptosis (evaluated in situ by TUNEL and quantified in cultured keratinocytes as solubilized DNA or by ELISA). Changes in cytosolic calcium or in ethidium bromide influx (P2X<sub>7 </sub>pore formation) were determined by confocal laser microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>(a) Co-application on the skin of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>specific agonist BzATP inhibited formation of DMBA/TPA-induced skin papillomas and carcinomas. At the completion of study (week 28) the proportion of living animals with cancers in the DMBA/TPA group was 100% compared to 43% in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group. (b) In the normal skin BzATP affected mainly P2X<sub>7</sub>-receptor &#x02013; expressing proliferating keratinocytes, where it augmented apoptosis without evoking inflammatory changes. (c) In BzATP-treated mice the degree of apoptosis was lesser in cancer than in normal or papilloma keratinocytes. (d) Levels of P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor, protein and mRNA were 4&#x02013;5 fold lower in cancer tissues than in normal mouse tissues. (e) In cultured mouse keratinocytes BzATP induced apoptosis, formation of pores in the plasma membrane, and facilitated prolonged calcium influx. (f) The BzATP-induced apoptosis, pore-formation and augmented calcium influx had similar dose-dependence for BzATP. (g) Pore formation and the augmented calcium influx were depended on the expression of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor, while the BzATP-induced apoptosis depended on calcium influx. (h) The BzATP-induced apoptosis could be blocked by co-treatment with inhibitors of caspase-9 and caspase-3, but not of caspase-8.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>(a) P2X<sub>7</sub>-dependent apoptosis is an important mechanism that controls the development and progression of epidermal neoplasia in the mouse. (b) The P2X<sub>7</sub>-dependent apoptosis is mediated by calcium influx via P2X<sub>7 </sub>pores, and involves the caspase-9 (mitochondrial) pathway. (c) The diminished pro-apoptotic effect of BzATP in mouse cancer keratinocytes is possibly the result of low expression of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor. (d) Activation of P2X<sub>7</sub>-dependent apoptosis, e.g. with BzATP could be a novel chemotherapeutic growth-preventive modality for papillomas and epithelial cancers in vivo.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The current theory of growth of epithelial cells predicts regulation by the concerted effects of mitogenic stimuli and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Apoptosis is a homeostatic process orchestrated by the host's genome of selective cell deletion without stimulating inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Dysregulation of apoptotic cell-death has been implicated in states of disease and in the neoplastic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Among the pro-apoptotic systems that operate in epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] the P2X<sub>7 </sub>is an important mechanism because the receptor is expressed by proliferating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and activation of the receptor induces apoptosis that controls directly growth of the epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor is a membrane-bound, ligand-operated channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The natural ligand of the receptor is ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] which is present in the extracellular fluid of epithelial cells at high nanomolar, low micromolar levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast to other types of ATP receptors, activation of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor requires relatively high concentrations of the ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, studies in epithelial cells of the female reproductive tract showed a threshold effect and activation of P2X<sub>7</sub>-mediated apoptosis already by nanomolar concentrations of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], suggesting that ATP levels which are present in the extracellular fluid suffice to activate the receptor.</p><p>Binding of the ligand to the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor can activate various cell-specific signaling cascades, including the IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], TNF&#x003b1; &#x02013; TRAIL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and the p38, JNK/SAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and NF-&#x003ba;B cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, a unique effect of activation of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor is formation of pores in the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In uterine epithelial cells formation of P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor pores induces apoptosis by a mechanism that involves uncontrolled influx of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>via P2X<sub>7</sub>-pores and activation of the mitochondrial &#x02013; caspase-9 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Until recently relatively little was known about the biological role of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>in vivo, and particularly in the epidermis. Earlier studies suggested involvement of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor in the inflammatory and immune processes since the receptor is expressed in Langerhans and inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and in cultured immature dendritic epidermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Overexpression of P2X<sub>7 </sub>was found in lesional skin of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, where an intense P2X<sub>7 </sub>immunoreactivity was confined to the cell membrane of the basal layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. P2X<sub>7 </sub>may also play a role in chemokine secretion by normal keratinocytes but available data are inconsistent. Inoue et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] reported that treatment of cultured normal keratinocytes with the P2X<sub>7 </sub>specific agonist 2',3'-0-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP) increased IL-6 release, while Pastore et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] described that BzATP down-modulated chemokine secretion.</p><p>Studies also suggested a role for P2X<sub>7 </sub>in the control of epidermal growth, but most studies were observational. The P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor is expressed in normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], in precancerous epidermal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and in skin cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptors were detected already in 8&#x02013;11 week-old human fetal epidermis; they colocalized with caspase-3 and with periderm cells positive for transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Co-localization of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>with apoptosis-related markers was also reported in adult human epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and recent studies reported BzATP-induced cell death in normal and cancer keratinocytes, presumably by augmented apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Although existing observational data suggest that the P2X<sub>7 </sub>may regulate growth of epithelial cells, no previous studies investigated experimentally the biological role of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor in vivo. The present study tested the hypothesis that P2X<sub>7 </sub>controls epidermal cell growth in vivo by apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experiments in mice in vivo</title><p>The experiments were approved by the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol [2006-0141], and all experiments were done in accordance with CWRU IACUC policy, following nationally and internationally recognized guidelines. Experiments utilized 6&#x02013;8 weeks old wild-type FVB female mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). The animal's dorsal skin (~3 &#x000d7; 5 cm) was shaved using Oster animal clipper (Mountain Home, AR) followed by weekly application of Nair hair remover lotion <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.naircare.com"/>. Skin neoplasia in the mice were induced by the "Two-Step" method, which involved tumor initiation by local treatment with 7,12-dimethyl-benz(a)anthracene (DMBA), followed by tumor promotion with local treatment of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) [e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]].</p><p>Treatments included the application of one or more of the following drugs, directly onto the shaved dorsal skin: DMBA (50 &#x003bc;g/200 &#x003bc;l acetone [950 &#x003bc;M, 190 nmol, 3.3 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>]); TPA (3 &#x003bc;g/200 &#x003bc;l acetone [20 &#x003bc;M, 4 nmol, 0.2 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>]); BzATP (14.3 &#x003bc;g/200 &#x003bc;l of 2.3/1 vol/vol solution of propylene-glycol [PG]/ethanol [EtOH] [100 &#x003bc;M, 20 nmol, 1.0 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>]); or the BzATP vehicle only (200 &#x003bc;l of PG/EtOH). DMBA was applied once, while TPA and BzATP were applied twice a week. The concentration/dose of BzATP and frequency of treatments were chosen based on data in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The First experiment (Experiment-1) included three groups of animals: Control (no treatment, n = 13); DMBA plus TPA (n = 15); and DMBA/TPA plus BzATP (n = 12). Treatments with BzATP began two weeks prior to the DMBA/TPA treatments. Endpoints were determined at 0&#x02013;12 (Papilloma Phase) and 14&#x02013;28 weeks (Cancer Phase) after DMBA. Endpoints were the incidence and prevalence of lesions, as well as the mean lesion size in each living animal. Biopsy of skin papilloma was done in one living animal using mini rotary ElliptiPunch blade (HUOT, Menomonee Falls, WI). Criteria for euthanasia (by cervical dislocation) prior to week 28 were according to Montgomery guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], including animals with excessive tumor burden, or with ulcerated lesions regardless of size that were bleeding, necrosed, or infected. The experiment was terminated at week 28, when all remaining living animals were euthanized. After death, representative samples were obtained from all skin lesions as follows: From the DMBA/TPA group 4 papillomas and 26 cancer samples; and from the DMBA/TPA-BzATP group 2 papillomas and 12 cancer samples. All animals underwent postmortem exam for the presence of metastases and non-epidermal tumors (none were found).</p><p>Lesions developed at 0&#x02013;12 weeks were defined papillomas based on the actual histological diagnosis in one case, the typical morphological appearance, and the extensive experience gained by others using this model and methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Lesions developed at 14&#x02013;28 weeks were defined either as cancers (as diagnosed in each case at the time of death), or as non-cancerous lesions, including existing or involuting papillomas (diagnosed at the time of death) or lesions that disappeared prior to death.</p><p>Experiments 2 and 3 studied the effects of BzATP in normal mice. Experiment-2 included one group of five animals. The shaved dorsal skin was divided into equal anterior and posterior areas. Each animal was treated with BzATP, applied locally twice a week for 4 weeks on the anterior skin area; vehicle only was applied in parallel twice a week for 4 weeks on the posterior skin area. At the end of the experiment animals were euthanized and strips were obtained from each animal from the anterior and posterior treated dorsal skin areas.</p><p>Experiment-3 included two groups of 5 normal animals, Control (vehicle only) and BzATP. Animals were treated for 16 weeks, and after euthanasia strips were obtained from each animal from the treated dorsal skin areas. In addition, blood samples were obtained from each animal from the retro-bulbar venous complex for plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT, glutamic pyruvic transaminase [GPT]), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase [GOT]) assays.</p><p>Skin tissues from animals of Experiments 1&#x02013;3 were assayed for histology (H&#x00026;E), P2X<sub>7</sub>-receptor immunoreactivity, and in-situ TUNEL.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiments using cultured mouse keratinocytes</title><p>The experiments utilized primary cultures of epidermal keratinocytes generated from 6&#x02013;8 weeks old wild-type C57Bl mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA); from P2X<sub>7</sub>-/-Pfizer mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], constructed by deletion of amino acids 506&#x02013;532 of the C-terminus which is critical for P2X7-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; or from P2X<sub>7</sub>-/-GSK mice, which have a <italic>lacZ </italic>gene inserted at the beginning of exon 1, resulting knockout of the receptor, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

Since the main cellular effect of BzATP was augmentation of apoptosis, this discovery provides the first direct support for the hypothesis that apoptosis is an important mechanism in vivo which controls the development and progression of neoplasia. The present findings also support the hypothesis that P2X<sub>7 </sub>is an important physiological pro-apoptotic system in epithelia, particularly those derived from the ectoderm (skin and breast), the uro-genital sinus (bladder), and the distal paramesonephric duct (uterine cervix and endometrium) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and Li, Qi, Zhou, Fu, Abdul-Karim, MacLennan, and Gorodeski GI: P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor expression is decreased in epithelial cancer cells of ectodermal, uro-genital sinus, and distal paramesonephric-duct origin (submitted, 2009).</p><p>Co-treatment with BzATP delayed formation of DMBA/TPA-induced papillomas, and resulted in fewer and smaller papillomas. Some papillomas regressed and involuted spontaneously, as was previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and the effect was unrelated to the treatment with BzATP. However, the majority (about two thirds) either progressed into squamous spindle-cell carcinomas or persisted as non-cancerous lesions. The latter trends depended on whether animals were co-treated with BzATP; thus, in mice co-treated with BzATP the proportion of animals with cancers at week 14 was lower than in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group (50% versus 80%) and remained relatively stable, while in the DMBA/TPA group the proportion of animals with cancers increased steadily, reaching 100% at week 24. These data suggest that local treatment with BzATP inhibits formation of DMBA/TPA-induced skin papilloma, and it can also inhibit papilloma transformation into cancers.</p><p>BzATP had little effect on the number of cancerous lesions per animal at weeks 14&#x02013;28, and on the proportion of animals with cancerous lesions &#x0003e; 10 mm<sup>3 </sup>at weeks 14&#x02013;22. In contrast, after week 23 the proportion of living animals with cancerous lesions &#x0003e; 10 mm<sup>3 </sup>increased in the DMBA/TPA group while it had decreased in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group. These data suggest that local treatment with BzATP exerts an inhibitory effect on the development on skin neoplasia. Interestingly, at weeks 15&#x02013;24, among animals with cancerous lesions, the proportion of living animals with lesions larger than 200 mm<sup>3 </sup>tended to be higher in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group than in the DMBA/TPA group. This effect cannot be explained by augmented proliferation since BzATP did not stimulate DNA synthesis in cultured normal keratinocytes. Instead, the effect could be explained by comparing the survival curves (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) and the proportions of animals with smaller and larger size cancerous lesions (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B, C</xref>). Thus, cancer-related deaths in the DMBA/TPA group were associated more often with smaller lesions while cancer-related deaths in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group were associated with relatively larger lesions. This suggests that treatment with BzATP also prolonged the life of animals with developed cancers.</p><p>The data showed that the main targets of BzATP in the normal skin are proliferating keratinocytes of the epidermal basal/parabasal layers and hair shafts. In these P2X<sub>7</sub>-receptor &#x02013; expressing cells BzATP augmented apoptosis without evoking inflammatory changes that potentially could have been induced by activation of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Experiments in P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient normal keratinocytes and in normal keratinocytes treated with anti-sense P2X<sub>7 </sub>oligonucleotides showed that the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor is a necessary mediator of the pro-apoptotic effect of BzATP, suggesting that the effect of BzATP is mediated by augmentation of P2X<sub>7</sub>-mediated apoptosis.</p><p>Similar to the normal skin, the main targets of BzATP in papilloma tissues were P2X<sub>7</sub>-receptor expressing proliferating keratinocytes at the base of developing papillomas. The importance of this finding relates to the fact that in the mouse DMBA/TPA model, papillomas at risk for developing into cancer are characterized by rapidly proliferating keratinocytes in the basal and parabasal layers of the papilloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Since treatment with BzATP decreased the incidence of DMBA/TPA-induced papillomas and their transformation into cancer, it is likely that the cellular mechanism of BzATP action involved augmented apoptosis of proliferating papilloma keratinocytes bearing the potential of malignant transformation.</p><p>One of the differences between BzATP effects in the normal skin and in papilloma tissues was the lack of macroscopic effects in the former, while inhibiting the development and growth of papillomas. Thus, treatment with BzATP for 16 weeks in normal mice augmented apoptosis of proliferating keratinocytes but it did not produce thinning or ulceration of the skin, as would be expected of a potent pro-apoptotic drug. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the morphological and histological characteristics of the unaffected normal skin between animals in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group (BzATP treatment for 30 weeks) and the DMBA/TPA group. However, in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group the enhanced apoptosis was associated with inhibition of papilloma development. The disparity between BzATP effects in normal and papilloma tissues could be related to differences in the growth rate of the respective keratinocytes. Normal skin cells are slow growing and their overall growth rate is apparently not affected by BzATP; in contrast, in the fast growing papilloma keratinocytes BzATP-induced apoptosis slows and inhibits growth.</p><p>The data in normal mice also showed that local treatment with BzATP had no adverse systemic effects, suggesting a relatively safe profile for the drug when applied locally on the skin. These data indicate that BzATP is absorbed from the skin into the basal/parabasal epidermal regions and hair shafts. The data also suggest that the predominant effect of BzATP is induction of apoptosis at the site of application, targeting rapidly growing proliferating keratinocytes.</p><p>In contrast to papillomas, the expression level of P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptors in DMBA/TPA-induced cancer cells was low, as was evident by three assays: in-situ immunoreactivity, Western blots, and qPCR. These findings are similar to those reported in non-melanoma skin cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and in uterine, bladder and breast epithelial cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and Li, Qi, Zhou, Fu, Abdul-Karim, MacLennan, and Gorodeski GI: P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor expression is decreased in epithelial cancer cells of ectodermal, uro-genital sinus, and distal paramesonephric-duct origin (submitted, 2009). The findings suggest that the rapid proliferation of cancer cells could be in part due to the low expression of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor and to attenuated P2X<sub>7</sub>-mediated apoptosis. Treatment with BzATP augmented apoptosis even in cancer cells expressing low levels of the receptor, but the effect was smaller than in normal or papilloma cells. The significance of this effect is at present unclear although it could have modified the biological behavior of the cancers and have contributed to the prolongation of life in the affected animals, as was discussed above.</p><p>Until recently little was known about the mechanisms of P2X<sub>7</sub>-receptor &#x02013; apoptosis in the skin, and one of the objectives of the present study was to begin to understand the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms that are involved in BzATP action in keratinocytes. The data suggest that, similar to uterine epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the P2X<sub>7</sub>-receptor &#x02013; apoptosis in keratinocytes depends on enhanced calcium influx via P2X<sub>7 </sub>pores, and is mediated by the caspase-9 &#x02013; mitochondrial pathway. The following experimental findings in the present study support this hypothesis: (a) Treatment with BzATP induced formation of pores and enhanced calcium influx; (b) the BzATP-induced apoptosis, pore formation and the augmented and prolonged calcium influx were critically dependent on the expression of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor; (c) the BzATP-induced apoptosis, pore formation and the augmented calcium influx had similar dose-dependence on BzATP; (d) the BzATP-induced pore formation and the augmented calcium influx began shortly (30&#x02013;60 seconds) after adding BzATP. In contrast, the BzATP-induced apoptosis required hours of treatment with BzATP, commensurate with a gene-mediated effect; (e) the BzATP-induced apoptosis depended on the presence of extracellular calcium at a physiological concentration of 1.2 mM, and on calcium influx; (f) the BzATP-induced apoptosis could be blocked by co-treatment with inhibitors of caspase-9 and caspase-3, but not of caspase-8. Since caspase-3 is a terminal step in the caspase cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], a possible interpretation of the present results is that P2X<sub>7</sub>-receptor &#x02013; apoptosis is mediated by the caspase-9 (mitochondrial) pathway. Collectively the data in mouse keratinocytes suggest that BzATP-dependent activation of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor involves formation of pores in the plasma membrane, and that facilitated uncontrolled influx of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>via the P2X<sub>7 </sub>pores stimulates apoptosis by the mitochondrial &#x02013; caspase-9 pathway.</p><p>P2X<sub>7 </sub>pores are believed to be formed of channels composed of pannexins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and ectodomains of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, the ability of agonists to induce apoptosis via the P2X<sub>7 </sub>pore mechanism is determined primarily by the cellular expression of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The present study showed that papilloma keratinocytes express the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor; therefore, the high expression levels of the receptor in papilloma cells and the significant apoptotic effects in response to BzATP could explain the inhibitory effect of BzATP on papilloma development. In contrast, the lesser effect of BzATP in skin cancer cells could be explained by the low expression level of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor in the cancer cells.</p><p>At present little is known whether the neoplastic transformation induces lesser expression of the P2X<sub>7</sub>-receptor, or whether the neoplastic transformation is triggered preferentially in cells expressing low levels of the receptor. The former possibility is supported by data in endometrial and bladder cells where low expression of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor was found already in pre-cancerous and early cancerous cells but not in hyperplastic benign cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Accordingly, the carcinogenic process could have induced lesser expression of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>already at early stages of cancer development. On the other hand the possibility that the neoplastic transformation is triggered preferentially in cells expressing low levels of the receptor is supported by data as well, and it could be more fundamental to the understanding of epithelial-cell carcinogenesis. Thus, in uterine cervical epithelia low expression of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor was found already in dysplastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since only a small fraction of cervical dysplasia cases progresses to cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], it is possible that low expression of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor in the cervix precedes the neoplastic transformation. Accordingly, abrogation of P2X<sub>7</sub>-mediated apoptosis could be responsible for the preservation of genetically aberrant cells that are susceptible to carcinogenic stimuli, favoring neoplastic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>The present data showed only partial inhibition (by about 50%) of papilloma and cancer formation in BzATP-treated mice. The experiments used the relatively low dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2 </sup>BzATP, based on the 100 &#x003bc;M concentration used in experiments with cultured cells. The study was not designed to test higher doses and different frequencies of drug administration, and it is possible that higher doses and/or more frequent applications could produce greater inhibition papillomas and cancers. Additional studies are needed to test this possibility.</p><p>In addition to improving our understanding of the biogenesis of skin cancers and possibly other types of epithelial cancers where the P2X<sub>7 </sub>controls cell growth, the present results provide a basis for continued research of novel chemotherapeutic growth-preventive modalities through regulation of apoptosis. The rationale is that epithelial cancers usually develop from premalignant lesions, e.g. papilloma, and the cancer risk of premalignant epithelial lesions may vary from 0.1% to 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The present results in the mouse model showed that local treatment with P2X<sub>7</sub>-receptor agonists could inhibit the development of papillomas and inhibit the transformation of papillomas into cancers. BzATP appears to be a candidate chemotherapeutic growth-preventive drug for skin papillomas, with an apparent low risk profile of adverse events when administered locally on the skin. However, more studies are needed to test whether BzATP could be used in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>&#x02022; P2X<sub>7</sub>-dependent apoptosis is an important mechanism that controls the development and progression of epidermal neoplasia in the mouse.</p><p>&#x02022; P2X<sub>7</sub>-dependent apoptosis in keratinocytes is mediated by calcium influx via P2X<sub>7 </sub>pores, and involves the caspase-9 (mitochondrial) pathway.</p><p>&#x02022; The diminished pro-apoptotic effect of BzATP in mouse cancer keratinocytes is possibly the result of low expression of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor.</p><p>&#x02022; Activation of P2X<sub>7</sub>-dependent apoptosis, e.g. with BzATP could be a novel chemotherapeutic growth-preventive modality for papillomas and epithelial cancers in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>CytoCore Inc. funded a small part of the study but it has no financial interest in the study.
