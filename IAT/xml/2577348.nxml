Here, we investigated the role of the ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) in fission yeast ribosome synthesis. As for many budding yeast ribosomal proteins, Rps2 was essential for cell viability in fission yeast and the genetic depletion of Rps2 caused a complete inhibition of 40S ribosomal subunit production. The pattern of pre-rRNA processing upon depletion of Rps2 revealed a reduction of 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNAs and the concomitant production of 21S rRNA precursors, consistent with a role for Rps2 in efficient cleavage at site A<sub>2</sub> within the 32S pre-rRNA. Importantly, kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles, suggesting that most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Analysis of steady-state RNA levels revealed that some pre-40S particles were produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but that these precursors were retained in the nucleolus. Our findings suggest a role for Rps2 in a mechanism that monitors pre-40S export competence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ribosomes are the molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis in all living cells. In eukaryotes, the 80S ribosome is composed of two unequal subunits with sedimentation coefficient of 40S and 60S. Both the small (40S) and large (60S) ribosomal subunits are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes: the 40S subunit is composed of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and roughly 30 ribosomal proteins, whereas the 60S subunit contains three rRNAs (25S, 5.8S and 5S) and approximately 50 ribosomal proteins. The synthesis and processing of rRNA, as well as the assembly between rRNAs and ribosomal proteins, occur in a nuclear compartment called the nucleolus. Although ribosome biogenesis is evolutionarily conserved, it has been most extensively studied in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. In the nucleolus of this organism, a large RNP complex is cotranscriptionally recruited to the nascent rRNA precursor that is synthesized by RNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). This nascent pre-rRNA is chemically modified and rapidly processed into a (i) 20S precursor of the mature 18S rRNAs and a (ii) 27S precursor of the 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. RNA polymerase III is responsible for the synthesis of the fourth pre-RNA, the precursor of the mature 5S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Advances in proteomic approaches in the past few years have led to a significant enhancement in the identification of factors associated with ribosome biogenesis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). Specifically, affinity purification of distinct pre-ribosome intermediates coupled with mass spectrometry identified over 200 proteins with various predicted biochemical activities, including kinases, helicases, NTPases and nucleases. An important conclusion from these studies is that the machinery involved in the assembly of the small and large ribosomal subunits appears to be mostly independent of each other. Indeed, purification of 35S rRNA-associated pre-ribosomes (&#x0223c; 90S) and subsequent protein identification by mass spectrometry indicates that it mostly includes 40S subunit processing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Accordingly, RNP complexes enriched by the purification of proteins that were previously characterized as 60S assembly factors mainly identified 5.8S and 25S rRNA precursors, and were devoid of 90S-associated proteins and 18S pre-rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Interestingly, the identification of ribosomal proteins in distinct preribosome intermediates suggest that ribosomal proteins are not only structural components of ribosomes, but are actively involved in the processing and assembly of ribosomal subunits. Recent studies substantiate this scheme by demonstrating direct roles for ribosomal proteins in various steps of ribosome biogenesis, including pre-rRNA processing and/or nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">9&#x02013;15</xref>). As yet, however, the mechanisms by which ribosomal proteins are involved in ribosome biogenesis remain poorly understood.</p><p>Ribosomal subunits have to be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to become actively involved in translation. Although knowledge about the molecular details of preribosome export is limited, genetic screening in budding yeast has been able to identify genes whose mutations result in nuclear accumulation of preribosomal subunits. Whereas specific nucleoporins and the major nuclear export receptor, Crm1, are necessary for export of both pre-40S and pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">16&#x02013;20</xref>), most of the identified factors required for nuclear export of preribosomes are dedicated for the small or the large subunit. This latter observation is consistent with the dichotomy between the machineries responsible for small and large ribosomal subunit assembly.</p><p>In budding yeast, pre-40S ribosomal subunits are exported from the nucleus as 20S pre-rRNA containing particles that are processed in the cytoplasm, generating 18S rRNAs and mature 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Final processing of 40S precursors also occurs in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), consistent with a cytosolic maturation step that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Using localization of the 20S pre-rRNA or green fluorescent protein-tagged small subunit ribosomal proteins, mutations in ribosomal and nonribosomal protein-coding genes that result in nuclear accumulation of pre-40S have been identified in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Using such strategies, the small subunit proteins Rps0, Rps2, Rps3, Rps5, Rps15, Rps18, Rps19 and Rps26 appear to be required for pre-40S nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). For some of these aforementioned ribosomal proteins, however, it remains uncertain whether they are directly involved in the nuclear export of pre-40S (transit through the nuclear pore complex) or if they function in export competence (quality control events that allow small subunit assembly/export to proceed).</p><p>The 40S ribosomal protein S2 (Rps2) is present on the solvent side of the ribosome small subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>), and is related to the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> S5 ribosomal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). We and others have demonstrated that the protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3 in mammals and Rmt3 in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>) directly interacts and methylates Rps2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Notably, deletion of <italic>rmt3</italic> in fission yeast leads to hypomethylated Rps2 and causes a 40S ribosomal subunit deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), while <italic>prmt3</italic>-deficient mice exhibit minute-like characteristics during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The biological role of Rps2 methylation remains to be determined, however. Herein, we report the functional analysis of fission yeast Rps2 in ribosome biogenesis. Our data indicate that Rps2 is required for efficient processing of the 32S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>2</sub>. Consequently, endonucleolytic cleavage at site A<sub>3</sub> is kinetically favored relative to A<sub>2</sub>, resulting in the production of 21S pre-rRNAs. Importantly, our results revealed that most pre-40S subunits were rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Yet, some 20S pre-rRNA containing particles were eventually produced in Rps2-depleted cells, but were not converted to mature small subunits because they were retained in the nucleolus. Our data suggest that Rps2 participates in pre-40S export competence rather than directly in the transport of 40S precursors from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, growth media and genetic methods</title><p>Cells were grown at 30&#x000b0;C in yeast extract medium with amino acid supplements (YES) and Edinburgh minimum medium (EMM) containing appropriate amino acid supplements. <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> cells were transformed with plasmids and PCR products by the lithium acetate method.

To study the functional role of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Rps2 in ribosome biogenesis, we thus constructed a conditional strain (FBY136) in which the genomic copy of <italic>rps2</italic> is deleted and plasmid-borne <italic>rps2</italic> is expressed from the inducible/repressible <italic>nmt1</italic><sup>+</sup> promoter. Expression from the <italic>nmt1<sup>+</sup></italic> promoter is strongly repressed following thiamine addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Whereas FBY136 grew as well as the control strain on thiamine-free medium, only the control strain was able to grow when thiamine was supplemented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Accordingly, protein levels of Rps2 were markedly reduced when thiamine was added to the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).

As controls, the expression level of the nonribosomal and ribosomal proteins Rmt1 and Rpl7, respectively, did not change in the presence or absence of thiamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).

Depletion of Rps2 resulted in the reduction of free 40S subunits and polysomes as well as the accumulation of free 60S subunits (data not shown). To provide a quantitative analysis of the ratio between the small and large ribosomal subunits, we prepared cell extracts under low Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration that causes all cellular ribosomes to dissociate into separate subunits. After the centrifugation of extracts from Rps2-depleted cells on sucrose gradient, we detected a temporal decrease in 40S ribosomal subunit levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C&#x02013;F). This deficit in small ribosomal subunit resulted in a gradual increase in the 60S:40S subunit ratio: 2.4, 5.4, 10.6 and 13.8 at 0, 4, 8 and 12 h, respectively, after the addition of thiamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, D, E and F, respectively).

The synthesis and processing of ribosomal RNA precursors has been extensively studied in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). An outline of yeast pre-rRNA processing is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. In yeast, rDNA repeats are transcribed by RNA polymerase I to generate a 35S rRNA precursor that is rapidly converted into 27S and 20S pre-rRNAs. The 27S pre-rRNA is processed into the mature 25S and 5.8S rRNAs found in the 60S ribosomal subunit, whereas the 20S pre-rRNA is cleaved in the cytosol to yield the mature 18S rRNA associated with the 40S subunit. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Pre-rRNA processing in yeast. The RNA polymerase I-dependent 35S precursor is first cleaved at site A<sub>0</sub> to produce the 33S precursor, which is rapidly processed at site A<sub>1</sub> to generate the 32S precursor.

Pre-rRNA processing was followed after chasing for 2, 5, 12 and 60 min with an excess of unlabeled methionine. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, the FBY136 strain cultured in the absence of thiamine (permissive condition) rapidly processed the 35S and 32S pre-rRNAs to 27S and 20S that were then matured to 25S and 18S rRNAs, respectively. FBY136 cells grown in nonpermissive conditions (with thiamine) showed only modest delays in the maturation of the 35S and 32S pre-rRNAs (compare lanes 6&#x02013;8 to 1&#x02013;3). Synthesis of mature 18S rRNA was severely compromised in Rps2-depleted conditions: 18S rRNA was not detected even after 60 min of chase as processing stopped after the production of 20S rRNA precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, the rRNA pulse-chases assays indicated that only a small fraction of 35S precursors matured into 20S-containing particles in Rps2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;10), consistent with the active turnover of aberrant 40S precursors upon Rps2 depletion. The kinetics of 27S pre-rRNA processing into mature 25S rRNA were similar for cells cultured in permissive and nonpermissive conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These results indicate that Rps2 specifically functions in the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit and does not affect biogenesis of the large subunit, consistent with our ribosome profile data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

The apparent discrepancy between the pulse-chase and northern analyses with respect to the levels of the 20S rRNA precursor is likely explained by the fact that the pulse-chase assay analyzes the kinetics of rRNA accumulation versus the steady-state RNA levels determined by northern hybridization (see Discussion section). As expected, the block in 20S pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) resulted in a concomitant decrease in mature 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;8; probe 2).

In summary, rRNA pulse-chase assays and northern blot experiments indicate that most 40S precursors undergo rapid turnover in the absence of Rps2; yet, the 40S precursors that are produced are completely inhibited in processing beyond the 20S pre-rRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Retention of pre-40S ribosomal subunits in the nucleolus of Rps2-depleted cells</title><p>The 20S rRNA precursor is generated during pre-rRNA processing in the cell nucleus and matured by a cytoplasmic cleavage at site D to give the mature 18S rRNA [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>)]. Accordingly, the detection of 20S pre-rRNA in Rps2-depleted cells could be the consequence of the retention of pre-40S in the nucleus or the inhibition of cleavage at site D in the cytosol. We first used fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) to determine the subcellular localization of 20S rRNA precursors in strain FBY136 grown in nonpermissive conditions. As the 20S precursor is the main pre-rRNA detected by northern hybridization of total RNA using a probe complementary to region D-A<sub>2</sub> of ITS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and data not shown), a fluorescently coupled oligonucleotide specific to the same region is expected to primarily show the steady-state localization of the 20S pre-rRNA. In permissive growth conditions, the 20S rRNA precursor was found concentrated in a nuclear region immediately adjacent to the DAPI-stained nucleoplasm, distinctive of nucleolar localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, panels a&#x02013;c); some staining was also detected in the cytoplasm.

These results indicate that processing of the 20S pre-rRNA is compromised because the 40S precursors that are produced in the absence of Rps2 are retained in the nucleolus. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Pre-40S ribosomal subunits accumulate in the nucleolus of Rps2-depleted cells.

Therefore, nucleolar accumulation of 20S pre-rRNAs in Rps2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A) is also expected for ribosomal proteins of the small subunit. To establish whether the localization of a small subunit ribosomal protein is perturbed upon Rps2 depletion, we generated a construct that expresses Rps7 from its endogenous promoter as N-terminal fusion to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Sucrose gradient experiments indicated that the Rps7-GFP protein is incorporated into ribosomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn625/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>), suggesting that the plasmid-expressed ribosomal protein is functional. The Rps7-GFP fusion showed cytosolic and nucleolar localization in FBY136 and wild-type strains grown without thiamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, panels a and c). In the presence of thiamine, however, the nucleolar levels of Rps7-GFP were increased in FBY136 cells as compared to the control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, compare panels b and d). Rps7-GFP was also detected in the nucleoplasm of Rps2-depleted cells, but not in control cells (compare panel b to panels a and d). We believe that the nucleoplasmic Rps7-GFP signal seen in nonpermissive conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B) likely corresponds to the free ribosomal protein.

Notably, this nuclear and nucleolar accumulation in nonpermissive conditions resulted in a corresponding decrease in the cytosolic localization of Rps7-GFP.

As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, such a phenotype of rRNA processing is indicative of delays in A<sub>2</sub> cleavage within ITS1. The detection of 21S rRNA precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) suggests that the rate of cleavage at site A<sub>3</sub> exceeds cleavage at site A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), thereby allowing the release of 27S rRNA precursors for the synthesis of 60S subunits. It should be noted that whereas the RNase MRP is responsible for A<sub>3</sub> cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), the endonuclease responsible for A<sub>2</sub> cleavage remains to be identified, although the putative nuclease Utp24 was recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Because accumulation of 22S and 23S pre-rRNAs were not detected in our northern analyses from Rps2-depleted cells, the results also suggest that Rps2 does not significantly contribute to cleavage at A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub> in fission yeast. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Function of Rps2 in fission yeast pre-rRNA processing.

The kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by pulse-chase assays suggest that most 40S precursors are rapidly degraded in the absence of Rps2. Whether 21S- or 20S-containing particles, or both, are subject to this rapid turnover remains to be determined. The remaining 20S-containing small subunit precursors are not processed into mature 18S rRNA in the cytoplasm because they are retained in the nucleolus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn625f7"/></fig></p><p>Delays in A<sub>2</sub> cleavage with little or no perturbation in A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>1</sub> processing have previously been reported in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> bearing mutations in the <italic>rrp8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), <italic>rrp5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) and <italic>yar1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) genes, as well as upon genetic depletion of the ribosomal proteins Rps0, Rps18, Rps19 and Rps21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism by which the product of these genes perturb 32S pre-rRNA processing at site A<sub>2</sub> is still poorly understood. The small subunit (SSU) processome, a complex consisting of the U3 small nucleolar RNA and &#x0223c;40 proteins, is required for early pre-rRNA processing, including cleavage at A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51">49&#x02013;51</xref>).

It is therefore possible that processome-independent association of Rps2 with the nascent pre-rRNA causes structural rearrangements required for optimal cleavage at A<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>A role for Rps2 in pre-40S export competence</title><p>In yeast and mammalian cells, 40S precursors are generated in the nucleolus, but must be exported to the cytoplasm for final processing into mature small subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Cells that were depleted of Rps2 were completely inhibited in 18S rRNA synthesis and 40S subunit production, which is likely the cause of lethality in these cells. Importantly, the kinetics of pre-rRNA accumulation as determined by our rRNA pulse-chase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) indicated that a small fraction of 35S rRNA precursors matured into 20S-containing particles in Rps2-depleted cells. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, our results are consistent with the active turnover of aberrant 40S precursors in the absence of Rps2. Importantly, analyses of <italic>de novo</italic>-synthesized rRNA species in yeast strains depleted for small subunit ribosomal proteins indicate that 40S precursors stalled in maturation are not necessarily targeted for rapid degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), suggesting that the rapid turnover of pre-40S observed upon Rps2 depletion is not a general consequence of the absence of a ribosomal protein. Two models, which are not mutually exclusive, could explain the low levels of 40S precursors detected in Rps2-depleted cells: (i) the efficient turnover of 21S-containing particles before reaching maturation into 20S pre-rRNAs, and (ii) slow processing of 21S into 20S pre-rRNA followed by rapid turnover of 20S-containing particles. Because we did not observe high levels of 21S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B) upon Rps2 depletion, which would be expected from the second model, we favor a mechanism, whereby 21S-containing particles are efficiently degraded. Interestingly, it does not appear that 21S-containing particles are intrinsically unstable precursors, since they can be processed directly into mature 18S rRNA in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). The stable incorporation of Rps2 into pre-40S particles could therefore directly control the inactivation of a surveillance mechanism. Alternatively, Rps2 could act indirectly via the structural rearrangement of a folding intermediate that triggers quality control pathways.</p><p>Although most 40S precursors were rapidly degraded upon depletion of Rps2, analysis of steady-state RNA levels by northern hybridization nevertheless detected 20S pre-rRNA in Rps2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). These 40S precursors were retained in the nucleolus, however, as determined by the visualization of pre-rRNAs and ribosomal proteins in individual cells by FISH and GFP fluorescence, respectively. We thus conclude that Rps2-depleted cells did not produce mature 40S subunits because the remaining 20S pre-rRNA-containing particles did not reach the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) for final processing by Fap7 and/or Nob1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Furthermore, the absence of detectable levels of 20S pre-rRNA in the nucleoplasm of Rps2-depleted cells contrasts to the noticeable detection of this rRNA precursor in the nucleoplasm of Rps15-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Accordingly, Rps15 appears to play a direct role in small subunit nuclear export. Taken together, our data suggest a role for <italic>S. pombe</italic> Rps2 in making 40S precursors export competent rather than being directly involved in the transport of pre-40S subunits from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We thus propose that pre-40S particles produced in the absence of Rps2 are recognized as aberrant and retained in the nucleolus for degradation. Nucleolar retention of preribosomes has been previously observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>: in <italic>nop9</italic>-null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) as well as in cells that express a temperature-sensitive allele of the HEAT repeat-containing protein, Sda1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). In fact, genetic evidence from the study of Dez <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) indicates that the rapid turnover of pre-60S particles generated in the conditional <italic>sda1-2</italic> strain requires the <italic>Tr</italic>f4-<italic>A</italic>ir1/2-<italic>M</italic>tr4 <italic>p</italic>olyadenylation (TRAMP) complex and the nuclear exosome.

These studies reveal that most ribosomal proteins of the small subunit are required for specific steps of 40S assembly. Consistent with our results in fission yeast, processing of the 20S pre-rRNA into 18S rRNA is inhibited upon depletion of budding yeast Rps2. In contrast to our FISH results, however, the cytoplasmic and nucleolar levels of the 20S pre-rRNA detected upon depletion of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rps2 were similar to a control strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Yet, the same study shows that Rps2 is required for nuclear export of pre-40S particles based on biochemical data that used a dynamic maturation assay in which nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs are fractionated after pulse-labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, it is difficult to distinguish between nucleoplasmic and nucleolar sources of pre-rRNAs using such a pulse-labeling assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Our study thus goes beyond these previous findings and provides evidence for the nucleolar retention of 20S-containing particles in the absence of Rps2.</p><p>The discrepancy between the ITS1 FISH results in Rps2-depleted budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and fission (our study) yeasts is unclear; however, it could due to technical differences as the 2-h period allowed for depletion of Rps2 for the FISH analysis in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) was not sufficient to detect nucleolar accumulation of 20S rRNA precursors in our conditional strain of <italic>S. pombe</italic> (data not shown).
