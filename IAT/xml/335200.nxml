Primer extension and nuclease protection analysis have revealed the presence of multiple transcriptional initiation sites, that are utilized in several hemopoietic cell lines (WEHI3B(D+). FDC-P1 and RB22.2). Some of the sites are used in all cell lines but others are unique; all are located in a region of the c-myb gene that is G-C rich, contains a number of potential Sp1 binding sites and lacks classical promoter consensus sequences. Experiments in which well characterized promoters controlling expression of a reporter gene have been replaced by fragments of c-myb DNA (including the observed cap sites) were performed in an attempt to demonstrate promoter activity in various cell types. It was shown that a region of the c-myb gene (approximately 1.0 kbp upstream from the splice donor site of the first exon) contains a weak promoter that has a low level of transcriptional activity in hemopoietic as well as in fibroblastic cells. These results support the suggestion that c-myb expression is not regulated primarily at the level of initiation of transcription.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0088-a" xlink:role="9600"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0090-a" xlink:role="9602"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9593"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9594"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9595"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9596"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9597"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9598"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9599"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9600"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9601"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9602"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9603"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9604"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9605"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9606"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9607"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9608"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9609"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9610"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9611"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
