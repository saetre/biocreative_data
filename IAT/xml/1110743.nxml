PNPase has been implicated in both mRNA and 23S rRNA 3&#x02032; processing. However, the observed maturation defects do not affect chloroplast translation, suggesting that the overall role of PNPase in maturation of chloroplast rRNA is not essential. Here, we show that this role can be largely ascribed to RNR1, for which homozygous mutants germinate only on sucrose-containing media, and have white cotyledons and pale green rosette leaves. Accumulation of chloroplast-encoded mRNAs and tRNAs is unaffected in such mutants, suggesting that RNR1 activity is either unnecessary or redundant for their processing and turnover. However, accumulation of several chloroplast rRNA species is severely affected. High-resolution RNA gel blot analysis, and mapping of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends, revealed that RNR1 is involved in the maturation of 23S, 16S and 5S rRNAs. The 3&#x02032; extensions of the accumulating 5S rRNA precursors can be efficiently removed <italic>in vitro</italic> by purified RNR1, consistent with this view. Our data suggest that decreased accumulation of mature chloroplast ribosomal RNAs leads to a reduction in the number of translating ribosomes, ultimately compromising chloroplast protein abundance and thus plant growth and development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Development of chloroplasts from proplastids and expression of the plastid genome are intimately linked processes, which are ultimately coordinated by nucleus-encoded proteins and enzymes. Chloroplast gene expression is regulated at several steps, one of these being post-transcriptional RNA processing. This includes endonucleolytic cleavage of long polycistronic transcripts, and 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end processing of precursor RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p><p>A heavily processed transcript in the plastids of flowering plants is the polycistronic primary transcript emanating from the ribosomal RNA (rrn) operon. This highly conserved gene cluster encodes the 16S, 23S, 4.5S and 5S rRNAs and three tRNAs. Maturation of the primary transcript occurs via a series of endo- and exonucleolytic steps. The primary precursor is initially processed by excision of the tRNAs and by additional endonucleolytic cleavages to generate 16S and 5S rRNA precursors, and a dicistronic 23S&#x02013;4.5S processing intermediate. Subsequent endonucleolytic processing of the 23S&#x02013;4.5S rRNA to generate monocistronic 23S and 4.5S rRNAs appears to occur on the ribosome [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)] and is thought to require prior 3&#x02032; end maturation of 4.5S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The 16S, 23S and 5S rRNA precursors generated by endonucleolytic cleavage require further processing to establish mature 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends.</p><p>While the molecular nature of rRNA processing has been gradually elucidated, the nature of the enzymatic machinery has remained elusive, in part because certain rRNA defects can represent pleiotropic effects where plastid biogenesis has been otherwise impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Several higher plant mutations, however, appear to have a primary defect in the processing of plastid rRNAs. For example, the maize mutant <italic>hcf7</italic> is impaired in 16S rRNA 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end processing, and the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant <italic>dal1</italic> is impaired in the processing of 16S rRNA 3&#x02032; ends and accumulates the 23S&#x02013;4.5S dicistronic processing intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant <italic>wco</italic> is also affected at least in 16S rRNA processing, but this defect is observed only in cotyledons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The <italic>DCL</italic> gene is essential for the accumulation of mature chloroplast ribosomes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>); however, defects in ribosomal proteins do not necessarily lead to aberrant rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). None of the genes affected by the mutations discussed above encodes proteins resembling known RNA processing factors, although DCL does interact with known RNA processing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). An apparent exception to these findings is the phosphorolytic 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exoribonuclease, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), whose chloroplast isozyme (At3g03710) has been implicated in 23S rRNA 3&#x02032; end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). This leaves open the question of how chloroplast rRNA maturation is regulated, and whether this maturation is linked to other processes.</p><p>The RNR superfamily of hydrolytic 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exoribonucleases, which includes the prokaryotic enzymes RNase II, is, in prokaryotes, primarily involved in the turnover of mRNA and of polyadenylated RNA degradation intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). RNase R, together with PNPase, is involved in the turnover of 16S and 23S rRNA degradation intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), and highly structured RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nuclear genome encodes three members of the RNR superfamily, which we have named RNR1-3. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RNR1 (At5g02250), previously named AtmtRNaseII, was first implicated in the final step of mitochondrial <italic>atp9</italic> mRNA 3&#x02032; end maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). This enzyme was subsequently shown to also be chloroplast-targeted in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and it was observed that a weak mutant allele of <italic>RNR1</italic> led to the accumulation of the 23S&#x02013;4.5S processing intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Here, we demonstrate, using null mutants, that RNR1 plays a profound role in rRNA metabolism, and thus in plant development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>The WT ecotype Columbia (Col-0) of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> was used in this study.

The exoribonucleolytic activity of the At5g02250 gene product was confirmed following the purification of a C-terminal tagged version from overexpressing transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The At5g02250 product was first named AtmtRNase II based on its mitochondrial localization as determined by transient expression of a fusion of the N-terminal 192 amino acids to green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the observation that an increased number of incompletely processed mitochondrial <italic>atp9</italic> mRNA 3&#x02032; ends accumulated in mutant plant, based on sequencing of cRT&#x02013;PCR products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>However, a chloroplast localization was subsequently proposed for this same protein, when a GFP fusion to 118 N-terminal amino acids was expressed, also in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). These workers further showed that a T-DNA insertion 36 bp upstream of the At5g02250 translation initiation codon gene decreased, but did not abolish expression, and resulted in plants exhibiting impaired photosynthesis, retarded growth and pale green leaves. Given that the GFP results and growth phentoypes suggested a role for At5g02250 in chloroplast biogenesis, the gene was re-named <italic>RNR1</italic>, a nomenclature that we have adopted here. However, the participation of <italic>RNR1</italic> in cpRNA metabolism was not thoroughly explored.</p><p>To pursue the analysis of <italic>RNR1</italic> in the context of chloroplast biogenesis, we selected three T-DNA insertion alleles from the Salk SIGnAL collection, naming them <italic>rnr1-1</italic> (SALK_138535), <italic>rnr1-2</italic> (SALK_044726) and <italic>rnr1-3</italic> (SALK_090294) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Homozygous mutants from each line were isolated following three outcrosses of the original T3 plants. Homozygous plants from each of these lines required germination and initial growth on sucrose-containing medium, consistent with a defect in photosynthesis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> compares WT and <italic>rnr1</italic> homozygotes after 15 days of growth on MS sucrose. The cotyledons of <italic>rnr1</italic> plants emerged either white or dark red, signifying a lack of chlorophyll and a significant accumulation of anthocyanins, which dissipated after several days as the cotyledons became white and then pale green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top panels). The rosette leaves of <italic>rnr1</italic> mutants, which are already visible in <italic>rnr1-3</italic> seedlings after 15 days, emerged and remained pale green compared with those of WT plants.</p><p>Following 40 days of growth on MS sucrose, both WT and <italic>rnr1-3</italic> were transferred to soil and were grown for an additional 9 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom panels). Under these conditions, growth of <italic>rnr1-3</italic> was significantly slower than the WT, and rosette leaves of the mutant remained pale green. Fourteen-day-old etiolated WT and <italic>rnr1</italic> plants were indistinguishable, which indicated that RNR1 activity was not required for skotomorphogenesis (data not shown), and the roots of the <italic>rnr1</italic> plants resembled those of the WT at all stages of growth.</p><p>Given the strong effect of the <italic>rnr1</italic> mutations on green tissues, it was of interest to determine whether <italic>RNR1</italic> exhibited tissue-specific expression. RT&#x02013;PCR was used to determine the mRNA abundance for <italic>RNR1</italic> in WT seedlings, mature leaves, roots and flower/flower buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The highest expression was found in 15-day-old seedlings, and roughly uniform expression was found in the other tissues examined, as compared with the control ubiquitin transcript. This result would be consistent with the presence of RNR1 in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), which are active in gene expression in non-green tissues. The extent to which RNR1 is required in plastid types other than chloroplasts is unknown.</p><p>To confirm the defect in chloroplast biogenesis suggested by the pale leaves of <italic>rnr1</italic> plants, cotyledons of WT and <italic>rnr1</italic> plants were observed by light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Following toluidine blue staining of transverse sections of cotyledons, chloroplasts could be detected in WT but not in <italic>rnr1</italic> cotyledons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>rnr1</italic> cotyledons exhibited a severely disorganized structure with no recognizable lower epithelium. Further analysis by TEM revealed that <italic>rnr1</italic> plastids contained no stacked thylakoids, and that these leaves contained plastoglobules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the latter perhaps reflecting a stress response. Taken together, these data suggest that RNR1 is essential for chloroplast development in cotyledons, and that this requirement is less strict in rosette leaves.</p></sec><sec><title>mRNA and tRNA transcripts accumulate normally in rnr1 plants</title><p>Because RNase II and RNase R are important for regulating RNA processing and turnover in bacteria, we compared the accumulation of representative mRNAs and tRNAs in 40-day-old WT and <italic>rnr1</italic> plants grown on sucrose-containing medium. We observed no differences in the accumulation of mRNAs encoding the &#x003b1;-subunit of the CF<sub>0</sub>CF<sub>1</sub> ATPase complex (<italic>atpA</italic>), the Photosystem II D1 protein (<italic>psbA</italic>), the Rubisco large subunit (<italic>rbcL</italic>), or of a tricistronic mRNA encoding the PsaA/PsaB subunits of Photosystem I and the ribosomal S14 subunit (<italic>psaA-psaB-rps14</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also observed no difference in the accumulation of the mitochondrial mRNA <italic>cox3</italic>, which encodes cytochrome oxidase subunit III. The <italic>rnr1</italic> mutation also had no obvious effect on 3&#x02032; end processing of <italic>psbA</italic> or <italic>rbcL</italic> transcripts, a phenotype that has been observed previously in chloroplast PNPase-deficient <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). RNA gel blots were also probed to detect an intronless tRNA, tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> (<italic>trnF</italic>), and an intron-containing tRNA, tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> (<italic>trnL</italic>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we observed no differences&#x02014;neither in the accumulation of tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> nor in the accumulation of the precursor or mature forms of tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>. RNR1 activity is, therefore, redundant or not required for processing and turnover of chloroplast mRNA and tRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>rnr1 plants accumulate fewer photosynthetic proteins than WT</title><p>The pale leaf phenotype of the <italic>rnr1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and microscopic evidence for a defect in chloroplast development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggested that although chloroplast mRNAs were accumulating normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), <italic>rnr1</italic> was not accumulating WT levels of photosynthetic protein complexes. To test this hypothesis, total protein from WT or <italic>rnr1</italic> leaves was analyzed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Because accumulation of photosynthetic complex subunits is highly coordinated, changes in the accumulation of individual core subunits are indicative of the accumulation of the entire complex.

In contrast, <italic>rnr1</italic> plants accumulated 3-fold less mature 16S RNA than WT plants, and 3-fold more of the precursor. To positively identify the 1.7 kb RNA as the pre-16S RNA, blots were reanalyzed with probes derived from the intergenic spacer and flanking the endonucleolytic cleavage site (probes <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). Probe <italic>B</italic> identified the 1.7 kb RNA, while probe <italic>C</italic> did not give a signal on these blots (data not shown), confirming that the longer transcript is the pre-16S RNA.</p><p>When RNA gel blots were analyzed with a 23S-specific probe (probe <italic>D</italic>), a complex pattern was revealed. 23S rRNA accumulates in chloroplasts as 7 major transcripts, the most noteworthy of which are the 1.2, 1.0 and 0.5 kb 23S* bands, which represent the mature 23S transcript after processing at &#x02018;hidden breaks&#x02019; following incorporation into ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), and a 3.2 kb band, which represents the 23S&#x02013;4.5S dicistronic precursor RNA. There were no detectable differences in the sizes of these major 23S fragments, indicating that there were no apparent defects in 23S rRNA 3&#x02032; processing, in contrast to what was observed in chloroplast PNPase-deficient <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). However, there were significant differences in the accumulation of several 23S RNA-containing transcripts. The 7.4 kb precursor RNA was visible in the <italic>rnr1</italic> plant, accumulation of the 3.2 kb 23S&#x02013;4.5S dicistronic RNA increased 10-fold in <italic>rnr1</italic>, and accumulation of the 23S* fragments decreased 10-fold. A similar result was observed when blots were analyzed with a 4.5S probe (probe <italic>E</italic>): the dicistronic 23S&#x02013;4.5S RNA over-accumulated in the mutant, and accumulation of the mature 0.1 kb 4.5S RNA decreased 10-fold.</p><p>When RNA gel blots were analyzed for the accumulation of 5S rRNA (probe <italic>F</italic>), we found that the accumulation of mature 5S rRNA (120 nt) was at least 10-fold lower in <italic>rnr1</italic> as compared with WT plants. Furthermore, mutant plants often accumulated low levels of an &#x0223c;350 nt precursor 5S rRNA (pre-5S). The fact that RNR1 activity was previously implicated in 3&#x02032; exonucleolytic trimming of the mitochondrial <italic>atp9</italic> mRNA prompted a high-resolution analysis of chloroplast rRNA 3&#x02032; end processing.</p></sec><sec><title>RNR1 activity is essential for final rRNA 3&#x02032; end maturation</title><p>Because the size of 16S rRNA prevents the detection of small extensions by agarose gel blot analysis, its 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends were mapped by cRT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As expected, all 16S rRNA analyzed had mature 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends in WT plants (filled arrowheads). 16S rRNA 5&#x02032; ends were also processed correctly in <italic>rnr1</italic> plants, whereas no mature 16S 3&#x02032; ends were detected in the mutant plants (open arrowheads). Ten of eleven clones analyzed contained a 5 nt 3&#x02032; extension, and the remaining clone contained a 12 nt extension. Thus, while the lack of RNR1 causes only a modest increase in the accumulation of the 1.7 kb pre-16S RNA, the mutation prevents the final 3&#x02032; processing of the mature transcript.</p><p>The processing of 23S RNA at the hidden breaks complicates its analysis by cRT&#x02013;PCR. Maturation of 23S 3&#x02032; ends was, therefore, analyzed by RNase protection, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. RNA from WT or from <italic>rnr1</italic> (or yeast tRNA as a negative control) was hybridized to a 190 nt antisense RNA probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), digested with RNase T1 and RNase A, and analyzed in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In RNA samples from WT plants, the probe protected an 86 nt fragment that represents the mature 23S RNA and, to a lesser extent, an &#x0223c;184 nt band that represents the dicistronic 23S&#x02013;4.5S species, as shown below. No mature 23S 3&#x02032; ends were observed in the <italic>rnr1</italic> mutant, but these plants did accumulate incompletely processed 23S 3&#x02032; ends with 10&#x02013;15 nt extensions. Thus, 3&#x02032; end maturation of both 16S and 23S rRNAs is affected in <italic>rnr1</italic>.</p><p>The small sizes of 4.5S and 5S rRNAs allow their analysis by high-resolution RNA gel blots in addition to RNase protection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, although monocistronic 4.5S rRNA accumulates to a much lower level in <italic>rnr1</italic> plants than in WT, no defect in its 3&#x02032; processing was observed, which would have been apparent as a slightly longer species. The 3&#x02032; end processing of 4.5S rRNA was also analyzed by RNase protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). In WT plants, 4.5S rRNA accumulates both as a mature species of &#x0223c;97&#x02013;99 nt, and as a weaker band of &#x0223c;270 nt, which represents an &#x0223c;170 nt 3&#x02032; extension. In the mutant, a significantly higher proportion of 4.5S rRNA accumulated as the precursor species, but a low level of mature 4.5S rRNA also accumulated, as was observed by RNA gel blot.</p><p>While RNase protection clearly showed the accumulation of precursor 4.5S transcripts in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), RNA gel blot analysis suggested that these did not represent monocistronic pre-4.5S rRNAs, as such a species of &#x0223c;270 nt would have easily been observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, probe <italic>E</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). It was likely, therefore, that the 4.5S precursors were derived entirely from dicistronic 23S&#x02013;4.5S species rather than from moncistronic pre-4.5S transcripts. Significant accumulation of both the 4.5S rRNA precursor and the 23S&#x02013;4.5S transcripts is consistent with the view that processing of the 4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; end is a prerequisite to its cleavage from 23S rRNA, as has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). This was tested by probing an RNA gel blot either with a 4.5S-specific oligonucleotide as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, left panel) or with a 4.5S rRNA precursor-specific oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, right panel). While the 4.5S-specific probe detected both dicistronic and mature 4.5S transcripts as expected, the precursor-specific probe detected only the dicistronic RNA, and not an &#x0223c;270 nt species.</p><p>To better characterize the 23S&#x02013;4.5S species, both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of this precursor were mapped by cRT&#x02013;PCR. Two types of 5&#x02032; ends were detected, both in WT and in <italic>rnr1</italic> plants, and coincided either with the annotated mature 23S 5&#x02032; end or to a position 72&#x02013;73 nt upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). As expected, more clones corresponding to the mature 5&#x02032; ends were detected in WT than in <italic>rnr1</italic>, but the lack of RNR1 did not seem to influence the location of these maturation sites. Interestingly, the 8 and 3 clones in WT and <italic>rnr1</italic>, respectively, which had mature 23S RNA 5&#x02032; ends, also had mature 4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This would represent the mature dicistronic intermediate prior to endonucleolytic cleavage between 23S and 4.5S rRNAs. However, due to the use of T4 RNA ligase during cRT&#x02013;PCR it is not possible to exclude the ligation of mature 23S and mature 4.5S prior to cDNA synthesis. Nevertheless, all clones with unprocessed 23S rRNA 5&#x02032; ends also had unprocessed 4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; ends, both in WT and in <italic>rnr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Although the 3&#x02032; ends of two clones from the mutant mapped downstream of the 5S rRNA, representing the 23S&#x02013;4.5S&#x02013;5S processing intermediate, most 3&#x02032; ends of 23S&#x02013;4.5S precursors mapped to a cluster of 4 nt situated 170 nt downstream of the 4.5S rRNA, as predicted by RNase protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This region likely represents an endonucleolytic cleavage site between the 4.5S and 5S rRNAs.</p><p>Both RNA gel blot and cRT&#x02013;PCR data suggested that 3&#x02032; maturation of 4.5S rRNA precedes or occurs concomitantly with endonucleolytic cleavage of the dicistronic 23S&#x02013;4.5S rRNA and, furthermore, that the impaired endonucleolytic processing of the 23S&#x02013;4.5S dicistronic species in <italic>rnr1</italic> plants is a pleiotropic effect of the lack of RNR1. Although it is tempting to suggest that incomplete 4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; processing is a primary defect of RNR1 deficiency, there is no direct evidence that this is the case, and accumulation of the 23S&#x02013;4.5S species has been observed in unrelated chloroplast biogenesis mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>To study the involvement of RNR1 in 5S rRNA 3&#x02032; end processing more closely, both RNase protection and cRT&#x02013;PCR experiments were performed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> shows that a 5S antisense probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) protected mature 5S rRNA from both WT and <italic>rnr1</italic> plants, whereas <italic>rnr1</italic> mutants alone accumulated a population of 5S precursor RNAs with short, heterogeneous 3&#x02032; extensions averaging 10 nt in length, as well as a full-length precursor of 351 nt, which is most likely generated by RNase P cleavage at the 5&#x02032; end of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>, and which was previously observed by agarose RNA gel blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, probe <italic>F</italic>). cRT&#x02013;PCR was used to reveal the precise 3&#x02032; ends of the pre-5S rRNAs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, all the clones obtained from WT RNA contained mature 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends, and although a few such clones were also obtained from <italic>rnr1</italic> plants, most clones from the mutant contained small 3&#x02032; extensions ranging from 1 to 11 nt. Together, these data indicate that RNR1 is involved in trimming these extensions, although since a small proportion of 5S rRNA mature 3&#x02032; ends was observed, they can also be apparently generated by an RNR1-independent route.</p></sec><sec><title>Purified RNR1 accurately processes pre-5S rRNA <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>C-terminal-tagged RNR1 (RNR1-tag) was purified from a transgenic overexpressing line to check whether RNR1 was able to perform <italic>in vitro</italic> the 3&#x02032; processing of 5S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). A mock purification was also performed from plants that did not overexpress tagged RNR1.

No RNase activity was observed with the mock fraction or in buffer alone, but tagged RNR1 efficiently digested the 20 nt extension to generate a mature 5S rRNA 3&#x02032; end.

Here, we have presented a detailed analysis of <italic>rnr1</italic> null mutants, which has illuminated several facets of chloroplast rRNA maturation. The RNA phenotypes presented here are much more striking than those observed in mitochondria of one of the same null mutant lines, <italic>rnr1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), raising the question of whether RNR1 is a minor player in mitochondria. Just as perplexing are the contradictory GFP targeting results which, rather than showing dual targeting in any of three laboratories which tested similar fusions [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and Supplementary Figure 1], generated either uniquely chloroplast or uniquely mitochondrial targeting. While the fusions made in each case were slightly different and GFP is well-known to produce artifacts, such results are unusual but not unprecedented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Furthermore, short nucleotide extensions were found in both organelles in <italic>rnr1</italic> plants, suggesting that indeed RNR1 is present both in mitochondria and in chloroplasts. In the longer term, careful immunoblot analysis should resolve these remaining ambiguities.</p><sec><title>Chloroplast 23S rRNA maturation requires several processing steps</title><p>Chloroplast rrn operon processing differs somewhat from that of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. In <italic>E.coli</italic>, 16S and 23S precursor RNAs are excised from a 30S precursor by RNase III, which cleaves the double-stranded stem formed by base pairing of their 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends. This is followed by endonucleolytic 5&#x02032; end maturation by RNase E, which for 23S RNA generates a 3&#x02032; overhang that is subsequently processed exonucleolytically to the mature 3&#x02032; end by RNase T, and to some extent by RNase PH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The 3&#x02032; end processing of 23S RNA occurs on the ribosome, as RNase T-deficient cells accumulate ribosomes with immature 23S RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>Based on its homologous position in the rrn operon, chloroplast 4.5S rRNA is derived from the fragmentation of the 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), which is accompanied by a 99 nt insertion in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Endonucleolytic processing within this sequence results in the formation of a mature 4.5S rRNA and a slightly shorter 23S RNA, in comparison with those of most bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Therefore, <italic>E.coli</italic> 23S RNA 3&#x02032; processing can be compared with chloroplast 23S&#x02013;4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; processing.</p><p>In chloroplasts, there is no sequence complementarity between the 23S 5&#x02032; end and the 4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; end that would suggest base pairing and endonucleolytic excision from the 7.4 kb precursor by an endonuclease like RNase III. In contrast, the 23S&#x02013;4.5S intermediate is generated by endonucleolytic cleavage &#x0223c;78 nt upstream of the mature 23S 5&#x02032; end, and &#x0223c;170 nt downstream of the 4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; end. This is followed by 3&#x02032; maturation of the 4.5S sequence in a single step, which either precedes or occurs concomitantly with 23S 5&#x02032; processing, since cRT&#x02013;PCR has shown that dicistronic intermediates with mature 4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; ends also have mature 23S 5&#x02032; ends. Our data are also consistent with the hypothesis that 4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; maturation must precede excision of the 4.5S rRNA from the dicistronic intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). This is reminiscent of the ordered mitochondrial tRNA processing, although in those cases 3&#x02032; end maturation is dependent on 5&#x02032; maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p><p>The 5&#x02032; end maturation of 23S rRNA is probably endonucleolytic, as there is no evidence for a 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exoribonuclease in plant chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), although ample evidence for this activity exists for <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Based on sedimentation of the dicistronic intermediate with polysomes in sucrose density gradients, this processing occurs on ribosomes, as has been proposed previously for the <italic>Brassica napus</italic> 23S&#x02013;4.5S intermediate and for <italic>E.coli</italic> 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Maturation of the 4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; end</title><p>Processing of the 4.5S rRNA 3&#x02032; end occurs in a single step, and based on polysome analysis, both this and final maturation of 23S rRNA also occur on ribosomes. In <italic>rnr1</italic> mutants, accumulation of translation-competent ribosomes is limited, presumably due to limiting levels of mature 16S or 5S rRNA or both.

Therefore, in <italic>rnr1</italic> mutants, the 23S&#x02013;4.5S intermediate may accumulate simply because ribosome assembly is slowed and its accumulation may, therefore, be a pleiotropic effect of the mutation.

In contrast, once incorporated into ribosomes, chloroplast 23S&#x02013;4.5S rRNA processing includes an endonucleolytic cleavage to produce the monocistronic 4.5S rRNA and a 23S precursor rRNA, and two subsequent exonucleolytic events, PNPase-catalyzed generation of a precursor with 10&#x02013;15 nt extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), followed by RNR1 trimming.

Secondary structure increases the stability of mRNAs, such as the <italic>trpT</italic> terminator, and in general those containing repetitive extragenic palindrome sequences in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), or 3&#x02032; stem&#x02013;loop structures in chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). In this view, RNR1 would digest the unstructured extensions downstream of the mature rRNA 3&#x02032; ends, but stall when it reached their structured regions. The specificity of RNR1 in rRNA processing is also emphasized by the fact that the maturation of <italic>trnR</italic> appeared to be RNR1-independent, or the role of RNR1 is fully redundant in its processing.</p><p>However, <italic>rnr1</italic> mutants were less efficient at processing long, highly structured pre-16S, pre-23S&#x02013;4.5S and to a lesser extent, pre-5S transcripts. Therefore, we cannot exclude that RNR1 could be partially responsible for processing these tails. This facet of RNR1 activity might require accessory protein(s). By analogy to the <italic>E.coli</italic> degradosome, where the association of PNPase with the RNA helicase RhlB allows it to turn over highly structured substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>), it is possible that RNR1 processivity is enhanced by its association with an RNA helicase. One candidate is the chloroplast RNA helicase encoded by <italic>VDL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), which is essential for the function of all plastid types, as would be expected of an rRNA maturation factor. Whether the <italic>vdl</italic> mutant accumulates aberrant plastid transcripts remains to be reported.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> contains three RNR genes</title><p>Residual rRNA processing in <italic>rnr1</italic> prompted us to search for additional members of the RNR superfamily encoded in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nuclear genome, and two such genes were found. We have tentatively designated these <italic>RNR2</italic> (At1g77680) and <italic>RNR3</italic> (At2g17510). While experiments with the RNR N-terminal 100 amino acids fused to GFP confirmed chloroplast targeting for RNR1, the putative RNR2 transit peptide (N-terminal 231 amino acid) targeted GFP to the nucleus and RNR3 targeting, using the N-terminal 194 amino acid of RNR3, resembled that of the untagged GFP control, suggesting that RNR2 and RNR3 might be components of the exosome (Supplementary Figure 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Therefore, chloroplasts appear to contain only a single RNR family enzyme, as well as PNPase. Whether these enzymes catalyze redundant activities remains to be seen, but a <italic>pnp1</italic>/<italic>rnr1</italic> double mutant is embryo lethal (S. Yehudai-Resheff, T. Bollenbach, R. Gutierrez and D. Stern, manuscript in preparation).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_33_8_2751__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_33_8_2751__gki576.tif"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory for providing the sequence-indexed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> T-DNA insertion mutants.
