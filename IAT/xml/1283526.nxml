It possesses three RNA-binding domains and is involved in the regulation of RNA metabolism. The long <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) is necessary for autoregulation. We used RNA-binding assays and <italic>in vitro</italic> selection to identify the ELAV best binding site in the <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR. This site resembles ELAV-binding sites identified previously in heterologous targets, both for its nucleotide sequence and its significant affinity for ELAV (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> 40 nM). This finding supports our model that <italic>elav</italic> autoregulation depends upon direct interaction between ELAV and <italic>elav</italic> RNA. We narrowed down the best binding site to a 20 nt long sequence A(U<sub>5</sub>)A(U<sub>3</sub>)G(U<sub>2</sub>)A(U<sub>6</sub>) in an alternative 3&#x02032; exon. We propose and test a model in which the regulated use of this alternative 3&#x02032; exon is involved in normal <italic>elav</italic> regulation. Found in NEurons (FNE), another neuronal RNA-binding protein paralogous to ELAV, also binds this site. These observations provide a molecular basis for the <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions reported previously between <italic>elav</italic> and <italic>fne</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>embryonic lethal abnormal visual system (elav)</italic> encodes (ELAV) protein that is the founding member of a family of primarily neuronal RNA-binding proteins that exist in all metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Proteins from this family contain three RNA recognition motif (RRMs), with a long variable hinge separating RRM2 from RRM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Proteins with RRMs typically interact with RNA, and act as post-transcriptional regulators. In addition, RRM domains can also serve other functions. For example the RRM of the <italic>Y14</italic> protein, present in complexes at exon junctions, forms heterodimers with the <italic>Mago-nashi</italic> protein, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). RRM&#x02013;DNA interactions have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> ELAV is required for the normal differentiation and maintenance of all neurons, appearing in postmitotic neurons and persisting at all stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). A second member of the family, RBP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), is produced starting at the third larval instar in all neurons, where its function remains unclear. It is also present in the cytoplasm of cystocytes where it is necessary for female fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The product of the third paralogue, found in neurons (<italic>fne</italic>), is detected shortly after ELAV with the same neuronal specificity, except that FNE appears to be cytoplasmic, while ELAV and neuronal RBP9 are nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Over-expression of FNE in neurons has shown that the two paralogues <italic>elav</italic> and <italic>fne</italic> interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In vertebrates, HuR, one of four ELAV orthologues, is ubiquitously expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), while the other three are early markers of neuronal differentiation, and persist in some mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The importance of these proteins for neuronal plasticity is reflected by their accumulation during acquisition of spatial memory in neurons of the hyppocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>ELAV family proteins bind with a distinct preference to U-rich sequences with apparent dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) in the 1&#x02013;100 nM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Modest poly(A) binding (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> 146 nM) by the RRM3 of HuD, HuC and HuR (the vertebrate homologues) has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The crystal structure of RRM&#x02013;RNA complexes have been determined both for the first two RRMs of HuD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and for the two RRMs of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sex lethal protein (SXL), which resemble <italic>Drosophila</italic> ELAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The pairs of RRMs of HuD and SXL proteins fold very similarly and are associated with a single RNA molecule. Each RRM constitutes a binding pocket for distinct regions of the RNA, without base pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Conserved residues in the RRM, in particular in the two characteristic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) motifs, make direct nucleotide contacts relying upon specific recognition of the bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Individual RRMs can still interact with the RNA target, but with decreased efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Comparison of known RNA&#x02013;RRM structures indicates that although the proteins adopt similar tertiary structures, specific RNA molecules adopt diverse conformations and orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>Functions in RNA stabilization, export and translation have been assigned to the vertebrate Hu proteins [for instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>)], while RBP9 has been proposed to destabilize RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> ELAV, through direct binding in the vicinity of polyadenylation sites located in alternative introns, promotes the accumulation of alternative forms of mRNAs encoding alternative protein forms specific to or enriched in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In addition, we have shown that <italic>elav</italic> autoregulates through a mechanism requiring its 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Owing to this autoregulation, the level of ELAV protein in neurons is independent of <italic>elav</italic> gene dosage. Versions of the <italic>elav</italic> gene with a truncated 3&#x02032;-UTR do not autoregulate, and flies carrying two copies die, except for a few escapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>In order to obtain further insight into the mechanism of <italic>elav</italic> autoregulation, the identification of the ELAV best binding site on the 3&#x02032;-UTR of its own RNA was crucial. For this purpose, we used a customized version of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection whose merit was to identify actual sequences, as opposed to defining artificial consensus sequences. We mapped the site, a U-rich sequence, to an alternative 3&#x02032; exon retained in a non-coding mRNA that otherwise shares the upstream non-coding exon of the functional <italic>elav</italic> mRNA. This binding site differs from the ELAV-binding sites mapped previously in the introns of <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>ewg</italic> targets, since it is exonic and at a distance from polyadenylation sites. However, it shares with the <italic>ewg</italic> and <italic>nrg</italic> sites a similarly high U content and a low <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (40 nM) for ELAV association. This suggests a dual molecular function for ELAV, respectively for autoregulation and the regulation of the metabolism of other RNAs. We also found that individual RRMs bind specific targets with different relative specificities, suggesting that different pairs of RRMs may be responsible for specific-target recognition. Finally, we found that FNE can bind to the same targets as ELAV, providing a possible molecular basis for previously described <italic>elav</italic>/<italic>fne</italic> interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Fusion proteins</title><p>The 483 amino acid long ELAV contains an N-terminal Q-A rich region (amino acids 26&#x02013;126) and three RRMs. The 356 amino acid long FNE protein is very similar, with a 24 amino acid long N-terminus upstream of the three RRMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). The glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) gene fusion system (Pharmacia Biotech) was used to produce fusion proteins. Open reading frames (ORFs), either as restriction fragments or as PCR products, were cloned in-frame into pGEX-2T. After sequencing of the cloning junctions and of the cloned PCR products, the plasmids were used to produce proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions: GST-ELAV (residues 76&#x02013;483), GST-RRM1 (residues 76&#x02013;242), GST-RRM2 (residues 229&#x02013;324), GST-RRM3 (residues 364&#x02013;483) and GST-FNE2 (residues 15&#x02013;356), the latter being poorly soluble.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of the <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR RNA pool</title><p>A library was constructed by sonication of a 7.5 kb BamHI (p7.5BB) genomic clone which included the <italic>elav</italic> stop codon and the complete 3&#x02032;-UTR, containing sequences necessary for <italic>elav</italic> autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The 100 bp fragments were gel purified and ligated into a modified pUC18 vector whose HindIII&#x02013;EcoRI polylinker fragment had been replaced by a new sequence introducing an EcoRV site for cloning, restriction sites for insert manipulation and a T7 promotor. The new sequence was generated by the annealing of two 61mer oligonucleotides AGCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGCTCAGAATAAACGCTGATATCGACATGAGGCCCGG (Selex5) and AATTCCGGGCCTCATGTCGATATCAGCGTTTATTCTGAGCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA (Selex6).</p><p>Independent clones (1500) were obtained after transformation, referred to as the original library (OL). The colonies on the transformation plates were recovered in Luria&#x02013;Bertani, and the cell suspension was used to inoculate two 250 ml cultures. The cultures were used to purify OL DNA. Characterization of the library was performed by testing 24 independent clones: 18 of the clones contained an insert &#x0223c;100 nt long, 2 contained a double insert and 3 none. Sequencing of three clones revealed 73, 93 and 105 nt long inserts corresponding to different regions of the 3&#x02032;-UTR. In addition, Southern blot analysis of p7.5BB with a probe made from the OL DNA showed that the library was representative (Results).</p><p>An aliquot of OL DNA was PCR amplified using the 23mer CGAATTCCGGGCCTCATGTCGAT (Selex3) and the 48mer GCCAAGCTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGCTCAGAATAAACGCTGAT (Selex4). The amplified DNA (up to 4 &#x000b5;g DNA in 100 &#x000b5;l) was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in 40 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM spermidine, 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each G-, A-, U-, CTP, 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> mM [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]CTP 800 Ci/mmol (Amersham), 100 U RNasin (Promega) and 25 U T7 RNA polymerase (Promega).

We chose this customized approach, using as RNA targets actual genomic <italic>Drosophila</italic> sequences, so that we could directly identify a specific binding site rather than a consensus sequence, which can be ambiguous. A somewhat similar approach was used for iterative selection of Hel-NI (a human ELAV-like protein) binding sequences, from libraries of naturally occurring 3&#x02032;-UTR sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>).</p><p>The progress of the enrichment was monitored (i) by shift assays, to assess the ability of given RNA populations to associate with ELAV, (ii) by Southern blot analysis of the genomic clone used to generate OL, using labelled populations of partitioned RNAs as probes, since the homogenization of the RNA population is expected to lead to simplification of the hybridization pattern and (iii) by establishment of binding curves (established by nitrocellulose filtration) between ELAV and the population of RNA, another means to evaluate the affinity of RNAs for ELAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Based upon these criteria, after two cycles, a dramatic change in the partitioned RNA population profile was observed and after three additional cycles optimal enrichment was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>We cloned and sequenced 12 cDNAs made from the partitioned RNAs of the last cycle (S5 clones). Insert sizes ranged from 81 to 118 nt. Their sequences were grouped into three non-overlapping clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Cluster 1 (C1, 8 of 12 sequenced clones) spans 183 nt in the 3&#x02032;-UTR, with a 20 nt long overlap in region 12&#x02009;331&#x02013;12&#x02009;350 of the <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR. Cluster 2 (C2, 2 of 12 sequenced clones) spans 103 nt, with an overlap in region 9730&#x02013;9830, and an insertion leading to 12 and 15 additional units, respectively, towards the 3&#x02032; end of the RNA. Cluster 3 (C3, 2 of 12 sequenced clones) covers 109 nt with an overlap in region 11&#x02009;908&#x02013;11&#x02009;987.

C2 clones encode artefactual antisense RNA, and we excluded it as the target we were looking for. C3 clones are significantly less represented than C1 clones in the final partitioned pool 5 (Southern hybridizations <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>), but interestingly, in pool 2, C1 and C3 clones were both significantly represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Although a second independent <italic>in vitro</italic> partitioning did not provide evidence for enrichment of C3 type clones, but only for type C1 clones, we do not exclude the possibility that C3 clones might encode a secondary binding site for ELAV.</p></sec><sec><title>ELAV binding to its best binding site in the <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR is sequence specific</title><p>The C1 clones show an overlap of 20 nt (AUUUUUAUUUGUUAUUUUUU; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), that we refer to as selected site for ELAV (SSE). By deduction, this sequence should define the ELAV best binding site. To evaluate this possibility, we examined the binding of ELAV to specific RNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). On shift assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), ELAV similarly binds SSE1F, a 120 nt long RNA including SSE, and EXS6, a 135 nt long RNA including one of the four binding sites for ELAV identified by cross-linking experiments in the <italic>neuroglian</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). It also binds SSE1F&#x00394;, a 65 nt long truncated version of SSE1F including SSE (data not shown). In contrast, it poorly binds SSE1R, the reverse complement to SSE1F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, reproducible patterns of multiple bands are seen, indicating that several types of complexes are sequentially formed as ELAV concentration increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We established the binding curves of ELAV to the different RNA targets by nitrocellulose filtration, and found that SSE1F and EXS6 have comparable affinities for ELAV (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of &#x0223c;40 nM), while the antisense RNA has a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> greater than 1 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, the 65 nt RNA containing the SSE sequence is sufficient for significant and specific ELAV binding. We further demonstrated the sequence specificity of the ELAV&#x02013;RNA interaction by showing that poly(U) can compete for binding of ELAV to an SSE-containing RNA, while poly(A) has no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we showed that a 20mer RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to SSE also competes the binding of ELAV to SSE1F, while a mutated version of this RNA (SSE&#x0223c;C, mutation of the G to C) does not compete as efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). An 8-fold excess of cold SSE&#x0223c;G competitor is sufficient to partially prevent binding, whereas the same excess of SSE&#x0223c;C has no effect. These experiments show that SSE is directly bound by ELAV and demonstrate the sequence specificity of its binding.</p></sec><sec><title>The RRMs of ELAV have distinct RNA-binding specificities</title><p>We showed that ELAV similarly binds the <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>elav</italic> RNA targets. To determine if recognition of a specific target is performed by specific RRM(s), we examined their binding specificity. First, we used an assay that classifies RNA-binding proteins according to their binding properties to homoribopolymers. In this assay, ELAV binds to homoribopolyuridylic acid and not to poly(A), poly(G) or poly(C), although weak binding to poly(G) is detected at low salt concentration (100 mM NaCl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). We tested the individual RRMs in this assay to evaluate their potential RNA-binding properties, and found that, similar to ELAV, both RRM1 and RRM3 bind poly(U) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). However, no binding was observed for RRM2. In addition, weak poly(G) binding was observed in the case of RRM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, the binding specificity of individual RRMs to homoribopolymers in this assay summarizes the specificity of ELAV essentially as a poly(U) binding protein.</p><p>To assess the specificity of the binding of the <italic>nrg</italic> site and the <italic>elav</italic> site by individual RRMs we used them in shift assays with a mixture of <italic>elav</italic> and <italic>nrg</italic> target RNAs whose sizes differ, allowing simultaneous monitoring of the binding of the two targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We found that RRM1 binds to <italic>elav</italic> and <italic>nrg</italic> targets with apparently similar affinities, since the ratio between the two RNAs remains constant. RRM3 shows an overall lower RNA affinity than RRM1 and, contrary to RRM1, exhibits a preference for the <italic>nrg</italic> target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Again, RRM2 does not show RNA-binding activity. Although, as has been seen for other ELAV-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) independent ELAV RRMs have a lower affinity for their RNA targets than the whole ELAV protein, their binding specificity recapitulates that of the whole protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), with RRM1 being the most effective individual RNA-binding domain.</p></sec><sec><title>FNE shares common RNA targets with ELAV</title><p>We described previously an <italic>elav</italic> paralogue (<italic>fne</italic>) whose product is concentrated in the cytoplasm of neurons, where its over-expression causes a decrease in stable <italic>elav</italic> transcript levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Both ELAV and FNE show high affinity for polyuridylic acid, but ELAV is more versatile and also binds to single- and double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). We tested whether the interaction between the two genes could rely upon interaction of their protein products with the same binding site. Consistent with this possibility, shift assays show that, similarly to ELAV, FNE specifically binds to <italic>elav</italic> and <italic>nrg</italic> RNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Furthermore, as shown when providing <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>elav</italic> RNA targets simultaneously in shift assays, both FNE and ELAV bind the two RNAs with apparently similar affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As for ELAV, we observe reproducible patterns of bands presumably corresponding to sequentially formed complexes as FNE concentration increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). GST&#x02013;FNE7, a fusion missing the 72 N-terminal amino acids of RRM1, also shifts <italic>elav</italic> RNA (SSE1F) and sequential complexes visible by gel shifts are formed (data not shown).</p><p>We performed binding assays by mixing ELAV and FNE proteins to determine if RNA binding by one protein affects binding by the other. The impact of the progressive addition of ELAV on FNE&#x02013;RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) reveals good consistency between the intensity of the shift and the total protein concentration, with the progressive addition of ELAV causing an increased shift of the RNA, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A and C</xref>). Thus, binding of one protein neither inhibits nor favours the binding of the other.</p><p>At high protein concentrations, high molecular weight complexes are formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) We noticed that the migration of the complexes formed at equimolar ELAV and FNE concentrations (80 nM each) is intermediate to the migration of FNE&#x02013;RNA complexes and ELAV&#x02013;RNA complexes at 160 nM protein concentrations, respectively. This indicates that hybrid complexes including the RNA(s) and both ELAV and FNE can be formed.</p></sec><sec><title>A complex array of coding and non-coding transcripts is produced from the <italic>elav</italic> locus</title><p>The stable transcript pattern of <italic>elav</italic> is complex and dynamic, in contrast with the fact that only one form of protein is produced. Neither the gene sequence nor functional data predict the existence of alternative protein forms. It thus seems probable that the observed transcript complexity reflects <italic>elav</italic> post-transcriptional regulation. We have shown previously that the level of ELAV protein produced in neuron is tightly regulated and independent of gene dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). We wished to determine how the binding of ELAV to the SSE-binding site in the <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR could contribute to gene regulation, and for that purpose we examined the structure of transcripts produced from the <italic>elav</italic> locus.</p><p>Although a complete 2.5 kb functional <italic>elav</italic> cDNA (cDNA-1/LD33076, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) has been identified, all the <italic>elav</italic> RNA detected on northern blots with single-stranded antisense probes corresponding to cDNA-1 are larger than 5 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). To gain insight into the structure of the multiple forms of <italic>elav</italic> RNA, we screened cDNA libraries (from <italic>Drosophila</italic> heads and embryos) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In addition, cDNAs identified by the Berkeley <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genome Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) were examined, and we completed the sequencing of those that we suspected might differ from the original coding <italic>elav</italic> cDNA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>The larger <italic>elav</italic> transcripts are absent as full-size cDNAs from the cDNA libraries, but partial cDNAs allow the (not necessarily exhaustive) identification of four alternative polyadenylation sites and alternative exon/intron boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Surprisingly, several forms of non-coding RNA exist, that we separate into two categories. First, those that differ from cDNA-1 by the exon(s), upstream of the <italic>elav</italic> ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that one level of regulation of <italic>elav</italic> expression is mediated by the regulation of the splicing event that generates the initiating ATG. Second, we identified a form of cDNA (RE58603) alternative to the coding cDNA-1, which includes an alternative non-coding 3&#x02032; terminal exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). It seems that a primary transcript that matures in multiple fashions is produced from the <italic>elav</italic> locus. Processing results in either RNA capable of producing ELAV protein, or on the contrary on abortive RNAs, a mechanism that could be very efficient at regulating ELAV protein levels.</p></sec><sec><title>The ELAV best binding site in the <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR maps to a non-coding alternative exon</title><p>ELAV binds to a site, SSE, retained in RE58603 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This non-coding RE58603 cDNA differs from the coding cDNA-1 by the substitution of a non-coding 3&#x02032; exon that replaces the 3&#x02032; coding 3&#x02032; exon of cDNA-1. This suggests a simple model, whereby when ELAV levels pass a given threshold, the protein binds to its own 3&#x02032;-UTR (at SSE) in the pre-mRNA, favouring the generation/accumulation of non-coding RNA (RE58603) versus that of a coding RNA (LD33076).</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we first determined by northern blot the pattern of expression of RNAs including the third exon of the non-coding cDNA RE58603 (between pA2 and pA3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) in the <italic>elav</italic> RNAs. Surprisingly, most of these RNAs are the same as those detected by an antisense <italic>elav</italic> ORF probe, although the 3 kb RNA corresponding to RE58603 itself is not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Clearly, complex transcripts that were not identified as full-size cDNA clones and that include large portions of the <italic>elav</italic> locus are produced, making it impossible to distinguish between the RNA with a coding exon 3 and a proper ATG (type cDNA-1) versus its non-coding counterpart including a non-coding alternative exon 3 (type LD33076).</p><p>We thus reasoned that all the functional <italic>elav</italic> RNA, including hypothetical forms that would differ from the cDNA-1 type by including, for instance, an extended 3&#x02032;-UTR, must share the common splicing event that generates the ATG initiation codon. We identified these by RT&#x02013;PCR using the EX2F and EX3R primers, in parallel with the alternative non-coding transcript of the RE58603 type, that were detected with the EX2F and EX4R pair of primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). As predicted by our model, the coding transcript accumulates from the time neurons start to be born (&#x0223c;5 h of development) and peaks &#x0223c;8&#x02013;12 h of development, shortly before the birth of the last embryonic neurons. In contrast, non-coding transcripts first appear coincidentally with the peak of the coding transcript (8&#x02013;12 h). Their level rises and plateaus until the end of embryonic development.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>ELAV binds a site in the <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR that resembles binding sites already identified in <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>ewg</italic></title><p>ELAV-binding sites have been reported in regulated introns of <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>erect wing</italic> (<italic>ewg</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In <italic>nrg</italic> RNA, they are defined as long tracts including at least two 8&#x02013;10 nt-long U-rich stretches. In <italic>ewg</italic> RNA, ELAV-binding sites consist of AU-rich elements including three to four tandemly repeated A(U<sub>4&#x02013;6</sub>) sequences. Our approach allowed us to map the ELAV best binding site in its RNA to a shorter U-rich sequence that is only 20 nt long (SSE). We found that the affinity of ELAV for a 65 nt long RNA including SSE is in the nanomolar range, similar to that of ELAV for a 164 nt long RNA derived from <italic>ewg</italic> proposed to bind several ELAV molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). It is also similar to ELAV affinity for an RNA including the 114 nt long EXS6 from <italic>nrg</italic> RNA that cross-links to ELAV (this paper).</p><p>Competition experiments highlight the higher affinity of ELAV for the SSE site than for a mutant version of the site where a C replaces the single G. Thus, the interaction between ELAV and the RNA depends in part upon recognition of specific bases, not just of the phosphate sugar-backbone.</p><p>Sequence analysis of 500 nt framing SSE with the Stem Loop program as well as attempts to identify secondary structures with the programs Mfold and PlotFold (GCG Wisconsin Package) in the 65 nt long SSE1F&#x00394; RNA failed to identify any secondary structure with base pairing of SSE (data not shown). ELAV thus binds ssRNA, reminiscent of the binding of the SXL and HuD proteins, whose two RRMs share extensive structural similarity with ELAV RRM1 and RRM2 and which also bind ssRNA with no base pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>An ELAV-binding site with a U-rich sequence and a low dissociation constant with ELAV was thus identified in the <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR. The characteristics of this site resemble those of the previously identified ELAV targets, supporting the validity of the binding site that we identified in the <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR, and thus our model that <italic>elav</italic> autoregulation depends upon direct binding of ELAV to the 3&#x02032;-UTR of <italic>elav</italic> RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>ELAV RRM1 and RRM3 bind RNA on their own with different specificities</title><p>ELAV protein and its homologues contain three conserved RNA-binding domains.

However domain swap experiments (with RRMs from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> paralogue RBP9, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> relative SXL or the human orthologue HuD) showed that chimeric ELAV proteins with substituted RRM3, but not RRM1 and/or RRM2, are functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p><p>We evaluated the binding properties of individual RRMs to determine if distinct RRMs are responsible for the specific target recognition of <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>elav</italic>-binding sites. We found that both RRM1 and RRM3 are capable of significantly binding RNA on their own, with RRM1 showing a higher affinity than RRM3. No RNA-binding activity was detected for RRM2 with the targets that we tested (<italic>nrg</italic>, <italic>elav</italic> sites, this paper; and the OL RNA, data not shown), even using different batches of proteins. We cannot exclude the possibility that the ELAV&#x02013;RRM2 fusion protein, in spite of the fact that it is abundantly and stably produced, may be non-functional, possibly owing to altered folding. Another alternative is that ELAV&#x02013;RRM2 can bind RNA only when another partner RRM is available, as in the case of HuD or HuC, whose second RRMs increases the affinity of RRM1 for an AU-rich sequence and stabilizes the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>Conserved residues between HuD and SXL interact with different bases in their different targets [U(A/U)UUUAUUUU for HuD and UGUUUUUUUUU for SXL] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), and it thus seems possible that the same ELAV RRMs are involved in <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>elav</italic> target recognition. However, our binding assay involving one protein and two binding sites shows that RRM1 and RRM3 display different relative affinities for the <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>elav</italic> RNA-binding sites. As a correlate, if the properties of individual RRMs are maintained in the complete protein, ELAV binding with specific RNAs may rely upon particular interactions with different RRMs. <italic>In vivo</italic>, it is conceivable that the complexes might interact with different sets of factors and thus enter distinct pathways of post-transcriptional processing, depending upon which RRM is involved in RNA contact (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>ELAV and FNE</title><p>The neuronal protein FNE is encoded by an <italic>elav</italic> paralogue, and the expression of the two genes is interconnected.

We showed that FNE and ELAV both can bind the <italic>elav</italic> SSE-binding site independently, and it has been shown that the two proteins can interact directly, since they have been identified in a large-scale two-hybrid screen of <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins as high confidence partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). These two properties could be involved in the feedback regulation. FNE could regulate <italic>elav</italic> by binding to <italic>elav</italic> RNA directly or FNE could titrate ELAV, both antagonizing the occupation of RNA-binding sites by ELAV. This would require that ELAV, which is predominantly nuclear, and FNE, which is predominantly cytoplasmic, would be present in the same cellular compartment, at least transiently. HuR, an apparently nuclear human orthologue of ELAV shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>).</p><p>We observed that, when mixing FNE and ELAV with RNA, binding complexes with RNA including both ELAV and FNE are formed.

But, since the proteins interact directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), it seems more probable to us that direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction, before or after RNA binding, is responsible for the formation of these complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>The ELAV best binding site in the <italic>elav</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR maps to a non-coding alternative exon</title><p>The processes required for the generation of mature mRNAs are intimately linked [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>)] and depend upon <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions scattered over the entire length of an RNA.

Indeed, this type of organization in the 3&#x02032; end of transcripts is not rare, since 28.6% of 8700 analysed human 3&#x02032;-UTRs contain two to four polyadenylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>).</p><p>Although a model where ELAV binding in the proximity of polyadenylation sites and slowing the recruitment of cleavage factors or of poly(A) polymerase can explain the data reported in the case of <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>ewg</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), it does not fit in the case of the <italic>elav</italic> gene. The sequences of ELAV-binding sites are not dramatically different, but they differ in their nature. ELAV binding to <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>ewg</italic> RNAs occurs in alternative 3&#x02032; introns and is responsible for the generation of alternative forms of proteins, while binding to <italic>elav</italic> RNA occurs in an alternative non-coding 3&#x02032; exon and does not cause protein diversity.

Our RT&#x02013;PCR data are in agreement with our proposed model hypothesizing that the coding transcript is produced as long as the level of ELAV protein remains below a given threshold and thus unbound to SSE. The non-coding transcript is alternatively produced by alternative choice of the terminal exon/polyadenylation site once ELAV protein level passes this threshold and binds SSE.
