As the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) transcription factor is encoded by the <italic>TCF8</italic> gene located in that region, and as it influences the differentiation of various mesodermal lineages, we hypothesized that ZEB1 might also modulate adiposity. The goal of these studies was to test that hypothesis in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>To ascertain whether fat accumulation affects ZEB1 expression, female C57BL/6 mice were fed a regular chow diet (RCD) ad libitum or a 25&#x00025; calorie-restricted diet from 2.5 to 18.3 months of age. ZEB1 mRNA levels in parametrial fat were six to ten times higher in the obese mice. To determine directly whether ZEB1 affects adiposity, wild type (WT) mice and mice heterozygous for <italic>TCF8</italic> (<italic>TCF8</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;) were fed an RCD or a high-fat diet (HFD) (60&#x00025; calories from fat). By two months of age on an HFD and three months on an RCD, <italic>TCF8&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> mice were heavier than WT controls, which was attributed by Echo MRI to increased fat mass (at three months on an HFD: 0.517&#x000b1;0.081 total fat/lean mass versus 0.313&#x000b1;0.036; at three months on an RCD: 0.175&#x000b1;0.013 versus 0.124&#x000b1;0.012). No differences were observed in food uptake or physical activity, suggesting that the genotypes differ in some aspect of their metabolic activity. ZEB1 expression also increases during adipogenesis in cell culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>These results show for the first time that the ZEB1 transcription factor regulates the accumulation of adipose tissue.

Excessive white adipose tissue puts individuals at risk for medical conditions such as Type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Therefore, considerable interest exists in defining the molecular pathways that regulate the development of adipocytes and their ability to store lipids in hopes of elucidating new preventative measures and treatment options.</p><p>Adipocytes primarily derive from multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that reside in bone marrow and the stroma of adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Sekiya1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The conversion of MSCs to preadipocytes activates an extensive transcriptional cascade that regulates terminal differentiation (for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Gesta1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Tontonoz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>). While several transcription factors such as PPAR&#x003b3; (nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) and the C/EBP&#x003b1; family are key components of this cascade, other modulatory transcription factors continue to be discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Xu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This report identifies one such transcription factor, the ZEB1 (<underline>z</underline>inc finger <underline>E</underline>-<underline>b</underline>ox binding homeobox 1) transcription factor.</p><p>As much as 70&#x00025; of obesity can be attributed to polygenetic traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Comuzzie1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and numerous genome-wide linkage studies have attempted to define loci that segregate with a predisposition to obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Comuzzie1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Herbert1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. To increase the likelihood that these association scans are detecting genetic rather than environmental conditions, they are often done on children.

So far, no viable candidate obesity/anti-obesity gene in this region has emerged. We hypothesize that mutations or polymorphisms in <italic>TCF8</italic> contribute to childhood/adolescent obesity.</p><p>A number of lines of correlative evidence support the hypothesis that ZEB1 plays a role in adipogenesis and/or lipogenesis. Expression of ZEB1 is high in mesenchymal tissues, including adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Banerjee1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, ZEB1 modulates the differentiation of the myogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic mesenchymal lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Takagi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Vandewalle1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and can even direct which lineage differentiates from the multipotent C2C12 mesenchymal cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Musatov1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that ZEB1 can also affect the differentiation of the adipogenic lineage. Additionally, ZEB1 mRNA expression increases following stem cell differentiation into adipocytes in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Sekiya1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is higher in obese women compared to those of normal weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Dolinkova1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, although nothing has been done as yet to investigate either of those observations. The goal of our studies was to determine whether ZEB1 affects adipose accumulation in mice.</p><p>ZEB1 (also called &#x003b4;EF1, TCF8, Nil-2-a, AREB6) is a large transcription factor of 1117 amino acids in humans that is conserved from worm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Clark1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Wacker1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> to man (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Vandewalle1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>). It binds to DNA via two zinc finger clusters at its N- and C-termini, and it recognizes target genes through a modified E-box sequence (5&#x02032;-CACCT(G)). Mechanistically, little is known about how ZEB1 regulates gene expression, but it can either repress or activate target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Chamberlain1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Higashi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The regulation of ZEB1 is also understudied. We were the first to report that it is induced by estrogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Chamberlain1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, but it is also induced by progesterone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Spoelstra1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that ZEB1 plays an important role in female physiology. Interestingly, high expression of ZEB1 becomes independent of estrogen in endometrial and ovarian carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Hurt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Other regulators of ZEB1 include NF-kB and the TGF-&#x003b2; family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Vandewalle1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. ZEB1 is also induced by p63 in neurons in response to ischemia, and ZEB1 appears to serve protective role in the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Bui1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Because <italic>TCF8</italic> null mice are perinatal lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Higashi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, even less is known about its target genes or normal physiological roles, especially in the adult. ZEB1 is predominantly known for its ability to modulate epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) in development and cancer by downregulating E-cadherin and other genes encoding cell adhesion and basement membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Aigner1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Eger1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. While the effects of ZEB1 on EMT have been studied extensively, its role in the development and differentiation of tissues is complex and less well understood (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Vandewalle1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>). However, ZEB1 is at the intersection of multiple mesenchymal developmental pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Takagi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Vandewalle1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, raising the possibility that it also affects adipogenesis.</p><p>The experiments in this study were undertaken to directly investigate whether or not ZEB1 modulates adipogenesis and/or lipogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> using female mice, which were chosen because estrogen induces ZEB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Chamberlain1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Spoelstra1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Hurt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Wang1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. As considerable data indicate that estrogen protects against weight gain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Power1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Shi1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, it seems plausible that ZEB1 might mediate estrogen's effects on adiposity. The results with wild type (WT) mice demonstrate that ZEB1 mRNA levels in adipose tissue increase dramatically with weight gain and plateau as the rate of weight gain decreases. To directly test whether ZEB1 affects this weight gain, mice heterozygous for <italic>TCF8</italic> (<italic>TCF8</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;) were fed a regular chow or high fat chow diet for up to 5 months, and the effects on body weight, fat mass, activity level, food intake, and glucose processing were determined. The resulting data indicate that haploinsufficiency of ZEB1 is sufficient to elicit significant fat accumulation, regardless of diet. Furthermore, in cell culture models of adipogenesis, ZEB1 expression increases with differentiation and lipid accumulation, as it does in the mice. These data are the first to show that ZEB1 plays a protective role against obesity. They are also the first to support the genome-wide association studies that mapped a human &#x02018;obesity&#x02019; gene to chromosome 10p11&#x02013;12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Hager1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Dong1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Price1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals and Genotyping</title><p>All experiments were done in accordance with the University of Minnesota Research Subjects Protection Program in adherence with federal, state, and local regulations.

As a pilot study to address this question, the expression of ZEB1 was initially monitored in WT female mice. While cyclical fluctuations in circulating estrogen and progesterone are often considered an undesirable complication associated with using females, we reasoned that this was unlikely to be a significant problem because of the duration of our experiments (2&#x02013;18 months) and that these hormones might even prove beneficial. As <italic>TCF8</italic> is induced about 10-fold by either estrogen or progesterone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Chamberlain1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Spoelstra1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, we predicted that more dramatic effects might be expected in female mice than in the males, which should have much lower levels of ZEB1.

Thus, the prediction was that any effects of ZEB1 haploinsufficiency would be more apparent in females. Also, because the C57BL/6 males gain weight very rapidly and are obese by 3 months of age, we reasoned that the effects of ZEB1 might be obscured in them.</p><p>To determine whether ZEB1 levels vary with adiposity, ZEB1 mRNA expression was measured in the parametrial fat of WT female mice fed a RCD (regular chow diet) <italic>ad libitum</italic> or a calorie-restricted diet (75&#x00025; of the calories consumed by the <italic>ad libitum</italic> group) from 2.5 to 18.3 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The only difference in the diets was a reduction in the amount of carbohydrate in the restricted diet. As expected, the body weights of the <italic>ad libitum</italic> group almost doubled by 10 months of age, then plateaued for the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, the calorie-restricted mice exhibited no significant change in body weight. Real time PCR (qPCR) was done on parametrial tissues harvested from mice at 3.5, 6.3, 9.3, 13.8, and 18.3 months of age to measure ZEB1 and &#x003b2;-actin mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). ZEB1 expression was the same with both dietary regimens at 3.5 months of age, but it increased dramatically with body weight in the <italic>ad libitum</italic> group and was significantly higher than those mice fed a calorie restricted diet by 9.3 months of age, although the trend was there by 6.3 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The same results were observed when the data were also corrected for body weight (data not shown). Similarly, ZEB1 protein levels also increased with body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), showing concordance between ZEB1 mRNA and protein expression and suggesting that ZEB1 regulates target genes in adipose tissue. Thus, an increase in the total body mass correlated with an increase in ZEB1 mRNA expression in parametrial fat, implying that ZEB1 has a specific role in adipose tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Female Mice Missing One TCF8 Allele Gain Excess Weight More Rapidly on a High-Fat Diet Than Do WT Controls</title><p>To directly determine whether ZEB1 affects adipose accumulation, female mice lacking one <italic>TCF8</italic> allele (<italic>TCF8</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;) as determined by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and western immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD, 60&#x00025; of the calories from fat) or a RCD at weaning (21 days of age). <italic>TCF8</italic>&#x0002b;/- mice fed a HFD had significantly increased body mass by 1.3 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

This trend continued until the termination of the study at 4.5 months of age. Note that the effects of ZEB1 haploinsufficiency with either diet occurred during a limited period or weight gain, when total body weights were increasing from about 20 to 27 grams and was thus not related to age of the animals as much as to actual body weight. The mechanistic reason for this restricted interval when ZEB1 haploinsufficiency had a measurable consequence is unknown. However, it is likely that once the mice on the high fat diet reach about 27 grams that both genotypes had sufficient fat to overcome the modulatory effects of ZEB1. Similarly, for mice fed a regular diet, too little fat was present below weights of &#x0223c;20 grams for ZEB1 to have a modulatory effect. Nonetheless, these experiments indicate that there is a substantial interval where total body mass was higher in the ZEB1 heterozygotes than in age-matched WT controls.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Increased Body Weight in TCF8&#x0002b;/&#x02212; Female Mice Is Due to an Increase in Adipose Mass</title><p>To ascertain whether the increase in body weight exhibited by the <italic>TCF8</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice can be ascribed to increased adipose mass or to other contributors such as lean muscle mass, Echo MRI was used to measure total fat mass, lean mass, free water, and total body fluids on mice fed either the HFD or RCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g003">Figure 3</xref>). There was no difference in free water between <italic>TCF8</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice and WT controls at any age on either diet. Interestingly, on a HFD, <italic>TCF8</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice exhibited increased total fat mass by 2 months of age, which was maintained at 3 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g003">Figure 3A, left panel</xref>).

These mice were not significantly longer that the WT mice as determined by measurement from nose to tail (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in body weight at 2 months is primarily a result of increased adipose tissue or increased lean mass, the ratio of fat mass to lean mass was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g003">Figure 3B, lowest left panel</xref>). Although there was a trend for a higher total fat to lean mass ratio in the mice fed a high fat diet at 2 months, only 4 mice were available for that time point and statistical significance was not achieved. In contrast, the increased body weights of the heterozygous mice at 3 months can be ascribed entirely to increased fat mass. These data as a whole indicate that the increase in body weight was due primarily to an increase in fat mass, not just to an overall increase in the size of the mice or lean muscle mass.</p><p>Whole body composition by Echo MRI was also done on <italic>TCF8&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> and WT female mice fed regular chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g003">Figure 3A, right panel</xref>).

As expected, there was no difference in glucose utilization at 5 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), presumably because both groups had excess fat mass by that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g003">Figure 3</xref>). On a RCD, there was no difference in glucose uptake between <italic>TCF8</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212; mice and WT controls at either 3 or 5 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g006">Figures 6D and E</xref>). While there is significantly more adipose tissue in the heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g003">Figure 3</xref>), the actual mass appears to not be enough to confer decreased glucose uptake. These data demonstrate, as anticipated, that glucose processing is impaired in overweight mice. Of more interest, ZEB1 haploinsufficiency independently reduces glucose uptake during part of the time when the mice are gaining excessive weight while on a HFD.</p><fig id="pone-0008460-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008460.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Female <italic>TCF8&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> mice exhibit impaired glucose uptake early in fat acquisition.</title><p>Mice were fed a high fat diet (<bold>A&#x02013;C</bold>) or regular chow (<bold>D, E</bold>) until they were 2, 3, or 5 months of age.

The cells were induced to differentiate as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>, and ZEB1 mRNA expression was measured using qPCR on the indicated days relative to treatment with differentiation cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). ZEB1 expression shows about a 4-fold increase in ZEB1 mRNA levels when the cells go from proliferating (Days -4 and -3) to confluency (Day 0). By Day 2, ZEB1 mRNA levels return to that observed in pre-adipocytes and then increase to maximal levels (about 5-fold) by four days after treatment. The changing ZEB1 mRNA levels suggest that it may have a role in the early and late stages of adipocyte development. This is in agreement with our observations in mice where ZEB1 increases in response to increased adipose accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g001">Figure 1</xref>). PPAR&#x003b3; and cyclin D mRNAs were also measured to serve as positive controls for adipocyte development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g007">Figures 7B and C</xref>).

To determine whether ZEB1 expression is altered prior to commitment to the adipocyte lineage, the C3H10T1/2 pluripotent mesenchymal cell line was used. The cells were treated with BMP-4 at Day -4 to commit them to the pre-adipocyte lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Tang1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Taylor1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Once they were pre-adipocytes and reached confluency, they were triggered at Day 0 to differentiate into adipocytes with the same differentiation cocktail as was used for the 3T3-L1 cells. Endogenous ZEB1 mRNA expression was measured throughout commitment and differentiation at the indicated time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g007">Figure 7D and E</xref>). A similar trend was observed with the C3H10T1/2 cells as was seen with the 3T3-L1 cells. ZEB1 mRNA levels did not change upon commitment of the cells to the adipocyte lineage (Day -3), but it did increase at confluency (Day 0), decrease with the initiation of differentiation (Day 1), and then increase with lipid accumulation (Day 4). PPAR&#x003b3; was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g007">Figure 7E</xref>) and cells were stained for oil red O (data not shown) to confirm a high level of differentiation. These data suggest that ZEB1 either does not regulate commitment to the adipocyte lineage or that sufficient ZEB1 is already present in the mesenchymal precursor cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on genome wide association studies that link obesity to the region on chromosome 10 that encompasses the <italic>TCF8</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Hager1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Dong1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Price1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and on the ability of ZEB1 to impact the differentiation of other mesenchymal cell lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Takagi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Vandewalle1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, we hypothesized that ZEB1 opposes obesity. Using <italic>TCF8&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> mice, we demonstrate herein that ZEB1 haploinsufficiency elicited excessive adipose tissue accumulation in female mice early in fat acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g003">3</xref>). This increased adiposity occurred on both regular chow and high fat diets, although significant differences in body weight were delayed by one month on the regular diet. These data suggest that ZEB1 is an important modulator of adipose tissue mass, not just under circumstances of high caloric pressure but also with a normal diet. However, there is one important caveat to this interpretation. Knockout of <italic>TCF8</italic> was accomplished by insertion of a 3.8 Kb DNA fragment containing the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene into the first exon. Thus, this insertion into the <italic>TCF8</italic> locus could be causing the effects on adipose accumulation. While this cannot be ruled out, the observations that endogenous ZEB1 expression increases in the adipose tissue of WT mice with increased fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and that ZEB1 fluctuates similarly in two WT cell lines during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g007">Figure 7</xref>) argues against an off-target effect of this insertion.</p><p>In order to begin to delineate the potential mechanisms by which ZEB1 represses obesity, food intake and activity were measured. No differences were observed in food consumption between <italic>TCF8</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x02212; and WT mice or in the total amount or duration of physical activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g005">Figure 5</xref>), which indicates that ZEB1 is affecting something other than energy intake or expenditure. This raises the question of whether ZEB1 is acting directly in adipose tissue and/or in other tissues. Certainly most of the genes associated with monogenetic or syndromic obesity described thus far are expressed in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Blakemore1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the large increase in ZEB1 expression in parametrial fat pads that occurs as the mice gain weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) implies at least some role for ZEB1 in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the parallel fluctuations in ZEB1 expression observed during adipogenesis in two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g007">Figure 7</xref>) suggest that ZEB1 is acting, at least in part, locally within the adipocyte.</p><p>The effects of ZEB1 haploinsufficiency were restricted, at least in this experimental paradigm, to a period of a few weeks that correspond to when the mice are initially gaining fat and are about 20 &#x02013; 27 g in size. When the mice are smaller, ZEB1 haploinsufficiency does not affect adiposity, perhaps because they are growing rapidly and little fat is accumulating. When the mice have matured and have gained almost 4 g of fat tissue, then significant differences in fat mass exist between the <italic>TCF8&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g002">Figures 2A and B</xref>). The fact that ZEB1 expression increases dramatically in adipose tissue with fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) complicates these experiments as there were no differences in ZEB1 levels between the genotypes at 4 or 5 months of age (data not shown). This latter point raises a paradox that exists with these data, the observation that ZEB1 mRNA increases in mice as they gain adipose mass, yet ZEB1 haploinsufficiency leads to increased fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g003">Figure 3</xref>). High expression of ZEB1 has also been reported in stem cells stimulated to differentiate into adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Sekiya1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and in obese women compared to those of normal weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Dolinkova1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, ZEB1 opposes fat accumulation yet is highly expressed in fat. One plausible explanation is that ZEB1 increases in order to repress additional fat accumulation. It is also possible that ZEB1 has multiple roles in modulating adipogenesis and adiposity. Many of these questions will need to be resolved using adipose tissue-specific <italic>TCF8</italic> knockouts.</p><p>Another unexpected result is the increase in lean mass as well as fat mass in <italic>TCF8&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic> mice at 2 months of age on a HFD. This did not occur on the RCD at either 2 or 3 months of age or on the HFD at 3 months of age. While this could be an experimental anomaly, this seems unlikely as the mice were all from the same breeder parents, were age-matched, and were housed in the same room. One possibility relates to the observations that ZEB1 opposes skeletal muscle differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Postigo2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> and in cell culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Postigo1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Diminished amounts of ZEB1 could lead to increased muscle differentiation and thus lean mass in a context where the mice are rapidly gaining in body mass, i.e., a HFD. However, the <italic>TCF8</italic> null mouse does not exhibit enhanced muscle mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Takagi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, its overall size is diminished with no obvious histological differences in the muscle system or in the expression of key myogenic genes. In contrast, heterozygous mice appear morphologically normal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Takagi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the increase in lean muscle mass in our mice likely relates in some way to the rapid increase in body weight and fat mass when they are on a HFD.</p><p>Insufficient data are available to assess whether diminished ZEB1 mass or function affects adiposity in humans. Two studies demonstrated that one form of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is caused by heterozygous mutations in <italic>TCF8</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Krafchak1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Liskova1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Of the 9 patients in those studies who have mutations in <italic>TCF8</italic>, none were reported to be obese or overweight. Thus, it is possible that ZEB1 haploinsufficiency has no affect on fat accumulation in humans. Alternatively, as these mutations are mostly in Exon 7 (of 9), some functions of ZEB1 may be retained. Certainly the four N-terminal zinc fingers should be intact and able to bind DNA in all of these patients. In addition, as all these patients have visual problems and most have other abnormalities, it is possible that poor health contributes to their lean phenotype. Additional studies will obviously be required to determine whether ZEB1 affects adiposity in humans.</p><p>Another unanswered question is whether ZEB1 deficiency contributes to fat accumulation in males as well as females. Because ZEB1 is induced by estrogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Chamberlain1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Spoelstra1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Hurt1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Wang1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and because estrogen influences a number of metabolic events that affect adiposity and glucose homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Power1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Shi1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, we decided to use female mice for these initial studies. Even though these mice are cycling through the estrous cycle and thus have fluctuating estrogen and progesterone levels, we predicted that ZEB1 levels would be higher in females than in males because these sex steroid hormones induce <italic>TCF8</italic> in females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Chamberlain1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Spoelstra1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Anose1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is possible that significant effects of ZEB1 haploinsufficiency on some parameters were overlooked in our study because of the relatively small numbers of mice used per treatment group and because their estrous cycles were not synchronized. Furthermore, because progesterone and testosterone may oppose estrogen's effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Mayes1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, more dramatic consequences of genotype may have been seen in ovariectomized animals treated with estrogen. The fact that significant effects of ZEB1 haploinsufficiency on fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008460-g006">Figure 6</xref>) were observed under these conditions attests to the importance of ZEB1 in modulating energy homeostasis. Nonetheless, we anticipate that ZEB1 mediates at least some of the effects of estrogen in attenuating fat accumulation. Thus, even in these reproductively intact mice, estrogen is unable to signal properly because of reduced ZEB1 levels. Experiments are in progress with male mice and with anti-estrogen treated female mice to assess whether ZEB1 mediates estrogen's effects on fat metabolism, whether it acts independently of estrogen, or both.</p><p>Even though ZEB1 insufficiency contributes to fat accumulation only during the time when fat mass is modest, this is a critically important time. Considerable evidence indicates that once fat is accrued in humans, especially in adolescents, it is difficult to reverse that and most individuals remain overweight or obese for life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Jasik1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Khan1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the observation that ZEB1 modulates adiposity during this early period of fat accumulation may have important implications for preventative measures. This is particularly true for females as adipose tissue-specific estrogen receptor agonists could be developed to locally modulate ZEB1 levels.</p><p>Transcriptional cascades regulate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into mature adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Rosen1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Rosen2">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. While the major players have already been identified, modulators such as ZEB1 are still being elucidated. As most genetic causes of obesity are polygenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008460-Comuzzie1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, a complete understanding of the proteins involved will be necessary to determine when a cell commits to the adipocyte lineage, when it differentiates into an adipocyte, and how lipids are stored within adipocytes. The data herein demonstrate for the first time that a diminished amount of the ZEB1 transcription factor can lead to increased adiposity during early weight gain, at least in females.
