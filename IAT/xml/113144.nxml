To identify proteins that bind to XPA, we screened a HeLa cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. Here we report a novel cytoplasmic GTP-binding protein, designated XPA binding protein 1 (XAB1). The deduced amino acid sequence of XAB1 consisted of 374 residues with a molecular weight of 41 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.65. Sequence analysis revealed that XAB1 has four sequence motifs G1&#x02013;G4 of the GTP-binding protein family in the N-terminal half. XAB1 also contains an acidic region in the C-terminal portion. Northern blot analysis showed that XAB1 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously, and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that XAB1 is localized mainly in the cytoplasm. Consistent with the GTP-binding motif, purified recombinant XAB1 protein has intrinsic GTPase activity. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we elucidated that XAB1 binds to the N-terminal region of XPA. The deletion of five amino acids, residues 30&#x02013;34 of XPA, required for nuclear localization of XPA abolished the interaction with XAB1. These results suggest that XAB1 is a novel cytoplasmic GTPase involved in nuclear localization of XPA.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x9447178.0x9ad7a70" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

There are two subpathways in NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c2">2</xref>). One is transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which efficiently removes the damage in the transcribed strand of transcriptionally active genes. The other is global genome repair (GGR), which occurs throughout the genome including the non-transcribed strand of active genes.</p><p>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive human disease characterized by hypersensitivity to sunlight and a high incidence of skin cancer on sun-exposed skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c3">3</xref>). Cells from XP patients are hypersensitive to killing by UV irradiation. XP is classified into seven complementation groups (XP-A to XP-G) and a variant form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c1">1</xref>). Except the variant form, the primary defect of XP resides in early steps of NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c3">3</xref>). Both TCR and GGR of NER are defective in groups A, B, D, F and G but not group C, in which only GGR is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c6">6</xref>). Cockayne syndrome (CS), another NER-defective hereditary disorder, shows photosensitivity, cachectic dwarfism and severe mental retardation but no predisposition to UV-induced skin cancer. In CS cells, the TCR subpathway is deficient, but GGR is proficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c8">8</xref>). CS is classified into two groups (CS-A and CS-B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c3">3</xref>). To date, all XP and CS genes have been cloned. In addition, the ERCC1 protein, encoded by a human gene that can correct the repair deficiency in a UV-sensitive, NER-defective, rodent mutant cell line, is also involved in NER. The core reaction of NER in humans has been reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> with purified XP and other proteins, and an outline of the GGR mechanism has been obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c9">9</xref>). On the other hand, the molecular mechanism of TCR is not resolved for humans, although genetic and cell biological evidence indicates that CSA and CSB play key roles in TCR.</p><p>XPA, consisting of 273 amino acid residues, binds preferentially to UV- or chemical-carcinogen-damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c11">11</xref>). Several distinct functional regions have been identified in XPA. The N-terminal region (residues 4&#x02013;29) is responsible for binding to the 34 kDa subunit of replication protein A (RPA34) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c13">13</xref>) and the basic amino acid region (residues 30&#x02013;42) is important for the localization of XPA to nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c14">14</xref>). The region containing the glutamic acid-cluster (E-cluster) (residues 78&#x02013;84) is important for the interaction with ERCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c16">16</xref>). The C-terminal region (residues 226&#x02013;273) is shown to bind to TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c18">18</xref>). The central region (residues 98&#x02013;219) is identified as the minimal polypeptide for preferential binding to damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c19">19</xref>). In addition, this polypeptide contains the region (residues 98&#x02013;187) necessary for binding to the 70 kDa subunit of RPA (RPA70) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c13">13</xref>).</p><p>In addition to RPA34 and ERCC1, we isolated cDNAs for five unknown proteins which bound XPA in yeast two-hybrid screening of the HeLa cDNA library.

Yeast strain HF7c was sequentially transformed with the pGBT9 XPA and pGAD GH HeLa cDNA library (8.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>) that we constructed. Transformants (1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>) were subjected to dual selection (HIS<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, LacZ<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and 281 independent clones were isolated. These clones were classified into seven groups by dot blot hybridization. Two of them encoded known proteins that bind to XPA; 145 clones were ERCC1 and 45 clones were RPA34. The other five groups were found to be unknown. Two of the five unknown groups, group 1 and group 2, had been detected in a previous screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c20">20</xref>). Out of 281 clones, 20 and 54 belonged to group 1 and group 2, respectively. In this study, we analyzed the cDNA belonging to the group 1 clones.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of cDNA for XAB1</title><p>Clone GH-17 had the longest insert, 2.5 kb, in group 1 and an open reading frame of 1125 bp. Sequence analysis of the other cDNAs from this group revealed that the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of the GH-17 insert was rearranged. To isolate full-length cDNAs, a HeLa cDNA library in &#x003bb;ZAPII was screened with the insert of GH-17 as a probe. Eight positive clones with inserts of 1.2, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.75 and 1.8 kb were obtained by the screening of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> plaques. All of them lacked the 5&#x02032; portion of the open reading frame of GH-17 and had the 3&#x02032;-untranslated sequence containing the poly(A) tail. To obtain the missing 5&#x02032;-end of the cDNAs, 5&#x02032;-RACE was performed using poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA from human placenta and WI38 cells. Four different clones from each RNA template were obtained. They had the same nucleotide sequence of GH-17 in the open reading frame region. The 5&#x02032;-untranslated sequence of the longest clone was identical to that of GH-17. The nucleotide sequence around the first ATG codon of GH-17 agreed with the consensus sequence for eukaryotic initiation codon described by Kozak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c24">24</xref>), and immunoblot analysis revealed that the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation product from GH-17 was the same size as the protein in HeLa cell lysate (data not shown). Thus, GH-17 encodes the entire coding region and the protein coding region starts from the first ATG of the open reading frame.</p><p>The reconstituted cDNA was 1829 nucleotides in length (DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no. AB044661) and contained an open reading frame of 1125 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 374 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 41 kDa and a calculated isoelectric point of 4.65. We designated this protein as XAB1. The N-terminal region of the deduced amino acid sequence contained several structural motifs that were conserved within GTP-binding proteins: the phosphate&#x0002f;magnesium binding motif G-1 (-G<sup>26</sup>MAGSGKT), G-2 (-G<sup>69</sup>IRDT), G-3 (-D<sup>122</sup>TPG) and the putative guanine ring recognition motif G-4 (-N<sup>189</sup>KTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c27">27</xref>).

The C-terminal region of XAB1 contained a cluster of acidic amino acid residues.</p><p>In order to identify homologous proteins, the predicted amino acid sequence of XAB1 was used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database using the BLAST command. The sequence of one unknown partial cDNA, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> mRNA for a putative ATP (GTP)-binding protein (CAA09376), was a perfect match. And the most highly related protein was the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> hypothetical protein (P46577) (52&#x00025; identity, 68&#x00025; similarity), followed by the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> hypothetical protein Yjr072cp (6322532) (48&#x00025; identity, 62&#x00025; similarity), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> hypothetical protein (CAB51688) (47&#x00025; identity, 64&#x00025; similarity) and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> hypothetical protein (CAA17930) (47&#x00025; identity, 64&#x00025; similarity). The alignment of these sequences is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd612f1">1</xref>. The NCBI database showed that the gene encoding the putative ATP (GTP)-binding protein (CAA09376) maps to 2p23.3.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of XAB1 mRNA</title><p>To determine the size of the mRNA and tissue-specific expression of XAB1, northern blot analysis of poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA from different human tissues was performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd612f2">2</xref>). A major transcript with an approximate size of 2.1 kb, which is consistent with the size of the cDNA clone, was identified. This gene was expressed ubiquitously in adult organs, with the highest level in testis. Two minor transcripts of 2.9 and 1.4 kb were also detected. The 1.4 kb transcript was expressed exclusively in testis.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization of XAB1</title><p>To determine the subcellular localization of XAB1, immunofluorescence analysis was performed using anti-XAB1 antibody. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd612f3">3</xref>A, intense signal was detected predominantly in cytoplasm. Western blot analysis of fractionated cellular proteins also showed that XAB1 is predominantly expressed in cytosol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd612f3">3</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of XPA deletion mutants with XAB1</title><p>Several functional domains have been identified in XPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c19">19</xref>). To delineate the binding region of XPA for XAB1, yeast two-hybrid assay was performed with a reverse combination in screening, full-length XAB1-bait and XPA deletion mutant-prey. The ability of each mutant to interact with XAB1 was determined as &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd612f4">4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd612tb1">1</xref>). The truncated XPA with deletion of the C-terminal region between amino acid residues 98 and 273 (C&#x00394;176) and deletion of the region between residues 61 and 92 (&#x00394;61&#x02013;92) were still able to interact with XAB1. Deletion of the N-terminal end of XPA between residues 1 and 52 (N&#x00394;52) and deletion of the region between residues 37 and 58 (&#x00394;37&#x02013;58) abolished the activation of the reporter gene. Furthermore, the truncated XPA with deletion of basic amino acid residues between 30 and 34 (Arg-Lys-Arg-Gln-Arg; &#x00394;30&#x02013;34) lost the ability to interact with XAB1. These results indicate that XAB1 interacts with the N-terminal region of XPA and that the five basic amino acid residues (residues 30&#x02013;34) of XPA are important for the binding to XAB1.</p></sec><sec><title>GTPase activity of recombinant His-XAB1</title><p>XAB1 has the motifs that were conserved in GTP-binding proteins, raising the possibility that XAB1 has intrinsic GTPase activity. To test the possibility, we measured GTPase activity using His-XAB1 produced by the baculovirus system. The protein was purified by metal affinity resin and Mini Q column chromatography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd612f5">5</xref>). His-XAB1 was eluted from the Mini Q column at 200&#x02013;300 mM KCl. GTPase activity was detected in the fractions containing His-XAB1 (fractions 13 and 14), and the elution profile of GTPase activity was correlated with that of His-XAB1. We also tested whether XAB1 has ATPase activity. However, we could not detect the ATPase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd612f5">5</xref>D).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We had searched for proteins that bind to XPA by yeast two-hybrid screening and had shown that the RPA34 bound to XPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c20">20</xref>). In the present study, we screened approximately 12 times the number of HeLa cDNA clones (1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>) screened previously using XPA as bait. Among the positive clones, there were ERCC1, RPA34 and five unknown cDNAs. We designated these unknown proteins XABs. XAB1 and XAB2 were detected in the previous and the present screening. Recently, we have shown that XAB2 is a novel tetratricopeptide repeat protein involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c28">28</xref>). From a periodic database search, XAB3 and XAB5 were identified as a putative metallopeptidase PRSM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c29">29</xref>) and a Golgi reassembly stacking protein GRASP65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c30">30</xref>), respectively. XAB4 has a region homologous to XAB5. Here we showed that XAB1, consisting of 374 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 41 kDa, is a novel cytoplasmic protein having GTPase activity.</p><p>GTP-binding proteins constitute a large superfamily which comprises at least three subfamilies: large heterotrimeric signal-transducing G-proteins, low molecular weight G-proteins and GTPases involved in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c26">26</xref>). The &#x003b1;-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins have a built-in GTPase-activating protein domain that facilitates GTP hydrolysis and accounts for their high intrinsic GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c26">26</xref>). The p21<sup>ras</sup> and <italic>ras</italic>-related low molecular weight GTPases exhibit high affinity for GTP and GDP, have low intrinsic GTPase and require GTPase-activating protein for efficient hydrolysis of GTP and release of GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c26">26</xref>). Recently, a new group of large molecular GTP-binding proteins (e.g. dynamin) has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c31">31</xref>). In the GTP binding motif, these proteins harbor only the four characteristic motifs for GTPase, G1&#x02013;G4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c31">31</xref>). In the dynamin family, MxA protein is well characterized in biochemical studies. MxA exhibits low affinity for GTP, lower affinity for GDP and a high <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for the GTP hydrolysis reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c33">33</xref>).</p><p>In size, XAB1 resembles the &#x003b1;-subunits of the heterotrimeric G-proteins. On the other hand, in terms of its GTP-binding motif, XAB1 resembles the dynamin family. We tried to detect intrinsic GTP-binding activity of recombinant XAB1 protein by nitrocellulose filter binding assay, but we could not detect any GTP or GDP-binding activity (data not shown). However, we have detected GTPase activity of recombinant XAB1 protein in solution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd612f5">5</xref>). Filter binding assay is less suitable for measuring low affinity interaction between protein and nucleotide than binding experiments in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c33">33</xref>). Our data suggest that XAB1 would exhibit low affinity for GTP and GDP, and high GTPase activity like MxA protein. XAB1 resembles the dynamin family with respect to GTPase activity, but differs from them in molecular weight.</p><p>A group of hypothetical proteins showed high degrees of sequence similarity with XAB1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd612f1">1</xref>). At the amino acid level, all the proteins share &#x0223c;47&#x02013;52&#x00025; sequence identity. It is likely that these proteins constitute a novel subfamily of GTP-binding proteins since they all contain the same G1&#x02013;G4 motifs and possess a similar molecular size (355&#x02013;385 amino acid residues), which is smaller than that of the dynamin family.</p><p>To identify the function of XAB1 in NER, we tested the effects of the addition of recombinant XAB1 protein or anti-XAB1 antibody on cell-free NER assay. But there were no significant effects of recombinant XAB1 and anti-XAB1 antibody (data not shown). XAB1 is expressed ubiquitously and its homologs are conserved in different species. The gene for the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> homolog is essential to the viability of yeast (data not shown). Consequently, XAB1 could have an essential function. We showed that XAB1 bound to the N-terminal region (residues 1&#x02013;52) of XPA and the deletion of 30&#x02013;34 amino acid residues of XPA abolished the ability to interact with XAB1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd612f4">4</xref>). Previously, we have shown that the NLS of XPA is localized in a region of 30&#x02013;42 amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd612c14">14</xref>). These results suggest that XAB1 is involved in the nuclear localization of XPA.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd612f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Alignment of the amino acid sequences of XAB1 and related proteins.
