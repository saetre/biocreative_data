The genome sequence of <italic>M. synoviae </italic>strain WVU 1853 has been determined and comparative analysis with <italic>M. gallisepticum</italic>, another major avian pathogen, provided evidence for horizontal gene transfer between the two species, though belonging to two distinct phylogenetic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Among the genes that could have arisen by horizontal gene transfer are those encoding for haemagglutinins. In avian mycoplasmas, genes encoding for these immunogenic and surface exposed proteins are the subject of considerable antigenic variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. By alternating the composition of their surface proteins, mycoplasmas are thought to colonize more efficiently mucosal surfaces and become more virulent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Haemagglutinins account among the most important surface proteins involved in colonization and virulence of avian mycoplasmas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>M. synoviae</italic>, haemagglutinins are encoded by related sequences of a multigene family referred to as <italic>vlhA </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The haemagglutinins of <italic>M. gallisepticum </italic>(pMGA) and <italic>M. imitans </italic>are also encoded by multigene families related to <italic>vlhA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Both organization and control of expression of <italic>vlhA </italic>genes are quite different between <italic>M. gallisepticum </italic>and <italic>M. synoviae</italic>. In the former species, <italic>vlhA </italic>genes are located in five distinct genomic regions and each gene appears to be translationally competent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. By contrast, in <italic>M. synoviae</italic>, all <italic>vlhA </italic>sequences are confined to a restricted genomic region with a unique copy being expressed in a single strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]</p><p>The uniquely expressed <italic>vlhA </italic>gene of <italic>M. synoviae </italic>yields a product that is cleaved post-translationally into a N-terminal lipoprotein (MSPB) and a C-terminal haemagglutinin protein (MSPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Cleavage was found to occur immediately after amino acid residue 344 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Both MSPA and MSPB are surface-exposed proteins and exhibit high frequency antigenic variation, but only MSPA mediates binding to erythrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Sequence analysis of several <italic>M. synoviae </italic>strains suggested that MSPA was more antigenically variable than MSPB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Consistently, in isogenically derived <italic>M. synoviae </italic>clones that have lost their haemadsorbing and/or haemagglutinating activity, MSPA was no more detectable by polyclonal antisera or monoclonal antibodies, suggesting extensive antigenic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The molecular basis underlying the generation of antigenic variants of <italic>M. synoviae </italic><italic>vlhA </italic>genes has been elegantly demonstrated in a study conducted by Noormohammedi et al. 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It resides in the ability of a single strain to undergo high frequency site-specific recombination, owing to the availability in the genome sequence of a significant pool of pseudogenes (<italic>vlhA</italic>-related partial sequences). Recombination between the single complete <italic>vlhA </italic>gene and one of the multiple pseudogene copies ensures the creation of a new <italic>vlhA </italic>gene variant. To date, three expressed <italic>vlhA </italic>gene variants (<italic>vlhA1</italic>, <italic>vlhA4</italic>, and <italic>vlhA5</italic>) have been characterized in <italic>M. synoviae </italic>strain WVU 1853 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These genes are equally sized and show extensive sequence variability in a 400-bp DNA segment in the middle of the <italic>vlhA </italic>sequence, suggesting that the recombination event, though introduced sequence variations, tended to preserve the overall sequence length and composition. Although it has been concluded that the potential of <italic>vlhA </italic>genes to vary is considerable, there is no indication as to which extent a <italic>vlhA </italic>gene could diverge without losing its properties.</p><p>Previous studies from our laboratory have identified in <italic>M. synoviae </italic>strain WVU 1853, an immunodominant <italic>vlhA </italic>variant (termed MS2/28.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] whose haemagglutinin region displayed a dramatic sequence shift and was considerably reduced in size, relative to the previously characterized expressed <italic>vlhA </italic>genes (<italic>vlhA1</italic>, <italic>vlhA4</italic>, and <italic>vlhA5</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To better evaluate the extent of antigenic variation that could be tolerated by the <italic>M. synoviae </italic>haemagglutinin, we sought to know whether this highly divergent <italic>vlhA </italic>member was properly processed and whether it remained functionally competent. Our results provide evidence that the antigenic repertoire of <italic>M. synoviae </italic><italic>vlhA </italic>genes might be wider than previously perceived.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of the MS2/28.1 fragment</title><p>The complete nucleotide sequence of MS2/28, the &#x003bb; phage-derived DNA fragment (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MSU66315">MSU66315</ext-link>) harbouring the immuno-reactive MS2/28.1 sequence, has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

MS2/28.1 lacked its N-terminal sequence, whereas the C-terminal region of MS2/28.2 was incomplete. The two partial ORFs shared 71% and 61.27% identity at the nucleotide and deduced amino acids sequences, respectively, and were separated by a 481-nucleotide non coding region (data not shown). Amino acid sequence comparisons between the two partial ORFs and the expressed <italic>vlhA1 </italic>gene have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. MS2/28.1 displayed 54.1% identity with <italic>vlhA1</italic>, along a 244-residue overlapping region, while MS2/28.2 showed 58.4% identity through a 495-amino acid overlapping sequence, starting at residue 260 of the <italic>vlhA1 </italic>gene sequence. Thus, the two partial open reading frames MS2/28.1 and MS2/28.2 are members of the <italic>vlhA </italic>gene family.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence that MS2/28.1 was transcribed through the unique vlhA promoter</title><p>Immunoreactivity of the &#x003bb; phage MS2/28 clone was associated with the 5' end of the MS2/28.1 partial ORF.

New variant sequences, recruited from a pool of <italic>vlhA </italic>pseudogenes, are placed under the control of this unique promoter via site-specific recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Hence, we performed RT-PCR using a sense primer targeting the 5'-end of the expected <italic>vlhA </italic>promoter-derived transcript coupled to a reverse primer located at the 3' end of MS2/28.1 partial coding sequence.

Such a gene replacement mechanism, also known as gene conversion, allows a single strain of <italic>M. synoviae </italic>to generate a large number of variants by recruiting new sequences from a large pseudogene reservoir. This pseudogene reservoir was found to be confined to a restricted region of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], providing an optimal environment for site-specific recombination. The finding that MS2/28.1 gene sequence occurs in tandem with another <italic>vlhA </italic>related gene (MS2/28.2), suggests that it is part of this pseudogene reservoir.</p><p>Overall, the data point to the selection and clonal expansion of a WVU 1853 bacterial cell expressing a variant <italic>vlhA </italic>gene with an exceptionally highly divergent haemagglutinin region, comparatively to the expressed <italic>vlhA </italic>variant sequences described to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Indeed, all tested colonies contained an MS2/28.1 sequence located immediately downstream of the unique <italic>vlhA1 </italic>promoter. Comparative sequence analyses with the previously full-length <italic>vlhA </italic>genes, suggest that gene replacement could have occurred from aa residue 224 to the carboxy terminus. This finding adds a new 5' recombination site to the previously identified three sites (codon for residues 136, 356, and 442) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], thus increasing the potential to generate antigenic variability.</p><p>Selection of clones expressing other <italic>vlhA1</italic>-related genes from a culture of <italic>M. synoviae </italic>WVU 1853, led to the identification of two variant clones, referred to as <italic>vlhA4 </italic>and <italic>vlhA5 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These expressed variants showed a predicted protein length close to that of <italic>vlhA1 </italic>and diverged in their amino acid sequence by only 15% and 25%, respectively, from residue 211 to the carboxy terminus. This limited sequence variability most likely allows maintaining proper <italic>vlhA </italic>processing, subcellular location, and haemagglutination activity, while providing sufficient antigenic variability. By contrast, the coding sequence of the full-length MS2/28.1 ORF is considerably shorter than <italic>vlhA1</italic>, from which it diverged by 64%. The results showed that this highly variant sequence was properly processed, with its C-terminal highly divergent region exposed at the cell surface. In addition, the <italic>M. synoviae </italic>clone expressing MS2/28.1 efficiently haemagglutinated chicken erythrocytes, a property that was mapped to the surface-exposed and highly divergent C-terminal 60 residues of MS2/28.1. As far as could be ascertained, this is the first report mapping the heamagglutinating activity of a <italic>M. synoviae vlhA </italic>gene. The finding that the antiserum raised against this C-terminal region inhibited the haemagglutinating activity of the homologous <italic>M. synoviae </italic>culture, definitely confirmed that the surface exposed C-terminal 60 residues of MS2/28.1 is associated with haemagglutination. It remains to be seen whether other regions of MS2/28.1 contribute to haemagglutination.</p><p>The results described above highlight the extent to which <italic>vlhA </italic>genes could vary, in both the size and the sequence composition, without compromising their haemagglutination activity. Hence, comparing the expressed sequences from several naturally evolved haemagglutinin variant clones may help identifying critical residues involved in the haemagglutinating activity of <italic>vlhA</italic>. These variations would enable the bacterium to expose an antigenically highly divergent product to better escape the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Such a plausible consequence is presently under investigation. However, we anticipate that, during natural infection, in the face of the immune pressure, such an antigenic shift may occur frequently. It would thus be of interest to perform sequence comparisons between naturally derived <italic>vlhA </italic>gene sequences by focusing on their variable haemagglutinin portion. Finally, because site-specific recombination events within <italic>vlhA </italic>genes occur frequently through <italic>in vitro </italic>culture passages, inter-laboratory variations in <italic>M. synoviae </italic>stocks that had been colony purified are likely to exist.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study provided an indication of the extent to which the <italic>vlhA </italic>haemagglutin gene of <italic>M. synoviae </italic>could vary without compromising the surface exposure and the haemagglutinating activity of its encoded product. We thus anticipate that the antigenic repertoire of <italic>M. synoviae </italic><italic>vlhA </italic>gene could be much wider than previously thought.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditions</title><p><italic>Mycoplasma synoviae </italic>strain WVU 1853 was obtained from the American Type Cell Culture collection (ATCC 25204 ) and grown in Frey's medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] supplemented with 15% (v/v) foetal calf serum.
