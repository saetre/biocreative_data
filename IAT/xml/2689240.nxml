The disease often spreads by implantation through the mesothelial surfaces covering the abdominal cavity. One of the suggested contributors for this spreading is the CD44 receptor on cell surface and its ligand, the extracellular matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We have found a 49-fold increase in the median concentration of hyaluronan in grade 3 ovarian carcinomas, and an 89-fold increase in the corresponding metastases compared to normal ovary. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] This is consistent with the fact that hyaluronan is an independent, unfavorable prognostic factor in epithelial ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and suggests that hyaluronan is involved in the progression of this, and other malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Blocking the accumulation of hyaluronan might offer a new way of fighting against the disease, and defining the causes of the accumulation should provide means for this.</p><p>Hyaluronan can be produced in mammals by three hyaluronan synthase isoenzymes: HAS1, HAS2 and HAS3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. HAS mRNA levels often correspond to the rate of hyaluronan synthesis, and are known to influence the content of hyaluronan in transplanted tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Therefore, upregulation of HAS expression is a likely contributor to the hyaluronan accumulation in tissues, and promotes tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and metastasis in experimental animals, in particular when coexpressed with hyaluronidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The tissue content of hyaluronan is balanced by catabolism, which is a more complex process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix can be partially fragmented by hyaluronidase activity or oxygen free radicals, and diffuse away through lymph. Alternatively, hyaluronan can be taken up by adjacent cells and be subject to lysosomal degradation in the tissue of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, the formation of oxygen free radicals, access to lymph, local uptake by cells, and hyaluronidases may each have a contribution to the rate of hyaluronan catabolism. There are 6 hyaluronidases in the human genome, two of them (<italic>HYAL1 </italic>and <italic>HYAL2</italic>) ubiquitous and characterized at protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The major transcript of <italic>HYAL3 </italic>is enzymatically inactive and appears to have only a supportive role in <italic>HYAL 1 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>HYAL 3 </italic>knockout mice did not display any evidence of hyaluronan accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Very little is known about HYAL4, but its expression is limited, and it might be a chondroitinase rather than hyaluronidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The expression of <italic>SPAM1</italic>-encoded PH20 hyaluronidase is almost exclusively detected in testis and sperm, and shows activity in higher pH. We have shown previously that ovarian tissues show no hyaluronidase activity at pH 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In an invasive bladder cancer cell line, blocking of <italic>HYAL1 </italic>expression decreases tumor growth, inhibits tumor infiltration and decreases microvessel density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Increased hyaluronidase expression has also been reported in colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], as well as in breast tumor metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In contrast, experimental overexpression of <italic>HYAL1 </italic>in a rat colon carcinoma cell line inhibits tumor growth and generates necrotic tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recent findings have suggested that depending on its concentration, <italic>HYAL1 </italic>can function as a tumor promoter or as a suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>We started to determine the mechanism of hyaluronan accumulation in ovarian cancer by analyzing the expression profiles of hyaluronan synthases and hyaluronidases in a clinically defined set of tumors, and found that a significantly decreased <italic>HYAL1 </italic>expression correlates with lower hyaluronidase activity and elevated hyaluronan content of the tumors, while <italic>HAS </italic>expression was not as consistently associated to the accumulation of hyaluronan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>39 ovarian tissue specimens from 39 patients were divided into 5 groups: normal ovaries (n = 5), serous cystadenomas (n = 10), serous borderline tumors (n = 4), low grade (grades 1+2) (n = 10) and high grade (grade 3) (n = 10) serous epithelial cystadenocarcinomas.

In addition to samples with weakly stained epithelial tissue similar to normal ovaries, 64% of tumor samples showed a more intense epithelial HAS2-immunostaining. The highest HAS2 staining intensities were detected in benign tumors and in grade 1 carcinomas (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and the intensities (graded into three categories) was significantly different in the histological subgroups (Chi-square P = 0.003).

Immunohistochemical stainings of HAS proteins showed a low level of HAS1, a slightly elevated level of HAS3 in the tumor epithelia, and a variable elevation of HAS2 immunostaining in the tumor epithelial cells, in agreement with the mRNA assays. In the stromal cells, no difference was observed with the HAS2 antibody in normal and tumor samples, an unexpected result considering the strong accumulation of hyaluronan in the same specimens. Instead, <italic>HYAL1 </italic>expression was consistently decreased in the cancers, with a concomitant trend to reduced hyaluronidase enzyme activity.</p><sec><title>HAS expression in ovarian cancer</title><p>Since <italic>HAS2 </italic>and <italic>HAS3 </italic>genes showed no consistent increase in their expression in the serous ovarian cancers, and <italic>HAS1 </italic>mRNA was virtually absent, changes in the transcriptional activity of the <italic>HAS </italic>genes seem not to be the main factor in the increased hyaluronan content of these tumors. A few of the samples showed high expression levels of <italic>HAS2</italic>, but most of the cancers showed no elevation in the expression of any of the <italic>HAS </italic>genes.</p><p>Immunohistochemical stainings confirmed that the levels of HAS1 and HAS3 were relatively low in ovarian cancers, while the signal for HAS2 was more widespread, in line with the real-time RT-PCR-analysis. While the stromal cells were positive for HAS2, their staining intensity did not correlate with that of stromal hyaluronan, nor with the tumor type or grade. Unexpectedly, the HAS2 antibody stained also normal, benign and malignant ovarian epithelial cells, all of which were largely negative with the hyaluronan probe. Putting these findings together would suggest that the epithelium somehow contributes to hyaluronan mainly seen in the stroma. Theoretically, this would be possible if the epithelial cells were unable to hold and take up the synthesized hyaluronan by a receptor like CD44. In support of this idea, the expression of CD44 is reduced in the high grade ovarian cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and the released hyaluronan could be trapped in the stroma by complexing with versican [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Even if the epithelial HAS contributes to stromal hyaluronan, it would not explain the hyaluronan accumulation in the high grade tumors since the epithelial HAS2 staining intensity was highest in the benign and well differentiated tumors.</p><p>Taken together, the data suggest that although in some of the ovarian tumors a high HAS2/HAS3 level may contribute to hyaluronan accumulation, in the majority of cases, particularly the high grade tumors, stromal hyaluronan accumulation is not explained by the increased expression of any of the HASs.</p></sec><sec><title>Relationship between HYAL1 and HYAL2</title><p>In terms of the cellular content of mRNA, the dominant hyaluronidase in these tissues was <italic>HYAL2</italic>. However, the fact that only <italic>HYAL1 </italic>mRNA correlated with the measured hyaluronidase activity, and inversely with hyaluronan accumulation, suggests higher enzymatic activity of HYAL1 and more importance in hyaluronan catabolism. It has been noted that HYAL2 preferentially produces hyaluronan fragments above 20 kDa, while <italic>HYAL1 </italic>can cut hyaluronan down to tetra- hexasaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], suggesting that they either act in sequence in the degradation, or have distinct functions related to the sizes of the end products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>There was also a trend for low <italic>HYAL2 </italic>expression in the most aggressive, grade 3 tumors, a result resembling that in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Like in ovarian cancer, hyaluronidase activity in DCBCL tissue extracts was not correlated with <italic>HYAL2 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, there was an inverse correlation between <italic>HYAL2 </italic>expression and hyaluronan content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Obviously, we need to know more about the distinct cellular functions of <italic>HYAL1 </italic>and <italic>HYAL2 </italic>to define their exact roles in malignancies.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic changes in the HYAL genes</title><p>Allelic imbalance is frequent in the 3p21.3 chromosome region containing <italic>HYAL1 </italic>and <italic>HYAL2 </italic>genes, suggesting that this site is important in ovarian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The positive correlation that still existed between the expression of <italic>HYAL1 </italic>and <italic>HYAL2 </italic>may be explained by concomitant deletions of these closely mapped genes. Whether due to genomic alterations or not, the present results suggest that hyaluronidase activity contributes to the accumulation of hyaluronan, a known promoter of malignant growth.</p></sec><sec><title>HYAL1 changes in ovarian vs. other cancers</title><p>The present findings of reduced <italic>HYAL1 </italic>expression are consistent with those of another set of ovarian cancer samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but in a strong contrast to reports on prostate and bladder tumors in which increased <italic>HYAL1 </italic>expression in poorly differentiated tumors is associated with advanced disease and unfavorable prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It appears that malignancies arising from different cell types utilize distinct strategies to survive and progress. Increased hyaluronan may contribute to tumor growth and invasiveness by providing an expanded, loose matrix for cancer cells, protecting the tumor from immune reactions and apoptosis, stimulating tumor cell migration, and increasing cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. While hyaluronidase may block the above functions associated with high molecular mass hyaluronan, it can at the same time create hyaluronan oligosaccharides that stimulate neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], a crucial precondition for tumor expansion. The relative importance of the opposite roles of hyaluronidase function in a particular type of cancer probably determines the outcome. The exact expression level is also important; transfections of <italic>HYAL1 </italic>can either promote or suppress malignant growth in a single cell type, depending on the resulting enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Possible mechanisms of HYAL-1 tumor suppressor function</title><p>High HYAL1 expression can result in apoptosis by increasing the expression of WOX1 (WW domain-containing oxidoreductase, WWOX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. WOX1 causes mitochondrial permeabilization and is an essential partner of p53 in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Importantly, WWOX variant 1 expression is significantly lower in ovarian epithelial tumours than in normal ovaries, which supports its role as a suppressor of ovarian tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Hyaluronidase can also cause apoptosis by inducing NAD+-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PDGH), an enzyme that degrades prostaglandins and promotes apoptosis in lung carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the high molecular mass hyaluronan that occupies cell surface CD44 receptors maintains p-Akt and PI3K dependent signals that prevent cancer cell apoptosis, while hyaluronidase, and the oligosaccharides created by hyaluronidase, block these cell survival signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results indicate for the first time that decreased expression of HYAL1 rather than increased expression of HAS1&#x02013;3 correlates with the accumulation of hyaluronan in serous ovarian cancer, and provides new insight in the role of hyaluronidases in human cancer <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>HYAL: hyaluronidase; HAS: hyaluronan synthase; FIGO: International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetrics.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TN performed the RNA extraction and RT-QPCR analysis, carried out hyaluronidase assays, performed statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
