In flies, the visceral mesoderm secretes signaling molecules that diffuse into the underlying midgut endoderm, where conserved signaling cascades activate the Hox gene <italic>labial</italic>, which is important for the differentiation of copper cells (Bienz, M. 1997. <italic>Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev.</italic> 7:683&#x02013;688). We present here a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> gene of the Fox family of transcription factors, <italic>FoxK</italic>, that mediates transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) signaling in the embryonic midgut endoderm. <italic>FoxK</italic> mutant embryos fail to generate midgut constrictions and lack Labial in the endoderm. Our observations suggest that TGF-&#x003b2; signaling directly regulates <italic>FoxK</italic> through functional Smad/Mad-binding sites, whereas FoxK, in turn, regulates <italic>labial</italic> expression. We also describe a new cooperative activity of the transcription factors FoxK and Dfos/AP-1 that regulates <italic>labial</italic> expression in the midgut endoderm. This regulatory activity does not require direct <italic>labial</italic> activation by the TGF-&#x003b2; effector Mad.

By stage 16, the visceral mesoderm surrounding the endodermal tube induces the subdivision of the midgut endoderm along its anterior&#x02013;posterior axis. This process is regulated by the selective and nonoverlapping expression of the four posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the visceral mesoderm (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bienz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miller et al., 2001</xref>). The <italic>Hox</italic> genes regulate the expression of signaling molecules such as decapentaplegic (Dpp), a member of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily, and Wingless/Wnt (Wg) in the visceral mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Immergluck et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reuter and Scott, 1990</xref>). Dpp and Wg maintain each other's expression and also regulate the expression of a ligand for the EGF receptor, Vein, in the visceral mesoderm. These three signaling molecules diffuse into the underlying endoderm to induce morphogenetic events critical for the functional organization of the midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Immergluck et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panganiban et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reuter et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>The regulatory events necessary for the specification and differentiation of parasegment 7 are the best documented. The sequence of events involves: (a) Dpp, Wg, and Vein signaling from the neighboring visceral mesoderm into the underlying midgut endoderm, (b) activation of known intracellular and nuclear effectors of the Dpp, Wg, and EGF receptor pathways in the endoderm layer, and, lastly, (c) expression of <italic>labial</italic> (<italic>lab</italic>) in parasegment 7 of the endoderm, a <italic>Hox</italic> gene required for endoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Immergluck et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Panganiban et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reuter et al., 1990</xref>). <italic>Defective proventriculus</italic> and <italic>Teashirt</italic> (<italic>Tsh</italic>) are two additional transcription factors that respond to Dpp and Wg signaling in the endoderm. <italic>Tsh</italic> negatively regulates <italic>lab</italic> and is required for interstitial cell precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mathies et al., 1994</xref>), whereas <italic>Defective proventriculus</italic> is broadly expressed in midgut precursor cells and is later repressed by <italic>lab</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakagoshi et al., 1998</xref>). Importantly, the inductive processes across germ layers mediated by the TGF-&#x003b2; and Wnt pathways are conserved mechanisms during specification and differentiation of the endoderm layer in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tam et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The activity of Dpp in the visceral mesoderm induces a well known signaling cascade that leads to phosphorylation of the Smad protein Mothers against dpp (Mad) and nuclear translocation of Med (Mad&#x02013;Medea) complexes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bienz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Massague and Wotton, 2000</xref>). The active Mad&#x02013;Med complexes regulate the expression of specific targets, such as the transcriptions factors Lab and Dfos/AP-1 in midgut endoderm. Dfos is required, but not sufficient, to activate <italic>lab</italic> expression in the endoderm, suggesting that Dfos is a component of a transcriptional complex that regulates Lab expression and midgut specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Riese et al., 1997</xref>). It is unclear at this time how the reiterated use of Mad in different developmental contexts results in the activation of unique, tissue-specific developmental programs. In particular, how does Mad precisely activate <italic>lab</italic> in the endoderm? What other factors contribute to the tissue-specific activity of Mad?</p><p>The fork head box (Fox) protein family is comprised of transcription factors that share a structurally related DNA-binding domain, the fork head (FH) or winged helix domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weigel and Jackle, 1990</xref>). Of the 17 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes encoding for Fox proteins, only 7 have been functionally characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee and Frasch, 2004</xref>). To learn more about the function of Fox proteins in development, we concentrated on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of vertebrate FOXK1, also known as myocyte nuclear factor (MNF) in mice and interleukin factor (ILF) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bassel-Duby et al., 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee and Frasch (2004)</xref> described <italic>Drosophila</italic> FOXK1 previously, but it is currently identified as MNF in FlyBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0036134.html">http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0036134.html</ext-link>). To follow modern nomenclature, we will refer to <italic>Drosophila</italic> MNF as FoxK. In the present work, we characterized the function of FoxK during midgut development and found that <italic>FoxK</italic> is required for Lab expression and for the formation of the midgut constrictions. Moreover, we describe a novel cooperative activity between the transcription factors FoxK and Dfos/AP-1 that mediate the Dpp signaling events during endoderm differentiation. Thus, FoxK plays a critical role in a key inductive process during midgut development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sequence conservation and genomic structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> FoxK</title><p>Our study of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of FOXK1 determined that its FH domain shares 84% sequence conservation to both human and murine FOXK1 and contains a characteristic bipartite nuclear localization sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). The N-terminal portion of <italic>Drosophila</italic> FoxK also contains a conserved FH-associated domain (FHA; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>), a phosphoprotein-binding domain typically found in the FOXK subfamily and in other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Durocher and Jackson, 2002</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> FoxK shares 67% identity in the FHA domain with human ILF/FOXK1, whereas the overall conservation of the full-length sequence is 48% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Peptidic sequence and genomic structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> FoxK.</bold> (A) Sequence alignment of the FH domains of <italic>Drosophila</italic> FoxK, human ILF, and murine MNF.

Five computer-predicted cDNAs contained <italic>FoxK</italic> sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Four of these transcripts only differ in their 5&#x02032;UTR: <italic>FoxK-RA</italic> (3,231 bp), <italic>FoxK-RD</italic> (3,195 bp), <italic>FoxK-RB</italic> (3,320 bp), and <italic>FoxK-RC</italic> (3,117 bp) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). ESTs from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project supported the existence of all these alternative transcripts. These four transcripts generated the same open reading frame (ORF) of 2,220 nucleotides encoding a 740&#x02013;amino acid long polypeptide (termed FoxK-L; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).

This alternative splicing should preserve the reading frame of the amino acid sequence, resulting in a protein lacking 41 amino acids in the W2 domain of the FH domain. The single EST supporting the existence of <italic>FoxK-RE</italic> (LD16137), although similar to the predicted <italic>FoxK-RE</italic> isoform, had 16 extra nucleotides in exon 6, which would produce a frame shift and a premature Stop codon.

These transcripts generated an ORF of 1,962 nucleotides encoding a 654&#x02013;amino acid short polypeptide (termed FoxK-S; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). <italic>FoxK-S</italic> RNA lacked 258 nucleotides from exons 8 and 9 corresponding to 86 amino acids that preserved the reading frame of FoxK-L (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, green).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional activity of FoxK protein</title><p>To determine the transcriptional activity of this putative transcription factor, we first assayed its ability to bind specific DNA sequences. Mouse MNF/FOXK1 binds both strands of the consensus FH-binding site composed of the heptanucleotide core 5&#x02032;-(A/G)TAAA(C/T)A-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weigel and Jackle, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Granadino et al., 2000</xref>). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) performed with a recombinant fusion protein including the FH domain of FoxK (GST-FoxK[414&#x02013;654]) and a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe containing a consensus FH-binding site (Oligo-FH) produced high molecular mass complexes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, arrows). The addition of cold Oligo-FH efficiently displaced the labeled probe, whereas a suboptimal probe (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, Sub) was less efficient. Conversely, an unrelated oligonucleotide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, GAS) did not interfere with Oligo-FH binding. Together, these results showed that the FH domain of FoxK specifically recognized a DNA sequence carrying a consensus FH-binding site.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>FoxK binds to specific DNA sequences and regulates transcription.</bold> (A) EMSA performed with GST-FoxK(414&#x02013;654) or GST alone (protein [P]) and the radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide Oligo-FH containing an optimum FH-binding site (red). Cold Oligo-FH probe (FH), a suboptimum FH-binding site (Sub), and an unrelated sequence (GAS) were used at 100-fold molar excess (competitors [C]). The higher bands (arrows) indicate specific binding of FoxK to Oligo-FH. Cold Oligo-FH efficiently competes for FoxK, whereas a suboptimum FH-binding site is a less efficient competitor and GAS does not compete for FoxK. GST alone did not bind to Oligo-FH. Free oligonucleotides complexes accumulate in the bottom (arrowhead). (B and C) A plasmid driving luciferase under the control of six consecutive Oligo-FH sequences (6xFH) was cotransfected with <italic>pAc5C-FoxK-L-V5</italic>, <italic>pAc5C-FoxK-S-V5</italic>, or empty vector in S2 cells. As expected, both FoxK-L and FoxK-S isoforms exhibit nuclear localization in transfected S2 cells (green, FoxK-L-V5). (D) Both FoxK-L and FoxK-S induce a fourfold activation of the 6xFH target sequence. The error bars correspond to the standard deviation of three independent experiments.

Expression of V5-tagged FoxK-S or FoxK-L resulted in nuclear accumulation of FoxK, confirming the functionality of the bipartite nuclear localization sequence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). S2 cells were next cotransfected with <italic>FoxK</italic> constructs and a luciferase-based reporter gene under the control of six tandem copies of Oligo-FH (6xFH). Despite the differences in the N-terminal region, FoxK-S and FoxK-L induced similar transcriptional activation on the reporter construct (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Interestingly, protein extracts from S2 cells transfected with <italic>FoxK-S</italic> and <italic>FoxK-L</italic> constructs produced two distinct bands in Western blot. The lower band had the expected molecular mass, whereas the higher band suggested the posttranslational modification of FoxK (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). It has been shown previously that mammalian FOXK1 is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 1997</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> FoxK contains multiple putative phosphorylation domains. However, we could not dephosphorylate FoxK in protein extracts using three potent and general phosphatases (see Materials and methods; unpublished data). Therefore, other mechanisms should be responsible for the posttranslational modification of FoxK. Overall, these observations indicated that both FoxK-S and FoxK-L induced potent transcriptional activation upon interaction with specific DNA sequences containing consensus FH-binding sites.</p></sec><sec><title>FoxK expression in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo</title><p>Using oligonucleotide primers specific for different exons of the <italic>FoxK</italic> gene, we detected <italic>FoxK</italic> transcripts at all stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

However, FoxK-L and FoxK-S show similar transcriptional activity in transactivation assays, indicating that the polyglutamine-rich stretch in the C terminus is not critical for the transcriptional activity of FoxK. <italic>FoxK-L</italic> and <italic>FoxK-S</italic> also show an interesting temporal distribution: embryonic stages only accumulate the Short isoform, adult flies only accumulate the Long isoform, whereas pupae, which contain both larval and adult tissues, produce both isoforms. The stage-specific separation of the two isoforms suggests that hormonal clues may regulate <italic>FoxK</italic> splicing. Interestingly, human MNF/FOXK1 also produces two isoforms by alternative splicing (MNF-&#x003b1; and -&#x003b2;), but both are expressed in muscle lineages. However, these two isoforms perform different functions during myocyte maturation and damage response. MNF-&#x003b1; is expressed during proliferation of undifferentiated myoblasts and shows poor ability to bind DNA, whereas MNF-&#x003b2; acts as a transcriptional repressor in differentiating myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). Because the two isoforms of <italic>Drosophila</italic> FoxK only cohabitate in pupae, FoxK-L and FoxK-S could exert the same regulatory activity in different stages.</p></sec><sec><title>FoxK is essential for midgut endoderm development</title><p><italic>FoxK</italic> exhibits a broad distribution in embryos, including the central nervous system, the midgut endoderm, and the epidermis; however, no obvious phenotypes seem to be associated to this widespread expression. We determined, though, that early <italic>FoxK</italic> activity provided maternally is critical for embryonic development. Thus, maternal <italic>FoxK</italic> may be involved in early segmentation events and may rescue early <italic>FoxK</italic> zygotic requirements, although we did not study these phenotypes in detail.</p><p>Based on the strong midgut phenotypes detected in <italic>FoxK</italic> mutant embryos, we focused on understanding the zygotic activity of <italic>FoxK</italic> in endoderm development. Embryos lacking <italic>FoxK</italic> exhibit arrested midgut development at stages 15&#x02013;16, in which the constrictions do not form. These <italic>FoxK</italic> mutant embryos specifically remove Lab expression in the endoderm, whereas the expression of Tsh, a transcription factor key for the specification of other intestinal lineages, is not affected. Moreover, the lack of other constrictions outside of the Lab domain clearly indicates that <italic>FoxK</italic> has other activities during midgut development. We have also identified several optimal FoxK-binding sites in the regulatory region of <italic>lab</italic> and proved the functionality of a 678-bp element containing five FH-binding sites. Our results, thus, support a direct transcriptional regulation of <italic>lab</italic> by FoxK in parasegment 7, indicating that <italic>FoxK</italic> plays a key role in midgut development.</p></sec><sec><title>FoxK is a novel Dpp target and effector in the endoderm</title><p>Several groups in the early 1990's contributed to the discovery that the signaling activity of Dpp in the visceral mesoderm controls <italic>lab</italic> expression in the endoderm (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bienz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakagoshi, 2005</xref>). Similarly to <italic>Dfos</italic>, expression of <italic>FoxK</italic> in the midgut endoderm depends directly on Dpp signaling, and both seem to be key components of the Dpp signaling cascade required for <italic>lab</italic> induction in the endoderm. However, we were puzzled by the inability of FoxK and Dfos to direct <italic>lab</italic> expression by themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Szuts and Bienz, 2000</xref>). Because both <italic>FoxK</italic> and <italic>Dfos</italic> encode for transcription factors, we hypothesized and demonstrated that they could work coordinately to control <italic>lab</italic> expression.</p><p>But, how do FoxK and Dfos fit in the classical model in which Mad directly activates <italic>lab</italic>? It has been proposed that Mad binds tissue- or cell-specific transcription factors that provide specificity to the multiple tissues that use the Dpp signaling pathway during specification or differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affolter et al., 2001</xref>). Following this hypothesis, the transcription factors FoxK and Dfos could be the endoderm partners of Mad that provide the tissue-specific clues necessary for <italic>lab</italic> expression in parasegment 7 of the endoderm. However, we have shown that FoxK and Dfos can restore <italic>lab</italic> expression in the endoderm in the absence of pSmad (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 Q</xref>), suggesting that activated Mad is not necessary for <italic>lab</italic> expression. In fact, the <italic>lab550</italic> minimal regulatory element contains a weak Dpp response element that includes activator as well as repressor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marty et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, <italic>lab550</italic> activation strongly depends on Lab self-regulation, suggesting that <italic>lab550</italic> is most likely involved in <italic>lab</italic> maintenance rather than in its initiation. Hence, factors other than Mad and Lab must be critical for stimulating <italic>lab</italic> transcription, whereas Mad input and Lab autoregulation may be key for subsequent <italic>lab</italic> maintenance.</p><p>Our data, thus, support a new model for Dpp-dependent endoderm specification that involves the sequential activation of transcription factors that progressively restrict the developmental potential of the target tissue (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). In our model, Dpp first activates Mad as a general/primary effector of Dpp signaling in the endoderm and other tissues (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Activated Mad then directly regulates the expression of <italic>FoxK</italic> and <italic>Dfos</italic>, the tissue-specific/secondary effectors of Dpp signaling in the endoderm. FoxK and Dfos, in turn, induce the expression of <italic>lab</italic>, the differentiation/tertiary Dpp effector in parasegment 7 of the endoderm. Finally, Lab controls the expression of target genes critical for the functional differentiation of copper cells in the midgut, some of which may have already been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leemans et al., 2001</xref>). It is still possible, though, that small amounts of pMad are present in our Tkv<sup>DN</sup> experiments that are undetectable using the anti-pSmad antibody. In this scenario, we would have to consider a more classical model where a functional complex containing Mad, FoxK, and Dfos is necessary for the specification of endoderm and activation of <italic>lab</italic>. However, we still favor the sequential model because a reduction in activated Mad should result, contrary to what we find, in some degree of Lab loss. But, because we did not test in Mad-null conditions, we cannot rule out the direct role of Mad in activating <italic>lab</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conserved mechanisms of endoderm development</title><p>Transcriptional regulators of the GATA and Fox families are conserved molecular mediators of endoderm specification in vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuda and Kikuchi, 2005</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakagoshi, 2005</xref>). In both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice, Fkh/FoxA1/FoxA2 and Serpent/GATA proteins function in the early stages of specification of endodermal precursors. In mice, <italic>Foxa1</italic> is necessary for pancreas and &#x003b2; cell differentiation and <italic>Foxa2</italic> is critical for development of the mature endoderm, whereas forced expression of <italic>Foxa1</italic> induces stem cells to differentiate into endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tam et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, intercellular signaling between cell layers by signaling molecules of the TGF-&#x003b2;/Dpp and the Wnt/Wg families is also critical for endoderm differentiation in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We have characterized a new role for FoxK in endoderm development in flies. Interestingly, the mouse Foxk1/MNF-&#x003b1; isoform is also abundant in brain, kidney, spleen, and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bassel-Duby et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). The vertebrate liver is a derivative of the endoderm, suggesting that mammalian FOXK1 is also involved in endoderm development. However, because the expression pattern of Foxk1 in mice is unknown at this time, we can only speculate about its potential role in other endoderm derivatives, such as the lining of the gut and the pancreas.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>RT-PCR and FoxK transcripts</title><p>RT-PCR was performed with total RNA using the Ultraspec-II RNA system (Biotecx).
