Here, we show that Dystroglycan null mutant follicle cells have normal apical-basal polarity, but lose the planar polarity of their basal actin stress fibers, a phenotype it shares with Dystrophin mutants. However, unlike Dystrophin mutants, mutants in Dystroglycan or in its extracellular matrix ligand Perlecan lose polarity under energetic stress. The maintenance of epithelial polarity under energetic stress requires the activation of Myosin II by the cellular energy sensor AMPK. Starved Dystroglycan or Perlecan null cells activate AMPK normally, but do not activate Myosin II. Thus, Perlecan signaling through Dystroglycan may determine where Myosin II can be activated by AMPK, thereby providing the basal polarity cue for the low-energy epithelial polarity pathway. Since Dystroglycan is often downregulated in tumors, loss of this pathway may play a role in cancer progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CELLBIO</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In multicellular organisms, the majority of cells are polarized, and this polarity is an essential feature of cell morphogenesis and the functional specification of cellular domains. Our current understanding of cell polarization suggests that it occurs in three successive steps. First, the cell receives extrinsic signals that provide polarity cues that determine the orientation in which the cell polarizes. Second, these cues induce the localization of conserved polarity proteins that direct the formation of distinct cortical domains, such as apical, lateral, and basal in epithelial cells. Finally, these cortical polarity complexes direct the polarized organization of the other constituents of the cell, such as the cytoskeleton and the exocytic and endocytic pathways. Apical-basal polarity is particularly important for the function of epithelia, where it is required for paracellular barrier formation and polarized transport, whereas the loss of polarity has been implicated in tumor formation and metastasis.</p><p>One of the best-studied in&#x000a0;vivo models of epithelial polarity is the epithelium formed by the follicle cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary. All follicle cells in each ovariole are produced by a pair of stem cells in region 2 of the germarium. The follicle cells migrate to surround each germline cyst as it leaves the germarium and become polarized, with their apical sides contacting the germ cells and their basal sides facing a basement membrane (<xref rid="bib34 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Tanentzapf et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Margolis and Spradling, 1995</xref>). Like other polarized epithelia, the apical domain is characterized by the presence of microvilli and two interacting cortical polarity complexes, the Crumbs/Patj/Stardust (Crb/Patj/Sdt) complex and the atypical Protein Kinase C/PAR6/Bazooka (aPKC/PAR6/Baz) complex (<xref rid="bib34 bib24 bib4 bib36 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Tanentzapf et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Knust and Bossinger, 2002; Benton and St. Johnston, 2003; Wang and Margolis, 2007; Wodarz and N&#x000e4;thke, 2007</xref>). Beneath this, lies the belt-like zonula adherens, which is enriched in DE-Cadherin (DECad), &#x003b2;-catenin, and Baz, which mediates adhesion to the neighboring cells (<xref rid="bib34 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Tanentzapf et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Mirouse et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). The rest of the lateral cortex is marked by the presence of the Lethal Giant Larvae/Scribble/Discs-large (Lgl/Scrib/Dlg) complex and the protein kinase PAR1 (<xref rid="bib9 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Doerflinger et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Goode and Perrimon, 1997</xref>). Finally, the basal domain accumulates receptors, such as Integrins and Dystroglycan (Dg), that interact with proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the basement membrane (<xref rid="bib31 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>It is thought that the primary polarity cues in most epithelia are provided by Cadherin-dependent adhesion to the adjacent cells and by adhesion to the basement membrane (<xref rid="bib40 bib41" ref-type="bibr">Yeaman et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Yu et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). In the case of the follicular epithelium, these cues are sufficient to differentiate a distinct basal domain that contacts the basement membrane and a noncontacting domain, but the specification of distinct apical and lateral domains requires apical contact with the germ cells (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tanentzapf et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Junctional complexes such as the adherens junctions are good candidates for lateral cues, whereas Dg has been proposed to provide a basal cue (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Dg is a component of the Dystrophin (Dys) Associated Protein Complex (DAPC), which is required for muscle cell integrity in vertebrates, and mutations in many of the genes in the complex are associated with muscular dystrophies (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ervasti and Sonnemann, 2008</xref>). Dg is a transmembrane glycoprotein that interacts with several components of the ECM, including Laminin, Perlecan (Pcan), and Agrin. Inside the cell, the WW domain of Dg binds to Dys, which recruits most of the other DAPC components, such as the Syntrophins and Dystrobrevin. Dys also binds F-actin, and this interaction is critical for DAPC function in muscle cells. Indeed, it is proposed that the main function of the DAPC in muscle is to create a physical link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton. Mammals have two additional Dys paralogs, Utrophin and Dystrophin Related Protein 2 (DRP2), and partial redundancy between these genes has been reported (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Deconinck et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). There is a single Dys gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, making it a good model for understanding the function of this protein.</p><p>In vertebrates, most of the components of the DAPC, including Dg, Utrophin, Dystrobrevin, and Syntrophin, are expressed in epithelial cells (<xref rid="bib10 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Durbeej and Campbell, 1999; Kachinsky et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). The DAPC is mainly localized to the basal domain. Several Dg ligands, such as Laminin and Pcan, are also present in epithelial basement membranes, where they interact with Dg (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hohenester et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). Consistent with a role in epithelial polarity, <italic>Dg</italic> knockout mice die as early embryos and show defects in the formation of one of the first basement membranes, suggesting abnormal development of epithelia (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Henry and Campbell, 1998</xref>). Surprisingly, the double knockout of <italic>dys</italic> and <italic>utrophin</italic> is viable and does not show the same epithelial defect (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Deconinck et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). This suggests that Dg either functions independently of its usual downstream partners in epithelial polarity or that DRP2 has an early function in the embryo. The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans Dg</italic> mutant also shows defects in epithelial development, indicating a conserved function of the DAPC in this process (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The function of Dg in epithelia has been best characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in which lethal <italic>Dg</italic> alleles have been generated by the imprecise excision of a <italic>P</italic> element to produce deletions around the <italic>Dg</italic> promoter (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Homozygous clones of these deletion alleles disrupt the apical-basal polarity of epithelia. Furthermore, clones of cells mutant for Pcan, a Dg ligand, show a very similar phenotype (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). In addition, homozygous <italic>Dg</italic> mutant germline clones block the early polarization of the oocyte. These results suggest a general function of Dg adhesion to the ECM as a polarity cue, but they have been called into question by the discovery of <italic>Dg</italic> nonsense mutations that are homozygous viable (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Christoforou et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that neither Dg nor Pcan is required for the apical-basal polarity of epithelial cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> under normal laboratory conditions. The published deletion alleles of <italic>Dg</italic> that produce polarity phenotypes also remove <italic>mRpL34</italic>, which encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, and the polarity defects of these alleles are due to the concomitant loss of <italic>Dg</italic> and <italic>mRpL34</italic>. Since defects in mitochondria are likely to lower ATP levels in cells, we tested whether Dg is specifically required for epithelial polarity under low-energy conditions. Nonsense mutations in <italic>Dg</italic> and <italic>Pcan</italic>, but not <italic>Dys</italic>, induce a loss of polarity only when the flies are subjected to energetic stress, and this function is linked to the control of Myosin II.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Dg Null Alleles Do Not Affect Apical-Basal Polarity</title><p><italic>Dg</italic> deletion mutants have been reported to disrupt epithelial polarity and the early polarization of the oocyte (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). However, this essential role in polarity is not consistent with the recent discovery that <italic>Dg</italic> null alleles caused by nonsense mutations early in the <italic>Dg</italic> coding region are homozygous viable and fertile (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Christoforou et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). We therefore decided to explore the effect of these null mutations on cell polarity in the ovary by using mosaic analysis, which allows us to compare wild-type and mutant cells in the same tissue.</p><p>We first focused our analysis on the epithelial follicle cells. No Dg protein could be detected by antibody staining in mutant clones of the nonsense alleles <italic>Dg<sup>O86</sup></italic> or <italic>Dg<sup>O43</sup></italic>, consistent with these mutations being protein null (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A data not shown). In all <italic>Dg</italic> mutant clones, the localization of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b2;-catenin ortholog, Armadillo (Arm), was not affected, indicating that these cells have normal adherens junctions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A), and the Dlg protein was normally localized to the lateral domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). Moreover, three apical markers, aPKC, Crb, and Patj, were properly restricted to the apical cortex in all mutant clones (n &#x0003d; 36) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B&#x02013;1D). In addition, Pcan, a Dg ligand, is correctly localized to the basement membrane of <italic>Dg</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E). Finally, the loss of Dg has no effect on the apical-basal organization of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E). Indeed, the only localization defect observed in <italic>Dg</italic> mutant cells was the loss of the basal localization of its intracellular binding partner, Dys (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A available online). We therefore conclude that Dg is dispensable for epithelial polarity, since the apical, subapical (adherens junctions), lateral, and basal cortical domains form normally in its absence.</p><p>Since previous analysis of <italic>Dg</italic> deletion mutants showed a defect in maintaining the early polarization of the oocyte, we studied the effect of <italic>Dg<sup>O43</sup></italic> and <italic>Dg<sup>O86</sup></italic> in the germline. Polarization of the oocyte during early oogenesis employs many of the same factors used in the establishment of epithelial polarity, such as members of the Par family (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Huynh and St. Johnston, 2004</xref>). This polarization is marked by the recruitment of microtubule minus ends to the posterior pole, allowing the accumulation of oocyte determinants, such as the RNA-binding protein Orb via minus end-directed transport. The oocyte also undergoes a repolarization of its cortical domains and cytoskeleton during midoogenesis to define the anterior-posterior axis of the future embryo. Germline clones for the null <italic>Dg</italic> alleles were generated and stained for Orb as an oocyte polarization marker. All mutant clones of the appropriate stage (region 2a of the germarium to stage 4, n &#x0003d; 36) showed a normal localization of Orb, and were indistinguishable from wild-type germline cysts (n &#x0003d; 18), indicating that <italic>Dg</italic> is not required for the early polarization and the differentiation of the oocyte (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>F). Furthermore, <italic>Dg</italic> null egg chambers repolarize their oocytes at stage 7 and continue to develop normally throughout the rest of oogenesis (data not shown). Thus, Dg is not required for polarity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Dg and Dys Are Required for Basal Planar Cell Polarity</title><p>Whereas the above-described results clearly show that null <italic>Dg</italic> alleles do not affect either epithelial or oocyte polarity, the mutations do exhibit an oogenesis defect. Females homozygous or transheterozygous for the <italic>Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> alleles lay eggs that are shorter and rounder than wild-type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B). This phenotype is completely penetrant, although some differences in expressivity are observed. Despite this difference in shape, the majority of eggs hatch, and the resulting larvae develop into viable, fertile adults (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>). This defect reflects a somatic requirement for <italic>Dg</italic>, since germline clones of either <italic>Dg<sup>O43</sup></italic> or <italic>Dg<sup>O86</sup></italic> produce eggs of wild-type shape (data not shown). The short-egg phenotype produced by <italic>Dg</italic> mutants is similar to, albeit weaker than, that produced by the mutations in <italic>dLar</italic> and <italic>kugelei</italic>, which disrupt the planar organization of basal actin stress fibers in the follicle cells (<xref rid="bib16 bib14 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Gutzeit et&#x000a0;al., 1991; Frydman and Spradling, 2001; Bateman et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). The stress fibers in wild-type follicle cells are arranged in parallel arrays around the dorsal-ventral axis of the egg chamber from stage 6 of oogenesis onward (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>E). This circumferential organization of the stress fibers over the entire follicular epithelium is thought to constrain the lateral growth of the oocyte, so that it extends along the anterior-posterior axis to give rise to the final elongated shape of the egg. As reported previously for the <italic>Dg</italic> deletion alleles (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> mutant ovaries show a defect in the organization of the actin stress fibers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>F). The stress fibers are still properly assembled in mutant follicle cells, but they do not align along the dorsal-ventral axis, and they sometimes show a mixed orientation within a single cell. This function of <italic>Dg</italic> is cell autonomous, since heterozygous cells adjacent to a mutant clone adopt the normal stress fiber orientation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>G and 2H).</p><p>As the canonical link between Dg and the actin cytoskeleton is through the cytoplasmic protein Dys, we tested whether the latter was also required for egg shape and basal stress fiber organization. As has been shown previously, the small deficiency <italic>Df(3R)Exel6184</italic> deletes the entire <italic>dys</italic> gene as well as several other predicted genes, and, consistent with this, Dys protein is not detected in follicle cells homozygous for this deficiency (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>B). The deficiency is viable as a homozygote, and the eggs laid by homozygous females are short and round, like those laid by <italic>Dg</italic> mutant females (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C). The same phenotype is observed in females carrying the <italic>Df(3R)Exel6184</italic> chromosome in <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>dys<sup>E17</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). This allele, which behaves genetically as a null in all tests, is associated with a nonsense mutation (Q2807STOP in isoform Dys-PA) that truncates the protein just before the WW domain that mediates the interaction between Dys and Dg. Mosaic analysis of <italic>dys</italic> mutant cells shows a similar cell-autonomous defect in the orientation of the actin stress fibers in the follicle cells (data not shown). Thus, both Dg and Dys are required for the planar polarity of the basal stress fibers in follicle cells, and this probably accounts for the egg-shape phenotype observed in <italic>Dg</italic> and <italic>dys</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Simultaneous Loss of <italic>Dg</italic> and <italic>mRpL34</italic> Produces a Synthetic Polarity Phenotype</title><p>Nonsense mutations in Dg, such as <italic>Dg<sup>O43</sup></italic> and <italic>Dg<sup>O86</sup></italic>, are semiviable, which raises the question of why the deletion alleles, which only remove sequences upstream of the coding region, are lethal. We have previously reported that <italic>Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> homozygotes have reduced viability, but are invariably recovered at 30%&#x02013;50% of the expected frequency (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>) (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Christoforou et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). This is not due to a maternal effect, since mutant larvae derived from <italic>Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> mutant mothers crossed to <italic>Dg<sup>O</sup>/CyO-GFP</italic> males show a similar viability (data not shown). Interestingly, when the <italic>Dg</italic><sup>O</sup> mutant larvae are reared separately from their <italic>Dg</italic><sup>O</sup><italic>/CyO-GFP</italic> siblings at low density, the viability of the mutant larvae improves to &#x0003e;90% of what is expected (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S3</xref>). This result shows that the reduced viability that has been previously reported is not due to the loss of <italic>Dg</italic> function per se, but rather to the competition between the mutant larvae and their wild-type siblings. Thus, complete loss of <italic>Dg</italic> is not lethal under favorable conditions, but does affect viability under conditions of stress.</p><p>The lethality associated with the <italic>Dg</italic> deletion alleles is linked to the <italic>Dg</italic> locus, as both alleles are completely lethal in <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>Df(2R)ED2457</italic>. Consistent with the results reported previously (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), this lethality is not associated with either of the two genes, <italic>CG8414</italic> or <italic>Rho1</italic>, that lie immediately upstream of <italic>Dg</italic>, because both deletion alleles are fully viable in <italic>trans</italic> to null alleles in <italic>CG8414</italic> or to a deletion allele of <italic>Rho1</italic>. Nor is the lethality due to the <italic>Dg</italic> locus itself, as the <italic>Dg</italic> deletion alleles are fully viable in <italic>trans</italic> to any of the <italic>Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> alleles (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S4</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Dg<sup>248</sup>/Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> and <italic>Dg<sup>323</sup>/Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> transheterozygotes survive better than <italic>Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> transheterozygotes, indicating that the deletion alleles are hypomorphs. This conclusion is supported by the severity of the crossvein phenotype observed in <italic>Dg<sup>248</sup>/Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> and <italic>Dg<sup>323</sup>/Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> transheterozygotes. The <italic>Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> alleles mainly produce a &#x0201c;detached&#x0201d; posterior crossvein phenotype in which the crossvein fails to join with either the L4 or L5 longitudinal vein (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Christoforou et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Dg<sup>248</sup>/Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> and <italic>Dg<sup>323</sup>/Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> transheterozygotes, the crossvein phenotype is weaker than in any <italic>Dg<sup>O</sup></italic> allele heteroallelic combination, showing more &#x0201c;complete&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;gapped&#x0201d; phenotypes (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). Thus, both in terms of viability and crossvein phenotype, the <italic>Dg</italic> deletion alleles are hypomorphic, in contrast to a previous report that they are protein nulls (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>As the lethality associated with the <italic>Dg</italic> deletion alleles is not due to any of the previously identified genes in the region, we re-examined the annotation of this genomic region and found an additional gene between <italic>Dg</italic> and <italic>CG8414</italic> in recent releases, the mitochondrial ribosomal protein <italic>mRpL34</italic>. Both deletion alleles affect this gene: <italic>Dg<sup>248</sup></italic> deletes sequence up to the start codon, and <italic>Dg<sup>323</sup></italic> removes more than half of the <italic>mRpL34</italic> coding sequence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;3</xref>A and 3B). To determine whether <italic>mRpL34</italic> is associated with the lethality of the <italic>Dg</italic> deletion alleles, we generated a genomic rescue construct spanning the sequence from the first noncoding exon of <italic>Dg</italic> and extending to the coding sequence of CG8414 and thus including the entire <italic>mRpL34</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B). One copy of this transgene completely rescues the lethality and sterility of <italic>Dg<sup>323</sup>/Dg<sup>248</sup></italic> transheterozygotes and hemizygotes of either allele (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S5</xref>). Consistent with the role for <italic>Dg</italic> in crossvein patterning and egg shape, the rescued flies show mild crossvein defects, and the mutant females lay short, round eggs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>; data not shown). Thus, the lethality of the <italic>Dg</italic> deletion alleles is not due to <italic>Dg</italic>, but rather to disruption of the adjacent <italic>mRpL34</italic> gene.</p><p>Since the lethality and sterility of <italic>Dg<sup>248</sup></italic> and <italic>Dg<sup>323</sup></italic> alleles are due to the deletion of <italic>mRpL34</italic>, we asked whether the latter gene could explain the polarity defects associated with these alleles. As previously reported, follicle cell clones mutant for <italic>Dg<sup>248</sup></italic> exhibit a polarity phenotype. In these cells, cortical markers of the apical (aPKC) and lateral (Dlg) domains are no longer detected in most of the clones (70%, n &#x0003d; 20) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). One copy of the <italic>mRpL34</italic> transgene rescues this phenotype completely (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D). This result was surprising since it has been reported that expression of a Dg transgene also rescues the <italic>Dg<sup>248</sup></italic> polarity phenotype (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Yatsenko et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).

Interestingly, we and others have recently shown that the LKB1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are specifically required to establish and maintain epithelial polarity under conditions of energetic stress, indicating that epithelia are polarized by a different mechanism when cellular ATP levels are low (<xref rid="bib29 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Mirouse et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). The loss of <italic>mRpL34</italic> is likely to disrupt mitochondrial function, including the production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. In support of this view, <italic>Dg<sup>248</sup></italic> mutant follicle cells show an increased level of AMPK phosphorylation on T184, which is a marker for the&#x000a0;high&#x000a0;levels of AMP that are produced when ATP levels are low (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>C). This raises the possibility that Dg is also specifically required to maintain epithelial polarity under low-energy conditions.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we generated <italic>Dg<sup>O43</sup></italic> or <italic>Dg<sup>O86</sup></italic> follicle cell clones in flies that were subjected to energetic stress by culturing them on sugar-free food (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mirouse et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Under these conditions, the mutant follicle cells show a fully penetrant polarity phenotype at all stages of oogenesis. Crb and aPKC are lost from the apical membrane domain, indicating that the two major apical complexes, aPKC/PAR6 and Crb/Patj/Sdt, are affected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B). Surprisingly, Patj is still properly localized in small mutant clones, suggesting that the mutant cells maintain some characteristics of an apical domain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D). A more severe polarity phenotype is observed in larger clones, in which the cells round up and apical Patj disappears (data not shown). The lateral marker Dlg is also lost from the cortex of all <italic>Dg</italic> mutant follicle cells under energetic stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). In addition, these cells show an upregulation of Arm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C), a phenotype that appears to be specific for this component of the adherens junction, as the expression levels of both DE- and DN-Cadherins are normal (data not shown). Finally, <italic>Dg</italic> loss of function causes a marked decrease in the density of basal actin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>E). However, <italic>Dg</italic> mutant clones have no effect on the deposition of Pcan on the adjacent basement membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>E). <italic>Dg</italic> mutant cell clones disrupt the organization of the epithelium and frequently round up to form multiple layers, indicating a complete loss of epithelial architecture (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>F).</p><p>By contrast to its function in epithelial cells, the removal of Dg from the germline under conditions of energetic stress has no effect on the polarization and subsequent maintenance of the oocyte in the germarium or on the repolarization of the oocyte during stages 7&#x02013;9 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>D; data not shown). Thus, Dg is required to establish and maintain epithelial polarity under low-energy conditions, but is dispensable for polarity in the germline.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Dg Induces Myosin II Activation Independently of AMPK</title><p>The polarity phenotype observed in <italic>Dg</italic> mutant cells under energetic stress is very similar to that observed in <italic>lkb1</italic> or <italic>ampk&#x003b1;</italic> mutant cells under the same conditions (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mirouse et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). AMPK acts as a cellular energy sensor because its activation requires the binding of AMP, which is generated as the cell uses up its supplies of ATP. This results in a conformational change that allows LKB1 to phosphorylate the activation loop of AMPK on T184 (T172 in human) to turn on its kinase activity (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lizcano et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Since T184 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient for the activation of AMPK in&#x000a0;vitro and in&#x000a0;vivo, the level of this phosphorylation is therefore an excellent readout for AMPK activity. <italic>Dg</italic> null mutant follicle cell clones under energetic stress show the same level of Phospho-T184 staining as wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A). Thus, Dg is not required for AMPK activation and must function either downstream or in parallel to the LKB1/AMPK pathway.</p><p>An essential function of AMPK in epithelial polarity is to phosphorylate the Myosin Regulatory Light Chain II (MRLCII), called Spaghetti Squash (Sqh) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and thereby activate Myosin II (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). We therefore tested whether <italic>Dg</italic> mutants affect the phosphorylation of Sqh under conditions of energetic stress. PhosphoS21-Sqh (corresponding to S19 in mammalian MRLCII) is mainly apical in early stages in wild-type follicle cells on sugar-free food, but it accumulates on both the apical and basal domains in later stages. By contrast, <italic>Dg</italic> mutant cells lack staining for pS21-Sqh (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B). This result indicates that Dg, like AMPK, is required for the activation of Myosin II under energetic stress.</p><p>A phosphomimetic form of MRLCII rescues the starvation-dependent polarity phenotype of <italic>ampk&#x003b1;</italic> mutants, indicating that the only function of AMPK in polarity is to activate Myosin II (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). To investigate further how Dg fits into this low-energy polarity pathway, we asked whether phosphomimetic forms of either AMPK or Sqh proteins could rescue the phenotype of <italic>Dg</italic> mutant cells under low-energy conditions. Neither AMPK-T184D nor Sqh-E20E21 rescue Dlg and aPKC localization or the organization of F-actin in <italic>Dg</italic> mutant follicle cells under energetic stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>C and 5D; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>E). Since phosphomimetic Sqh is not sufficient to rescue the polarity of <italic>Dg</italic> mutant cells under low-energy conditions, Dg must have another function, in addition to the activation of Myosin II. We therefore tested whether Dg could also influence Myosin II localization itself. In early stages, Sqh and Myosin II Heavy Chain are enriched at the apical side of the follicle cells. However, in <italic>Dg</italic> mutant cells under energetic stress, both proteins are mainly localized to the basal side and the apical enrichment is usually lost (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>E and 5F). Thus, Dg is required both for the activation and localization of Myosin II in starved follicle cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Pcan, But Not Dys, Is Required for Apical-Basal Polarity under Energetic Stress</title><p>Since the primary target of Dg in the cytoplasm is the Dys protein, we tested whether the latter was also involved in epithelial polarity under energetic stress conditions. Follicle cells mutant for null alleles of <italic>dys</italic> show a wild-type localization of all of the polarity markers we examined, including Dg, both under normal conditions and during energetic stress (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A&#x02013;6D). The function of Dg in establishing and maintaining apical-basal polarity is therefore independent of Dys.</p><p>It has been proposed previously that the function of Dg in epithelial polarity required its interaction with Pcan in the ECM, since <italic>pcan<sup>null</sup></italic> mutant follicle cells lose their polarity (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). We tested for a requirement of Pcan in follicle cells under normal and energetic stress conditions by using the same null allele as the previous study. On standard food, epithelial polarity was completely normal, even when the <italic>pcan<sup>null</sup></italic> mutant clones encompassed the entire egg chamber (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>E, 6G, and 6I; data not shown). By contrast, <italic>pcan</italic> mutant follicle cells lose polarity under energetic stress. The apical and lateral determinants, aPKC and Dlg, are mislocalized, Arm is overexpressed, and there is a decrease in the density of basal F-actin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>F, 6H, and 6J). Furthermore, Sqh is not phosphorylated in starved <italic>pcan</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>J). This phenotype is fully penetrant, regardless of the size of the clone, and is identical to that observed in <italic>Dg</italic> mutant cells. Thus, Pcan is required to maintain epithelial polarity when cells are under energetic stress, strongly suggesting that it acts upstream of Dg as a ligand.</p><p>Dg protein itself is strongly overexpressed in <italic>pcan</italic> mutant cells&#x000a0;under energetic stress and tends to localize all around the cortex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>H), a phenotype that is also observed in <italic>lkb1</italic> and <italic>ampk&#x003b1;</italic> mutant follicle cells. This suggests the existence of a negative-feedback loop, in which the Dg-dependent activation of Myosin&#x000a0;II reduces Dg protein levels and limits its localization to the basal domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report that clones of <italic>Dg</italic> null mutations have no effect on apical-basal polarity under normal conditions, but disrupt the planar cell polarity (pcp) of the basal actin stress fibers. The loss of this organization allows the oocyte to grow in all directions, leading the short, round-egg phenotype of <italic>Dg</italic> null homozygotes. A very similar phenotype is seen in mutants in the receptor tyrosine phosphatase DLar and in the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits of integrin (<xref rid="bib14 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Frydman and Spradling, 2001; Bateman et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). Since DLar and integrins are also receptors for the components of the ECM, three different ECM receptors are required nonredundantly for the pcp of the actin stress fibers. However, mutants in <italic>Dg</italic>, <italic>dys</italic>, and <italic>DLar</italic> have no effect on other well-characterized examples of pcp in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, such as the orientation of the apical trichomes on the wing blade. This indicates that pcp on the basal side of the cell has different requirements than apical pcp, and it would therefore be interesting to examine whether the classical pcp pathways that regulate apical planar polarity are involved in the orientation of the basal actin stress fibers.</p><p>A newly identified null allele in <italic>dys</italic> also gives rise to short, round eggs and causes an identical defect in the orientation of the basal actin stress fibers. Since Dys binds to the intracellular domain of Dg and to F-actin, it may provide a direct link between the two to transmit the planar polarity of the ECM to the basal stress fibers. Dg and Dys also function as links between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton in muscle cells, where they play an important role in allowing the cell surface to withstand the mechanical forces caused by contraction, thereby preventing muscular dystrophy (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ervasti and Sonnemann, 2008</xref>). Our results in epithelial cells indicate that the DAPC does more than just create a physical link between the ECM and actin, raising the possibility that it also plays a role in organizing the cortical actin network in muscle.</p><p>Our data contradict previous reports that Dg is required for the apical-basal polarity of epithelial cells and for the initial anterior-posterior polarity of the oocyte (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that we used null alleles of Dg, whereas the earlier studies used deletions in the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>Dg</italic> locus that also remove <italic>mRpL34</italic>, an essential gene that encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein. More importantly, the apical-basal polarity defects of the <italic>Dg</italic> deletion alleles can be rescued by transgenes expressing either mRpL34 or Dg, indicating that this phenotype is caused by the concomitant loss of both genes. Furthermore, the nonsense alleles of <italic>Dg</italic> give an identical polarity phenotype to the deletion alleles when the flies are cultured on food without glucose. Thus, Dg is required for epithelial polarity only under conditions of energetic stress, and the Dg deletion alleles give a polarity phenotype under normal conditions, because the loss of mRpL34 disrupts mitochondrial function, thereby reducing cellular energy.</p><p>Although the energetic stress caused by disruption of <italic>mRpL34</italic> can explain the epithelial polarity phenotypes of the <italic>Dg</italic> deletion alleles, the <italic>Dg</italic> nonsense mutations have no effect on oocyte polarity even in starved flies. The early defects in oocyte polarity observed with the deletion alleles may therefore be due to loss of <italic>mRpL34</italic> alone. It has also been reported that loss of <italic>pcan</italic> disrupts epithelial polarity and the basal localization of Dg under normal conditions (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Using the same allele, we found that <italic>pcan</italic> null clones show normal apical-basal polarity on standard food, but show similar polarity defects to <italic>Dg</italic> mutants under energetic stress conditions, and this discrepancy may be due to differences in fly food composition in different laboratories.</p><p>Like Dg and Pcan, LKB1 and AMPK are only required for epithelial polarity under conditions of energetic stress (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mirouse et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, the polarity phenotype of <italic>Dg</italic> or <italic>pcan</italic> mutant clones is indistinguishable from that of <italic>ampk</italic> and <italic>lkb1</italic> mutants under glucose starvation. Apical (Crb, aPKC) and lateral (Dlg) markers are no longer localized at the cortex, whereas markers for the adherens junctions (Arm, DECad) are more stable, but eventually disappear in large mutant clones. Interestingly, the Crb complex component Patj remains apically localized in small mutant clones like the adherens junctions components. Since all other apical markers are disrupted, Patj cannot be targeted apically solely through its interaction with Sdt and Crb, suggesting that it may also interact with junctional proteins. This is consistent with the observation that Patj is still properly localized in <italic>crb</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tanentzapf et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Starved <italic>Dg</italic> and <italic>pcan</italic> mutant clones do not accumulate phosphorylated Sqh and show a reduction of basal actin and an increase in apical actin, just like <italic>ampk</italic> and <italic>lkb1</italic> clones. As well as these polarity phenotypes, mutations in all four proteins upregulate Arm under conditions of energetic stress, whereas starved <italic>pcan</italic>, <italic>ampk</italic>, and <italic>lkb1</italic> clones show a dramatic increase in Dg levels. Thus, mutants in these proteins have no effect on polarity under normal conditions and cause the same spectrum of phenotypes under conditions of energetic stress, strongly suggesting that they are all essential components of a low-energy polarity pathway (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>).</p><p>The principal function of LKB1 and AMPK in epithelial polarity under low-energy conditions is to activate Myosin II through the direct phosphorylation of its regulatory light chain, Sqh, by AMPK, since a phosphomimetic form of Sqh rescues all of the polarity defects of starved <italic>ampk</italic> or <italic>lkb1</italic> null cells (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Our results show that Pcan and Dg are also required for the activation of Myosin II under conditions of energetic stress, but their polarity phenotypes cannot be rescued by the constitutively active forms of either AMPK or Sqh. This leads to two important conclusions. First, Pcan and Dg are not required for the activation of AMPK, and the loss of localized, phosphorylated Sqh must therefore be due to some other defect. Second, the failure of phosphomimetic Sqh to rescue the polarity defects of starved <italic>Dg</italic> clones indicates that Dg must have another function in addition to its role in Myosin activation.</p><p>Sqh is mislocalized to the basal cortex of starved <italic>Dg</italic> clones, and this could account for both the failure of AMPK to phosphorylate it and the inability of phosphomimetic Sqh to rescue the polarity phenotype. Phospho-AMPK is uniformly distributed, however, and should be able to phosphorylate Sqh anywhere in the cell. In addition, Sqh and the Myosin II heavy chain still colocalize in <italic>Dg</italic> mutant cells, strongly suggesting that the lack of rescue by phosphomimetic Sqh is not caused by its failure to interact with and activate the heavy chain. An alternative possibility is that loss of <italic>Dg</italic> disrupts Myosin activation and localization indirectly, perhaps by altering the arrangement of F-actin. Phosphomimetic Sqh does not rescue normal actin organization in starved <italic>Dg</italic> clones, demonstrating that this phenotype is not caused solely by the loss of Myosin activity, and this suggests that Dg plays a myosin-independent role in the polarized organization of the actin cytoskeleton. If Myosin II activation is regulated by its actin-dependent localization and/or its binding to actin, the failure to phosphorylate Sqh in <italic>Dg</italic> clones could be a secondary consequence of a polarity defect that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>LKB1 or AMPK activation, glucose deprivation, or the expression of phosphomimetic Sqh are sufficient to induce apical-basal polarity in isolated human intestinal cells in culture, indicating that this pathway is conserved in humans (<xref rid="bib25 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Baas et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). In order to polarize single cells de novo, there must be a polarity cue that provides the positional information to generate cellular asymmetries. This cannot be provided by LKB1 or AMPK, since activated P-AMPK is not spatially restricted, and its function can be bypassed by providing a constitutively active myosin (<xref rid="bib29 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Mirouse et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Cell-cell adhesion is also unlikely to act as the polarity cue, because the low-energy pathway can polarize single mammalian cells in culture in the absence of any contacts with their neighbors. The only remaining asymmetry under these conditions is cell adhesion to the ECM on the substrate. Since Pcan is a component of the basal ECM and Dg is an ECM receptor, and they are both required for polarity under energetic stress, it is attractive to propose that the adhesion of Pcan to Dg provides the basal cue for epithelial polarity under low-energy conditions.</p><p>In all organisms, the intracellular domain of Dg has two conserved features: a WW domain-binding motif that interacts with Dys, and a PXXP motif that can function as a SH3 domain-binding site. A null mutant in the single Dys/Utrophin homolog in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome has no effect on epithelial organization under low-energy conditions, suggesting that Dg does not regulate polarity through binding to Dys. In support of this view, the overexpression of full-length Dg or Dg with a mutated Dys-binding domain disrupts follicle cell polarity, whereas a construct that lacks the SH3 domain-binding site does not (<xref rid="bib39 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Yatsenko et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it seems most likely that the binding of Pcan to Dg controls epithelial polarity under low-energy conditions by signaling through the SH3-binding domain, and it will be important to identify the SH3 protein responsible.</p><p>LKB1 is mutated in both familial and spontaneous tumors of epithelial origin, suggesting that disruption of the low-energy polarity pathway may play a role in tumor progression (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alessi et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Most tumor cells undergo a metabolic switch, called the Warburg effect, in which they take up about five times more glucose than normal cells because they are generating ATP from glycolysis, which is much less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brahimi-Horn et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, tumor cells often have reduced access to nutrients and oxygen as the tumor outgrows the local blood supply. Thus, the cells are likely to be subjected to energetic stress, both because they are inefficient at generating ATP and because they are hypoxic. In this context, it is interesting to note that Dg is downregulated in a wide variety of tumors, with low levels of expression correlating with a poor prognosis (<xref rid="bib18 bib27 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Henry et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Losasso et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Sgambato et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, when Dg is reintroduced into breast cancer cell lines that no longer express it, it restores epithelial polarity and reduces tumorogenicity (<xref rid="bib30 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Muschler et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Sgambato et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). These results suggest that Dg is required to maintain epithelial organization in tumor cells under energetic stress, and that its downregulation leads to overproliferation and a loss of polarity that contribute to metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Strains</title><p>The <italic>Dg</italic> alleles have been described previously (<xref rid="bib8 bib6" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Christoforou et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).

This is compensated for by the activation of AMPK, which activates Myosin II. Myosin II is required for the proper establishment and maintenance of the cortical epithelial domains. Dg is also required for Myosin II activation and localization. However, Dg has an additional function, probably acting as a polarity cue via its interaction with the basement membrane protein Pcan. In turn, establishment of epithelial polarity restricts Dg localization to the basal domain.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig></floats-wrap></article>
