However, many important features of this system, including the prevalence of polyadenylated mRNAs in the bacterium, are still poorly understood. By comparing the transcriptomes of wild-type and <italic>pcnB</italic> deletion strains using macroarray analysis, we demonstrate that &#x0003e;90% of <italic>E.coli</italic> open reading frames (ORFs) transcribed during exponential growth undergo some degree of polyadenylation by PAP I, either as full-length transcripts or decay intermediates. Detailed analysis of over 240 transcripts suggests that Rho-independent transcription terminators serve as polyadenylation signals. Conversely, mRNAs terminated in a Rho-dependent fashion are probably not substrates for PAP I, but can be modified by the addition of long polynucleotide tails through the biosynthetic activity of polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis indicates that the extent of polyadenylation of individual full-length transcripts such as <italic>lpp</italic> and <italic>ompA</italic> varies significantly in wild-type cells. The data presented here demonstrates that polyadenylation in <italic>E.coli</italic> occurs much more frequently than previously envisioned.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Since the identification of the structural gene for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> poly(A) polymerase I (PAP I) in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), a variety of experiments have shown that polyadenylation plays an integral role in <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Specifically, the deletion of the structural gene for PAP I (<italic>pcnB</italic>) leads to a 90% reduction in poly(A) levels along with increased mRNA half-lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Conversely, overproduction of PAP I significantly reduces mRNA stability and leads to inviability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Furthermore, polyadenylation in <italic>E.coli</italic> has been implicated in the general RNA quality control of transcripts, helping to remove defective RNAs and stable breakdown products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). However, unlike in eukaryotes, the importance of polyadenylation in <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA metabolism has often been downplayed because it is believed that only a limited number of mRNAs are post-transcriptionally modified. For example, although it is estimated that between 3200 and 3300/4290 genes in <italic>E.coli</italic> are expressed in exponentially growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), only a few mRNAs have been directly shown to be polyadenylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>A further complication in understanding prokaryotic polyadenylation has been the observation that while polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), a 3&#x02032; &#x02192; 5&#x02032; exonuclease, plays an important role in mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), it also functions biosynthetically <italic>in vivo</italic> to add heteropolymeric tails to the 3&#x02032; ends of RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In fact, PNPase seems to function as the primary mechanism for the post-transcriptional modification of mRNAs in a variety of prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> PAP I synthesized tails exclusively contain A residues and have been found either after Rho-independent transcription terminators or attached to mRNA decay products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In contrast, PNPase synthesized tails are primarily heteropolymeric (they contain all 4 nt but are &#x0223c;50% A) and are usually distributed throughout the coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>In order to obtain a better overview of the extent and significance of post-transcriptional modification of <italic>E.coli</italic> mRNAs, we have carried out a genome-wide analysis to identify polyadenylation targets. We show here that &#x0223c;90% of the ORFs transcribed in exponentially growing cells undergo some degree of polyadenylation. Specific array results were confirmed by a combination of northern blot analysis, kinetic RT&#x02013;PCR, real-time PCR, and cDNA cloning and sequencing. The data strongly suggest that Rho-independent transcription terminators serve as polyadenylation signals not only for the ORF immediately upstream, but in the case of polycistronic transcripts for all ORFs within the transcription unit. In contrast, operons that are terminated in a Rho-dependent fashion appear to be preferentially modified by PNPase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>The <italic>E.coli</italic> strains used in this study were all derived from MG1693 (<italic>thyA715 rph-1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).

When appropriate, chloramphenicol (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) was added to the medium. Expression of the <italic>pcnB</italic> gene in SK9124 was induced with IPTG (350 &#x003bc;mol) as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The optical density of the cultures was measure using a Klett-Summerson colorimeter with a green filter (No. 42). Total RNA was isolated from cells grown to 50 Klett units above background (&#x0223c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml) as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). All RNA preparations were further treated with DNase I using the DNA-free&#x02122; kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) to remove any possible DNA contamination.</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA labeling</title><p><sup>33</sup>P-labeled strippable cDNAs were prepared using the Endo-Free&#x02122; RT kit (Ambion) as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub> and gene-specific primers (GSPs) (Sigma-Genosys, The Woodlands, TX, USA) were used to generate cDNAs to identify and estimate polyadenylated and steady-state mRNA levels, respectively. Initial reverse transcriptions of total RNA from the wild-type (MG1693) and the <italic>&#x00394;pcnB</italic> (SK7988) strains using oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub> primers generated almost identical amounts of cDNAs, as estimated by liquid scintillation counting. This was surprising since a <italic>pcnB</italic> deletion strain has been shown to have only 10% of the wild-type poly(A) level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In addition, hybridization of these cDNAs to Panorama <italic>E.coli</italic> macroarrays yielded almost identical hybridization patterns (data not shown), indicating a significant level of non-specific cDNA synthesis.</p><p>Accordingly, the total RNA (20 &#x003bc;g) were first passed through Dynabeads (Dynabeads<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> mRNA direct&#x02122; kit, Dynal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) [oligo(dT)<sub>25</sub>] to not only enrich for polyadenylated RNAs but also to eliminate RNAs that might serve as non-specific primers prior to reverse transcription with oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub> primers. Based on liquid scintillation counting, the amount of labeled cDNA increased 3-fold in the wild-type strain (MG1693) and 30-fold in the PAP I-induced strain (SK9124 [pBMK11(<italic>pcnB</italic><sup>+</sup>)]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) compared to the <italic>&#x00394;pcnB</italic> mutant (SK7988). These cDNAs were further analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel that showed no difference in the cDNA profiles obtained with RNA from SK7988 in presence or absence of the oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub> primer (Supplementary Figure S1, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the amount of cDNAs of various lengths were increased significantly in both MG1693 (Supplementary Figure S1, lane 3) and SK9124 (Supplementary Figure S1, lane 4).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA array experiments</title><p>Panorama <italic>E.coli</italic> macroarrays (Sigma-Genosys) were used to compare the relative polyadenylated and steady-state mRNA levels in various genetic backgrounds. Membranes were hybridized to the respective cDNAs, washed, and exposed on the same PhosphorImager screen as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The membranes hybridized with poly(A)-enriched cDNAs were exposed for 120 h and the membranes hybridized with cDNAs obtained using GSPs were exposed for 24 h. The exposed screens were scanned at a pixel density of 88 &#x003bc;m using a Storm 840 series, Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Each membrane was used up to six times following stripping of the previously hybridized probe using the Strip-EZ&#x02122; RT kit (Ambion) as per the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Background subtraction</title><p>In typical macroarray experiments comparing the steady-state mRNA levels, the pixel counts of a particular gene not expressed under the experimental conditions employed are considered as background and subtracted from the pixel counts of the rest of the genes to obtain net expression. However, since <italic>E.coli</italic> contains an A/T rich genome, we were concerned about potential nonspecific priming employing short encoded poly(A) tracts and long A/G regions, which are relatively numerous in the organism. To asses the significance of these technical problems, we first carried out a search for internal poly(A) tracts of 9 nt or longer within the <italic>E.coli</italic> genome using GCG's FIND PATTERNS program. This number was chosen because internal poly(A) tracts of &#x0003c;9 nt would not serve efficiently as templates under the experimental conditions employed for the reverse transcription reactions. Our search identified fewer than 100 such sequences (data not shown). In order to deal with the issue of non-specific priming at long A/G tracts, we attempted to identify a transcript to use for background subtraction that was actively transcribed, was not post-transcriptionally modified (either by PAP I or PNPase) in the wild-type strain, and contained an extensive A/G tract.</p><p>We chose the <italic>rplY</italic> mRNA, which contains a long A/G track [21/26 nt, AGGAAUUAAUUUAA<bold>GAGAG</bold>AAAGAA<underline>AUG</underline>, the translation initiation codon (underlined) and the potential ribosome binding site (bold) are &#x0223c;100 nt downstream of a promoter like sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>)] immediately upstream of the AUG start codon that could serve as a template for oligo(dT) primed reverse transcription. In addition, the stability of this transcript was not affected in the absence of either PNPase or RNase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), indicating that it was probably not degraded through a poly(A)-dependent decay pathway. To test these assumptions directly, we used RT&#x02013;PCR to clone oligo(dT)<sub>17</sub>-primed <italic>rplY</italic> cDNAs from either MG1693 or SK9124. Subsequent DNA sequencing demonstrated that while the 3&#x02032; ends of all of the cDNAs contained 14&#x02013;18 nt of contiguous A residues, they were located primarily within the A/G region immediately upstream of the AUG start codon that might have been generated through non-specific priming to oligo(dT)<sub>17</sub> (data not shown). Based on these observations, we used the average pixel count of the <italic>rplY</italic> spots that hybridized to oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub> derived cDNAs for background subtraction in each array.</p></sec><sec><title>Data processing and analysis</title><p>The analysis of the PhosphorImager files and data processing were carried out using Array Vision, version 5.1 (Imaging Research Inc., St Catharines, Ontario, Canada) and Excel, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In brief, relative mRNA abundance (either polyadenylated or steady-state level) for each ORF in each strain was obtained from two replicate experiments providing a total of four determinations. The average values of the four determinations for each ORF were considered as its expression level. The pixel density of the <italic>rplY</italic> mRNA was used as the background hybridization level for oligo(dT)-dependent cDNA hybridization. For the GSP-dependent cDNA hybridization, the pixel value for the <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA was used for background subtraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). A <italic>t</italic>-test was applied to determine the consistency of the ratios across replicate hybridizations. At least a 2-fold change in the spot intensities with a <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x02264;0.05 (95% probability) was considered significant and reported in this investigation. As a means of examining the experimental variability between the biological replications, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient for each of the strains, which varied between 0.92 and 0.96.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Rho-independent transcription terminators</title><p>The presence of a Rho-independent transcription terminator was determined manually by identifying predicted secondary structures within no more than 80 nt downstream from the 3&#x02032; ends of annotated transcription units following the criteria of Lesnik <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Dot-blot and northern analysis</title><p>Dot-blots were performed to compare the total <italic>in vivo</italic> poly(A) level as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).

The AP primed cDNAs from the wild-type (MG1693) and PAP I-induced (SK9124) strains were amplified using 5&#x02032; GSPs (RPSO185A for <italic>rpsO</italic>, CSPA90 for <italic>cspA</italic>, CSPC-5&#x02032; for <italic>cspC</italic>, and CSPE744 for <italic>cspE</italic>, 5&#x02032; end-labeled) and AAP (3&#x02032; primer) for either 6, 12 and 18 cycles for <italic>rpsO</italic> and <italic>cspC</italic> or 10, 20 and 30 cycles for <italic>cspA</italic> and <italic>cspE</italic> cDNA. Two microlitre of each PCR mixture were separated on a 1.5&#x02013;2% agarose gel, dried and the amplification products were quantified using a PhosphoImager and ImageQuant software. The fold-change in the polyadenylated transcript levels represents the highest ratio of pixel counts for the amplification products from the PAP I induced strain versus the wild-type control.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>Real-time PCR was used to quantitate the extent of full-length mRNA polyadenylation for the <italic>lpp</italic>, <italic>ompA</italic>, <italic>yjgG</italic> and <italic>ymgC</italic> mRNAs in an AB7500 real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the comparative C<sub>T</sub> (&#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T</sub>) method as described by the manufacturer. All cDNAs for real-time PCR were generated using either the Endo-free&#x02122; RT kit (Ambion) or Superscript&#x02122; III reverse transcriptase at 48&#x000b0;C. Only 95&#x02013;100 nt of the 3&#x02032; end of each cDNA were amplified to permit effective PCR using either the SYBR Green<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> I reagent (<italic>ompA</italic>, <italic>yjgG</italic>, ymgC) or custom TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> gene expression assays as specified by the manufacturer.

While PAP I only synthesizes homopolymeric poly(A) tails <italic>in vivo</italic>, PNPase generated tails are primarily adenosine rich heteropolymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Since both kinds of tails have been isolated using oligo(dT)-driven RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), we hypothesized that a genome-wide analysis of cDNAs generated using oligo(dT) primers would facilitate the identification of all mRNA targets that were post-transcriptionally modified by PAP I and/or PNPase. We deemed this comparison would be valid since there is only a minimal growth difference between a wild-type and PAP I deficient strains (a doubling time of 30 min in the wild-type control compared to 32 min for the PAP I mutant, data not shown).</p><p>It should also be noted that many ORFs in <italic>E.coli</italic> are synthesized as parts of polycistronic transcripts. Thus it was possible that some ORFs detected on the arrays would arise from a single polycistronic transcript that had been polyadenylated. For the analysis presented here, we have assumed that such polycistronic cDNAs constitute a very small fraction of the labeled material for the following reasons. In the first place, it is well known that polycistronic mRNAs are rapidly processed into smaller units, such that under steady-state conditions the primary polycistronic transcript makes up only a very small fraction of the total mRNA for a particular operon. In addition, since the arrays contain each full-length ORF, they will detect both full-length and decay intermediates that have been polyadenylated.</p><p>Accordingly, <italic>E.coli</italic> macroarrays (Panorama, Sigma-Genosys) were used to assay all 4290 ORFs in a wild-type strain (MG1693). In order to minimize for non-specific hybridization arising from priming in templates with long A/G rich or short internal poly(A) sequences, the average pixel counts of the <italic>rplY</italic> (encoding the ribosomal protein L25) spots was used for background subtraction (see Materials and Methods). Previous macroarray studies using <italic>E.coli</italic> GSP-dependent cDNAs have shown that &#x0223c;74&#x02013;77% (3175&#x02013;3303) of the ORFs are expressed in exponentially growing wild-type strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In our experiments, using oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub> derived cDNAs, &#x0223c;68 &#x000b1; 2% (2917 &#x000b1; 86) of all ORFs (4290) in the wild-type strain exhibited hybridization levels at least 2-fold above background, indicating that the corresponding transcripts were post-transcriptionally modified by PAP I and/or PNPase. Thus, transcripts from &#x0003e;90% of the ORFs expressed during exponential growth were post-transcriptionally modified.</p></sec><sec><title>All transcribed ORFs are polyadenylated when PAP I is overexpressed</title><p>Previously we have shown that overproduction of PAP I from a controlled expression plasmid for 15 min led to 90 &#x000b1; 10-fold increase in the total <italic>in vivo</italic> poly(A) level with no change in the cell's growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Accordingly, as a positive control, we compared the oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub> generated transcriptomes from a PAP I-induced strain (SK9124) with a wild-type strain (MG1693). As expected, the majority of the ORFs that were detected in the wild-type strain showed increased hybridization (2- to 50-fold) after PAP I induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2). In fact, the total number of ORFs that were detected increased to 77 &#x000b1; 2%, which was identical to the number of ORFs detected with GSP-dependent cDNAs in a wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Overall the hybridization intensities for the SK9124 array increased 21 &#x000b1; 0.1-fold over the wild-type (MG1693) array. The hybridization levels of &#x0223c;90% of the polyadenylated wild-type ORFs increased between 2- and 10-fold, while &#x0223c;5% of the ORFs showed an increase of 10- to 50-fold in poly(A) levels in SK9124 compared to the wild-type control. The poly(A) levels for the rest of the ORFs remained either unchanged or increased &#x0003c;2-fold above the wild-type level. Interestingly, five genes (<italic>tolA, yceO</italic>, <italic>yidJ</italic>, <italic>yicF</italic> and <italic>rfaS</italic>) showed a significant decrease in level of polyadenylated transcripts following PAP I induction.</p></sec><sec><title>PAP I is responsible for the post-transcriptional modification of the majority of <italic>E.coli</italic> mRNAs</title><p>In order to determine if PNPase played a significant role in the post-transcriptional modification of <italic>E.coli</italic> mRNAs, we hybridized an array with cDNAs obtained from a <italic>&#x00394;pcnB</italic> strain (SK7988), since PNPase is solely responsible for the post-transcriptional addition of polynucleotide tails in the absence of PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In this case, only 48 ORFs (1.1%) were detected in the <italic>pcnB</italic> deletion strain (Supplementary Table S1). The pixel counts of these ORFs were significantly above background, but were much lower (1.5- to 6.3-fold) compared to the wild-type strain. Since it was possible that these species were detected because of cDNA synthesis resulting from inefficient priming utilizing A/G rich regions or short encoded poly(A) tracts within their coding sequences, we examined these ORFs for the presence of such sequences. The longest A/G tracts that were observed varied between 5 and 13 nt. In contrast, the <italic>rplY</italic> mRNA that was used for background subtraction contained an A/G tract of 21/26 nt (see Materials and Methods). In addition, no significant internal poly(A) tracts were present in any of the 48 ORFs.</p><p>Although this observation indicated that the post-transcriptional modification of these ORFs arose through the activity of PNPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), the only common feature for the majority of these transcripts (45/48) was that they were terminated in a Rho-dependent fashion either as a monocistronic transcript or as part of a polycistronic transcript. In addition, five were <italic>IS</italic> inserts (four <italic>IS5</italic> and one <italic>IS1</italic>) and five encoded ribosomal protein genes (<italic>rplN</italic>, <italic>rplE</italic>, <italic>rplF</italic>, <italic>rpsE</italic> and <italic>rpmB</italic>). Eight of the 48 transcripts were monocistronic. At least one of the mRNAs (<italic>ompA</italic>) has also been shown to be a substrate for PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of array data</title><p>Even with the most careful experimental design and the application of rigorous statistical analysis, some of the data in a global gene expression analysis may be in error because of possible technical as well as biological problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Accordingly, we sought to validate our results by a direct comparison of the macroarray results with the published data on the polyadenylation of individual <italic>E.coli</italic> mRNAs. For example, it has been shown by cDNA sequencing that the 3&#x02032; ends of the <italic>lpp</italic>, <italic>rpsO</italic>, <italic>trxA</italic>, <italic>rpsT</italic> and <italic>rmf</italic> mRNAs are modified by either PAP I or PNPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In fact, all of these ORFs except <italic>rmf</italic> showed above background levels of hybridization in the wild-type array (MG1693). Since the <italic>rmf</italic> mRNA has been shown to only contain short (&#x0003c;6 nt) poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), the stringent enrichment for polyadenylated transcripts (see Materials and Methods) may have led to the exclusion of this ORF. Furthermore, the <italic>acnA</italic> transcript, which was shown by direct sequencing not to contain poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), was also not detected in the array probed with oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub> generated cDNAs (data not shown).</p><p>Next we compared the polyadenylation levels of selected transcripts in the wild-type and PAP I-induced strain using kinetic RT&#x02013;PCR. The increases in the level of polyadenylated transcripts for <italic>lpp</italic> (&#x0223c;11-fold) and <italic>rpsT</italic> (&#x0223c;5-fold) after PAP I induction as indicated by the macroarray data were consistent with previous RT&#x02013;PCR estimations under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Similarly, the increase in the amount of polyadenylated <italic>rpsO</italic> mRNA (ribosomal protein S20), a previously identified substrate for PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) was identical in both the macroarray and RT&#x02013;PCR experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We also compared the levels of polyadenylated <italic>cspA</italic>, <italic>cspC</italic> and <italic>cspE</italic> transcripts, since out of the nine <italic>csp</italic> (cold shock protein) genes (<italic>cspA</italic>&#x02013;<italic>cspI</italic>) in <italic>E.coli</italic>, these are expressed at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and are predicted to be polyadenylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The kinetic RT&#x02013;PCR results were in good agreement with the array data for these genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the <italic>cspB</italic>, <italic>cspD</italic>, <italic>cspF</italic>, <italic>cspG</italic>, <italic>cspH</italic> and <italic>cspI</italic> mRNAs were, as predicted, not detected on the arrays in either of the strains (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Polyadenylation levels of full-length transcripts</title><p>The array data presented above helped us to identify all the ORFs that were polyadenylated (either as full-length or breakdown products). However, it neither showed the total level of polyadenylation nor the fraction of full-length polyadenylated transcripts for individual ORFs. While we would ideally like to know the extent of polyadenylation for all the ORFs, at the present time it is both technically challenging and cost prohibitive to make this determination. Accordingly, we choose two model transcripts (<italic>lpp</italic> and <italic>ompA</italic>) to determine what fraction of their full-length mRNAs were polyadenylated using real-time PCR. These two mRNAs were picked because we have previously shown that they are both targets for PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In addition, <italic>ompA</italic> was also one of the 48 ORFs detected in the <italic>pcnB</italic> deletion strain (Supplementary Table S1). We included the <italic>yjgG</italic> and <italic>ymgC</italic> mRNAs in the real-time PCR study as negative controls. These transcripts were not polyadenylated based on their below background level pixel counts in the wild-type array after hybridization to oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub>-primed cDNAs, but had above background pixel counts after hybridization with GSP-dependent cDNAs (data not shown).</p><p>For direct comparison with the array data, oligo(dT)<sub>20</sub>-primed cDNAs were used in the real-time PCR experiments, as described in the Materials and Methods section. In agreement with the array data, no polyadenylated <italic>yjgG</italic> and <italic>ymgC</italic> mRNAs were detected in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), while very low levels were detected following a 15 min induction of PAP I (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ompA</italic> showed a higher percentage of polyadenylated transcripts compared to <italic>lpp</italic> in both the wild-type (MG1693) and <italic>pcnB</italic> deletion (SK7988) strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Polyadenylation of full-length transcripts for both mRNAs increased significantly after PAP I induction (SK9124, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). It should be noted that quantification of polyadenylated full-length <italic>lpp</italic> mRNAs, using oligo(dT)<sub>17</sub>-primed cDNAs generated at a lower annealing temperature (42&#x000b0;C versus 48&#x000b0;C) resulted in a higher percentage of polyadenylated transcripts in the wild-type and PAP I-induced strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Relationship between steady-state mRNA levels and increases in polyadenylation</title><p>Various studies have suggested that increased polyadenylation leads to more rapid decay of <italic>E.coli</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). These results would predict a concomitant reduction in the steady-state levels of the mRNAs that are polyadenylated. To test this hypothesis directly, we hybridized the arrays with cDNAs derived from either MG1693 (wild-type) or SK9124 (PAP I-induced) using GSPs. Surprisingly, the steady-state transcript levels of the majority of ORFs (&#x0223c;68 &#x000b1; 2%) were identical, within experimental error, in the wild-type and PAP I-induced strains. Only &#x0223c;8% of the ORFs showed either a decrease or increase in their steady-state levels that were &#x02265;2-fold in the PAP I-induced strain compared to the wild-type control. Within this group of ORFs, the steady-state transcript levels of 97 genes were decreased, while 228 ORFs showed increased levels. Interestingly, some of the transcripts that showed significant changes in their steady-state transcript levels were either not polyadenylated or showed no change in poly(A) level (Supplementary Tables S2A and 2B).</p><p>In order to determine if the changes in steady-state levels that were observed using the arrays were valid, we used northern blot analysis to directly examine a number of specific mRNAs. Following 15 min of PAP I induction, mRNAs from three different classes were analyzed: (i) Those that had unchanged steady-state levels; (ii) Those that had increased steady-state levels; and, (iii) Those that had decreased steady-state transcript levels. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, there was excellent agreement between the array data and the northern blot results for all of the mRNAs that were tested.</p><p>However, these results seemed to contradict our expectations of reduced steady-state levels based on the shorter half-lives we observed after a 15 min induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In particular, we previously reported that the half-lives of specific transcripts such as <italic>lpp, ompA</italic>, <italic>trxA,</italic> and <italic>rpsO</italic> were decreased &#x0223c;1.5- to 4-fold under conditions in which there was an &#x0223c;90-fold increase in the <italic>in vivo</italic> poly(A) level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). As such, we carefully reexamined the half-life data and noticed that changes were not observed until 5&#x02013;8 min after the addition of rifampicin (&#x0223c;20&#x02013;25 min of increased PAP I activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesized that the 15 min period over which PAP I was overproduced in the presence of ongoing transcription was too short to allow new steady-state levels to be established. To investigate this possibility directly, the steady-state mRNA levels of <italic>lpp</italic>, <italic>ompA</italic>, <italic>trxA</italic> and <italic>rpsO</italic> were determined for up to 45 min after PAP I induction. Under these circumstances, the growth rate of the PAP I induced strain decreased marginally from 30 min before induction to 35 min after induction (data not shown), while the steady-levels of all the transcripts tested decreased between 2.5- and 5.0-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These data suggest that more than 15 min of PAP I overexpression is required for transcripts to reach new steady-state levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Polyadenylation patterns of transcripts encoding related proteins</title><p>Another question we wanted to address related to how polyadenylation affected mRNAs encoding proteins involved in the same cellular process. We choose ribosomal protein mRNAs for this study as they represent a group of ORFs that are highly expressed but have diverse organizational structures. In addition, one of the mRNAs (<italic>rpsO</italic>) has served as a model substrate for the <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Seven of the 55 ribosomal protein genes are transcribed as monocistronic mRNAs, while the rest of the genes are embedded in 14 different operons including one containing 11 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). In addition, five of the monocistronic and 11 of the polycistronic mRNAs terminate with Rho-independent transcription terminators. Interestingly, in wild-type <italic>E.coli</italic> 50/55 of the ribosomal protein ORFs were polyadenylated, irrespective of their mode of termination. Only five mRNAs (<italic>rplY, rplT, rpmG, rpsM</italic> and <italic>rpmJ</italic>) had no detectable poly(A) tails within the experimental parameters of the array experiment. In addition, transcripts of genes within the same operon tended to demonstrate comparable changes in their polyadenylation levels following PAP I induction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). In contrast, there were no significant changes (&#x0003c;2-fold) in steady-state mRNA levels for the majority of the ribosomal protein genes after PAP I induction except for <italic>rpsU</italic> (&#x02212;2.0-fold), <italic>rplT</italic> (+3.2-fold), and <italic>rplQ</italic> (&#x02212;2.0-fold) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Rho-independent transcription terminators appear to be targets for polyadenylation</title><p>Previous experiments have indicated that a Rho-independent transcription terminator might play a significant role in mRNA polyadenylation in wild-type <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). To determine if this were a general pattern for <italic>E.coli</italic> transcripts, we analyzed the 3&#x02032; nt sequences for the presence or absence of a Rho-independent transcription terminator of more than 200 ORFs with the highest pixel counts from both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated transcripts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>; Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). The majority of the transcripts in each group were part of operons, some of which contained up to 12 ORFs. In agreement with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), of the ORFs showing high levels of post-transcriptional modification, &#x0223c;72% were linked to a Rho-independent transcription terminator either as a monocistronic or part of a polycistronic mRNA. In most cases, every gene within a polycistronic transcript that was terminated in a Rho-independent fashion was post-transcriptionally modified [e.g. the <italic>atpI</italic> operon with nine genes and the <italic>rpsJ</italic> operon with 11 genes, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> (Supplementary Table S3)].

However, our previous sequencing experiments with transcripts terminating in a Rho-independent fashion (<italic>lpp</italic> and <italic>rpsO</italic>) showed that the majority of the poly(A) tails were homopolymeric and occurred after the terminator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). In contrast, a transcript terminated in a Rho-dependent fashion (<italic>trxA</italic>) contained mainly heteropolymeric tails distributed throughout the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Here we have extended this analysis to two additional transcripts derived from the wild-type strain (MG1693) using RT&#x02013;PCR cloning and DNA sequencing of the 3&#x02032; ends. In one case, we analyzed the <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA, which contains a distinct Rho-independent transcription terminator and whose half-life is directly related to the level of polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The second transcript chosen was the <italic>pcnB folK</italic> operon, in which the <italic>pcnB</italic> coding sequence overlaps the downstream <italic>folK</italic> gene and the operon is terminated in a Rho-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>As predicted, all 30 independently derived <italic>pcnB</italic> cDNA clones contained heteropolymeric tails ranging in length from 27 to over 600 nt (seven clones &#x0003c;50 nt; seven clones, 50&#x02013;100 nt; seven clones, 101&#x02013;200 nt; seven clones, 201&#x02013;300 nt; one clone, 358 nt; and one clone &#x0003e;600 nt; data not shown).

As expected, all 12 of the independently derived cDNA clones had homopolymeric poly(A) tails ranging in size from 17 to 27 nt (data not shown), which were located in the same regions where the heteropolymeric tails were observed in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>With <italic>ompA</italic>, a very different result was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Ten of the tails, including one heteropolymeric one, were found after the Rho-independent transcription terminator.

Here we have provided strong evidence for the first time that polyadenylation of mRNAs is a very general phenomenon (&#x0223c;90% of the ORFs) in exponentially growing <italic>E.coli</italic>. In fact, it appears that any transcribed mRNA can be polyadenylated, since the number of ORFs with polyadenylated transcripts increased to 100% after a transient increase in PAP I level. While the array data did not measure the extent to which each transcript was polyadenylated, the 2- to 50-fold increase in the hybridization intensity for specific ORFs after PAP I overproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2) suggests that the apparent low levels of polyadenylated transcripts observed using olido(dT) affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) results from low intracellular levels of PAP I rather than limited accessibility to potential substrates.</p><p>In addition, it should be noted that both the level and average length of poly(A) tails is reduced dramatically by the degradative activity of 3&#x02032; &#x02192; 5&#x02032; exonucleases such as PNPase and/or RNase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), resulting in the majority of the poly(A) tails being &#x0003c;15 nt in length in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Thus it seems likely that the extent of polyadenylation in exponentially growing cells is significantly underestimated because the average tail-length, kept short by the activities of PNPase and RNase II, is not sufficiently long enough to be enriched using a stringent oligo(dT) approach. The &#x0223c;1.7-fold increase in the detection of full-length polyadenylated <italic>lpp</italic> mRNAs using real-time PCR when the cDNAs were synthesized using less stringent conditions supports this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the detection of only 48/&#x0223c;3300 expressed ORFs in the absence of PAP I (<italic>&#x00394;pcnB</italic>, Supplementary Table S1) confirmed our earlier results obtained with poly(A) sizing assays that suggested that PAP I accounts for 90% of the poly(A) tails in exponentially growing <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Does this observation mean that PNPase only plays a minor role in the post-transcriptional modification of mRNAs? We think that the answer is probably no. In the first place, cloning and sequencing analysis of the <italic>lpp</italic>, <italic>rpsO</italic>, <italic>ompA</italic>, <italic>trxA</italic> and <italic>pcnB-folK</italic> mRNAs, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) strongly suggest that transcripts without a Rho-independent transcription terminator are modified primarily by PNPase. Since 50% of the annotated protein encoding transcriptional units are predicted to be terminated in a Rho-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), there are a large number of potential targets for post-transcriptional modification by PNPase. In addition, it is also likely that PNPase synthesized tails containing short sequences of contiguous A residues were excluded during enrichment with Dynabeads [oligo(dT<sub>25</sub>)]. Furthermore, in the absence of PAP I, the polymerizing efficiency of PNPase may be reduced considering that these proteins normally exist as a complex in wild-type <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Finally, based on sequencing of cDNAs derived from a variety of mRNAs, we have observed that every mRNA studied so far can be a substrate for PNPase catalyzed polynucleotidylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). While the current sample size is still relatively small, it would appear that any transcript that is a substrate for the 3&#x02032; &#x02192; 5&#x02032; nucleolytic activity of PNPase can also be post-transcriptionally modified with the addition of heteropolymeric tails. It thus seems probable that the addition of heteropolymeric tails to mRNA decay intermediates is quite common even though its biological function is still not currently understood. What is particularly interesting is that most these tails are longer than 100 nt in length compared to the majority of homopolymeric tails that are shorter than 50 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) (data not shown).</p><p>The data presented above also lend further support to our earlier observation that Rho-independent transcription terminators play a significant role in the polyadenylation of <italic>E.coli</italic> mRNAs by PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). For example, examination of over 100 ORFs that were highly expressed but not polyadenylated in wild-type <italic>E.coli</italic> showed that only one of them (0.9%) contained a Rho-independent transcription terminator (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>, Supplementary Table S4). In contrast, an identical analysis of over 130 highly polyadenylated ORFs revealed that 72% of them were terminated in a Rho-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>, Supplementary Table S3). In addition, the direct sequencing of cDNAs demonstrated the presence of mainly poly(A) tails on the <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA which contains a Rho-independent transcription terminator compared to the absence of such tails on the <italic>pcnB-folK</italic> dicistronic mRNA which terminates in a Rho-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These data are in agreement with our previous sequencing analysis of the <italic>lpp</italic>, <italic>rpsO</italic> and <italic>trxA</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Our results further suggest that if a polycistronic operon containing a Rho-independent transcription terminator is a substrate for PAP I, the processed portions of the transcript are also substrates for the enzyme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>, Supplementary Table S3). One possible explanation for this phenomenon relates to the fact that polyadenylation at Rho-independent transcription terminators appears to involve the action of a multi-protein complex that includes PAP I, PNPase and the RNA binding protein Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). If this complex had some form of transient interaction with the RNase E based degradosome, it would be possible that the processing products of a polycistronic transcript would be transferred to the polyadenylation complex. The recent paper suggesting that Hfq can also interact with RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) provides some support for the idea of swapping of RNA molecules between RNase E and PAP I through an Hfq mediated exchange. In contrast, RNA molecules terminated in a Rho-dependent fashion are not substrates for Hfq, resulting in the lack of polyadenylation for the full-length molecule or its decay intermediates. Taken together, we conclude that a transcript with a Rho-independent transcription terminator is likely to be polyadenylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, there is an &#x0003c;28% chance for polyadenylation of a transcript terminated in a Rho-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>A somewhat unexpected observation concerned the relationship between steady-state transcript levels and polyadenylation. In particular, the steady-state levels of only 327 transcripts (&#x0223c;8%) ORFs changed more than 2-fold following 15 min of PAP I induction (Supplementary Tables S2A and 2B). Furthermore, we were unable to find any direct correlation between the changes in the steady-state level for a particular transcript and its apparent level of polyadenylation. Thus, how does one explain the unchanged steady-state transcript levels of 68% of the ORFs including <italic>lpp</italic>, <italic>ompA</italic>, <italic>rpsO</italic> and <italic>trxA</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), when it was previously shown that half-lives decreased significantly following a 15 min induction of PAP I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> have provided some insights that may partially answer this question. Specifically, under conditions where transcription is permitted to continue, it takes &#x0223c;30 min for the new steady-state levels to be achieved. Once this adaptation has occurred, decreases between 2.5- and 5.0-fold were observed for all four mRNAs tested by northern analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, to address this question unequivocally, it will be necessary to carry out a genome-wide experiment using RNAs isolated after a 30 min induction.</p><p>In conclusion, it should be noted that our macroarray data have not addressed the important question relating to what fraction of full-length mRNAs are polyadenylated in wild-type <italic>E.coli</italic>. The fact that there were significant differences in the pixel counts of the various polyadenylated transcripts suggested that there might be variations in the fraction of each transcript that was post-transcriptionally modified. This idea was supported by the real-time PCR analysis that showed &#x0223c;3-fold difference in the polyadenylation of the full-length <italic>lpp</italic> and <italic>ompA</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Taken together, it would appear that polyadenylation occurs more frequently than previously envisioned, probably helping the cell distinguish productive from nonproductive RNAs, thereby increasing the efficiency of the RNA degradative machinery.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkl684_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkl684_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported in part by a grant (GM57220) to S.R.K. from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.
