There are clusters of tandemly arrayed A3 genes present on human chromosome 22. These are A3A, A3B, A3C, A3DE, A3F, A3G, and A3H. In contrast, only a single A3 gene (mA3), which produces a protein with two Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding motifs was found in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Human A3G has been shown to be active against <italic>vif</italic>-defective human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and other viruses such as simian immunodeficiency virus, human hepatitis B virus, and HTLV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In contrast, A3A was not found to inhibit HIV-1 but blocked replication of adeno-associated virus and retrotransposons such as intracisternal A particle (IAP) and long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>A3G contains two copies of the cytidine deaminase active site (CDA) HXEX<sub>23&#x02013;28</sub>PCX<sub>2&#x02013;4</sub>C (where X is any amino acid) while A3A contains only a single CDA domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The cysteine and histidine residues are believed to coordinate a critical active site zinc ion while the glutamic acid residue participates directly in the deamination reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Initial research suggested that this deamination activity was critical for APOBEC3-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication as A3G and A3F caused extensive mutagenesis of <italic>vif</italic>-defective HIV-1 proviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. More recent research has challenged this model based on the finding that some A3G and A3F mutants that appeared incapable of catalyzing deamination of deoxycytidine nevertheless retained substantial inhibitory activity against HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, A3A mutants lacking the ability to induce cytidine deamination have been shown to effectively inhibit the mobility of retrotransposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study we wanted to investigate why A3A lacks antiviral activity against HIV-1. We observed that A3A was packaged into HIV-1 virions but did not associate with the viral nucleoprotein complex (NPC) and had no antiviral activity. In contrast, we previously reported that A3G, which exhibits strong antiviral activity, was packaged into viral NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Sequence alignment of A3G and A3A revealed significant homology of A3A to the C-terminal region of A3G leading us to speculate that the inability to assemble into viral NPC may be due to the lack of an N-terminal CDA domain in A3A. To test this model, we constructed an A3G-3A chimeric protein, in which the N-terminal half of A3G was fused to A3A. This resulted in the creation of an enzyme containing two CDA domains. Interestingly, the A3G-3A chimera was packaged into HIV-1 particles and, unlike A3A, associated with the viral NPC. In support of our model, the A3G-3A chimera displayed strong antiviral activity against HIV-1 but was also sensitive to inhibition by HIV-1 Vif. These results suggest that the A3G N-terminal domain confers antiviral activity and Vif sensitivity to A3A and carries determinants required for the assembly into viral NPC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>APOBEC3A has no antiviral activity and is insensitive to degradation by HIV-1 Vif</title><p>It has been reported that APOBEC3A (A3A) does not have antiviral activity towards HIV-1 irrespective of the presence or absence of Vif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To verify these results, we tested the antiviral activity of human A3A and its sensitivity to HIV-1 Vif by transient transfection of HeLa cells. We used two different vectors for the expression of HIV-1 Vif: pNLA-1 Vif, expressing Vif together with other viral proteins from a proviral backbone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and pcDNA-hVif, expressing codon-optimized Vif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Both forms of Vif can efficiently counteract the antiviral activity of A3G. HeLa cells were transfected with DNA encoding <italic>vif</italic>-defective HIV-1 and pcDNA-A3A together with either pNL-A1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 2 &#x00026; 5) or pcDNA-hVif vector DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 3 &#x00026; 6) or empty vector (lanes 1 &#x00026; 4). We found that neither expression of A1-Vif nor hVif reduced cellular A3A expression relative to the Vif-negative control (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Furthermore, expression of Vif had no effect on the packaging of A3A into virus particles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, compare lanes 4&#x02013;6). We also compared the infectivity of viruses produced in the presence of A3A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4) to virus produced in the absence of A3A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lane 1) in a single cycle assay as described in Materials and Methods. Our data were consistent with previous reports and confirmed that A3A had no antiviral activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, compare lanes 1 &#x00026; 2). Accordingly, the presence of Vif did not affect the infectivity of the viruses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;4).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A3A is resistant to Vif induced degradation</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>HeLa cells were transfected with vectors expressing <italic>vif</italic>-deficient pNL4-3 (3 &#x003bc;g each) along with pcDNA-A3A (1.5 &#x003bc;g each) and 1.5 &#x003bc;g of either pNL-A1vif(-) (lane 1), pNL-A1 (lane 2), or pcDNA-hVif (lane 3).

Moreover, on comparing the amino acid sequences of A3G and A3A we found that A3A is highly homologous to the C-terminus of A3G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We therefore wanted to investigate whether the lack of A3A antiviral activity and the insensitivity of A3A to degradation by HIV-1 Vif were attributable to the lack of an N-terminal domain. We constructed an A3G-3A chimera by fusing the N-terminal domain of A3G to the N-terminus of A3A using a BamHI restriction site present in both A3G and A3A genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, BamHI). The resulting construct is schematically delineated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. Expression of the A3G-3A chimera was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). For that purpose, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA-A3A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, lane 1), pcDNA-A3G-3A (lane 2), or pcDNA-Apo3G (lane 3) and whole cells lysates were subjected to immunoblotting using an A3G-specific peptide antibody. Because of the high amino acid homology of A3A and A3G at their C-termini (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), the A3G antibody cross-reacted well with the A3A and A3G-3A proteins. A3A runs as a doublet on our gels. The reason for this is unclear but could be due to covalent post-translational modification of the protein or to initiation at an internal AUG codon.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Construction and expression of A3G-3A chimera</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Sequence alignment of A3G and A3A.

Cell were grown on the cover slips for 24 h; then, cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol (-20&#x000b0;C, 10 min) and stained with A3G-specific peptide antiserum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, A3G exhibited predominantly cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). As predicted, A3A revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Interestingly, the subcellular distribution of the A3G-3A chimera largely reflected that of A3G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Thus, addition of the N-terminal domain of A3G to A3A induced a redistribution of the protein to a largely cytoplasmic localization. Punctate structures were observed in all samples and presumably represent P bodies or stress granules.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of APOBEC proteins</bold>.

We next wanted to test whether A3A and A3G-3A similarly assembled into viral NPCs. HeLa cells were transfected with DNA encoding <italic>vif</italic>-defective HIV-1 along with pcDNA-A3A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), pcDNA-A3G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), or pcDNA-A3G-3A DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Virus-containing supernatants were collected 48 h post transfection and concentrated by pelleting through 20% sucrose. Concentrated viruses were resuspended in 1 ml of DMEM and 50% each were loaded onto a 20&#x02013;60% sucrose step gradient in the absence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3) or presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;6). We have previously reported that components of the viral core, including nucleocapsid protein (NC), are resistant to 0.1% Triton X-100, whereas other viral components, such as matrix (MA) or envelope protein, are detergent sensitive and can be separated from core-associated proteins by sucrose step gradient centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In this assay, intact viruses accumulate at the 20%/60% interphase of the step gradient column as evidenced by the enrichment of NC and CA protein in the S3 fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, lane 3). As expected, A3A, A3G, and A3G-3A partitioned with the viral fractions in fraction S3. No viral proteins were identified in fractions S1 and S2 attesting to the absence of soluble secreted proteins in our virus preparations. Detergent treatment resulted in the partitioning of CA and NC between the soluble S1 fraction and the detergent resistant viral core fraction S3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, lanes 4 &#x00026; 6). Interestingly, detergent treatment resulted in the quantitative sequestration of A3A to the soluble S1 fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, lane 4) suggesting that A3A was not associated with viral NCPs. In contrast, &#x0003e;70% of the virus-associated A3G copurified with viral NPCs in fraction S3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, lane 6). Interestingly, A3G-3A behaved very similar to A3G and exhibited significant resistance to detergent extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, lane 6). Thus, the A3G N-terminal domain imposed A3G-like properties onto A3A not only with respect to intracellular localization but also as far as packaging into viral NPC and antiviral properties were concerned.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>A3G-3A co-purifies with viral nucleoprotein complexes</bold>.

Virus containing supernatants were collected 24 h post-transfection, filtered to remove cellular debris, and concentrated by pelleting through 20% sucrose. Viral pellets were suspended in 1 ml of DMEM and 500 &#x003bc;l each of the virus preparation was loaded onto a 20%/60% sucrose step gradient previously overlaid with 100 &#x003bc;l of PBS (lanes 1&#x02013;3) or Triton X-100 (lanes 4 to 6) as described in Materials and Methods. Three fractions of 1.1 ml each were collected from the top of the gradient as shown in the cartoon on the right. Fraction S1 (lanes 1 &#x00026; 4) contains soluble proteins; fraction S2 (lanes 2 &#x00026; 5) is a buffer fraction of 20% sucrose that separates soluble proteins from virus particles or viral cores; fraction S3 (lanes 3 &#x00026; 6) includes the interphase of 20%:60% sucrose where viral particles and viral cores accumulate. Gradient fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an A3G-specific antibody (A3A, A3G, or A3G-3A) followed by probing with an HIV-positive patient serum (CA). Nucleocapsid protein (NC) was identified by a goat anti-NC antibody and matrix protein (MA) was identified by a mouse monoclonal antibody to MA(P17).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-4-61-6"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is well documented that human A3G has potent antiviral activity and effectively inhibits the replication of <italic>vif</italic>-deficient HIV-1. It is also accepted that the antiviral activity of A3G requires packaging of the protein into viral particles. Accordingly, wt HIV-1 is generally not susceptible to the antiviral properties of A3G since its Vif protein prevents A3G encapsidation. Recent reports demonstrated that A3A was able to inhibit LTR-retrotransposons and adeno-associated virus, a single-stranded DNA virus, but had no effect on <italic>vif</italic>-defective HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This was surprising since A3A, like A3G, was found to be packaged into HIV-1 particles and had deaminase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Structurally, A3G and A3A differ by the presence of a second deaminase domain in A3G located in the N-terminal portion of the protein. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated a role of this N-terminal deaminase domain in A3G dimerization, Vif-sensitivity, and packaging into HIV-1 virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. On the other hand, our data confirm that despite the lack of an N-terminal deaminase domain, A3A is efficiently packaged into HIV-1 virions (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, our data also show that encapsidation of A3A is qualitatively distinct from that of A3G: A3G is packaged into viral NPC and is resistant to detergent treatment while virus-associated A3A is detergent sensitive and does not co-purify with the NPC. This qualitative difference in packaging of A3G and A3A may well explain their different antiviral properties.</p><p>The reason for the lack of association of A3A with viral NPCs is unclear; however, we have previously shown that viral genomic RNA was required for the association of A3G with the viral NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Importantly, A3G was still packaged into virus-like particles in the absence of genomic RNA; however, such A3G remained detergent sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, we propose that functional packaging of APOBEC proteins into viral NPCs requires interaction with viral genomic RNA. Consistent with this model, A3A was packaged into virus particles irrespective of the presence or absence of viral genomic RNA (data not shown) suggesting that A3A lacks a domain required for the binding to viral genomic RNA. Thus, while A3A is packaged either non-specifically or via a specific interaction with viral component(s), it appears to lack a domain required for the specific assembly into viral NPCs. Interestingly, addition of the A3G N-terminal domain resulted in the targeting of the chimeric protein to viral NPCs. At the same time, the A3G-3A chimera acquired antiviral activity. These results suggest a correlation between the association of APOBEC proteins with the viral NPC and their ability to inhibit virus replication.</p><p>Consistent with the previously described importance of the A3G N-terminal domain for Vif-sensitivity, the A3G-3A chimera acquired sensitivity to degradation by Vif. Future experiments will investigate whether the regions in A3G determining Vif-sensitivity overlap with those required for NPC association. Also, A3A clearly differed from A3G and A3G-3A in its intracellular distribution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The more prominent nuclear accumulation of A3A may explain its reported effects on retrotransposition. It will be interesting to define in more detail the regions in the A3G N-terminus affecting subcellular distribution of the A3A chimera. It is possible that the A3G N-terminus masks a nuclear import signal on A3A. Alternatively, the A3G N-terminus may contain a nuclear export signal preventing nuclear accumulation of the cytidine deaminase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The <italic>vif</italic>-defective molecular clone pNL4-3Vif(-) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] was used for the production of virus stocks.
