We report here the isolation of a related gene (transin-2 gene). The structures of these genes are very similar. Indeed, a stretch of 428 nucleotides of the transin gene containing both exon and intron sequences is 98% conserved in the transin-2 gene. However, the putative promoter regions of the genes show little sequence homology, apart from a short element related to a sequence involved in control of transcription by cyclic AMP or a tumour promoter. Expression of the transin-2 gene, unlike that of the transin gene, is not induced by EGF, dibutyryl cyclic AMP or cytochalasin D. Nevertheless, transin-2 RNA is expressed in several transformed rat embryo fibroblast cell lines, and can be induced by a tumour promoter. The proteins transin and transin-2 are approximately 71% homologous in sequence. Both proteins show significant sequence homology with two connective tissue degrading metalloproteases. These homologies raise the possibility that expression of transin and transin-2 in transformed cells might play a role in tumour invasion.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0275-a" xlink:role="1143"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0278-a" xlink:role="1146"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0271.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1139"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0272.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1140"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0273.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1141"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0274.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1142"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0275.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1143"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0276.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1144"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1145"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0278.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1146"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0279.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1147"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0280.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1148"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0281.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1149"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0282.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1150"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0283.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1151"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
