The inhibitor is a hydrophobic, multiple transmembrane protein that is resident in the Golgi and is named GAAP (Golgi anti-apoptotic protein). Stable expression of both viral GAAP (v-GAAP) and human GAAP (h-GAAP), which is expressed in all human tissues tested, inhibited apoptosis induced by intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic stimuli. Conversely, knockout of h-GAAP by siRNA induced cell death by apoptosis. v-GAAP and h-GAAP display overlapping functions as shown by the ability of v-GAAP to complement for the loss of h-GAAP. Lastly, deletion of the v-GAAP gene from vaccinia virus did not affect virus replication in cell culture, but affected virus virulence in a murine infection model. This study identifies a new regulator of cell death that is highly conserved in evolution from plants to insects, amphibians, mammals, and poxviruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Apoptosis is a conserved and strictly regulated process of cell suicide that, among other things, can remove virus-infected cells. In turn, many viruses, including poxviruses, have evolved strategies to block apoptosis to keep cells alive until virus replication is completed. Here, a novel viral anti-apoptotic protein from vaccinia virus and camelpox virus, viral Golgi anti-apoptotic protein (v-GAAP), and its human counterpart, h-GAAP, are described. Evolutionarily, GAAPs are extremely well conserved with closely related proteins in plants, insects, amphibia, and mammals, the viral and human counterparts sharing a striking 73&#x00025; sequence identity. GAAPs are resident in the Golgi and inhibit apoptosis induced by a wide range of apoptotic stimuli. Knockout of h-GAAP, which is expressed in every tissue tested, induced cell death by apoptosis. The close relationship between the viral and the human proteins was confirmed in that v-GAAP could complement for the loss of h-GAAP and promote cell survival. Deletion of the v-GAAP gene from vaccinia virus affected virus virulence. Thus, this study identifies a new regulator of cell death that is highly conserved in evolution and has been hijacked by poxviruses. These data support a role for the Golgi complex in sensing pro-apoptotic stimuli.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Gubser C, Bergamaschi D, Hollinshead M, Lu X, van Kuppeveld FJM, et al.

Alternatively, poxvirus immunomodulatory proteins may be intracellular and interfere with signalling pathways regulating cellular gene expression or apoptosis.

PCR and Southern blot analysis confirmed that the genomic structures of all viruses were as predicted. Comparisons of the growth of the recombinant viruses in cell culture showed there were no differences in plaque phenotype or yield of intracellular virus (unpublished data). Immunoblotting of extracts from v-GAAP RevHA&#x02013;infected cells with anti-HA antibody (Ab) detected v-GAAP as a 23-kDa protein that was present early and throughout infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030017-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, right panel).

In addition, very late post-infection (24 h) v-GAAP was also detected in the nuclear membrane and the ER (unpublished data).

To investigate whether h-GAAP was expressed in different human tissue, complementary DNA (cDNA) from 16 human tissues obtained from multiple disease-free individuals was used for PCR analysis of h-GAAP gene expression. This showed that h-GAAP is expressed in all human tissue examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030017-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Next, the &#x003b1;-GAAP Ab was used to study the location of h-GAAP by immunofluorescence; this demonstrated that endogenous h-GAAP co-localised with the Golgi marker GM130 in HeLa, SiHa, and BGMK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030017-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and unpublished data).

This protein is called Golgi-anti-apoptotic protein because of its function and subcellular location. Overexpression of h-GAAP or v-GAAP rendered cells resistant to induction of apoptosis, while knock down of expression of the human gene by siRNA caused cells to die by apoptosis. Deletion of v-GAAP from VACV did not affect virus replication in cell culture, but affected virulence in a murine model of infection. v-GAAP therefore represents a new virus-encoded apoptosis inhibitor. v-GAAP is remarkable in that it is very closely related to a previously uncharacterised human protein (h-GAAP) that is conserved in a wide range of eukaryotes, is expressed in all 16 human tissues tested, and is essential for cell viability.</p><p>VACV and other poxviruses express a wide range of proteins that interfere with aspects of the host response to infection (for reviews see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030017-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030017-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;). These proteins may act inside or outside the cell, and most of them target the innate response to infection. Among the intracellular regulators of the innate response, a subset block the induction of apoptosis, so that virus replication can be completed before the cells dies. Apoptosis regulators from VACV and other poxviruses have been reviewed recently &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030017-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d; and include proteins that inhibit caspase activity, or are present at the mitochondrial membrane. v-GAAP is another example of an intracellular apoptosis inhibitor, but it has three striking differences from the ones discovered previously.</p><p>First, v-GAAP (and h-GAAP) is present in the Golgi, a compartment that until recently was not thought to have an important role in the regulation of apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030017-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030017-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. This observation supports recent evidence that the Golgi has a role in the regulation of apoptosis. Other poxvirus proteins that affect induction of apoptosis are located either at mitochondria or are in the cytosol.</p><p>Second, v-GAAP is very closely related to a human protein that shows remarkable conservation throughout eukaryotes. The virus and human protein have 73&#x00025; aa identity, a similar hydropathy profile, and a very similar length. Moreover, the genomes of many eukaryotes (plants, insects, amphibia, and mammals) encode a closely related protein. For instance, the human and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GAAPs share 38&#x00025; aa identity and differ in length by only 4 aa. Hitherto, the function of the protein we have called GAAP had not been determined in any species, although the human gene was one of several reported to be up-regulated in some breast tumours &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030017-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Data presented here provide the first characterisation to our knowledge of the human protein, and demonstrate that this protein is essential for cell viability and that cells die by apoptosis in its absence. In addition, it is shown that the viral protein can complement the essential function served by h-GAAP. Other immunoregulatory proteins from poxviruses either have no orthologues outside poxviruses or have a much lower amino acid identity with cellular counterparts. For instance, the interleukin-1&#x003b2; receptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030017-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, interferon-&#x003b3; receptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030017-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, and 3&#x003b2;-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030017-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d; from VACV share 33&#x00025;, 25&#x00025;, and 44&#x00025; aa identity with their human orthologues, respectively. Therefore, compared to other orthopoxvirus immunomodulators, v-GAAP shows by far the greatest amino acid similarity with its mammalian counterpart. The close relationship of the GAAPs in VACV and mammals suggests that either the gene has been captured from the host more recently in evolution, or that functional constraints have restricted its divergence after acquisition.</p><p>Third, v-GAAP (and h-GAAP) inhibits apoptosis induced by an unusually broad range of pro-apoptotic stimuli from both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Instrinsic pro-apoptotic stimuli inhibited by GAAPs include bax, staurosporine, doxorybicin, cisplatin, and ceramide. Extrinsic stimuli inhibited include Fas and TNF. The mechanism by which GAAPs inhibit apoptosis remains to be determined. The ability of GAAPs to inhibit cell death induced by various instrinsic apoptotic stimuli suggests strongly that it acts at a step in the mitochondrial pathway. The finding that h-GAAP suppressed TNF-induced apoptosis at a step downstream of caspase-8 activation is consistent with this idea.</p><p>In summary, a new regulator of apoptosis has been discovered by the study of poxviruses. The protein, called v-GAAP in VACV and h-GAAP in <italic>Homo sapiens,</italic> is highly conserved in eukaryotes, and is another example of a host gene acquired during virus evolution to combat the host response to infection. The human protein is essential for cell viability, and in its absence cells die by apoptosis. Both human and viral GAAPs inhibit an unusually wide range of pro-apoptotic stimuli. The viral protein affects virus virulence and can also substitute for the h-GAAP to maintain cell viability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and viruses.</title><p>Monkey BS-C-1 and human HeLa, TK<sup>&#x02212;</sup>143, U2OS (osteosarcoma, p53 wild-type), and Saos2 (osteosarcoma, p53-null) cells were grown in Dublbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com">http://www.invitrogen.com</ext-link>) with 10&#x00025; (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.
