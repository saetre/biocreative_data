Postabsorptive metabolism in hepatocytes ensures glucose synthesis via gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to maintain blood glucose levels. In diabetic patients, sustained rates of gluconeogenesis independent of nutrient status are responsible for increased hepatic glucose output (HGO) and, therefore, hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>).</p><p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) catalyzes the first committed step in gluconeogenesis. Gene transcription from the cytosolic form of PEPCK (PEPCK-C) is highly regulated by the glucagon/insulin axis. In diabetes, the lack of insulin (type 1 diabetes) or resistance to its action (type 2 diabetes) is responsible for an important upregulation of the enzyme, and this induction correlates with increased rates of gluconeogenesis in liver and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Also, PEPCK gene modulation in the liver has resulted in remarkable effects on systemic glucose metabolism in mice. A twofold overexpression of PEPCK-C results in insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>), whereas a sevenfold overexpression results in hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). Moreover, studies by Burgess et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>) and She et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>) using a liver-specific PEPCK-C knockout mouse have shed light on the critical role of PEPCK-C in the integration of energy metabolism through a mechanism that implicates cataplerosis from mitochondria, as highlighted by hypoglycemia and lethality after ablation of PEPCK-C gene in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). Furthermore, a polymorphism in the promoter for <italic>Pck1</italic> is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>), and dysregulation of gluconeogenesis has direct implications for glucose homeostasis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>).</p><p>Despite all evidence, the validation of this enzyme as a target for liver-specific gene therapy or pharmacological intervention in diabetes has not been extensively investigated to date. Prior studies in streptozotocin-treated mice using RNAi-directed downregulation of PEPCK-C in the liver have shown a direct role for this enzyme in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in the absence of insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Here, we have focused on evaluating the indirect metabolic impact of knocking down hepatic PEPCK-C in a model of insulin resistance.</p><p>We show that partial silencing of hepatic PEPCK-C in <italic>db/db</italic> mice leads to improved glycemia control directly, through the coordinate inhibition of components of the gluconeogenic pathway in the liver, and indirectly, by improving insulinemia and peripheral sensitivity to the hormone. Our observations indicate that PEPCK-C plays a key role in the control of hepatic energy metabolism and provides a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of diabetes.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Experimental animals and adenovirus.</title><p>Male C57BKS.Cg-&#x0002b;Lepr<sup>db</sup>/&#x0002b;Lepr<sup>db</sup> (<italic>db/db</italic>) mice were purchased from Harlan Interfarma, maintained in a constant 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a standard rodent chow and water ad libitum.

Hepatocytes were cleared by repeated centrifugation at 50<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and viability (&#x0003e;80&#x00025;) was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The respiration medium consisted of F-12 Coon's modification supplemented with 20 mmol/l HEPES, 20 mmol/l lactate, 2 mmol/l pyruvate, 2 mmol/l glutamine, and 1 mmol/l octanoate conjugated with 0.5&#x00025; BSA. Medium was equilibrated with air at 37&#x000b0;C and stirred at 750 rpm until a stable signal was obtained for calibration at air saturation. At least 10<sup>6</sup> hepatocytes per milliliter were used for measurements. The titration protocol, which was completed within 50&#x02013;60 min, was recorded at 2-s intervals using a computer-driven data acquisition system (Datlab; Oroboros).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>Results are expressed as the means &#x000b1; SE.

Treatment with Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic> achieved a 42 and 25&#x00025; reduction in <italic>Pck1</italic> gene expression in fed and fasted livers, respectively (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Interestingly, the net amount of RNA silenced was similar independent of nutritional status. Densitometric quantification of Western blots confirmed a similar amount of hepatic PEPCK-C protein reduction on treatment (100 &#x000b1; 15.1 vs. 46.1 &#x000b1; 6.8 relative units; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 11, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Because PEPCK-C is also present in kidney and adipose tissue, we assessed the tissue specificity of silencing. No changes in PEPCK-C protein content were observed either in kidney or epididymal adipose tissue (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of PEPCK-C demonstrates a nonhomogeneous reduction of PEPCK-C immunoreactivity that is more evident in pericentral than periportal hepatocytes (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.</title><p>To investigate the consequences of PEPCK-C silencing on glycemia control, key metabolic parameters were measured. Fed blood glucose was significantly reduced in Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic> animals (271 &#x000b1; 23 mg/dl) compared with both saline-treated (409 &#x000b1; 48 mg/dl) and Ad-shCT&#x02013;treated (370 &#x000b1; 38 mg/dl) groups, although no significant changes were found in fasted animals (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Interestingly, PEPCK-C silencing and oral metformin treatment demonstrated similar variations in fed glycemia (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>Systemic glucose clearance, assessed using a glucose tolerance test, was improved after Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic> treatment, as demonstrated by a reduction in the area under the curve of &#x0223c;40 and 20&#x00025; compared with saline-treated and Ad-shCT groups, respectively (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). Also, fed and fasting insulinemia were significantly reduced after treatment with Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic> (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Accordingly, an intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test showed that PEPCK-C&#x02013;silenced animals have higher sensitivity to insulin (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Furthermore, Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic>&#x02013;treated animals scored significantly lower (2.38 &#x000b1; 0.01, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14 vs. 2.74 &#x000b1; 0.07, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5 and vs. 2.53 &#x000b1; 0.01, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14; Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic> vs. saline treated and vs. Ad-shCT, respectively) when their degree of insulin resistance was assessed from the QUICKI index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>).</p><p>Next, we directly evaluated insulin signaling in vivo measuring insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in liver, muscle, and epididymal adipose tissue (white adipose tissue &#x0005b;WAT&#x0005d;). AKT phosphorylation at Ser<sup>473</sup> and Thr<sup>308</sup> was enhanced in Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic>&#x02013;treated animals after insulin treatment, in marked contrast to reduced signaling by insulin in saline-treated and Ad-shCT&#x02013;treated groups (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>&#x02013;<italic>H</italic>). These data demonstrate improved peripheral insulin sensitivity after partial hepatic PEPCK-C knockdown in the <italic>db/db</italic> mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Gluconeogenesis and HGO.</title><p>HGO, determined by the flux from pyruvate to glucose in vivo, was reduced in Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic>&#x02013;treated animals (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Moreover, liver glycogen was significantly reduced in Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic>&#x02013;treated animals on fasting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), consistent with decreased hepatic glucose production capacity</p><p>Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the last step in the gluconeogenic and glycogenolysis pathways, and is, therefore, responsible for regulating HGO. The mRNA of this enzyme (encoded by <italic>G6pc</italic>) was significantly reduced at levels comparable with those observed for PEPCK-C (encoded by <italic>Pck1</italic>). Glucose-6-phosphatase and PEPCK-C are regulated by transcription factors like hepatocyte nuclear factor-4&#x003b1; (HNF-4&#x003b1;) (encoded by <italic>Hnf4&#x003b1;</italic>) and FOXO1, which are co-activated by PGC-1&#x003b1; (encoded by <italic>Ppargc1&#x003b1;</italic>). PGC-1&#x003b1; mRNA was slightly reduced in PEPCK-C&#x02013;silenced animals (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), although PGC-1&#x003b1; protein in nuclear extracts was constant (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). HNF-4&#x003b1; is downregulated, albeit nonsignificantly, in treated animals. In addition, FOXO1 phosphorylation at Ser<sup>256</sup> increased in liver of Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic>&#x02013;treated animals (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic></xref>). These data suggest that insulin signaling through AKT-dependent FOXO1 phosphorylation contributes to the observed reduction in steady-state mRNA levels for gluconeogenic genes such as <italic>G6pc</italic> and <italic>Pck1.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Lipid homeostasis.</title><p>To investigate the effects of liver-specific PEPCK-C knockdown on lipid metabolism, several blood and liver parameters were analyzed. Serum triglycerides were pronouncedly reduced both in fed and fasted animals after PEPCK-C silencing in the liver, accompanied by decreased serum free fatty acids (FFAs) and increased &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate. Furthermore, a net increase in total serum cholesterol with a concomitant increase in HDL cholesterol was found (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Lipid accumulation in the liver is a characteristic of the diabetes phenotype in <italic>db/db</italic> mice. Oil-red staining demonstrated both micro- and macrovesicular lipid droplets in Ad-shCT&#x02013;treated livers, which are more profuse in Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic> group, especially in periportal compared with perivenous hepatocytes (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Consistently, we observed a moderate increase in hepatic triacylglycerol (TAG) and a 3.5-fold increase in liver fatty acid content after PEPCK-C silencing (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Meanwhile, the level of FAS mRNA was unaltered, whereas SREBP1-c and liver X receptor-&#x003b1; decreased &#x0223c;25&#x00025; (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). Correspondingly, the precursor (p125) and active form (p68) of SREBP1-c were reduced, whereas FAS protein content was unchanged (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). Moreover, mRNA and protein levels from glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes, such as glucokinase (<italic>Gck</italic>), <sc>l</sc>-PK, or malic enzyme (<italic>Mod1</italic>), were unaltered or significantly reduced (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>&#x02013;<italic>E</italic>).

Consistently, no accumulation of TCA intermediates, like acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, was observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, the expression profile of cytosolic (decreased) and mitochondrial (unaltered) superoxide dismutases (SODs) is compatible with increased peroxisomal oxidation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>) (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>).

An imbalance between these two pathways would, theoretically, alter cellular energy charge (CEC), unless a corresponding energy producing or consuming pathway compensates for such disequilibrium. Our data show an apparent reduction in gluconeogenesis while &#x003b2;-oxidation is maintained. Consistently, CEC was greatly increased because of a 25&#x00025; reduction of AMP and a 50&#x00025; increment in ATP content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). As a result, the master-switch energy sensor AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>), which is activated by decreasing energy charge, was not stimulated, as determined by the ratio of phosphorylated versus total AMPK (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>E</italic></xref>), and ACC, a target for AMPK, was not inhibited by phosphorylation (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>The work of Rodgers et al.

Therefore, we evaluated the levels of Sirt1 to investigate whether the pathway could be responsible for the coordinated reduction in gluconeogenic enzymes and regulatory factors.

Infection of <italic>db/db</italic> mice with adenovirus-directed shRNA allowed inhibition of PEPCK-C specifically in the liver, with unaltered levels in kidney and WAT, where PEPCK-C has important roles in gluconeogenesis from glutamine and glyceroneogenesis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>).</p><p>Inmunostaining experiments show a PEPCK-C gradient across the porto-central axis of the liver acinus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>).

Although similar silencing pattern and efficiency (&#x0223c;50&#x00025;) was obtained in our previous study on type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>) using a hydrodynamic gene transfer technique, the present report demonstrates that the use of adenovirus can result in an absolute higher silencing efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 1, which is detailed in an online appendix &#x0005b;available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1087">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1087</ext-link>&#x0005d;) and longer lasting effects (up to 2 weeks), which allowed us to evaluate the metabolic impact and underlying mechanisms of knocking down hepatic PEPCK-C in a type 2 diabetes model.</p><p>Mice with reduced PEPCK-C liver content showed a clear improvement in glucose tolerance and fed glycemia, comparable with the results of oral metformin treatment. However, fasting glucose was unchanged, even though HGO from pyruvate was clearly reduced. Compensatory HGO from glycogenolysis, as supported by reduced hepatic glycogen content in fasting and even in fed animals when silencing reached 90&#x00025; (Supplementary Fig. 1), could be responsible for unchanged fasting glycemia. Accordingly, fasting glycemia was significantly reduced in treated animals when PEPCK-C was 90&#x00025; silenced (Supplementary Fig. 1).</p><p>Improved glucose tolerance and insulinemia suggest increased peripheral insulin sensitivity. Lower insulin levels could be secondary to reduced glycemia; however, phloridzin treatment, which inhibits intestinal glucose uptake and renal reabsorption, has been shown to reduce glycemia with no effects on insulin sensitivity in a type 2 diabetes mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). Moreover, an ameliorated intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT) and higher insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in muscle and adipose tissue strongly support the hypothesis of an insulin-sensitizing effect. In adipose tissue, AKT phosphorylation at Thr 308 was unchanged by either treatment. However, it has been shown that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is independent of signaling through Thr<sup>308</sup> and closely matches Ser<sup>473</sup> AKT-P levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). The QUICKI index was also suggestive of an overall reduction in insulin resistance. In addition, hepatic PEPCK-C silencing improves clinical symptoms of type 2 diabetes, such as polydipsia, polyuria, and glycosuria, as revealed by metabolic cage studies (data not shown). Cross talking between liver and brain through the vagal nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>) could be responsible for a coordinated metabolic regulation in peripheral tissues in response to hepatic energy metabolism modulation, affecting systemic insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, despite hepatic lipid accumulation, AKT phosphorylation was also evident in the liver of PEPCK-C&#x02013;silenced mice. Hepatic lipidosis is commonly associated with the induction of insulin resistance through incompletely understood mechanisms. Recent reports have demonstrated that lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance is not mediated by fatty acid or TAG accumulation per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). Instead, diacylglycerol induces insulin resistance via activation of PKC&#x0025b; translocation to the vicinity of insulin receptor substrate-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). In agreement with AKT phosphorylation data, we have observed that PKC&#x0025b; is not modulated by PEPCK-C silencing, reinforcing the current view that lipid accumulation is not necessarily linked to insulin resistance in the liver.</p><p>Dislipidemia is associated with obesity and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). PEPCK-C silencing resulted in reduced plasma TAG, together with an important elevation of hepatic lipids, mainly nonsterified fatty acids. An important but not sufficiently appreciated role for PEPCK-C in the liver is glyceroneogenesis: the provision of glycerol-3-phosphate to sustain fatty acid re-esterification for triglyceride synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Therefore, PEPCK-C silencing could induce a significant reduction in fatty acid re-esterification activity. How to reconcile a concomitant increase in liver TAG and a reduction of TAG in plasma is not apparent. However, elevated fatty acids in the liver could be originated from excess import, reduced oxidation, and/or increased de novo synthesis. Results presented above support that PEPCK-C&#x02013;silenced livers maintain mitochondrial function. Long- and medium-chain fatty acid oxidation are highly regulated through PEPCK-C import into the mitochondria at the level of CPT-1. Reduced CPT-1 mRNA levels in PEPCK-C&#x02013;silenced animals, together with increased malonyl-CoA content, a potent allosteric inhibitor of CPT-1, provide indirect evidence for a slight inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. However, this allosteric inhibition can be overridden by fatty acid abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). Moreover, it is clear from our data that no blockade at the level of mitochondria is responsible for the accumulation of fatty acids because O<sub>2</sub> consumption in the presence of octanoate, which is imported into mitochondria independently of CPT-1, is unaffected in PEPCK-C&#x02013;silenced hepatocytes. Also, increased plasma ketones and cellular propionyl-CoA is suggestive of maintained mitochondrial and increased peroxisomal oxidation. Actually, after a low-dose ciprofibrate-mediated peroxisome proliferation, SOD expression is modulated with a similar pattern to that observed in our model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>).</p><p>The contribution of de novo lipogenesis to the accumulation of TAG and fatty acids seen in livers of Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic> treated mice can also be discarded. Key regulatory factors involved in lipogenesis were either maintained (ChREBP) or reduced (SREBP1c and LXR-&#x003b1;). Lipogenic enzymes regulated by these factors (ACC and FAS) were unaltered, suggesting a main contribution of ChREBP in gene expression regulation of these targets. Whether liver glucokinase (GK) might be a target gene for SREBP1c-mediated induction has remained controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). Our data revealed no alteration on GK mRNA or protein levels, suggesting that the LXR-&#x003b1;/SREBP1c axis is not directly regulating GK in our model, in agreement with results obtained by Mitro et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>) using a LXR-&#x003b1; agonist.</p><p>Fatty acid uptake and activation could instead contribute to the liver fat accumulation and to decreased serum TAG and FFA. FFA import and activation into the liver is an ATP-consuming step that could be sustained by the increased CEC. Therefore, lipid accumulation in the liver might be multifactorial, involving increased uptake from peripheral fat stores and reduced triglyceride synthesis, VLDL assembly, and export.</p><p>Liver-specific knockout animals are euglycemic and able to bypass the complete absence of PEPCK-C activity in their livers with extrahepatic gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Burgess et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>) have presented data demonstrating a weak flux control coefficient for gluconeogenesis in partial PEPCK-C knockout mice, suggesting that other factors like TCA cycle flux could contribute to gluconeogenic flux independent of PEPCK protein content. Because PEPCK-C is not only required for gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis but also for cataplerosis (i.e., the removal of citric acid cycle anions), the failure of this process would result in an impairment in the TCA cycle and mitochondrial function in the liver, leading to decreased &#x003b2;-oxidation and oxygen consumption, together with a complete derangement in energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). Data presented in this manuscript, together with our previous study in streptozotocin-induced diabetic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), demonstrate that a 50&#x00025; reduction of PEPCK expression results in reduced HGO and glycemia. In addition, mitochondrial respiration and CPT-1&#x02013;independent &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids is not affected, suggesting that TCA cycle flux was sustained as long as intermediates (acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA) were not accumulated and ketones were overproduced. The discrepancy among the various studies might be related to one of three factors. First, knockout mice have a complete ablation of the PEPCK-C gene in the liver, in contrast to the partial reduction in the enzyme described in this study. In fact, 90&#x00025; reduction in PEPCK-C protein levels in the liver, obtained with higher adenoviral dosage (Supplementary Fig. 1), reproduce the blockade on mitochondrial function observed in the knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). Second, adaptation to a lack of PEPCK-C in knockout animals as a consequence of deletion of the gene very early during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>) may induce a compensatory increase in gluconeogenesis in tissues other than the liver. In this regard, a recent study points to a disparity between results obtained from a liver <italic>Ppar-&#x003b1;</italic> knockout mouse and a short-term knockdown model using chemically modified siRNA against <italic>Ppar-&#x003b1;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). Third, studies on liver-specific knockout mice were directed toward understanding the physiological role of PEPCK-C in the liver. To our knowledge, liver PEPCK-C knockout animals have not been previously studied in relevant models of diabetes, such as the one presented in this study.</p><p>The coordinated regulation of several key players in energy homeostasis in the livers of Ad-sh<italic>Pck1</italic>&#x02013;treated animals is an intriguing observation. We have identified Sirt1 as a probable mediator in the response of the cell to a partial reduction in PEPCK-C content. A nutrient signaling response mediated by pyruvate induces Sirt1 protein in liver during fasting, where it interacts with and deacetylates PGC-1&#x003b1; in an NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent manner, increasing PGC-1&#x003b1; ability to coactivate HNF-4&#x003b1; and, therefore, upregulate gluconeogenic genes, but not mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). In addition, Sirt1-mediated deacetylation of FOXO1 has been shown to promote its transcriptional activity over gluconeogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>), suggesting an integrated regulation by insulin and Sirt1 over gluconeogenesis in treated animals. Moreover, Sirt1 transcription is inhibited by a NADH-mediated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). In this context, Sirt1 seems to function as a nutrient sensor by decoding fluctuations in cellular NADH levels. Therefore, our observation of a substantial reduction of Sirt1 identifies this nutrient sensor as a potential mediator of the coordinated downregulation of gluconeogenesis. Recent data from Sun et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>) have shown that oral administration of resveratrol, an activator of Sirt1, improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity mainly though its action on muscle. However, the potential for Sirt1 as a therapeutic target for diabetes in the liver is curtailed by its role in gluconeogenesis, as recently suggested by reduced HGO and improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in <italic>db/db</italic> mice after hepatic Sirt1 silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>).</p><p>All in all, we present evidence to sustain that partial silencing of liver PEPCK-C in <italic>db/db</italic> mice leads to improved control of glycemia, insulinemia, and peripheral sensitivity to the hormone through its coordinate inhibition of key players responsible for the activation of liver gluconeogenesis, in the absence of a blockade at the level of mitochondria. In addition, we show that this model represents a departure from the view, recently challenged, that steatosis leads to insulin resistance. Finally, our observations join the growing body of evidence that indicates that PEPCK-C plays a key role in the control of hepatic energy metabolism in type 2 diabetes animals, validating liver PEPCK-C as a target for pharmaceutical intervention. Nonetheless, in view of the known discrepancy between the large contribution of gluconeogenesis to hepatic glucose production in small rodent models as compared to large animals (i.e., canine, human) the suitability of the approach should be further tested in a larger animal model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db07-1087_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db07-1087_supp.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>A.G.G.V. has received a fellowship from IDIBELL.

Measurements of the different mitochondrial chain respiratory states were as follows: Routine respiration was measured in the presence of octanoate, followed by the inhibition of ATP synthase with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml oligomycin, and uncoupled respiration was initiated by the addition of 1 &#x003bc;mol/l FCCP followed by 5 &#x003bc;mol/l antimycin A to stop respiration.
