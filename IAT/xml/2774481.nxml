In addition, there is associated airway inflammation, which is usually eosinophilic, together with features of tissue repair known as remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. Airway remodelling in asthma encompasses several structural changes in the airway wall including reticular lamina and basement membrane thickening and increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. This latter feature is due to a combination of both ASM hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>] and hypertrophy, which increases with disease severity and is associated with fixed airflow obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>].</p><p>The cause of ASM hyperplasia in asthma is unknown and is often attributed to increased proliferation. Indeed proliferation is increased in <italic>ex vivo</italic> asthmatic ASM in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>] but not others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>], and several reports have been unable to demonstrate increased ASM proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. An alternative explanation is that ASM or its progenitors migrate to the ASM bundle. It is likely that this recruitment will require a chemotactic signal arising from the ASM. The C&#x02013;C and C&#x02013;X&#x02013;C chemokines, in particular, are attractive candidates as ASM chemoattractants. These ubiquitous, structurally related peptides mediate the chemotaxis of many cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]; play a key role in wound repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>] and in regulating cell survival and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. In asthma, ASM contributes to the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and is an important source of chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. However, in contrast to the extensive literature on ASM-derived chemokines there is a paucity of data describing the expression and function of ASM chemokine receptors. To date only CCR1, 3 and 7, and CXCR1 and 2 have been reported, but the relative contribution of these and possibly other chemokine receptors to ASM function in asthma is uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that: (i) ASM cells express a range of chemokine receptors, (ii) the pattern of expression is different in subjects with and without asthma, (iii) the chemokine receptors expressed are functional; promote ASM migration and repair, and modulate cell survival and proliferation. To test our hypothesis, we examined chemokine receptor expression and function using a variety of techniques in health and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Asthmatic subjects and non-asthmatic controls were recruited from Leicester, UK.

CCR3, 7, CXCR1, 3 and 4 were highly expressed, but expression was not different between asthmatics and controls. CXCR1, 3 and 4 were functional as evidenced by increased calcium response to ligand activation and promotion of wound healing. However, the effect of recombinant chemokines on wound healing was small and only inhibited by CXCR3 blockade. We have reported previously the ASM expression and function of CCR3 and 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. In contrast to our earlier findings for CCR3 and 7, activation of CXCR1, 3 and 4 did not mediate ASM migration, but consistent with the CC chemokine receptors, stimulation of the CXC chemokine receptors did not affect ASM proliferation or survival.</p><p>Our findings confirm that ASM express CCR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>], 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>], 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>] and CXCR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. We now extend this panel to include CCR4 and 6, CXCR3, 4 and 6. The chemokine receptors that were highly expressed were CCR3, 7, CXCR1, 3 and 4. Two previous studies have reported that ASM express CCR3, and CCL11 a ligand of CCR3, has the capacity to mediate ASM migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>]. ASM-derived CCL19, a CCR7 ligand, also mediates ASM migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. We report here for the first time that the CXC chemokine receptors may play a role, albeit minor, in tissue repair in response to injury as assessed by the wound-healing assay. This effect was most marked for CXCR3 as inhibition of this receptor inhibited wound healing in the presence and absence of exogenous chemokines, the latter indicating the involvement of ASM-derived chemokines. Interestingly, we have previously reported that CXCL10 was expressed preferentially by asthmatic ASM in bronchial biopsies and <italic>ex vivo</italic> cells compared with those from healthy control subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. This supports the view that the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis may play a role in wound repair and maintaining the ASM-bundle integrity. During airway inflammation ASM injury could occur due to the release of various mediators from inflammatory cells and injured epithelial cells, which could result in the expression of various proteins, including chemokines, by ASM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>]. Use of the wound-healing assay to mimic the ASM injury, which can occur during inflammation, is validated by the fact that disruption of the ASM monolayer results in the release/expression of a number of cytokines/chemokines that are also released/induced by inflammatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>].</p><p>We were unable to demonstrate a chemotactic response of ASM to the chemokines CXCL8&#x02013;12, suggesting that ASM CXC chemokine receptor expression does not contribute significantly to ASM recruitment. One previous report showed that CXCL8, a ligand for CXCR1, was chemotactic for ASM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>]. It is possible that the discrepancy between our findings and this earlier work and the chemotaxis vs. the wound-healing assays may reflect the relative sensitivity of the assays. However, we have consistently demonstrated that our chemotaxis assay identifies a clear response to PDGF, CCL11 and CCL19, so if our assay is too insensitive to detect a chemotactic response to the CXC chemokines this effect is likely to be very small and therefore of questionable biological importance. Whether the chemokine receptors that were not highly expressed by ASM play a role in ASM migration and wound healing remains unknown and warrants further investigation.</p><p>Chemokine receptors, including CXCR1, 3 and 4, have been implicated in the regulation, both positive and negative, of proliferation and survival in a number of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. Consequently they can play important roles in processes such as haematopoeisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>], inflammatory disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>] and the progression of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>], and provide potential therapeutic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>]. Whether chemokine receptors exert an effect on ASM survival or proliferation is uncertain. To date we are only aware of a single report examining this question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>] and in this report CCR3 activation did not affect survival or proliferation. We have extended this observation and using a combination of techniques we have been unable to find a role for CXCL8&#x02013;12 in either up- or down-regulating ASM proliferation or survival.</p><p>Increased ASM mass is a characteristic feature of asthma. The predominant mechanisms driving this ASM hyperplasia are unclear but will be due to increased proliferation, recruitment or prolonged survival of ASM cells either alone or in combination. Our current findings do not support a role for CXCR1, 3 or 4 in ASM migration, proliferation or survival. Earlier work has implicated CCR3 in ASM migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>]. However, recombinant and ASM-derived CCL11 was inactivated by &#x003b2;-tryptase and co-culture with mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>] and as mast cells are located within the ASM bundle in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>] this questions the importance of ASM CCR3 activation in disease. In contrast to the other chemokine receptors, we have reported that the CCR7/CCL19 axis is important for the migration of ASM cells towards mast cells and the ASM bundle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. Importantly, recent evidence also suggests a potential role for ASM progenitor recruitment; ASM progenitors (fibrocytes) are increased in number in the ASM bundle in severe asthma and migration is in part mediated by ASM-derived PDGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. Therefore, although ASM does express a wide panel of chemokine receptors, their potential function in modulating ASM hyperplasia appears to be limited, with CXCR3 and CCR7 mediating wound repair and CCR7 promoting ASM migration.</p><p>One potential criticism of our study is that we may have underestimated the importance of chemokine receptor function in ASM as we have not examined the effects following priming with pro-inflammatory cytokines, which play a role in disease, or the combined effects of several chemokines. However, we have shown that ASM chemokine receptor mRNA expression is not different between ASM from asthmatic and non-asthmatic subjects and is unaffected following incubation with poly(I:C) or HLMC lysates which mimic viral infection and the inflammatory milieu, respectively. Additionally, we have previously examined the effect of mast cell&#x02013;ASM interactions on ASM migration and this has highlighted the importance of the CCL19/CCR7 axis only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. We are therefore confident that it is unlikely that we have overlooked any biologically important effects of the other chemokine receptors expressed by ASM in the pathogenesis of asthma.</p><p>In conclusion, we have described the panel of chemokine receptors expressed by ASM from subjects with and without asthma. CCR3, 7, CXCR1, 3 and 4 were the most highly expressed receptors. Expression was not different between health and disease. Further study of the function of CXC chemokine receptors revealed that they are functional and mediate wound repair but not migration, proliferation or survival. This suggests that these chemokine receptors may modulate some aspects of ASM function, but does not support a key role for CXCR1, 3 or 4 in the development of ASM hyperplasia in asthma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Supported by Asthma UK, a Department of Health Clinician Scientist Award and Wellcome Trust.
