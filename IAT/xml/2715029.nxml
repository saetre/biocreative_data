However, the cellular mechanisms regulating IL-1&#x003b2; production in the skin of CAPS patients remain unclear. We identified mast cells (MCs) as the main cell population responsible for IL-1&#x003b2; production in the skin of CAPS patients. Unlike normal MCs that required stimulation with proinflammatory stimuli for IL-1&#x003b2; production, resident MCs from CAPS patients constitutively produced IL-1&#x003b2;. Primary MCs expressed inflammasome components and secreted IL-1&#x003b2; via NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain when stimulated with microbial stimuli known to activate caspase-1. Furthermore, MCs expressing disease-associated but not wild-type NLRP3 secreted IL-1&#x003b2; and induced neutrophil migration and vascular leakage, the histological hallmarks of urticarial rash, when transplanted into mouse skin. Our findings implicate MCs as IL-1&#x003b2; producers in the skin and mediators of histamine-independent urticaria through the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Urticaria, or hives, is a common disease that can affect up to 20% of the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Chronic urticaria, defined as urticaria that persists for &#x0003e;6 wk, occurs in 0.1% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), and in a significant percentage of cases (&#x0223c;40&#x02013;80%), there is no identifiable cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). H1 antihistamines have remained the first line of treatment because histamine release from cutaneous mast cells (MCs) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of urticaria development. However, only &#x0223c;55% of patients with chronic urticaria are responsive to antihistamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), suggesting that in a significant number of individuals, chronic urticaria is mediated via histamine-independent mechanisms.</p><p>An urticarial rash developing in the neonatal or early infantile period is one of the clinical manifestations characteristic of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). CAPS consists of a spectrum of hereditary periodic fever disorders that comprise three phenotypically overlapping but relatively distinct syndromes: familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (Mendelian inheritance in men number [MIM] 120100), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS; MIM 191900), and chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (MIM 607115), which is also known as neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease. Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and MWS are characterized by periodic attacks of urticarial rash, fever, and arthralgia, whereas patients with chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome, the most severe form of CAPS, exhibit chronic urticaria as well as fever, arthropathy, chronic meningitis, papilledema, growth and mental retardation, and hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). The urticarial rash observed in CAPS is similar to that associated with common urticaria. However, unlike the latter disorder, the rash observed in most CAPS patients responds to therapy with IL-1 receptor antagonist rather than antihistamines, suggesting that urticaria in these patients is mediated by IL-1. However, the cellular mechanism responsible for urticaria in CAPS patients remains poorly understood.</p><p>The mature form of IL-1&#x003b2; is produced by cleavage of the inactive pro&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; precursor by caspase-1, a protease activated by a large multiprotein complex termed the inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). CAPS is caused by missense mutations in the gene, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)&#x02013;leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) containing pyrin domain 3 (<italic>NLRP3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), whose product is a component of the inflammasome that includes the adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and procaspase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). NLRP3, a member of the NOD-like receptor family, is an intracellular receptor involved in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Although several microbial activators of NLRP3 have been reported, the precise mechanism by which the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by PAMPs remains poorly understood. In the presence of ATP or pore-forming molecules, several PAMPs, including LPS, muramyl dipeptide, bacterial mRNA, and the antiviral compound R837, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In addition to PAMPs, NLRP3 senses endogenous danger signals such as monosodium urate crystals and particulate matter including asbestos, silica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), and aluminum salts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Disease-associated NLRP3 mutations associated with CAPS localize to the centrally located NOD domain and constitutively activate caspase-1 to produce active IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). NLRP3 is predominantly expressed in monocytes, granulocytes, and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), but to date, no reports have investigated the cells in the skin that are involved in the development of urticarial rash associated with CAPS. Our study identifies resident MCs in the skin as a cell population capable of producing IL-1&#x003b2; via the NLRP3 inflammasome and provides evidence that MCs mediate urticarial rash via dysregulated IL-1&#x003b2; production in the skin of CAPS patients.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Resident MCs produce constitutively mature IL-1&#x003b2; in CAPS skin</title><p>To identify the source of IL-1&#x003b2; in the human skin, we performed immunolabeling of skin organ cultures with an antibody (Ab) that recognizes p17, the mature form of IL-1&#x003b2;.

In accordance with these results, R837 effectively induced intracellular processing of pro&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; into p17 in LPS-primed MCs, whereas secretion of mature IL-1&#x003b2; into the culture supernatant was more potently induced by ATP than by R837 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>).

K<sup>+</sup> efflux induced by ATP is important for caspase-1 activation via P2x7r (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), and this ion channel rapidly transitions to a pore-like structure that allows passage of molecules as large as 900 D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Notably, IL-1&#x003b2; secretion induced by ATP or R837 was completely abrogated when the MCs were incubated in medium containing a high K<sup>+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Furthermore, ATP induced large pore formation in MCs as determined by YoPro-1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, left), which was not observed in P2x7r-deficient MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, right). Unlike ATP, R837 did not induce large pore formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, left) even though R837 is structurally related to ATP. However, secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; induced by ATP required expression of P2x7r in LPS-stimulated MCs as well as that elicited by R837 was also dependent, at least in part, on P2x7r (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>).

MCs are known to promote inflammation and tissue remodeling in IgE-associated allergic disorders as well as to produce multiple cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, in response to microbial stimuli, although the mechanisms involved remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In this paper, we provide evidence that MCs express components of the inflammasome, and these factors are critical for the activation of caspase-1 and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion.</p><p>Our analysis revealed that Nlrp3 mutations associated with CAPS induce constitutive activation of the inflammasome in MCs, leading to dysregulated IL-1&#x003b2; production in the skin. These studies are consistent with a previous report that showed enhanced production of IL-1&#x003b2; in the skin of CAPS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), although the cellular source of IL-1&#x003b2; was not investigated by the authors. We showed that transfer of MCs expressing the CAPS-associated Nlrp3 mutant induces perivascular neutrophil-rich inflammation in the mouse skin, which is the histological hallmark of the urticarial rash observed in CAPS patients. Collectively, these studies implicate MCs in inflammasome activation and the pathogenesis of IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated disease in the skin. Because MCs reside in multiples tissues and also participate in experimental models of arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>) and encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), it is possible that these cells play a role in disease pathogenesis not only in the skin but also in the joints and central nervous system, which are also major disease targets in CAPS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Further studies are needed to better understand the contribution of MCs to IL-1&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated disease in autoinflammatory syndromes associated with NLRP3 mutations.</p><p>The mechanism by which NLRP3 mutations cause inflammatory diseases is still poorly understood. Studies in vitro suggested that these mutations exert a gain-of-function effect, probably through the loss of a regulatory step associated with NLRP3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Consistently, mouse Nlrp3 mutants, corresponding to those observed in human CAPS, induced constitutive Asc-dependent NF-&#x003ba;B activation and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. Notably, the increased production of IL-1&#x003b2; induced by CAPS-associated Nlrp3 mutants was abolished when their pyrin domain was deleted, which is in accordance with a critical role for that module in the interaction with caspase-1 and assembly of the inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>As is the case with macrophages, production of mature IL-1&#x003b2; via the Nlrp3/Asc inflammasome in mouse MCs required two signals, LPS and ATP or R837. Although a main function of LPS is to induce pro&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; production, LPS also promoted expression of <italic>Nlrp3</italic> in MCs, suggesting that LPS regulates inflammasome activation via several mechanisms in MCs. In macrophages, ATP-driven stimulation through the P2x7r is essential for caspase-1 proteolytic cleavage and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion via Nlrp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). The P2x7r forms a nonselective ion channel upon activation with ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) and upon stimulation mediates K<sup>+</sup> efflux, which may be important for Nlrp3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). This ion channel mediated by P2x7r rapidly transitions to a pore-like structure by recruiting the pannexin-1 pore, which allows passage of molecules as large as 900 D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Therefore, it is possible, as it has been proposed for macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), that ATP promotes passage of microbial ligands such as LPS via pannexin-1 to trigger inflammasome activation in MCs. Consistently, ATP did not induce caspase-1 activation alone and triggered large pore formation in MCs, and this activity was blocked in P2x7r-deficient MCs. Unlike ATP, however, R837 did not induce large pore formation but elicited IL-1&#x003b2; secretion, at least in part, through P2x7r. The role of P2x7r in mediating IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in response to R837 stimulation is consistent with the observation that high K<sup>+</sup> extracellular medium blocked IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in MCs. Collectively, these results suggest that ATP and R837 may promote inflammasome activation via different mechanisms in MCs, although both stimuli require P2x7r and K<sup>+</sup> efflux for effective IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in MCs.</p><p>We observed a reduction in the amounts of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 produced by MCs lacking <italic>Nlrp3</italic> compared with those from WT or Asc-deficient cells. The reason for this different regulation of cytokine secretion by Nlrp3 and Asc is unclear. One possibility is that Nlrp3 contributes to MC maturation in an Asc-independent manner. <italic>Nlrp3</italic> was first reported as an MC maturation&#x02013;inducible gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>) whose expression was increased after the maturation into MCs with a connective tissue phenotype. Our BMCMCs were cultured with IL-3 and stem cell factor, which partially induce connective tissue&#x02013;type maturation compared with the cells cultured with IL-3 alone. This possibility may explain, at least in part, why CAPS patients suffered from skin eruption but not asthma reaction or rhinitis, even though MCs in these tissues are likely to express the constitutively activated disease-associated NLRP3 mutation. However, no morphological and functional differences were observed between WT and Nlrp3-deficient MCs. Alternatively, Nlrp3 may directly or indirectly regulate cytokine production independently of the inflammasome in MCs.</p><p>CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants constitutively produced IL-1&#x003b2; in MCs of the skin of patients and when injected into mouse tissues. However, it remains unclear why MCs with constitutive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome produce mature IL-1&#x003b2; in the absence of LPS in patients given that microbial stimulation appears to be required for pro&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; production. One possibility is that CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants induce pro&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; via constitutive activation of NF-&#x003ba;B induction, which is consistent with results found in the current work and also reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Another possibility is that production of pro&#x02013;IL-1&#x003b2; is induced by endogenous or environmental cues operating in the skin independently of NLRP3. Consistent with this model, the characteristic skin rash observed in CAPS and systemic inflammatory syndromes often develops within the first few weeks of life when the skin is first exposed to environmental factors. These may include exposure to small amounts of LPS and/or other microbial stimuli after birth. The observation that skin abnormalities in incontinentia pigmenti (MIM 308300), an X-linked dominant inherited disorder caused by the mutation of <italic>NEMO,</italic> a gene that encodes the regulatory component of the I&#x003ba;B kinase complex responsible for the activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, commence at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>) is also consistent with this possibility.</p><p>Urticarial rash associated with CAPS is usually nonpruritic and unresponsive to antihistamines. This clinical observation is in accordance with our observation that NLRP3 inflammasome activation induces IL-1&#x003b2; secretion but not degranulation in MCs. Nonetheless, MCs expressing CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutant promoted vascular permeability, a cellular response also induced by histamine release, which is critical for wheal formation in vivo. Because many cases of non-CAPS urticaria are unresponsive to histamine receptor antagonists, it is possible that skin rash associated with histamine resistance is mediated via inflammasome activation in MCs. Thus, understanding the pathophysiology of CAPS may provide critical insight into more common diseases such as antihistamine-refractory urticaria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents.</title><p>Ultrapure LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O55:B5), ATP, and MG-132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
