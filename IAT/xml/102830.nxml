This molecule is converted to ADP-ribose 1&#x02033;-phosphate (Appr-1&#x02033;p) by the action of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CPDase). Comparison of the previously cloned CPDase from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with proteins having related cyclic phosphodiesterase or RNA ligase activities revealed two histidine-containing tetrapeptides conserved in these enzyme families. Using the consensus phosphodiesterase signature, we have identified the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> open reading frame <italic>YGR247w</italic> as encoding CPDase. The bacterially expressed yeast protein, named Cpd1p, is able to hydrolyze Appr&#x0003e;p to Appr-1&#x02033;p. Moreover, as with the previously characterized <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and wheat CPDases, Cpd1p hydrolyzes nucleosides 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates (N&#x0003e;p) to nucleosides 2&#x02032;-phosphates.

Site-directed mutagenesis of individual amino acids within the two conserved tetrapeptides showed that H<sub>40</sub> and H<sub>150</sub> residues are essential for CPDase activity. Deletion analysis has indicated that the <italic>CPD1</italic> gene is not important for cellular viability. Likewise, overexpression of Cpd1p had no effect on yeast growth. These results do not implicate an important role for Appr&#x0003e;p or Appr-1&#x02033;p in yeast cells grown under standard laboratory conditions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Splicing of pre-tRNAs is initiated by endonucleolytic cleavages that lead to the removal of the intron and the generation of two tRNA half molecules. In yeast and plants, the two tRNA halves are ligated via an unusual 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032; phosphodiester, 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoester linkage (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c2">2</xref>). In the following maturation steps, the 2&#x02032;-phosphate is removed from the spliced tRNA. This reaction is catalyzed by a specific phosphotransferase which transfers the 2&#x02032; phosphate to an NAD to produce ADP-ribose 1&#x02033;,2&#x02033;-cyclic phosphate (Appr&#x0003e;p) and nicotinamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c4">4</xref>). The resulting Appr&#x0003e;p is then converted to ADP-ribose 1&#x02033;-phosphate (Appr-1&#x02033;p) by the action of a specific phosphodiesterase referred to as a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPDase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f1">1</xref>). The tRNA splicing pathway described above is also conserved in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c8">8</xref>), although in these organisms, most of the tRNA splicing involves another RNA ligase. This ligase, to date identified only in vertebrates, joins the two tRNA exons by the regular 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c10">10</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f1">1</xref>). The finding that the 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester, 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoester-forming pathway functions in vertebrates as a redundant route of tRNA splicing led to speculations that production of Appr&#x0003e;p and&#x0002f;or Appr-1&#x02033;p might be important for the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>).</p><p>CPDase activity has been previously identified in yeast, wheat and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>). The cDNA encoding the CPDase in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been cloned and the enzyme biochemically characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>); the overexpressed and purified <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein has similar substrate specificity to the enzyme purified previously from wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c11">11</xref>). Both enzymes hydrolyze Appr&#x0003e;p and nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates (N&#x0003e;p) to Appr-1&#x02033;p and nucleoside 2&#x02032;-phosphates (N2&#x02032;p), respectively. CPDase partially purified from yeast was found to be highly specific for Appr&#x0003e;p: no hydrolysis of N&#x0003e;p to N2&#x02032;p by the yeast enzyme could be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c5">5</xref>). Apart from the apparent higher substrate specificity of the yeast protein, the plant and yeast enzymes share many biochemical properties, suggesting that they belong to the same family of proteins. Despite these similarities, a search of the yeast databank with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein sequence as a query did not identify a candidate gene encoding the CPDase in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>).</p><p>In this work we have compared sequences of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CPDase with other proteins having 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic nucleotide 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase or related activities, and identified two histidine-containing tetrapeptides, which are highly conserved in this family of enzymes. Using the consensus phosphodiesterase signature, we have identified the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae YGR247w</italic> as a gene encoding CPDase. We demonstrate that the yeast enzyme has similar properties to the previously characterized plant CPDases. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that two conserved His residues of the CPDase signature are essential for enzyme activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and media</title><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strain BMA41 (<italic>MATa&#x0002f;MAT</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>leu2-3,112</italic>, <italic>his3-11</italic>, <italic>ade2-1</italic>, <italic>ura3-1</italic>, <italic>trp1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>can1-100</italic>) was used.

The gene encoding the related protein, with 56&#x00025; identity and 66&#x00025; similarity to AtCPDase1 and referred to as AtCPDase2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f3">3</xref>), has been subsequently sequenced within the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c22">22</xref>). Since this gene is positioned immediately downstream of the AtCPDase1 gene, within the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, it was likely formed by DNA duplication and encodes a protein with properties similar to AtCPDase1. Inspection of amino acid sequences of both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins revealed that they have two His residue-containing tetrapeptides which are also conserved, in terms of both sequence and approximate spacing, in two other families of enzymes with either 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic nucleotide 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase or related activities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f2">2</xref>). The first family corresponds to RNA ligases involved in tRNA splicing. The C-terminal domains of these enzymes have phosphodiesterase activity that opens the terminal cyclic phosphate in RNA into the 2&#x02032;-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c23">23</xref>); for the tRNA splicing ligase from wheat germ, it has been demonstrated that the enzyme also inefficiently hydrolyzes 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic mononucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c11">11</xref>). To the second family belong prokaryotic RNA ligases which are able to ligate tRNA half molecules containing 2,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate and 5&#x02032;-OH termini to products containing the 2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c25">25</xref>). Physiological substrates of these enzymes are not known. Although these enzymes have not been demonstrated to have a cyclic 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase activity, it is likely, based on the structure of the ligation product, that the reaction they catalyze involves hydrolysis of the 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate into 2&#x02032;-phosphate. Moreover, brain CNPases, which hydrolyze cyclic 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-phosphates into 2&#x02032;-phosphates in mono- or oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c28">28</xref>, and references therein), contain two conserved tetrapeptide sequences that are similar to those of the proteins described above. While the second tetrapeptide conforms with the consensus derived from other three classes, the first one deviates from the consensus in the second and fourth amino acid position (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f2">2</xref>).

The purified recombinant His-tagged protein was tested for phosphodiesterase activity using different cyclic nucleotides as substrates. The yeast protein converted Appr&#x0003e;p to the product which chromatographs in two different TLC systems with an identical mobility to that of Appr-1&#x02033;p, obtained by the hydrolysis of Appr&#x0003e;p by the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CPDase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f4">4</xref>A). Moreover, the product of Appr&#x0003e;p hydrolysis by the yeast enzyme migrated differently from Appr-2&#x02033;p generated by treatment of Appr&#x0003e;p with RNase T2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f4">4</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c5">5</xref>). The yeast protein also hydrolyzed all four nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates to the corresponding 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoesters; no formation of nucleoside 3&#x02032;-phosphates was detected.

The rate of A&#x0003e;p hydrolysis was similar at 30 and 37&#x000b0;C, and &#x0223c;2-fold slower at 4&#x000b0;C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f5">5</xref>B). The kinetic parameters, <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>, were calculated for Appr&#x0003e;p and four nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd302tb1">1</xref>). As based on <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub><italic>&#x0002f;K</italic><sub>m</sub> values, the yeast CPDase has the following specificity towards cyclic nucleotides: Appr&#x0003e;p:A&#x0003e;p:C&#x0003e;p:U&#x0003e;p:G&#x0003e;p &#x0003d; 100:43:30:20:16. Thus, the enzyme has a small preference for Appr&#x0003e;p over N&#x0003e;p.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional analysis</title><p>To find out whether the <italic>CPD1</italic> gene is essential, a null allele was created using a one-step disruption procedure. The DNA fragment carrying the <italic>TRP1</italic> marker flanked by 50 bp-long sequences corresponding to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; untranslated regions of <italic>CPD1</italic>, was transformed into the diploid BMA41 strain. Tryptophan prototrophs were selected and subjected to PCR and Southern blotting analysis. Of the 20 transformants analyzed, 18 showed the expected profile for the strain heterozygous for <italic>CPD1</italic>. Three of the heterozygous diploids (<italic>CPD1&#x0002f;cpd1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>::TRP1</italic>) were sporulated and 40 asci dissected, most of which gave rise to complete tetrads showing 2:2 segregation of trp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>:trp<sup>&#x02013;</sup>. Hence, <italic>CPD1</italic> is not essential for cellular viability.</p><p>The growth of the <italic>CPD1</italic>-disrupted and wild-type (wt) haploid strains was assessed on different standard media (complete fermentable, complete non-fermentable and minimal SD medium) at 16, 28 and 37&#x000b0;C. No differences could be detected. Since phosphodiesterases converting cyclic phosphodiesters into phosphatase-sensitive monoesters may represent catabolic enzymes replenishing the cellular phosphate pool, we have measured growth of the <italic>cpd1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>::TRP1</italic> strain on a phosphate-free medium. Two <italic>CPD1</italic> and two independent <italic>cpd1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>::TRP1</italic> strains were pre-grown in a complete medium and then spotted in 10 serial dilutions onto a minimal medium with or without a phosphate. No differences in growth of the wt and mutant strains could be detected (data not shown).</p><p>We determined whether deletion of <italic>CDP1</italic> entirely eliminates the ability of yeast extracts to hydrolyze Appr&#x0003e;p and A&#x0003e;p. Extracts were prepared from haploid <italic>cpd1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>::TRP1</italic> and <italic>CPD1</italic> wt strains obtained from a complete tetrad. Only extracts of the two strains carrying the <italic>CPD1</italic> gene hydrolyzed Appr&#x0003e;p (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f6">6</xref>), suggesting that <italic>CPD1</italic> is the only gene in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> to encode an Appr&#x0003e;p cyclic phosphodiesterase. We have found that the product of Appr&#x0003e;p hydrolysis, Appr-1&#x02033;p, is converted during incubation with the extract to another compound, co-migrating during TLC analysis with ADP-ribose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f6">6</xref> and data not shown). Thus, yeast cells are likely to contain a phosphatase removing the monoester phosphate group resulting from hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate in Appr&#x0003e;p. Comparison of <italic>cpd1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>::TRP1</italic> and wt strain extracts for activity to hydrolyze A&#x0003e;p revealed that Cpd1p is not the only phosphodiesterase able to hydrolyze A&#x0003e;p to A2&#x02032;p. Low levels of such activity were also present in extracts from <italic>CPD1</italic> deleted strains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f6">6</xref>B). Significantly, however, extracts from wt strains yielded more A2&#x02032;p than those from strains deleted in <italic>CPD1</italic>, further demonstrating that Cpd1p hydrolyzes not only Appr&#x0003e;p but also nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates to N2&#x02032;p. Interestingly, extracts from both <italic>cpd1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>::TRP1</italic> and wt strains also contained phosphodiesterase activity converting A&#x0003e;p to the product comigrating with A3&#x02032;p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f6">6</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Site-directed mutagenesis of the CPDase signature</title><p>We have investigated whether two tetrapeptide regions conserved among different classes of 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic nucleotide 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterases or related enzymes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f2">2</xref>) are important for the activity of Cpd1p. The amino acids that form part of the tetrapeptides or are adjacent to them (P<sub>38</sub>, H<sub>39</sub>, V<sub>40</sub>, T<sub>41</sub>, V<sub>42</sub>, T<sub>43</sub>, P<sub>149</sub>, H<sub>150</sub>, V<sub>151</sub>, S<sub>152</sub> and L<sub>153</sub>) were individually mutagenized to alanine. Mutant proteins were overexpressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified on NTA-Ni columns. They were first tested for A&#x0003e;p hydrolysis under limiting (10 min incubation) and exhaustive (60 min incubation) conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f7">7</xref>A and B, respectively). No hydrolysis of A&#x0003e;p could be detected in reactions containing mutants H<sub>39</sub> and H<sub>150</sub>, and mutations T<sub>41</sub> and S<sub>152</sub> strongly decreased activity of the enzyme. Quantitative determinations, using a phosphate release assay (Materials and Methods), indicated that mutations H<sub>39</sub> and H<sub>150</sub> lower activity of Cpd1p at least 1000-fold, while T<sub>41</sub> and S<sub>152</sub> mutants have 2 and 30&#x00025; of the wt protein activity, respectively (data not shown). Other mutations had no significant effect on Cpd1p activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f7">7</xref>, and data not shown). When mutant proteins were tested with Appr&#x0003e;p as a substrate, mutants H<sub>39</sub> and H<sub>150</sub> were again found to be inactive. Interestingly, mutants T<sub>41</sub> and S<sub>152</sub> were considerably more active with Appr&#x0003e;p than A&#x0003e;p as a substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f7">7</xref>C). Quantitative determinations by the inorganic phosphate assay indicated that the T<sub>41</sub> mutant has 49&#x00025; activity of the wt protein whereas activities of S<sub>152</sub> and a wt protein are identical when Appr&#x0003e;p is used as a substrate (data not shown). Hence, residues T<sub>41</sub> and S<sub>152</sub> are likely to play a role in substrate recognition rather than the catalysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In all eukaryotes, splicing of tRNAs via the 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester, 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoester-forming pathway yields tRNA intermediates with a 2&#x02032;-phosphate at the splice junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c2">2</xref>). This 2&#x02032;-phosphate is removed by the specific phosphotransferase and transferred to an NAD acceptor to produce Appr&#x0003e;p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c3">3</xref>). The latter product is further converted to Appr-1&#x02033;p by the action of the cyclic phosphodiesterase previously identified in yeast, wheat and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c11">11</xref>). The cDNA encoding the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CPDase has been cloned and its product (AtCPDase1) biochemically characterized. In addition to Appr&#x0003e;p, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CPDase, and also its wheat counterpart, hydrolyze all 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic nucleotides to the corresponding nucleoside 2&#x02032;-phosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>). A second gene encoding a related protein to AtCPDase1 and referred to as AtCPDase2, has been subsequently sequenced within the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome project.</p><p>By aligning the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CPDases with three other families of enzymes having either 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic nucleotide 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase or related activities, we identified two tetrapeptide sequences, which are conserved in this class of proteins. Using the derived signature, H&#x0005b;ILVMF&#x0005d;T&#x0005b;LVM&#x0005d; &#x0005b;X<sub>66&#x02013;107</sub>&#x0005d;H&#x0005b;ILVM&#x0005d;&#x0005b;TS&#x0005d;&#x0005b;ILV&#x0005d;, as a profile to search sequence databases, we identified the gene <italic>YGR247w</italic> as a candidate gene encoding the CPDase in yeast. We found that the encoded protein indeed has cyclic phosphodiesterase activity with substrate specificity similar to that of the previously characterized <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and wheat enzymes. When this work had been nearly completed, Martzen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c31">31</xref>) also reported identification of <italic>YGR247w</italic> as the CPDase gene by a biochemical genomics approach, based on assaying biochemical activities of all yeast ORFs expressed as GST fusions.</p><p>The bacterially overexpressed yeast protein hydrolyzed Appr&#x0003e;p and nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates to Appr-1&#x02033;p and N2&#x02032;p, respectively. Based on relative <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>&#x0002f;<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values, the specificity of the yeast CPDase towards the cyclic nucleotides is Appr&#x0003e;p:A&#x0003e;p:C&#x0003e;p:U&#x0003e;p:G&#x0003e;p &#x0003d; 100:43:30:20:16. Hence, the enzyme has a small preference for Appr&#x0003e;p over nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates. Notably, the yeast, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and wheat enzymes hydrolyze different nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates with the same order of preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c11">11</xref>; this work).</p><p>The demonstration that Cpd1p utilizes both Appr&#x0003e;p and nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates as substrates is in disagreement with previous findings indicating that crude or partially purified preparations of the yeast phosphodiesterase hydrolyze Appr&#x0003e;p but not nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c5">5</xref>). It is unlikely that the enzyme studied previously and that reported in this work represent two different proteins. We have demonstrated that extracts prepared from strains deleted for the <italic>CPD1</italic> gene are devoid of activity to hydrolyze Appr&#x0003e;p. Moreover, Culver <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c5">5</xref>) have previously shown that the Appr&#x0003e;p cyclic phosphodiesterase activity detectable in yeast extracts also appears to be due to only one protein species. We have investigated whether the apparent discrepancy between the previous and current results may result from the presence in the extract of an inhibitor preventing hydrolysis of N&#x0003e;p but not Appr&#x0003e;p. We have found that crude extracts of yeast cells indeed hydrolyze A&#x0003e;p to A2&#x02032;p with the efficiency which, relative to the hydrolysis of Appr&#x0003e;p, is lower than that of the purified recombinant enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f6">6</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd302tb1">1</xref>). However, the <italic>CPD1</italic>-gene-dependent hydrolysis of A&#x0003e;p to A2&#x02032;p in extracts was clearly apparent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f6">6</xref>). It is possible that partially purified CPDase fractions investigated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c5">5</xref>), prepared from the yeast strain other than that used in this work, contained inhibitory factors interfering with the hydrolysis of nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates.</p><p>To assess the importance of the CPDase signature for enzymatic activity, all residues within the two conserved tetrapeptides of Cpd1p were individually mutated to alanine. Mutations of the two conserved histidine residues, H<sub>39</sub> or H<sub>150</sub>, resulted in a very strong inhibition of activity of the enzyme to hydrolyze A&#x0003e;p and Appr&#x0003e;p. Mutations of T<sub>41</sub> and S<sub>152</sub> inactivated the enzyme partially and their effect on A&#x0003e;p hydrolysis was much more pronounced than on Appr&#x0003e;p hydrolysis. Hence, it is possible that T<sub>41</sub> and S<sub>152</sub> are involved in substrate recognition rather than the catalysis. Ballestro <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c28">28</xref>) have recently analyzed, by mutagnesis, the sequence <sup>330</sup>GSRAHVTLGCSAGV<sup>343</sup> of the zebrafish zRICH phosphodiesterase, a protein homologous to mammalian brain CNPases. The investigated sequence was identified as a region conserved in all CNPases with similarity to the active site motif of &#x003b2;-ketoacyl synthases. Although this analysis did not provide evidence of the expected relationship, two of the point mutations analyzed, H<sub>334</sub>A and T<sub>336</sub>A, inactivated the zebrafish enzyme. Significantly, H<sub>334</sub> and T<sub>336</sub> represent two conserved residues of the C-terminus-proximal tetrapeptide identified in CPDases and CNPases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd302f2">2</xref>). Hence, His and Ser&#x0002f;Thr residues of the proposed signature may indeed be universally important for enzymatic activity of the 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic nucleotide 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterases and related enzymes discussed in this work. Interestingly, two His residues conserved in many cyclizing ribonucleases likewise play critical roles in catalysis (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c33">33</xref>).</p><p>The tRNA-splicing pathway generating the 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester, 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoester bond and, consequently, Appr&#x0003e;p, also functions in vertebrates, even though most of the tRNA splicing in these organisms occurs via another pathway (Introduction). These findings led to speculations that production of Appr&#x0003e;p and&#x0002f;or Appr-1&#x02033;p might be important for the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>). Other NAD or ADP-ribose derivatives, such as nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), have been recently shown to act as intracellular messengers mobilizing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from intracellular stores in animal and plant cells (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c35">35</xref>). Although we have reported previously that Appr&#x0003e;p and Appr-1&#x02033;p neither affect nor modify Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release in sea urchin egg homogenates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c6">6</xref>), cloning of <italic>CPD1</italic> provided the possibility to investigate whether these compounds have any other biological function. We found that the <italic>CPD1</italic> gene is not essential for cellular viability and that the <italic>cpd1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>::TRP1</italic> strain is at no disadvantage when grown at different temperatures on rich or minimal media, and with or without phosphate (Results). Since&#x000a0;Cpd1p appears to be the only phosphodiesterase able to hydrolyze Appr&#x0003e;p in yeast cells, these results suggest that formation of Appr-1&#x02033;p is not essential for yeast growth under standard laboratory conditions. We have also found that overproduction of Cpd1p in strains transformed with multicopy 2&#x000b5; plasmids expressing Cpd1p from either <italic>GAL10</italic> or its own promoter, a condition that should deplete Appr&#x0003e;p, has no effect on yeast growth in standard media (data not shown).</p><p>The <italic>YGR247w</italic> gene was recently identified in a screen designed to identify genes whose expression elicits the SOS response in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd302c36">36</xref>). The genes of the SOS system in bacteria are generally induced by agents that damage DNA or inhibit its metabolism, or play a role in DNA metabolism and&#x0002f;or genome stability. We checked whether the <italic>CPD1</italic> deletion has any effect on growth and viability of yeast cells treated with a DNA-damaging agent such as UV (254 nm) light. No effect could be detected with cells grown on YPD and treated with different doses of UV light (our unpublished results).</p><p>In summary, the current results do not implicate an important role for Appr&#x0003e;p or Appr-1&#x02033;p in yeast cells grown under standard laboratory conditions. Other approaches, such as a search for mutations which are synthetic lethal with a <italic>CPD1</italic> deletion, might provide more insight into the role of Cpd1p and, consequently, Appr&#x0003e;p and Appr-1&#x02033;p, in the cell. It is possible that Cpd1p, and its counterparts in other organisms, are only responsible for catabolism of Appr&#x0003e;p and nucleoside 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphates generated as products of tRNA splicing and endonucleolytic degradation of RNA by cyclizing ribonucleases, respectively.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd302f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> tRNA splicing pathways in eukaryotes.
