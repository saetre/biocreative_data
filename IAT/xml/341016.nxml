Here we emphasise features of H1 and H5 genes relevant to their expression in the chicken genome. Of particular note is an H1 gene-specific 5' element, 5' AAACACA 3' found upstream of all H1 genes studied to date. This "H1-box" is not found in the related H5 gene, which is expressed only in erythroid cells. A second aspect relates to generation of histone mRNA 3' termini. The H5 gene is shown to contain a remnant of the dyad symmetry element (as well as other conserved sequences) associated with core and H1-histone gene transcript 3' processing. However, it appears as if H5 has evolved a different mechanism in which the mRNA terminus (which is polyadenylated) is displaced downstream from the dyad element. The two clear differences noted here have the potential to affect transcriptional (H1-box) and post-transcriptional (3' terminus processing) regulation of H1 and H5 gene expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00296-0268.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="585"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00296-0269.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="586"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00296-0270.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="587"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00296-0271.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="588"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00296-0272.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="589"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00296-0273.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="590"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00296-0274.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="591"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00296-0275.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="592"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00296-0276.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="593"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00296-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="594"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
