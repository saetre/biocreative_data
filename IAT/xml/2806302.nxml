It is an oligosaccharide with two fucoses, and its chemical structure is Fuc&#x003b1;1 &#x02192; 2Gal&#x003b2;1 &#x02192; 4 [Fuc&#x003b1;1 &#x02192; 3]GlcNAc&#x003b2;1 &#x02192; R, belonging to the A, B, H, Lewis blood group antigens family with specific fucosylation of the terminal end of carbohydrate structure catalyzed by the &#x003b1;1,2-fucosyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The expression of Lewis y antigen primarily occurs during the embryogenesis period. Under physiologic conditions, its expression in adults is limited on the surface of granulocytes and epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, elevated expression of Lewis y has been found in 70-90% of the human carcinomas of epithelial cell origin, including breast, ovary, prostate, colon cancers, and the high expression level is correlated to the tumor's pathological staging and prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has been reported that the Lewis y antigen was expressed on a number of different molecular carriers, including 2 major ovarian cancer antigens (CA<sub>125 </sub>and MUC-1), suggesting the high incidence of Lewis y in ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>We have established the stable ovarian cancer cell line with high expression of Lewis y, RMG-I-H, through gene transfection technique to introduce the gene of human &#x003b1;1,2-fucosyltransferase (&#x003b1;1,2-FT) into the ovarian cancer cell line RMG-I in our previous works. We found that the RMG-I-H cells become highly tolerant to the anti-tumor drugs, 5-fluorouracil, carboplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It suggested that the Lewis y antigen possessed the function of boosting the survival ability of ovarian cancer cells.</p><p>Activation of the PI3K pathway supports survival and proliferation of multiple cell lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. PI3K activation results in the localized increase of phosphorylated lipid second messengers at the plasma membrane. Key signaling intermediates are then recruited to the phosphorylated lipids via specialized lipid-binding domains, pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and are themselves activated to initiate further signaling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. One key effector molecule that is activated in this manner is the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which, when localized to products of PI3K activation, is able to phosphorylate multiple downstream substrates that mediate cell growth, survival, and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Studies found that soluble Lewis y antigen (4A11) or its glucose analog, H-2 g, effect angiogenesis by inducing VEGF expression and signaling through PI3K pathway in the angiogenesis-rich rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Here we report that the cell proliferation of ovarian cancer cell line RMG-I sped up as the Lewis y antigen was increased. The phosphorylation level of Akt was apparently elevated in Lewis y-overexpressing cells. The inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, dramatically inhibited the growth of Lewis y-overexpressing cells. Taken together, Lewis y antigen stimulates the growth of ovarian cancer cells through activating PI3K/Akt signal-transduction pathway. Potential treatment strategies through the inhibition of PI3K signaling pathway to target Lewis y signals may provide a useful approach for therapy of ovarian tumor growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The human ovarian cancer cell line, RMG-I, which was established from the tissues of human ovarian clear cell carcinoma, donated by Professor Iwamori Masao of Tokyo University of Japan.

Glycosylation reactions are catalyzed by the actions of glycosyltransferases, sugar chains being added to various complex carbohydrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. An increasing body of evidence indicates that sugar chains in glycoproteins are involved in the regulation of cellular functions including cell-cell communication and signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Research shows that 75% of ovarian cancers have varying degree of Lewis y overexpression, and increased expression is associated with poor prognosis of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In our previous study, we introduced &#x003b1;1,2-FT gene into human ovarian cancer cell line RMG-I through gene transfection and established cell model overexpressing &#x003b1;1,2-FT gene and Lewis y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Here by comparing cell proliferation status before and after transfection, we found that cell proliferation after gene transfection was accelerated. To further test the role of Lewis y in ovarian cancer cell proliferation, we treat Lewis y-overexpressing RMG-I-H ovarian cancer cells with &#x003b1;-L-fucosidase for the first time, which reducing the content of fucosylated antigens on cell surface. Through observing biological behaviors of cell before and after &#x003b1;-L-fucosidase treatment, we found the cell proliferation rate in transfected group was significantly higher than that of &#x003b1;-L-fucosidase-treatment group. Our preliminary study proved that the lactose type I chain family of the original RMG-I cells was primarily glycolipid, and they were Lc<sub>4</sub>Cer, Lewis a, and Lewis b, whereas, H-1 instead had the absolute domination in the successfully transfected cells. For the glycolipids of the lactose type II chain family, such as Lewis x, Lewis y, IV<sup>3</sup>NeuAc-nLc<sub>4</sub>Cer and NeuAc-Le<sup>X</sup>, their concentrations were over 0.01 &#x003bc;g per milliliter of dry cells; however, the glycolipids shown in the transfected RMG-I-H cells were Lewis x and Lewis y. 42.6% of Lewis x in the RMG-I-H was converted into Lewis y, which was in much higher percentage than the 3.2% of the original RMG-I cells. Although type I chain family H-1 had the absolute domination in the transfected RMG-I-H cells, its actual content was only 1/4 of the Lewis y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These further proved that the changes of biological behaviors of RMG-I-H cells, such as enhancement of proliferation and growth, as well as the worsening in the severity of malignancy, all had to do with the increase in Lewis y antigen. Blocking experiments with Lewis y specific monoclonal antibody provided further evidence for its function.</p><p>The molecular mechanism by which Lewis y antigen causes the malignancy of ovarian cancer cell have not been completely understood. In previous studies, we tested the differences in oncogene expression before and after &#x003b1;1,2-FT gene transfection using gene chips technology. Results showed that: there were 88 differentially expressed genes after cell transfection, and altered genes mainly involved these genes regulating cell proliferation, signal transduction, transcription and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that Lewis y may be an important component in signaling transduction pathway participating in signal transduction inside cell and further promoting proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Studies found that anti-Lewis y antibodies (ABL364 and IGN311) blocked the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in A431 cells and prevented cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The MAPK signaling pathway has central roles in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation and our experimental results have further verified this conclusion. Our study found that the tyrosine phosphorylation level of MAPK after &#x003b1;1,2-FT gene transfection increased than that of before transfection in ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells (in press). In addition to MAPK pathway, the PI3K/Akt pathway is another critical pathway involved in cell survival and has been shown to be constitutivelsy active in ovarian cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, little is known about the relation of Lewis y and the PI3K/Akt pathway in the development and management of ovarian cancer. In an effort to understand the mechanism of action of Lewis y, we focused on investigating its effect on the PI3K/Akt pathway. In this study, we found the PI3K/Akt pathway was aberrantly activited by Lewis y antigen and PI3K/Akt pathway is necessary for Lewis y enhancing growth of RMG-I cells. It was verified by (1) increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt in &#x003b1;1,2-FT transfected cells. (2) blockage of cell surface Lewis y by anti-Lewis y antibody resulted in significant attenuation of the phosphorylation of Akt, as well as the difference in phosphorylation intensity among two cell lines. (3) in the presence of PI3K inhibitor LY294002, Lewis y no longer conferred a growth advantage in RMG-I-H cell. One of the crucial downstream targets of PI3K is the serine/threonine kinase Akt. Active Akt causes a variety of biological effects, including suppression of apoptosis by phosphorylation and inactivation of several targets along pro-apoptotic pathways. In particular, activated Akt is able to phosphorylate a variety of downstream substrates, e.g., Raf and I-K (a kinase that regulates the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A number of studies have demonstrated that the patients with increased p-Akt had a significant survival disadvantage compared to patients with lower Akt phosphorylation, and the patients with ovarian cancer suggested p-Akt overexpression as an independent prognostic indicator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that overexpression of Lewis y antigen could significantly enhance proliferation of ovarian cancer cells through upregulating PI3K/Akt pathway.</p><p>Lewis y is mainly distributed at the plasma membrane of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and carried by different glycolipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and glycoproteins, such as CD44v6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], Muc6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], which are related to carcinogenesis. Studies showed that changes in glycosyltransferase expression might affect structure of carbohydrate chains on cell surface receptors and therefore impacted the expression and function of those glycoprotein receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It has been reported that transfection of the sense cDNA of <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase(GnT)-V, an enzyme associated with cancer progression and metastasis, into human H7721 hepatocarcinoma cells resulted in an increase in the level of GlcNAc&#x003b2;1,6 Man&#x003b1;1,6-branch (GnT-V product) on the N-glycans of EGFR, this promoted the tyrosine autophosphorylation of EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. From the above we speculate that there might be one possibility implicated in the mechanism that Lewis y antigen activates PI3K pathway. The over-expression of &#x003b1;1,2-FT cDNA results in the elevation of Lewis y content on some surface receptors, which might alter the comformation of the receptors, then promoting the signaling of the receptor and finally stimulating the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Our studies have found that the total amount of surface Lewis y as well as the Lewis y content on some surface receptors were all increased, and Lewis y expression on EGFR was very high on &#x003b1;1,2-FT-transfected cells (in press).</p><p>Cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and the Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling pathways has been implied in human various malignant tumors, with some research stating that PI3K activity is essential for induction of Raf/MEK/MAPK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Additional studies suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway enhances and/or synergizes with Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling to provide a more robust survival signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We speculate whether such cross-talk between the two pathways also exists in Lewis y-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells, and whether Lewis y is the key point for triggering or regulating this cross-talk, the detailed mechanism requires further study.</p><p>The changes in glycosyltransferase expression might affect the sugar chain heterogeneity and distribution, which may mask some tumor antigens, reduce the immunogenicity of tumor cells, and promote tumor cells immune evasion. It has been confirmed that under normal circumstances, T lymphocytes do not recognize Lewis y antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This allows the evasion of tumor cells from the recognition and killing by the human immune system, in order to easily enter the lymph nodes to form metastasis. Other studies found a novel function for soluble Lewis y, that is inducing cytokine release, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), through the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We speculate that except for proliferation, Lewis y could also induce tumor cells immune evasion through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, the detailed mechanism is being studied. Lewis y may participate in natural humoral immune response, antibodies are ideally suited for eradicating pathogens from bloodstream and early tissue invasion. With regard to cancer cells, passively administered and vaccine induced antibodies have accomplished this concept, limiting tumor cells and systemic or intraperitoneal micrometastases in a variety of preclinical models. Many protocols developing anti-Lewis y vaccines have been performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we showed that increased expression of Lewis y antigen plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells.
