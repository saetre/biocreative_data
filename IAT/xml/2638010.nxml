Among them, chondrocyte hypertrophy is a rate-limiting step for the skeletal growth, being responsible for 40&#x02013;60&#x00025; of the endochondral ossification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Hunziker1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Wilsman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The initiation is precisely linked with the cessation of proliferation; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the harmonious transition from the proliferation to hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes remains an enigma.</p><p>CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein &#x003b2; (C/EBP&#x003b2;), also known as nuclear factor-interleukin-6 (NF-IL6), is a member of the C/EBP family of six transcription factors characterized by a carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper dimerization domain and an adjacent highly conserved basic DNA binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Descombes1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Nerlov1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Contrary to C/EBP&#x003b1; that is purely antiproliferative as a tumor suppressor in several cell types, C/EBP&#x003b2; regulates expression of various genes involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, immune function and female reproduction, as well as tumor invasiveness and progression, through a variety of mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Nerlov1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.Over the past several years, C/EBP&#x003b2; has been shown to control differentiation of hematopoietic and adipogenic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Johnson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Wu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The present study initially investigated skeletal phenotype of C/EBP&#x003b2;-deficient (C/EBP&#x003b2;&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice which have been reported to display mainly hematopoietic and adipogenic defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Screpanti1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Tanaka2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The mice showed dwarfism with an elongated proliferative zone and delayed chondrocyte hypertrophy in the limb cartilage, implicating the cell cycle control by C/EBP&#x003b2; in chondrocytes.</p><p>Cell cycle factors appear to play an important role in the control of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-LuValle1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Moro1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. During the cell cycle activation, complexes of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) promote G1/S-phase transition from G0/G1 by phosphorylating Rb-related pocket proteins, which activate genes required for the S-phase entry. The cyclin-CDK complexes are inhibited by two major families of CDK inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Besson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The p16 INK4 family specifically binds and inactivates monomeric CDK4 or CDK6, whereas the Cip/Kip family, which includes p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, and p57<sup>Kip2</sup> (p57), inhibits all G1/S-phase cyclin-CDK complexes. Since the control of these cell cycle factors driving S-phase onset greatly influences the commitment to cell differentiation, the present study performed a screen of potential transcriptional targets of C/EBP&#x003b2; using a microarray analysis, and identified p57 as the most probable target during hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes. We further investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of skeletal growth and endochondral ossification through the C/EBP&#x003b2;-p57 signal in chondrocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>C/EBP&#x003b2;&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice exhibit impaired skeletal growth and endochondral ossification</title><p>To analyze the physiological role of C/EBP&#x003b2; in skeletal growth and endochondral ossification, we investigated the skeletal phenotypes of heterozygous and homozygous C/EBP&#x003b2;-deficient (C/EBP&#x003b2;&#x0002b;/&#x02212; and C/EBP&#x003b2;&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice.

To identify cell cycle factors lying downstream of the C/EBP&#x003b2; signal, we performed a screen of transcriptional targets of C/EBP&#x003b2; using a microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004543.s001">Table S1</xref>). The C/EBP&#x003b2; overexpression caused downregulation of cyclin B1, B2 and D1, and upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16, p21 and p57, by 50&#x00025; or more as compared to the empty vector overexpression. Since the above analyses were performed in non-chondrogenic C3H10T1/2 cells, we further examined the expressions of the candidate genes by real-time RT-PCR analysis in the cultures between wild-type and C/EBP&#x003b2;&#x02212;/&#x02212; rib chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004543-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

Hence, the cell cycle arrest in chondrocytes caused by C/EBP&#x003b2; appears to immediately link to the start of the differentiation.

This may be because p57 is more crucial for chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation than C/EBP&#x003b2; whose function could be substituted by several upstream signals of p57. In fact, the C/EBP&#x003b2; deficiency did not abrogate, but partially suppressed the p57 expression in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004543-g004">Figure 4B, C</xref>), while the knockdown of p57 strongly suppressed the C/EBP&#x003b2;-induced hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004543-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Among other cell cycle factors, mice lacking the Rb-related pocket proteins p107 and p130 show skeletal phenotype very similar to that of the p57&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Rossi1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that these proteins are likely to be major downstream targets of the cyclin-CDK complexes that are inhibited by p57 in chondrocytes. More interestingly, the Cip/Kip family proteins have recently been reported to regulate pathways distinct from that of cell cycle control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Besson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Since p57 supports skeletal myoblast differentiation by inhibiting phosphorylation of the key transcription factor MyoD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Reynaud1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, this factor might also induce chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation by regulating crucial transcription factors like Runx2 or Sox9. This may also explain the direct linkage from the cell cycle arrest to cell differentiation by the C/EBP&#x003b2;-p57 signaling, unlike the cGKII signal, as mentioned above.</p><p>We conclude that C/EBP&#x003b2; directly transactivates p57 to promote transition from proliferation to hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes during endochondral ossification. Besides the anabolic function for physiological skeletal growth, the C/EBP&#x003b2; haploinsufficiency in adult mice caused resistance to cartilage destruction during osteoarthritis progression in knee joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004543-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, C/EBP&#x003b2; has been reported to be induced by proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, and to mediate the decrease of articular cartilage matrix by suppressing the promoter activity of cartilage characteristic genes like cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein and type II collagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Imamura1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Okazaki1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The cytokine-induced C/EBP&#x003b2; also enhances the promoter activity of prostaglandin synthetic enzymes like cyclooxygenase-2 and phospholipase A2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Massaad1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Thomas1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> and proteinases like aggrecanase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Mizui1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004543-Raymond1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref> in chondrocytes.
