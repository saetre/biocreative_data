Although significant advances are beginning to be made into the management of the disease, the 5-year survival rate has not improved over the past 25 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Jemal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The high mortality rate is due to the high incidence of metastatic disease at initial diagnosis, the aggressive clinical course and the failure of systemic therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Pliarchopoulou1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved understanding of the molecular biology of the disease that can be utilized to develop new therapies for pancreatic cancer.</p><p>We previously showed that adrenomedullin (AM) is over-expressed in pancreatic cancer and has a strong autocrine role in this disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Ramachandran1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. AM is a 52 amino acid peptide originally isolated from human pheochromocytoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Kitamura1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> that acts as a multifunctional regulatory peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Hinson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. One issue with AM as a target for cancer therapy is that AM has several physiological functions whose inhibition may be detrimental. AM is expressed in normal pancreatic islet cells, with predominant expression in the F cells, which also contain pancreatic polypeptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Martinez1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. AM reduces insulin secretion in physiological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Martinez1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. AM also has important effects in vascular cell biology where it regulates vascular tone and permeability and promotes vasodilation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Nuki1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Hayakawa1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. AM is also a potent angiogenic molecule, especially in hypoxia, which induces AM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Nakayama1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The angiogenic effects of AM are likely mediated through direct stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Miyashita1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and protection of endothelial cells from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Kato1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Adrenomedullin signaling is necessary for murine lymphatic vascular development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-FritzSix1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Mice in which AM has been genetically deleted develop cutaneous edema and midgestational lethality due to defect in lymphatic vessel growth and cardiovascular defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Caron1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In cancer, AM appears to have an important role in angiogenesis as well as an additional trophic effect directly on cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Miller1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Rocchi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>AM acts as a peptide ligand that activates receptors on the cell surface. Pancreatic beta cells express receptors known to respond to AM including the adrenomedullin receptor (ADMR, also known as L1-R) and the calcitonin-receptor-like-receptor (CRLR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Martinez1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Martnez1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Pio1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Our previous study found that pancreatic cancer cells express only ADMR, while both receptors are present in cells found within the tumor microenvironment including human pancreatic stellate cells (HPSCs) and endothelial cells. However, the roles of the specific receptors in AM's effects on pancreatic cancer, HPSCs and endothelial cells are currently unknown.</p><p>The current study examines the effects of AM on human pancreatic tumor cells, HPSCs and endothelial cells and investigates the receptors involved in these effects. We silenced each of the receptors <italic>in vitro</italic> using siRNA and found that ADMR was primarily responsible for the biological effects of AM on each of these cell types. We then examined the effects of silencing ADMR on pancreatic cancer cells and observed a major reduction of tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. To analyze the potential of ADMR as a target of cancer therapy, we then evaluated the effects of silencing ADMR in both mouse cells that make up the tumor microenvironment and on human cancer cells by using DOPC nanoliposomes to deliver species specific siRNAs. This systemic silencing of ADMR did not have obvious deleterious effects on healthy mice but greatly reduced tumor development. Therefore, ADMR should be an important target for the future development of small molecule therapeutics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell Lines and AM Peptides</title><p>Pancreatic cancer BxPC3 cells and HUVEC cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

Taken together, these observations suggested that AM might be a useful target for cancer therapy. However, AM has complex physiological roles mediated by its actions on at least two types of G-protein-coupled receptors, CRLR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Albertin1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and ADMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Martnez1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Currently little is known about the relative contributions of ADMR or CRLR to the physiological or pathophysiological actions of AM.

Therefore, AM is present and likely secreted by several cell types that constitute the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>AM has two potential receptors, ADMR and CRLR. We were interested to determine whether both receptors were important for the ability of AM to stimulate pancreatic tumor growth or whether one receptor might be more important. We previously observed that pancreatic cancer cells express exclusively ADMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Ramachandran1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in that study we did not determine whether this receptor was required for the effects of AM on the cancer cells. Furthermore, currently the receptor involved in the effects of AM on endothelial cells or stellate cells is unknown. It has been reported that endothelial cells express CRLR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-FernandezSauze1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and it has been suggested that CRLR is the main mediator of the effects of AM on the vasculature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Sumanas1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we examined the importance of the different receptors by silencing them individually on each of the cell types. We found that silencing ADMR reduced the proliferation of HPSC, HUVEC and MLEC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> while silencing of CRLR had no effect. ADMR was also primarily responsible for the angiogenic effects of AM on HUVECS and MLECs, while CRLR had lesser effects. Previously it was reported that an anti-CRLR antibody reduced the angiogenic functions of AM on endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-FernandezSauze1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Guidolin1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in that study they did not evaluate the effects of ADMR. Our data clearly indicate the primary importance of ADMR on pancreatic cancer cells and cells resembling the stellate and endothelial cells found in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Having identified ADMR as a critical AM receptor for pancreatic tumors, we tested the effect of silencing ADMR <italic>in vivo</italic> as a potential approach to pancreatic cancer therapy. We first examined the effect of silencing ADMR specifically in cancer cells by stably silencing ADMR in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and then using them to develop orthotopic tumors. We observed a dramatic reduction on tumor volume after silencing ADMR in two different pancreatic cancer cell lines. These dramatic effects emphasized the importance of the ADMR receptor and the AM autocrine loop in pancreatic cancer cells.</p><p>We also observed a reduction in metastasis after silencing ADMR. However, because of the large effect of ADMR silencing on primary tumor growth, it was difficult to determine if this involved more than simply reduced cancer cell growth. To determine whether the reduction in metastasis was independent of the reduced tumor growth, we examined the behaviour of the ADMR silenced cells in lung and liver metastasis studies. By injection of cancer cells into the tail vein, the cells are carried to various organs but tend to form colonies in the lung. Similarly, injection of cancer cells into the spleen leads to the development of metastases in the liver. The number of colonies formed in these assays does not depend on the growth rate of the cells. Using sensitive bioluminescence imaging we observed a highly significant reduction in the incidence of metastases as well postponement on the presence of detectable metastases in both lung and liver using ADMR silenced cells. Reduction in number of lung and liver metastatic foci were also seen on silencing ADMR <italic>in vivo</italic>. These studies supported AM as a metastatic factor apart from also being a growth inducer and potent angiogenic factor.</p><p>To develop the idea of targeting ADMR therapeutically, we investigated the effects of systemic delivery of siRNA using liposomes. Initially we were concerned that the silencing of this receptor might prove deleterious. Previously it was reported that CRLR knock-out mice were embryonically lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Dackor1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. However, when we silenced ADMR by systemic delivery of DOPC nanoliposome coupled siRNA to mouse ADMR we did not observe any effects on body weight, feeding behavior, activity or blood glucose levels of the animals, despite highly effective silencing of ADMR in the pancreas. Thus, tentatively it appears that systemic ADMR silencing is not overtly harmful. Clearly, full toxicology studies will be required before moving this treatment forward to human trials. Notably, unlike typical siRNA studies, in the current study ADMR was silenced on both the cancer cells and systemically by using siRNAs of both human and mouse ADMR. Silencing of only the human form does not test the systemic effects of siRNA treatment as would occur if this treatment was translated to the clinic. We observed that treatment of the mice with the combination of both human and mouse siRNA to ADMR greatly inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> without obvious harmful effects.</p><p>The reduction of angiogenesis associated with ADMR silencing was not associated with a reduction in VEGF production. This is in keeping with previous observations suggesting that AM does not act through VEGF stimulation in the process of angiogenesis. It was previously shown that down regulation of VEGF or its receptor, VEGFR-2, could not suppress AM induced angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Guidolin1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, an AM antagonist was able to inhibit VEGF induced blood flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007502-Shibata1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggests that AM acts as an VEGF-independent angiogenic factor and a reduction in AM's function in cancer cells and the adjacent tumor microenvironment cells results in reduced neoangiogenesis.</p><p>Thus, this study collectively delineated the autocrine effects of AM in pancreatic cancer and identified ADMR as the critical receptor through which these effects are mediated on both tumor cells and cells within the tumor microenvironment. Because the effects of ADMR silencing on pancreatic cancer cells were so dramatic, we expect that this is the major site of action of the <italic>in vivo</italic> silencing experiments. Importantly, we showed that silencing ADMR <italic>in vivo</italic> greatly reduced tumor growth without overt deleterious effects. These data generally support the suggestion that ADMR may be a potent therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007502.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Silencing of ADMR or CRLR on HPSCs, HUVECs, or MLECs.
