Randomly determined cDNA sequences attract considerable interest as a catalog of expressed genes from a given organism. EST sequences are highly conserved between mammals, therefore a dense gene map will be a powerful tool to construct a precise comparative map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c1">1</xref>). In human, 3 400 000 EST sequences have been deposited in a public database and over 30 000 genes have been physically mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c2">2</xref>). In addition, the draft sequence of the human genome has recently become available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c4">4</xref>). Therefore, the map position of any gene is available by direct comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences. In mouse, 1 960 000 EST sequences have been deposited in a public database. Approximately 3900 orthologous pairs between human and mouse were recently identified in which &#x0223c;3000 genes were mapped in the mouse genome and &#x0223c;180 conserved segments were defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c3">3</xref>). Thus, extensive comparison of the mapping data is indispensable to make use of the wealth of data generated by the Human and Mouse Genome Projects for the isolation of the genes underlying important traits in livestock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c7">7</xref>).</p><p>Economic trait loci (ETL) controlling traits such as growth, fatness and milk yield were recently mapped in livestock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c10">10</xref>). In addition, recent work demonstrated that a common region between cattle and mouse regulates a quantitative trait such as tolerance to trypanosome infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c11">11</xref>). Therefore, a precise comparative map enables us to use not only livestock but also model animals such as mouse to discover ETL genes. In domestic species, however, the numbers of ESTs deposited in the public databases are quite limited. This limitation has impeded the progress of both constructing a precise comparative map and the activity of candidate positional cloning. Recently, an ordered comparative map between cattle and human including 638 orthlogs was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c12">12</xref>), but more data are required to further refine conserved segments.</p><p>To construct a precise comparative map, radiation hybrid (RH) mapping is a convenient method for gene mapping because the markers need not be polymorphic, and thus large-scale mapping is easier. For RH mapping of the genes, it is desirable to design PCR primers in the non-coding region (3&#x02032;-UTR) to prevent amplification of host DNA present in the hybrid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c13">13</xref>). A large number of bovine ESTs that were recently deposited in a public database by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c14">14</xref>), however, lack information regarding the 3&#x02032;-end of the cDNA. Furthermore, the 3&#x02032;-UTR information is useful for clustering a large number of ESTs, being especially effective for discrimination of gene families.</p><p>We report the determination of 36 310 bovine ESTs that are mostly composed of a pair of 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-sequences of a cDNA clone, using newly constructed poly(A) tail-removed cDNA libraries. These ESTs will be a valuable resource for livestock ESTs and as markers for RH mapping to construct a precise comparative map.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of cDNA libraries</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD) from several fetal tissues of Holstein cattle, including kidney, liver, rumen, brain, cartilage, lung and ovary, as well as from an adipocyte cell line established from Japanese Black cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c15">15</xref>). Poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA was isolated using oligotex-dT30 (Takara, Japan). cDNA synthesis and library construction were performed using the SuperScript &#x003bb;ZipLox system (Gibco BRL). In each library, 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>&#x02013;10 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> independent phage transfectants were obtained. Each library was amplified and transfected into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH10B Zip to convert it to a plasmid library by Cre&#x0002f;loxP-mediated <italic>in vivo</italic> excision. cDNA clones were pooled and plasmid DNA was extracted from each library. The plasmid was cleaved using the <italic>Not</italic>I restriction enzyme, followed by nested deletion to remove the poly(A) tail using a Nested Deletion Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). Deletion conditions were optimized for appropriate deletion sizes (50&#x02013;100 bp). Briefly, we maintained strict amounts of the linear DNA (1 &#x000b5;g) and time for deletion (1 min). After self-ligation, DNA was transformed into ElectroMax (Gibco BRL) based on the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Colonies were picked for subsequent PCR amplification and sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of sequencing templates</title><p>Each colony was subjected to colony PCR and culture. For colony PCR and DNA sequencing we used the primers CGTCCCATTCGCCATTCAG for the 5&#x02032;-end and GCTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG for the 3&#x02032;-end. The primer for the 3&#x02032;-end was located 210 bp downstream of the <italic>Not</italic>I site in the vector to ensure reliable PCR amplification after deletion. Briefly, a small amount of the colony was suspended in 50 &#x000b5;l of the reaction mixture containing 1&#x000d7; regular PCR buffer consisting of 0.2 &#x000b5;M each primer, 50 &#x000b5;M dNTP, and 2.5 U <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (Takara, Japan). The PCR consisted of 35 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s for denaturing, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s for annealing, 72&#x000b0;C for 3 min for extension. After PCR amplification, the products were analyzed using 1&#x00025; agarose gel electrophoresis, and 1 &#x000b5;l of the PCR product that produced the appropriate length and signal was used directly in a DNA sequencing reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequencing</title><p>For the clones derived from ordinary cDNA libraries &#x0005b;i.e. with poly(A) tails&#x0005d;, plasmid DNA was extracted as usual and the sequencing reaction was performed using a BigDye primer kit (P.E. Biosystems, Japan). Otherwise, the sequencing reaction was performed in 10 &#x000b5;l of a reaction mixture containing 6 &#x000b5;l of water, 4 &#x000b5;l of BigDye terminator (P.E. Biosystems), 0.2 &#x000b5;M sequence-specific primer and 1 &#x000b5;l of the PCR product. The proportion of PCR product and conditions for sequencing were crucial for a robust sequence signal without purifying the PCR fragments as template DNA. Cycle sequencing was performed under the conditions of 35 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s for denaturing, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s for annealing, 60&#x000b0;C for 4 min for extension. Sequencing was performed on an ABI 3700 Capillary Sequencer. The quality of the sequence was assessed using Phred software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Data management system</title><p>A series of sequence data processing procedures were automatically performed using an in-house system, named cDNA Information Manager. The cDNA Information Manager is composed of a sequence database and five servers: FTP and HTTP servers, Sequence Processor, Sequence Analyzer and Sequence Manager. The sequence database is used to store sequence data and analysis reports, etc. The FTP server is used to enter new sequences from a Macintosh computer to this system. The Sequence Processor performs basic processing of new sequences, including trimming sequence ends, quality checking and clustering. The Sequence Analyzer performs homology searches against the GenBank database and designs PCR primers targeting the 3&#x02032;-ESTs from the sequences. The Sequence Manager provides data from the database at the user&#x02019;s request using the HTTP server. The cDNA Information Manager allows direct access to the Human Gene Map (http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;w ww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;genemap&#x0002f;) and Unigene (http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;UniGene&#x0002f;) databases (NCBI).</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence data processing and clustering</title><p>EST sequences are submitted to the data management system, cDNA Information Manager. The ambiguous regions are removed from the ends of the sequences to achieve less than one ambiguity out of 20 bases in the text files. Then, the vector sequence was searched using BlastN v.2.0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c18">18</xref>) and removed. Sequences that were &#x0003c;100 nt long or had &#x0003e;7&#x00025; ambiguity were removed from the data flow. After basic processing, the sequences were clustered among previously generated ESTs based on sequence identity using BlastN. The criteria were more than 300 bits (for conventional cDNA libraries) and 400 bits &#x0005b;for poly(A) tail-removed cDNA libraries&#x0005d; of the Blast score with 80&#x00025; nucleotide identity. An ID was allocated to the sequences that had no similarity to earlier entries in our ESTs, followed by homology searches against the GenBank database.</p></sec><sec><title>Accession numbers</title><p>Bovine ESTs described in this paper were deposited in the DDBJ database, accession nos AV588548&#x02013;AV618892 and AV662325&#x02013;AV668289.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Establishment of a high throughput EST sequencing system</title><p>The basic principle for preparation of a poly(A) tail-removed cDNA library is schematically presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne108f1">1</xref>A. Bacterial colonies of the cDNA clones were directly subjected to PCR amplification. The 3&#x02032; priming site was located 210 bp downstream of the <italic>Not</italic>I site to ensure that it is out of the range of deletion, because the exonuclease excises nucleotides in both directions from the <italic>Not</italic>I site. We confirmed that &#x0003e;60&#x00025; of the cDNA clones were successfully amplified. Direct sequencing of colony PCR products was performed without prior purification. Removal of the poly(A) tail clearly improved the quality of the 3&#x02032;-sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne108f1">1</xref>B). According to the evaluation by Phred software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c17">17</xref>), base calling was possible beyond 450 bp in 90&#x00025; of the cases (data not shown). Thus, we constructed six poly(A) tail-removed cDNA libraries from various tissues. The size of the cDNA inserts in each library ranged from 0.7 to 4 kb, the average size being 1.5 kb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne108f2">2</xref>A).</p><p>The size of the deletion as calculated from the distance between the <italic>Not</italic>I site and the insert&#x02013;vector junction is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne108f2">2</xref>B. The size of the deletion was within 60 bp in 80&#x00025; of the clones in each library, except for the lung cDNA library, which was composed of two preparations. In the cDNA libraries, the average deletion sizes were 41 (adipocyte), 45 (cartilage), 52 (brain), 61 (ovary), 121 (kidney) and 125 bp (lung). The procedure was thus deemed sufficient to remove the poly(A) tail while leaving much of the 3&#x02032;-UTR.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of a data management system</title><p>To deal with a large amount of sequence information, we established a data management system, called the cDNA Information Manager. The flow chart of the data analysis is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gne108f3">3</xref>. The sequences were subjected to basic processing, including trimming of ambiguous ends and vector sequence, checking sequence quality and clustering based on identity. Although dispersed repeats in ESTs were not masked out, errors in clustering due to dispersed repeats occurred in &#x0003c;1&#x00025; of sequences (data not shown). A new ID number was allocated to novel sequences, followed by homology searches against the GenBank database. PCR primers were automatically designed for the 3&#x02032;-sequences for mapping.</p><p>The results of the analyses, such as homology searches and primer design, can be browsed and the data can be manipulated as necessary. Our data management system is linked to the Human Gene Map (http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;genemap&#x0002f;) and Unigene (http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x0002f;UniGene&#x0002f;) databases (NCBI) based on homology to human ESTs. In addition, we can obtain various statistics, for example redundancy and the results of homology searches, using custom made programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of ESTs</title><p>We generated 19 500 sequences from the 5&#x02032;-end and 16 800 sequences from the 3&#x02032;-end of cDNAs. These were clustered into 16 400 groups, in which 8600 and 7800 IDs were allocated to 5&#x02032; - and 3&#x02032;-ESTs, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne108tb1">1</xref>). Approximately 12&#x00025; of the IDs included both 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ESTs in a group due to short cDNA inserts.</p><p>To confirm that the deletion from the 3&#x02032;-end did not affect EST clustering, we estimated the overlap of the 3&#x02032;-ESTs to which IDs were allocated, by examining the number of IDs with high homology (score &#x02265; 400 bits, <italic>E</italic> &#x0003c; e &#x02013; 109) to the same gene. Thus, &#x0223c;90&#x00025; of 1500 3&#x02032;-ESTs matched unique genes in the GenBank database. This suggests that interference with EST clustering due to deletion was negligible and the criteria for clustering were appropriate. Thus, we estimate that the ESTs represent &#x0223c;6900 genes.</p><p>Next, clone redundancy was analyzed as the number of 3&#x02032;-ESTs included in a cluster (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne108tb2">2</xref>). All 3&#x02032;-ESTs (16 813) were clustered into 8331 groups, 529 of which had IDs allocated to 5&#x02032;-ESTs. Seventy-five percent of the groups included a single 3&#x02032;-EST, and those unique sequences represented 37&#x00025; of the overall 3&#x02032;-sequences. The groups with redundancy of less than five times accounted for &#x0003e;95&#x00025; of the total groups and corresponded to 64&#x00025; of the overall 3&#x02032;-sequences. Therefore, our massive sequencing was effective for isolation of new genes. Some highly redundant sequences were observed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne108tb3">3</xref>); most of them were housekeeping genes such as elongation factors, extracellular matrix proteins and ribosomal proteins. A sequence showing a redundancy of 118 times could not be identified from the homology search, but had very weak similarity to human mRNA for insulin-like growth factor II (score &#x0003d; 52 bits, <italic>E</italic> &#x0003d; 1e &#x02013; 05), as well as its 5&#x02032;-sequence. There was also a high frequency of the mitochondrial genome, constituting 0.6&#x00025; of the 3&#x02032;-sequences.</p><p>The results of the homology searches against each division of the GenBank database are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne108tb4">4</xref>. Scores of 400 and 600 bits were used as a threshold against bovine ESTs, while 200 and 400 bits were used against human and mouse ESTs in order to eliminate possible effects of dispersed repeats, because dispersed repeats usually show less than 400 and 150 bits of the scores against bovine and other ESTs, respectively. More than 50&#x00025; of the ESTs were novel bovine sequences, providing valuable data. Forty-five percent of the 3&#x02032;-ESTs were thought to be identical to the 5&#x02032;-sequences of bovine ESTs deposited in a public database, suggesting that they had been derived from short cDNAs. Homology to human ESTs had a higher score than to mouse ESTs, which is consistent with a previous report that rodents have undergone more sequence changes than other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c20">20</xref>). In general, the translated region of cDNA is more conserved than the non-coding region among species. As expected, the homology of the 5&#x02032;-ESTs to mouse or human ESTs was significantly higher than that of the 3&#x02032;-ESTs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gne108tb4">4</xref>), which was thought to reflect the fact that the 5&#x02032;-sequences contained coding regions. Thus the 5&#x02032;-ESTs were useful for identifying gene functions, while the 3&#x02032;-ESTs, which were less conserved among species, were useful for designing bovine-specific primers for RH mapping.</p><p>We described a new system to produce large numbers of high quality ESTs, with which we determined 600 ESTs per day. We obtained both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; cDNA sequences derived from &#x0223c;6900 genes that will be used for RH mapping. The draft sequences of the human genome will facilitate finding human orthologs and determining their chromosomal positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gne108c4">4</xref>), which will promote construction of a precise comparative map. This approach is applicable to other organisms whose ESTs need to be developed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gne108f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) The flow chart for preparation of a poly(A) tail-removed cDNA library.
