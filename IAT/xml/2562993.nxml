The cytokine GRO/KC (growth related oncogene; CXCL1) shows strong, rapid upregulation in dorsal root ganglion in both nerve injury and inflammatory models. Neurons and glia express its receptor (CXCR2). CXCL1 has well-known effects on immune cells, but little is known about its direct effects on neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report that GRO/KC incubation (1.5 nM, overnight) caused marked upregulation of Na<sup>+ </sup>currents in acutely isolated small diameter rat (adult) sensory neurons in vitro. In both IB4-positive and IB4-negative sensory neurons, TTX-resistant and TTX-sensitive currents increased 2- to 4 fold, without altered voltage dependence or kinetic changes. These effects required long exposures, and were completely blocked by co-incubation with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Amplification of cDNA from the neuronal cultures showed that 3 Na channel isoforms were predominant both before and after GRO/KC treatment (Na<sub>v </sub>1.1, 1.7, and 1.8). TTX-sensitive isoforms 1.1 and 1.7 significantly increased 2 &#x02013; 3 fold after GRO/KC incubation, while 1.8 showed a trend towards increased expression. Current clamp experiments showed that GRO/KC caused a marked increase in excitability, including resting potential depolarization, decreased rheobase, and lower action potential threshold. Neurons acquired a striking ability to fire repetitively; IB4-positive cells also showed marked broadening of action potentials. Immunohistochemical labelling confirmed that the CXCR2 receptor was present in most neurons both in dissociated cells and in DRG sections, as previously shown for neurons in the CNS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Many studies on the role of chemokines in pain conditions have focused on their rapid and indirect effects on neurons, via release of inflammatory mediators from immune and glial cells. Our study suggests that GRO/KC may also have important pro-nociceptive effects via its direct actions on sensory neurons, and may induce long-term changes that involve protein synthesis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Altered sodium channel expression in sensory neurons contributes to enhanced excitability and abnormal spontaneous activity after nerve injury or inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, little is known about mechanisms of this sodium channel regulation. Recent studies suggest important roles for cytokines and chemokines in the nervous system, in both neuropathic and inflammatory chronic pain. They may regulate pain via direct effects on neurons or glia, or via local release of modulators (e.g., prostaglandins; bradykinin) from immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>We recently described a rat pain model in which the sensory neurons of the L4 and/or L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are inflamed by deposition of zymosan, which stimulates a robust localized inflammatory response without overt nerve injury. This caused abnormal spontaneous activity, along with markedly increased sodium currents in small diameter, primarily nociceptive DRG neurons, an overall increase in excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and a very striking early increase (15-fold after one day) in the chemokine GRO/KC (growth-related oncogene/keratine-derived chemokine; CXCL1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We observed similar large increases of GRO/KC in the spinal nerve ligation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>GRO/KC is best known for its role in neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation early during inflammation. In this regard its effects are similar to those of other CXC family cytokines with an ELF motif, including interleukin-8 (IL-8; CXCL8) in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. GRO/KC may also have direct roles in the nervous system, including roles in pathological pain. Both GRO/KC and its primary receptor, CXCR2 (IL-8Rb) are expressed in neurons and other cells in the central nervous system, under normal and pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Less is known about GRO/KC in the peripheral nervous system. However, GRO/KC stimulates calcium influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and release of the pain-related peptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] from cultured neonatal DRG neurons. Levels of GRO/KC in inflamed muscle tissue are well correlated with nociceptive behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Overall, these studies in peripheral nervous system suggest a pro-nociceptive role for GRO/KC (however, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]).</p><p>In view of the striking increases in GRO/KC observed in DRG in several pain models, the evidence that this chemokine may play important roles in pathological pain, and the relative dearth of information about its mechanisms of action in pain processing pathways (especially in the periphery), we initiated this study to examine effects of GRO/KC on the properties of small diameter DRG neurons. In light of our previous study showing marked increases in Na<sup>+ </sup>currents and excitability following local inflammation of the DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we focused on possible regulation of Na<sup>+ </sup>currents by GRO/KC in small diameter rat DRG neurons in acute primary culture. Here we report that overnight incubation with GRO/KC, but not acute application, leads to increased excitability, 2- to 4 fold increases in TTX-resistant and TTX-sensitive Na<sup>+ </sup>currents without altered voltage dependence or kinetic changes, and increases in mRNA abundance of Na channel isoforms that are already present in control cells. The increase in Na<sup>+ </sup>currents required protein synthesis. The results suggest that GRO/KC may have important pro-nociceptive effects through direct effects on neurons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Young female Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight 100&#x02013;150 g) were housed one or two per cage under a controlled diurnal cycle of 12 h light and 12 h dark with free access to water and food. The ambient environment was maintained at constant temperature (22 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C) and relative humidity (60&#x02013;70%). All the surgical procedures and the experimental protocol were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Acute culture of sensory neurons</title><p>Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). The bilateral L4 and L5 DRGs were isolated and the sheath was carefully removed in ice-cold normal Ringer solution. The connective tissue was digested by exposure to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution containing 1.0% collagenase II (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C followed by washout in normal Ringer solution for another 10 min. DRGs were then dissociated by trituration with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. DRG cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips in Medium199 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1000 U/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. GRO/KC (rat recombinant, from Cell Sciences, Canton, MA, USA) and/or cycloheximide (Sigma) were added to the medium immediately after plating, as indicated, and the DRG cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C (5% CO<sub>2 </sub>balance air) before recording. Recordings were made within 30 hours of plating, and cells were selected for recording based on diameter (&#x0003c; 25 &#x003bc;m) and the absence of processes. Isolectin B4 (IB4) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyante (FITC) (1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l; Sigma) was added to the culture medium for 30&#x02013;60 min prior to start of recording sessions to identify non-peptidergic IB4-postive and peptidergic IB4-negative neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This procedure has been previously shown not to affect the currents measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Neurons showing a robust fluorescence signal were classified as IB<sub>4</sub>-positive and those displaying no signal at all, IB<sub>4</sub>-negative. In general, the fluorescence was not examined until after completion of current recordings from each cell; i.e., IB4 binding was not used as a criterion in selecting which cells to record. In each individual experiment, we alternated between recording from control and experimental coverslips throughout the recording period. Every attempt was made to compare control and experimental cells taken from the same cultures, though in some cases it was not possible to obtain data from all four types of cells (experimental and control for both IB4-positive and IB4-negative) in a given experiment, particularly when IB4 status was not determined until the end of the recording. Additional controls for inter-animal variability are described in the Results section. Once it had been well established that the proportion of IB4-positive cells did not change with GRO/KC exposure, IB4 binding was sometimes examined prior to recording in order to ensure that approximately equal numbers of each cell type were recorded in each experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>After over-night culture (16&#x02013;30 hours), coverslips were transferred to a recording chamber. Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of small DRG neurons (diameter 15&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;m) were conducted at room temperature with an AxoPatch-200B amplifier (Molecular Devices Corp, Union City, CA, USA). Patch pipettes (2.5&#x02013;4.0 M&#x003a9;) were fabricated from borosilicate glass. Data were acquired on a Pentium IV computer with the Clampex 8 program (Molecular Devices Corp). The cell capacitance artifact was cancelled by the nulling circuit of the recording amplifier. Voltage errors were minimized by using &#x02265; 80% series resistance compensation. The current was filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz. The recording chamber was continuously perfused at room temperature with oxygenated bath solution at a flow rate of 1&#x02013;2 ml/min.</p><p>For the current-clamp study of excitability, we measured the threshold current (rheobase), action potential (AP) threshold, resting membrane potential, AP rising rate, AP falling rate, afterhyperpolarization, and input resistance. Any cells without AP were excluded from the study. Only neurons that had stable membrane potential more negative than -45 mV after obtaining the whole cell configuration were used for further study.</p><p>For the voltage-clamp study, total Na<sup>+ </sup>current was divided into tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) and TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) currents, using the method previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Briefly, in most experiments, the TTX-R currents were isolated from the TTX-S currents by using a holding potential of -50 mV. The peak TTX-R current was measured at each potential. Both TTX-R and TTX-S current were evoked by a series of depolarizations from a holding potential of -80 mV. The amplitude of the TTX-S current in each cell was measured during depolarization to -10 mV from -80 mV, based on the distinct kinetic properties of the two currents. At this voltage, TTX-S current was measured as the difference between the early peak current and the current 5 msec after the beginning of the depolarization, a time window in which the TTX-S current essentially completely inactivates but TTX-R current changes little. In experiments in which TTX-S current evoked from -80 mV was measured at additional voltages, a time window of 11 msec (at -20 mV) or 27 msec (at -30 mV) was used, as determined in our previous studies using TTX to verify the separation of the currents.</p></sec><sec><title>Solutions for recording action potentials</title><p>The normal bath solution for recording AP contained (in mM) 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose.

The bilateral L4/L5 DRGs were removed and post-fixed in the perfusion fixative for 2 hours at room temperature. The ganglia were horizontally sectioned with a cryostat at a thickness of 8 &#x003bc;m. Tissue sections were incubated in polyclonal rabbit anti-rat antibody to CXCR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:200 overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, followed by reaction with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:1000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hour.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical staining of GRO/KC receptor CXCR2 in dissociated DRG cells</title><p>DRG cells from L4/L5 spinal levels were removed from rats, and neurons were isolated and cultured overnight. The cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldeyhde for 30 min at room temperature, washed in ice cold acetone for 1 min, and permeablized with 1% Triton for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with antibody to CXCR2 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and neuronal marker anti-NeuN (1:100, Milipore, Billerica, MA) for 2 hours followed by incubation in secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594(1:1000, Milipore, Billerica, MA) for 1 hour. After drying, the cells were mounted on coverslips with Vector Hard Set mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). In some experiments, IB4 conjugated to FITC (1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l), instead of anti-NeuN antibody, was added to the culture medium for 30 min before switching to the primary antibody, to identify IB4-positive and IB4 negative neurons. The immunoreactive products were visualized using a confocal microscope and Slidebook 4.1 imaging acquisition software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis of CXCR2 in protein extracted from DRG</title><p>Western blot analysis was employed to confirm that the CXCR2 antibody used for immunohistochemistry recognized protein in the DRG of the size expected for CXCR2. Bilateral L4/L5 DRGs were isolated and homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10% NP-40, and 10 mM EDTA) (Millipore, Billerica, MA) supplemented just before running the assay with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (100 &#x003bc;l of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; 500 &#x003bc;l of PMSF, Na<sub>3</sub>VO4, and NaF) (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) followed by centrifugation at 4 &#x000b0;C for 40 min. Samples (15 &#x003bc;g of total protein per lane) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) running in Tris-HEPES-SDS buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL) followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in tris-glycine-SDS transfer buffer. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in Tween (0.1%)-phosphate-buffered saline (PBST) at room temperature for 1 hour. The CXCR2 antibody (1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was applied to the blot followed by incubation with immunopure peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:20,000, Pierce, Rockford, IL). The blot was developed by exposure to blue-light-sensitive Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp) using the enhanced Chemiluninescent (ECL) Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative analysis of sodium channel subtype expression</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from DRG cultures under conditions similar to those used in electrophysiological recordings, using a Stratagene Absolutely RNA Miniprep Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Immediately after isolation, RNA was transcribed into cDNA using an iScript cDNA kit (Bio-Rad). Cells treated overnight with 1.5 nM GRO/KC were compared with control cells from a sister culture. Relative channel expression was determined by quantitative PCR using a Stratagene MX-Pro 3005P. cDNA samples were amplified in triplicate (10 min at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 sec 95&#x000b0;C, 60 sec 60&#x000b0;C, then 60 sec 72&#x000b0;C with fluorescence measured at the end) in a 25 &#x003bc;l reaction volume (400 nM each forward and reverse primers, SYBR green reaction mix (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN)). Fluorescence was normalized with the reference dye ROX, and gene expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine ribosyltransferase (HPRT; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]), run on the same plate. Primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were selected using the Primer3 program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and were designed to include exon-intron boundaries to minimize contamination by genomic DNA. Care was also taken to avoid regions of homology with other Na channels, and primers were examined with an in silico virtual PCR program to ensure that no other products were predicted from rat cDNA or genomic DNA <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu"/>. PCR products were verified by melting point analysis at the end of each experiment and, during protocol development, by gel electrophoresis. Template from control cells was run side-by-side with template from GRO/KC-treated cells from the same culture. The efficiencies of the amplification reactions were estimated directly from the amplification plots using the DART program and a correction for efficiencies was included in the relative expression calculations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Efficiencies were generally in the range of 95 to 103% and were similar for control and GRO/KC treated samples, and across experiments. Hence a single efficiency value was used for control and GRO/KC samples for each gene in any given experiment. Efficiencies were set to 100% for genes with low expression that amplified only during the last few cycles and did not have enough data points for the DART efficiency measurement; low-expressing genes were not studied in quantitative detail. With the exception of the efficiency estimate, amplification data were analyzed using MxPRO software (Stratagene) to determine values for amplification threshold and relative expression.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primers used for qPCR experiments:</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Name</td><td align="left">Rat gene symbol</td><td align="left">Rat gene ID</td><td align="left">Rat mRNA reference</td><td align="left">Primers Forward, reverse</td><td align="right">Predicted size (bp)</td><td align="left">Position in mRNA</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Na<sub>v </sub>1.1</td><td align="left">Scn1a</td><td align="left">81574</td><td align="left">NM_030875.1</td><td align="left">atccgagtccgaagatagca</td><td align="right">137</td><td align="left">1817..1953</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">gtctcggggaaaacagtgag</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Na<sub>v </sub>1.2</td><td align="left">Scn2a1</td><td align="left">24766</td><td align="left">NM_012647.1</td><td align="left">cggagagttcgtcagtagcc</td><td align="right">229</td><td align="left">1661..1889</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">aagagagactggtgcggaga</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Na<sub>v </sub>1.3</td><td align="left">Scn3a</td><td align="left">81574</td><td align="left">NM_013119.1</td><td align="left">aacttggtgccatcaaatcc</td><td align="right">182</td><td align="left">4513..4334</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">cagattcacacccatgatgc</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Na<sub>v </sub>1.4</td><td align="left">Scn4a</td><td align="left">25722</td><td align="left">NM_013178.1</td><td align="left">caccgctcttctctgcttct</td><td align="right">282</td><td align="left">23..304</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">gtgggtgtcctggtcttgtt</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Na<sub>v </sub>1.5</td><td align="left">Scn5a</td><td align="left">25665</td><td align="left">NM_013125.1</td><td align="left">ttctagctcgaggcttctgc</td><td align="right">132</td><td align="left">727..858</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">tgcgtaaggctgagacattg</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Na<sub>v </sub>1.6</td><td align="left">Scn8a</td><td align="left">29710</td><td align="left">NM_019266.2</td><td align="left">tacagtggctacagcggcta</td><td align="right">274</td><td align="left">2008..2281</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">tgtttgtgaccacgctcatt</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Na<sub>v </sub>1.7</td><td align="left">Scn9a</td><td align="left">78956</td><td align="left">NM_133289</td><td align="left">gacagcttcttccagaggtgataata</td><td align="right">215</td><td align="left">1922..2024</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">ccatggtggacatttttgtct</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Na<sub>v </sub>1.8</td><td align="left">Scn10a</td><td align="left">29571</td><td align="left">XM_001078257</td><td align="left">cacggatgacaacaggtcac</td><td align="right">151</td><td align="left">1610..1760</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">gatcccgtcaggaaatgaga</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Na<sub>v </sub>1.9</td><td align="left">Scn11a</td><td align="left">29701</td><td align="left">NM_019265</td><td align="left">ggcagccaagtcaatctttc</td><td align="right">233</td><td align="left">679..911</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">gggccacagttgtgcttaat</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">HPRT</td><td align="left">Hprt</td><td align="left">24465</td><td align="left">NM_012583</td><td align="left">gcagactttgctttccttgg</td><td align="right">278</td><td align="left">495..772</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">tactggccacatcaacagga</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using Clampfit 9 (Molecular Devices Corp), Graphpad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), and Origin 7 (Origin Lab Corp., Northampton, MA, USA).

In IB4-negative cells, multiple action potentials (up to 27) could be observed during the 1 second current injection, and these lasted throughout the entire pulse. IB4-positive cells also acquired the ability to fire throughout the 1 second current injection after GRO/KC incubation. In this case the number of action potentials per pulse did not increase as dramatically; rather, the action potentials tended to become very broad (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), though still continuing until the end of the 1 second current injection. The significant increase in action potential width (68%) seen in IB4-positive cells in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> may be a conservative estimate, because those measurements are from the first evoked action potential and action potentials tended to broaden even more during the course of a long depolarizing pulse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Small diameter neurons acquire the ability to fire repetitively after GRO/KC incubation</bold>.

This upregulation required protein synthesis. Many studies on the role of chemokines in pain conditions, including GRO/KC (e.g.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]), have focused on their indirect effects on neurons, via stimulation of release of inflammatory mediators from immune and glial cells that then act on sympathetic and sensory neurons. Our study suggests that GRO/KC might also have important pro-nociceptive effects via its direct actions on sensory neurons. The majority of small diameter DRG neurons are nociceptors. The striking increase in excitability after GRO/KC incubation, including the ability to fire continuously during long depolarizations, would be expected to profoundly increase the sensitivity to painful stimuli in vivo &#x02013; both by increasing the sensitivity of nociceptors to stimuli, and by increasing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the dorsal horn. It will be important to conduct experiments to interfere with GRO/KC production or action in the DRG in vivo, to confirm the pro-nociceptive roles for this chemokine suggested by this in vitro study.</p><p>Our results have some interesting similarities to those reported by Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], who found that chronic (24 h) exposure of cultured small diameter capsaicin-sensitive trigeminal neurons to another pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 1-&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), led to a 67% increase in TTX-S (but not the TTX-R) Na<sup>+ </sup>current, without changes in voltage dependence. As in our study, acute applications did not increase Na<sup>+ </sup>current (and in fact caused slight decreases in the Na<sup>+ </sup>current), and the cytokine receptor was shown to be expressed on the neurons.</p><p>GRO/KC actions are thought to be mediated by the CXCR2 receptor. As discussed in the Introduction, the presence of this receptor on neurons (including neonatal DRG neurons in vitro) has been previously observed with a variety of methods. The effects reported here are most likely to be due to a direct effect of GRO/KC on the neurons, because: (1) effects were obtained in low density, acute cultures, in which non-neuronal cells were very sparse and intercellular mediators would be diluted by the culture medium; and (2) using an antibody to the CXCR2 receptor, we demonstrated that the receptor was present on the membranes of virtually all of the small diameter neurons in our cultures. Western blot analysis of DRG proteins, using the same antibody, revealed a doublet band at 58&#x02013;66 kDa and a lighter band of 35 kDa. For comparison, Xiong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] reported a band of approximately 58 kDa in Western blots of CXCR2 receptor in rat hippocampus. The human receptor, which has an almost identical predicted molecular weight of 40.7 kDa based on amino acid sequence (vs. 40.5 kDa for the rat receptor), has been reported to have an apparent molecular weight of 56 kDa when isolated from neutrophils, due to the presence of 2 N-linked 9 kDa carbohydrate moieties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, this same group reported additional forms of the human receptor, of 38 and 40 kDa that were shown to differ in their carbohydrate groups.</p><p>The inability of GRO/KC to increase Na<sup>+ </sup>currents after acute application, or in the presence of cycloheximide, provides evidence that protein synthesis is required for the effect on Na<sup>+ </sup>currents. The simplest explanation would be that additional Na<sup>+ </sup>channels are synthesized after GRO/KC incubation, as this would be consistent with the observation that only the magnitudes of the currents are altered, not their activation range or decay time constants. Our measurements of Na channel subtype expression were consistent with this view. However, we cannot entirely rule out other possibilities such as synthesis of proteins that modulate channels already present. The CXCR2 receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor that has been shown to activate a number of different signalling pathways in neurons, including intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, inositol tris-phosphate, MAP kinases, and CREB (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). In turn all of these pathways can lead to enhanced transcription and protein synthesis through a number of signal transduction pathways. In addition, some G-protein coupled receptors, including the closely related CXCR4 receptor, have been shown to be present in the nucleus as well as on the plasma membrane, where they are thought to activate nuclear effects through additional pathways (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]). This is particularly interesting in light of our observation of nuclear staining for CXCR2 in some cells in addition to plasma membrane staining in DRG neurons. While artifactual nuclear staining can be a problem with immunohistochemical methods, this seems somewhat less likely given the observation that not all nuclei showed staining in our specimens.</p><p>We initially identified GRO/KC as a cytokine that might play important roles in pathological pain because it showed marked early increases in a pain model in which localized inflammation of the DRG is induced by zymosan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Using the same model, we found that localized inflammation led to marked increases in TTX-S and TTX-R currents in small diameter DRG neurons, as well as increased excitability, as determined by patch clamp studies in acutely isolated neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. That study and the present study have certain common findings: both localized inflammation and GRO/KC incubation give striking increases in the magnitude of TTX-S current in both IB4-positive and IB4-negative cells, without obvious changes in inactivation time constant or voltage dependence. Both lead to increased excitability, though these effects are larger for GRO/KC treatment. One difference is that localized inflammation led to increased TTX-R current only in IB4-positive cells, while GRO/KC incubation also increased this current in IB4-negative cells. The comparison of these two studies suggests that GRO/KC elevations in the localized inflammation model provide one plausible explanation for some, but not all of the changes in ion currents and excitability observed in this model. We observed effects on excitability and Na<sup>+ </sup>currents at a relatively low GRO/KC concentration of 1.5 nM, which is well within the physiological range for most peptide receptor actions. In one study, GRO/KC-stimulated (acute) Ca<sup>2+ </sup>elevation in isolated DRG neurons could be observed at GRO/KC concentrations of 6.4 nM but was not significant at 1.2 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In cells expressing cloned CXCR2 receptors, the binding constant for GRO/KC was 0.2 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus it seems plausible that the effects reported here could occur in vivo.</p><p>The TTX-R currents described here, as in our previous study, had characteristics attributed to the Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 isoform. Our recording conditions would have minimized contributions from the persistent current (thought to be mediated by the Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 isoform) due to slow inactivation at the holding potentials used, and/or because the current may "washout" during whole cell patch clamp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Other studies also suggest that the persistent current would be quite small under our recording conditions (adenosine triphosphate in the pipette, Cl<sup>- </sup>as the anion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In our qPCR experiments we observed that the Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 isoform was very low abundance under our culture conditions, though it had levels similar to Nav 1.8 in cDNA derived from whole DRG. Hence the lack of Na<sub>v </sub>1.9 currents in our experiments may be related to the acute culture process; some studies of the persistent current used shorter culture times than we used in this study. The TTX-S current in DRG neurons is mediated by a number of different isoforms, which are not readily distinguished electrophysiologically. Some of the excitability changes we observed after GRO/KC incubation, such as resting membrane depolarization and increased input resistance, are not readily explained by the increased Na<sup>+ </sup>currents observed in the voltage clamp experiments. Hence it is highly likely that additional ion currents can be modulated by GRO/KC. This was also true of localized inflammation, which upregulates voltage activated K<sup>+ </sup>currents as well as Na<sup>+ </sup>currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the pro-inflammatory cytokine GRO/KC (CXCL1), which markedly increases in DRG during the early phase of several models of pathological pain, may exert important pro-nociceptive effects in part through its direct actions on nociceptive neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JW and RY conducted the patch clamp experiments and data analysis.
