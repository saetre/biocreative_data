Western societies face high and increasing rates of CVD (such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, heart failure and arrhytmia etc.), which is considered a number one cause of premature death and disability. Although CVD has been shown to have significant heritability, pinpointing of the genes and variants associated with the elevated risk to the disease has been challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The focus has slowly switched from DNA variants located in genic regions causing direct changes in the encoded protein to the regulatory variants affecting gene expression. Non-coding variants potentially contributing to the susceptibility to complex diseases are localized in promoters and enhancers, introns or <italic>5'</italic>- and <italic>3'-UTR</italic>s, and may affect binding of the gene expression regulators, such as transcription and splicing factors or miRNAs. Comparative genetics studies have noted several essential gene regulatory elements that are conserved among species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, targeting evolutionarily conserved non-coding regions (CNR) in candidate genes for CVD may pinpoint regulatory elements directing the gene expression profile. Genetic variation in these regions may contribute to the susceptibility to CVD. Based on these hypotheses we aimed to target human CVD candidate gene <italic>Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX1; SLC8A1) </italic>with polymorphism screening in CNRs and to test associations of identified variants with CVD and related metabolic traits in two Eastern-European populations.</p><p>Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+ </sup>exchange participates in the regulation of vascular function and thus, disturbances in this process contribute to the development of CVD. Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>+2 </sup>exchanger (NCX1) is a bidirectional calcium transporter, responsible for calcium homeostasis in cardiac myocytes and in other cell types by catalyzing the exchange of one Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ion for three Na<sup>+ </sup>ions across plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Altered Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+ </sup>exchange activity has been observed in arrhythmias, heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and salt-sensitive essential hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>Ncx1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice showed complete lack of Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+ </sup>exchange activity in heart leading to the defects in heart development and embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p><italic>NCX1 </italic>gene (498 908 bp) is located in chromosome 2p22.1 and consists of 12 alternatively spliced exons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Alternative splicing of <italic>NCX1 </italic>produces several tissue-specific isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] differing in their regulatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. NCX1 alternative isoforms respond differently to potential therapeutic agents such as polyunsaturated fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and specific NCX1 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Currently, genetic studies targeting the association of <italic>NCX1 </italic>polymorphisms with CVD are limited. Resequencing of the entire coding and promoter regions in Japanese population identified 15 polymorphisms, two of these variants located &#x0003e;23 kb upstream of the mRNA transcription start site were associated with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>We have conducted a polymorphism screening in <italic>NCX1 </italic>non-coding regions.

Among the total 29 CNR-s selected, 16 intronic regions entered the DHPLC screening (See additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) phase. 13 regions were excluded before the laboratory experiments due to failure in DHPLC primer design, inappropriate length of the PCR and CNR fragment (too long &#x0003e;700 bp or short &#x0003c;50 bp), or more than two different Tm melting points for the region of interest. The average length of the screened CNR segments was 163 bp (SD: 64 bp, range: 70-287 bp) and PCR fragments was 334 bp (SD: 87 bp, range 170-489 bp). Polymorphism screening was performed with 15 different DNA pools, each consisting of DNAs of three patients with cardiovascular disease originating from two Eastern European sample sets (n = 22 from HYPEST and n = 24 from CADCZ study; detailed description is given below). Individual DNAs in the pools exhibiting evidence for the presence of a polymorphism were sequenced at least twice on both forward and reverse orientations.</p></sec><sec><title>DGGE genotyping assay</title><p>Genotyping of the identified 14 bp indel (rs11274804, NCBI dbSNP database) in <italic>NCX1 </italic>intron 2 was performed by standard Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) (Ingeny, Goes, Netherlands). The manufacturer's recommendations were followed in the design of the DGGE assay and in choosing the conditions for the experimental setup.

To initially validate the reliability of the DGGE assay, all DNA samples with alternative genotypes previously detected by DHPLC were re-genotyped at the DGGE platform. To further assure DGGE gel typing system's quality in each assay, double positive (product containing 14 bp indel) and negative controls were used. All ambiguous genotypes in DGGE analysis were re-genotyped twice and/or sequenced on both DNA strands by an ABI 377 Prism automated DNA sequencer using ReproGel 377 gels (Amersham Biosciences Inc., USA). The sequences of all novel variants were verified by resequencing twice on both forward and reverse orientation.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects for association studies with cardiovascular disease</title><p>Two Eastern-European sample collection, HYPEST and CADCZ were used to conduct association analysis of rs11274804 with cardiovascular traits and serum biomarkers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The HYPEST study has been approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research of University of Tartu (no. 122/13, 22.12.2003; 137/20, 25.04.2005). CADCZ study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Charles University--1st Faculty of Medicine (December 1996) and is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The studies were carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and all the participants have given their written informed consent. These sample collections have been recruited to target the genetic-epidemiological component of cardiovascular disease in Estonian and Czech populations, respectively. HYPEST subjects were recruited across Estonia during 2004-2007 (1823 individuals, age range 18-85 years) with the aim to evaluate risk factors for essential hypertension and related cardiovascular disease. Details of the recruitment are given in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>.

In total, we identified 365 conserved non-coding regions between human and mouse and rat (May 2004, NCBI Build 33). These conserved non-coding regions (CNR) covered 15.1% of the analyzed genomic region (gene &#x000b1; 10 kb). Based on the length (50-300 bp), location (&#x0003e;200 bp from the nearest exon) and sequence conservation (&#x0003e;70% between human and both rodents), 29 regions were selected for further polymorphism screening among 46 East-European cardiovascular disease patients (HYPEST n = 22; CADCZ n = 24). Due to the limitations of the technology and/or complex structure of the DNA sequence, 13 of the selected <italic>NCX1 </italic>regions did not qualify for the DHPLC screening. The remaining 16 regions were subjected to polymorphism discovery among cardiovascular phenotype patients. Detailed descriptions of the selected regions as well as inclusion/exclusion criteria for the analysis are given in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. In total, ten genetic variants (including three novel variants) were identified within the 16 analyzed regions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Most of the variations were located within the second intron of the gene (first intron relative to ATG initiation codon), including six SNPs, and one 14 bp indel (rs11274804, NCBI dbSNP database). Two SNPs were detected in the <italic>NCX1 </italic>intron 10 and one SNP in intron 4. Among the screened HYPEST samples (n = 22) three common (minor allele frequency, MAF&#x0003e;10%) and four rare (MAF&#x0003c;10%) variants were identified. Five polymorphisms detected in the studied CADCZ patients (n = 24) were uncommon (MAF&#x0003c;10%) and four were common (MAF&#x0003e;10%).

In addition, the location of rs11274804 indel variant in the second intron of <italic>NCX1 </italic>(the first intron in the coding region) raised the hypothesis about its potential effect on the gene transcription as several gene expression regulatory elements have been mapped within the first introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, this polymorphism as well as its flanking region was selected for further characterization.</p><p>The region flanking the 14 bp indel (348 bp) in <italic>NCX1 </italic>intron 2 was targeted for the larger-scale genotyping using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Our study samples, HYPEST (n = 1122) and CADCZ (n = 670), displayed nine different genotype variants of this intronic segment (representing seven novel alternative alleles), detected by DGGE and confirmed by sequencing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The analyzed region appeared to be highly polymorphic in both sample collections. In addition to 14 bp indel, a SNP (C/G), a duplication of 40 bp segment, and four alternative deletions (10 bp, 43 bp and 5 bp) were localized within the 348 bp region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The breakpoints of several detected variants co-localized with the 14 bp indel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The allele frequencies of the detected variants in the full genotyped sample (n = 1792) varied from singletons (10 bp deletion; 40 bp duplication) to common polymorphisms with allele frequencies up to 8.51% (14 bp indel). The 43 bp deletion was enriched in HYPEST samples (20 subjects in HYPEST versus 1 in CADCZ). One HYPEST subject appeared to be a compound heterozygote for 14 bp indel/43 bp deletion.

So far, fine-scale polymorphism discovery in the coding, and promoter regions of the <italic>NCX1 </italic>gene have been carried out only among Japanese individuals, where twopromoter SNPs were shown to be associated with essential hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] as one of the major risk factor for several CVDs (i.e. CAD). We conducted the polymorphism discovery in <italic>NCX1 </italic>non-coding conserved regions using CVD patients from two Eastern-European sample collections (HYPEST, essential hypertension; CADCZ, coronary artery disease). Among the ten identified variants, the genomic context of the 14 bp indel located in <italic>NCX1 </italic>gene intron 2 and its association with CVD was studied in detail. First introns have previously been indicated to contain essential regulatory elements and therefore, may contribute to the transcriptional regulation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and splicing. For example, in human <italic>CFTR </italic>gene a regulatory intronic DNase I hypertensive site (DHS) was shown to be required for the normal expression levels in the intestinal epithelium <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The expression profiles of human angiotensin II type 2 receptor <italic>AGTR2 </italic>and erythroid-specific <italic>GATA-1 </italic>are affected by regulatory elements in intron 1 containing transcription factor binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Genotyping of the 14 bp indel locus revealed the hypervariable nature of the studied genomic segment within <italic>NCX1 </italic>intron 2. Among the screened Eastern-Europeans (n = 1792) the analyzed 348 bp region was represented by seven different alleles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The alignments of human-chimpanzee-macaque sequences revealed that the major human variant (allele frequency 90.45%) was actually a human-specific deletion compared to other primates. The most common alternative variant, the 14 bp indel, appeared to have the ancestral status among primates. Both, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque possess this common 14 bp sequence tract in their <italic>NCX1 </italic>intron 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Either natural selection or genetic drift may have contributed to the enrichment of the novel 14 bp deletion variant among humans. The data suggests that the novel deletion variant may carry a selective advantage among humans as it was found to be associated with decreased risk for CAD and elevated serum triglyceride levels. In primate evolution, emergence of such short indel variants and indel-related transcriptional and translational changes may have provided an additional source for the flexible response of genomes to the changing life-style and environmental conditions. As a supportive observation, an enrichment of indels in immunity-associated loci has been found as a possible response to variable virus infections (i.e. HIV) in human and chimpanzee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The human-specific deletion variant is surrounded by an abundance of other short (5-43 bp) deletion variants and a duplication (40 bp) polymorphism, which possess overlapping breakpoints (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). This observed high variation refers to a potential indel hotspot, which may have been triggered by the initial 14 bp deletion in human lineage. This scenario is consistent with a recent report revealing the mutagenic role of the indel heterozygosity to its surrounding sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The state of indel heterozygosity is expected to affect localized chromosome pairing during meiosis. Regions with indel heterozygosity might be prone to double stranded DNA breaks and are thus targeted to mutational repair, which in turn leads to higher mutation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A consensus sequence motif GTAAG has been reported with the high prevalence within genomic regions prone to insertion/deletion events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The sequence (CATTCCCTCTCCAT) of the 14 bp indel identified in this study contains the inverted sequence of this previously described hotspot motif on the reverse strand (GTAAG vs. CATTC). In addition, the studied hypervariable <italic>NCX1 </italic>intronic region harboured two further CATTC motifs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Low LD in this region additionally refers to active genome dynamics (See in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p><p>High prevalence of small indels (&#x0003c;100 bp) has been found to be preferably associated with alternatively spliced genes, where partial inclusion and deletion of genic regions may broaden gene expression profiles in different tissue types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Among the 12 exons coded by the human <italic>NCX1 </italic>gene there are six alternative untranslated 5'-exons denoted 1a-1f. Different combinations of these six exons may result in up to 32 different Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+ </sup>exchanger mRNA transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The hypothesis that preferences in splice-site selection among <italic>NCX1 </italic>exons 1a-1f (and other alternative exons) may be affected by the genetic composition in the hypervariable intron 2 requires experimental proof.</p><p>The knowledge about the involvement of small indels (&#x0003c;100 bp) in increasing/decreasing susceptibility to the development of complex disease is still scarce. A well-known example is 32 bp deletion in human the <italic>CCR5 </italic>gene that results in a frameshift and premature termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. This variant, which is common among Europeans (MAF 9.2%) and almost absent among Africans contributes to the resistance against HIV-1 infection. It was speculated that a 10 bp direct repeat that flanks the deleted region promoted a recombination event leading to the 32 bp deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The effect of indels in non-coding regions is less understood. A recent study identified a 25 bp deletion in intron 32 of the human <italic>MYBPC3 </italic>gene leading to the loss of exon 33. The carriers of this deletion develop heritable cardiomyopathies and have increased risk of heart failure in Indian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The current study identified a strong association between the carrier status of <italic>NCX1 </italic>intronic 14 bp indel and increased risk to coronary artery disease (CAD) in the East European population. The risk was the highest among the CAD patients with metabolic disease. Consistent with the effect on metabolic processes, the 14 bp indel was also associated with serum triglyceride levels. Several recent studies have highlighted the role of metabolic factors and metabolic syndrome in determining the extent of CAD and the risk for new vascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In perspective, the association study of rs11274804 as well as other identified indel variants in <italic>NCX1 </italic>intron 2 with CAD and related metabolic factors is to be extended to other populations. The expression of <italic>NCX1 </italic>alternative transcripts in vascular muscle (NCX1.3 isoform) and in heart (NCX1.1 isoform) further supports the potential involvement of <italic>NCX1 </italic>genetic variants in susceptibility to coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Functional studies would reveal whether the carrier status of alternative <italic>NCX1 </italic>intronic indel variants affects the alternative transcript profile of the gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, compared to SNPs targeted by large number of locus-specific and genome-wide assays, considerably less attention has been paid to short insertion-deletions (indels) variants in the human genome. The data of genome dynamics, mutation rate and population genetics of short indels, as well as their impact on gene expressional profile and human disease susceptibility is limited. The characterization of <italic>NCX1 </italic>intronic hypervariable region enriched in human-specific indel variants contributes to this gap of knowledge.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KK contributed to the study design, performed polymorphism screening, genotyping and resequencing experiments, contributed to the analysis and interpretation of the data and write the first draft of the manuscript.
