The fold appears to have a strong association with fatty acid biosynthesis, its regulation and metabolism, as the proteins with this fold are predominantly coenzyme A-binding enzymes with a variety of substrates located at their active sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have analyzed the structural features and sequences of proteins having the hot dog fold.

The hot dog fold in this structure is formed by a sausage-like long central helix wrapped around by a highly curved six-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet resembling the bun (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Several protein structures determined since then were shown to contain this fold. These proteins take part in several functions including the dehydration step of fatty acid elongation, thioester hydrolysis, transcription regulation in fatty acid metabolism and degradation of phenylacetic acid and environmental pollutants.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Dimer of FabA from <italic>E. coli</italic></bold>.

The binding site in FabA has been identified as a well-formed deep tunnel present at the subunit interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Residues from both subunits contribute to the formation of the tunnel which is hydrophobic in nature except at the two catalytic residues His70 and Asp84. FabA, being a homodimer, consists of two tunnels related by a twofold symmetry. The active site is located slightly below the surface of the protein and the active residues at each site come from a different subunit.</p><p>Dillon and Bateman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] have unified the large superfamily of hot dog fold proteins by an extensive analysis of their sequences. They have classified a large number of proteins from prokaryotes, archaea and eukaryotes of this superfamily into 17 subfamilies based on the clustering of sequences and available structural and biochemical information. Consensus sequence motifs were identified by them for each subfamily. Though all these proteins possess the hot dog fold, the inter-subfamily sequence similarities are very low (10&#x02013;20%). They showed that the hot dog fold domain, though exists as a single entity of the coded proteins, also associates with other domains, suggesting the occurrence of domain fusion events involving this domain. It has been found to be associated with a second hot dog fold domain in tandem and also with various types of other domains such as LpxC (UDP-3-O-acyl N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase), AMP binding, acyl transferase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and a few more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In the last two years, there has been an enormous increase in reports of the structures of hot dog fold containing proteins and the deposition of their coordinates in the Protein Data Bank. Currently, the PDB contains more than sixty non-redundant crystal structures of proteins with the hot dog fold, a majority of them being hypothetical proteins taken up by structural genomics programs, for which no other characterization has been reported until now (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The availability of a reasonable number of crystal structures of hot dog fold proteins facilitated a more detailed comparative analysis across the subfamilies. Here, we attempt to group these hot dog fold proteins into their corresponding subfamilies and analyze the structure-function relationships of the subfamilies having representative crystal structures. This paper describes a detailed structural comparison of the hot dog fold proteins and their different modes of quaternary associations and functional diversity. This analysis made it possible to predict functional subfamilies and identify possible catalytic residues for a number of hypothetical proteins with known structures which should aid in further experimental verifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Diversity in quaternary association and function</title><p>Each subunit of a hot dog fold is made up of 5 or 6 highly curved antiparallel &#x003b2;-strands wrapped around a long &#x003b1;-helix. Our analysis indicated that the basic structural repeat unit of the hot dog fold proteins is either a homodimer of two such subunits or a double hot dog with a single polypeptide chain folding into two hot dog domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The dimer of hot dog folds is formed by the association of &#x003b2;-sheets from both the subunits to form a continuous anti-parallel &#x003b2;-sheet. The two helices run antiparallel to each other at the dimer interface. In the enzymes with the repeat unit as the dimer of hot dogs, the active sites comprise residues from both the subunits. In the case of double hot dogs, the two domains have an undetectable sequence similarity (~10% identity as derived from structure-based alignment). However, at the nucleotide level, the sequence identity between the two domains of the double hot dogs is around 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Though these basic building blocks (homodimer or double hot dog) of various subfamilies are similar with root mean square deviations (rmsd) of 1.0&#x02013;3.0 &#x000c5; for the C&#x003b1; atoms, they differ in their quaternary associations and are highly divergent in their sequences. The various quaternary associations observed are dimers (D); tetramers with central helix interactions at the tetramer interface (TA); tetramers with back to back stacking of the &#x003b2;-sheets of the repeating units (TB); hexamers with active site loops at the interface (H1); hexamers with N-terminal helices at the interface (H2); hexamers with head-to-tail arrangement of dimers (H3); dimers of double hot dogs with central helix interactions (D<sub>dh</sub>A); dimers of double hot dogs with back to back stacking of &#x003b2;-sheets (D<sub>dh</sub>B); and trimers of double hot dogs (Tr<sub>dh</sub>) which appear like H2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The two domains of the double hot dogs are connected by long loops. Though they connect the second &#x003b2;-strand from the centre in the first subunit to the last &#x003b2;-strand of the second subunit in all the cases, the loops have considerable variation in length and conformation and also in the direction they follow to connect the subunits. This variation in the nature of the connecting loops appears to be linked with the quaternary association (D<sub>dh</sub>A, D<sub>dh</sub>B and Tr<sub>dh</sub>) of the double hot dog fold proteins. The analysis of buried surface areas of various types of quaternary association has revealed that approximately 17&#x02013;20%, 20&#x02013;25%, 26&#x02013;30%, 32&#x02013;36%, 26&#x02013;30% and 16% surface area per monomer gets buried upon the formation of D, TA, TB, H1, H2 and H3 types of quaternary associations, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Various quaternary associations of hot dog fold proteins</bold>.

It always forms a dimer (or a double hot dog) or higher oligomers. There are different modes of association of the basic building blocks in higher oligomers, but strict correlation between oligomeric state and function has not always been observed. Subfamilies with hot dog fold proteins of similar quaternary associations differ in their substrate specificities. On the other hand, proteins with different quaternary associations and highly divergent sequences can carryout the same reaction as in the case of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterases. In all the crystal structures considered, the consensus sequence motifs identified earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] are localized at the active site and at the interface of the quaternary association indicating that the information about the substrate specificity and quaternary association are encoded in the sequence. Variations of the consensus sequence at the interface change the oligomeric state. The double hot dog domains are found to accommodate bulkier substrates and generally contain one active site per dimer instead of two. The structure-function relationships of subfamilies with the available representative crystal structures (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) are discussed here.</p></sec><sec><title>Subfamilies of the hot dog fold suprefamily of proteins</title><sec><title>1. Dehydratases (FabA and FabZ)</title><p>The two subfamilies of dehydratases, FabA-like dehydratases and FabZ-like dehydratases have been well studied both biochemically and structurally. Both FabA and FabZ are isozymes catalyzing the third step of elongation in Type II fatty acid biosynthesis. FabZ is only a dehydratase while FabA has an additional isomerase activity. The biological oligomer of FabZ is a hexamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], a trimer of dimers where the active site loops are stabilized by the interactions at the hexameric interface. However, FabA is active as a dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Dimers of FabA and FabZ superpose with a rmsd of around 1.5 &#x000c5; and the positions of the catalytic dyad (Glu-His in the case of FabZ and Asp-His in the case of FabA) are structurally conserved. The two <italic>cis </italic>peptides Tyr-Pro (FabZ)/Ala-Pro (FabA) in the N-terminal loop lining the active site tunnel and His-Phe harbouring the catalytic histidine are conserved in both the classes of enzymes. However, there is a subtle difference in the overall architecture of the active site tunnels, which was attributed to the additional isomerase activity of FabA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It was shown by domain-swapping experiments that the &#x003b2;-strand at the dimer interface and the loop connecting this &#x003b2;-strand to the next one are important for isomerase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the case of FabA, consensus sequence motifs are localized to the loops that form the active site tunnel and the region responsible for the isomerase activity, while in the case of FabZ, the consensus sequence motifs are located on active site loops which are also involved in hexameric contacts. When a hexamer of FabA was generated by superimposing three dimers onto the three dimers of hexameric FabZ, severe steric clashes of less than 1 &#x000c5; were observed at the dimer-dimer interfaces between the atoms of the loops containing the catalytic histidine and the loop involved in isomerase activity, thus indicating the neccessity of the dimeric state of FabA to function as a dehydratase/isomerase.</p><p>Each step of the FAS II pathway present in bacteria and plants is catalyzed by a distinct enzyme. In contrast to this, in the FAS I pathway of mammals and fungi, all the reactions are catalyzed by a large single multienzyme complex called the synthase. The dehydratase domain identified in each subunit of the homodimeric porcine fatty acid synthase structure (PDB code: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2CF2">2CF2</ext-link>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]) was found to have the double hot dog fold flanked by FabD (malonyl-CoA/acyl-CoA-ACP transacylase) and FabI (NADPH-dependent &#x003b2;-enoyl reductase) domains. As the structure is available at a low resolution of 4.5 &#x000c5; and the deposited coordinates contain only the C&#x003b1; atoms of the fitted model, it is not included in further analysis presented in the paper.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Thioesterases</title><p>This group of enzymes catalyzes the hydrolysis of the thioester bond in fatty acids bound to CoA or acyl carrier protein (ACP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The thioesterases belong to different subfamilies of hot dog fold proteins as they differ in their substrate specificities and are also highly divergent in sequences. Eight of the seventeen subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] of hot dog fold proteins are thioesterases and representative crystal structures are available for all of these thioesterase subfamilies (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>a. Acyl-CoA thioesterases</title><p>Acyl-CoA thioesterases are widespread in prokaryotes and are also found in a few eukaryotes.

Though the catalytic mechanism is similar, the positions of the carboxylate residues, Asp17 in 4HBT-I (<ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1BVQ">1BVQ</ext-link>) and Glu73 in 4HBT-II (<ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1Q4T">1Q4T</ext-link>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]), involved in catalysis are different. These two enzymes having the same fold and catalyzing the same reaction differ remarkably in their quaternary associations. In 4HBT-I the active site is formed at the dimer interface, while in 4HBT II three subunits contribute to the active site. A hypothetical protein (PDB code: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2OAF">2OAF</ext-link>) has a consensus sequence motif of that of 4HBT-I and forms a TA tetramer. For 4HBT-II, the extra N-terminal motif, which is also one of the consensus motifs, is positioned before the central helix and prevents the formation of helix-to-helix packing observed in the quaternary association of 4HBT-I.

A novel induced fit mechanism was observed in the case of TtPaaI, where only two of the four active sites accommodate the ligand, indicating half of the sites reactivity.

These classes cluster together in the phylogenetic tree as well.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of active site residues</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Subfamily</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Biological assembly</bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold>Catalytic residues</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Others</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1 a)</td><td align="center">D</td><td align="center">Asp</td><td align="center">His</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">b)</td><td align="center">H1</td><td align="center">Glu147*</td><td align="center">His133*</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">2 a)</td><td align="center">H2</td><td align="center">Asp</td><td align="center">-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">b)</td><td align="center">TB</td><td align="center">Asp</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">Additional Thr &#x00026; Gln</td></tr><tr><td align="left">c)</td><td align="center">TA</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">Asp</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">e) i</td><td align="center">TA</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">Asp</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;ii</td><td align="center">TB</td><td align="center">Glu</td><td align="center">-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">f)</td><td align="center">TB &#x00026; D</td><td align="center">Asp</td><td align="center">-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">3</td><td align="center">D, D<sub>dh</sub>A, Tr<sub>dh</sub>, H2</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">His</td><td align="center">Asp in a slightly different location</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="center">TA</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">Asp</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Catalytic residues corresponding to FabZ of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>(PDB code: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1Z6B">1Z6B</ext-link>).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Highly divergent sequences lead to similar structures</title><p>The present analysis shows correlations between the oligomerization, function and sequence of proteins with the hot dog fold (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). At the subunit level, the proteins possess highly divergent sequences but adopt a similar fold. A detailed comparison of these proteins revealed conserved hydrophobic interactions between the residues from the central helix and the various parts of the curved &#x003b2;-sheet. Though the residues involved in these interactions are from different parts of the sequence in different proteins, the interactions are structurally conserved and hence form the driving force for the formation of the hot dog fold.</p></sec><sec><title>Ligand and pH induced Structural Changes</title><p>Two of the 64 proteins discussed in this analysis show structural changes upon ligand binding.

In the case of <italic>B. subtilis </italic>FapR (PDB code: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2F3X">2F3X</ext-link>), upon ligand binding, three flexible loops become ordered, a substrate binding tunnel is formed leading to conformational changes in the helix-turn-helix motif resulting in the impairment of DNA binding.</p><p>The third enzyme in which structural changes have been observed is FabZ of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>(PDB codes: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1Z6B">1Z6B</ext-link> &#x00026;<ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1ZHG">1ZHG</ext-link>). As reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the two <italic>cis </italic>peptide bonds in the active site loops of the active hexameric FabZ molecule flip to <italic>trans </italic>peptide bonds, leading to large conformational changes in the active site loops, by which the architecture of the catalytic site drastically changes making it incapable of binding to the substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). In addition, the hexamer dissociates into inactive dimers as the changes affect the loops at the hexamer interfaces. Extensive Dynamic Light Scattering and gel filtration studies showed that these transitions are triggered by pH changes.</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>The active site tunnel in different forms of <italic>P. falciparum </italic>FabZ</bold>. a) active hexameric (PDB code: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1Z6B">1Z6B</ext-link>) and b) inactive dimeric form of FabZ from <italic>P. falciparum </italic>(PDB code:<ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1ZHG">1ZHG</ext-link>).

Our analysis led to the identification of the probable functions of the hypothetical proteins containing the hot dog fold through detailed structural comparisons and identification of sequence motifs. Our analysis also demonstrates that quaternary association and function are related in certain cases. The consensus sequence motifs localized to the interface of quaternary structure and active site direct the mode of association and substrate specificity. Different modes of quaternary association were observed in the MaoC subfamily where the consensus sequence motif at the interface varies considerably. Double hot dog domains might have evolved by gene duplication to accommodate bulky substrates and to regulate activity by the asymmetric induced fit mechanism. It appears to be a case of directed divergent evolution where sequences changed substantially to design various types of quaternary association to carry out different functions with the same fold.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Functional annotation of hot dog fold proteins</title><p>All non-redundant crystal structures containing the hot dog fold in the PDB were identified using the DALI server hosted by the EMBL-EBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] using a dimer of FabZ from <italic>P. falciparum </italic>(PDB code: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1Z6B">1Z6B</ext-link>) as a search model. The sequence of one representative structure from each subfamily obtained from the DALI search was submitted to the Blastp server of NCBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and a search for homologues in the PDB was carried out which resulted in the identification of all the structures with the hot dog fold within the subfamilies. A total of 64 non-redundant crystal structures were considered for the present analysis. Out of these structures, more than forty are from various structural genomics programs and have not been biochemically characterized so far. We attempted to assign functions to these proteins based on sequence and structural analysis. These crystal structures were grouped into respective subfamilies according to the presence of consensus sequence motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and available biochemical information. For the structures where the consensus sequences were not strictly followed, homologous proteins were picked up from the Swissprot database using the BLAST server. The consensus sequence motifs could be readily identified in these homologous proteins and these were used to assign the function. The crystal structures were visually examined in PyMOL [DeLano Scientific LLC] to identify the repeating structural unit. The possible quaternary association was identified by displaying the symmetry-related molecules and was further confirmed by examining the buried surface areas using the server MSDpisa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. For the hypothetical proteins classified into structurally and functionally characterized subfamilies, the functional annotation was confirmed by the similarities in the mode of quaternary association and structural conservation of the active site architecture. Pairwise structural superposition of the monomers and dimers was carried out using DaliLite. These results are used to calculate the structural distance measure (SDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. SDM values are calculated based on structural superposition and thus provide a better model for the evolutionary relation of proteins with very low sequence identities. MEGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] is used to generate the final phylogenetic tree using the distance matrix of the SDM values.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Theme of the paper originated from KS and LSP and the paper was written by them.
