Although the mechanisms responsible for the induction of oral tolerance have not been elucidated fully, repeated oral administration of a high dose of antigen can induce oral tolerance by anergy or deletion of antigen-specific T cells. In contrast, repeated feeding of a low dose of antigen favors the induction of active immune regulation involving regulatory T cells, including transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;)-producing T helper 3 cells, IL-10-producing T regulatory 1 cells, and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that, after repeated oral administration of type II collagen (CII) and subsequent induction of CIA, the mean arthritis index is lower in tolerized mice than in CIA mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the proportion of IL-10-producing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>T cells increases in Peyer's patches and spleens of tolerized mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Among the various immune cells involved in the induction of oral tolerance, dendritic cells (DCs) may play a major role in linking orally administered antigen to antigen-specific tolerance.</p><p>DCs are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play a decisive role in determining immunity or immune tolerance; this determination is based on the maturation or activation state and the subset of DCs, and cytokine profiles in the microenvironment at the time of antigen uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A previous study demonstrated that CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+ </sup>DCs, which increase in number in Peyer's patches during the induction of tolerance to CII, suppress T-cell proliferation and induce CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>regulatory T cells. CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+ </sup>DCs, however, promote T-cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying the suppression by DCs of the expansion and differentiation of effector T cells and promotion of T-cell tolerance remain elusive.</p><p>One regulatory mechanism of DCs is the suppression of proliferation by producing the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which degrades the essential amino acid tryptophan. Murine macrophages and DCs expressing IDO inhibit T-cell proliferation or induce T-cell apoptosis <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

Upon exposure to allergen within the mucosa, Langerhans-like DCs expressing high-affinity IgE receptors produce IL-10 and TGF&#x003b2;, upregulate IDO expression, and suppress the allergic response in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Whether the tolerogenic activity of DCs from Peyer's patches in orally tolerized mice is IDO dependent, however, is unknown.</p><p>To elucidate the expression of IDO and its role in the induction of oral tolerance, we prepared DCs from Peyer's patches of DBA/1 mice after induction of oral tolerance by repeated oral administration of CII and subsequent induction of CIA. We examined whether IDO-expressing DCs have tolerogenic characteristics and whether they can induce CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>regulatory T cells.

In freshly isolated Peyer's patches, the proportion of CD11c<sup>+ </sup>IDO<sup>+ </sup>DCs was higher in tolerized mice than that in CIA mice. We found that IDO expression was induced most by oral CII feeding plus CII immunization, and that the expression of IDO did not correlate with disease severity. Next, we investigated whether the expression of IDO by DCs takes place during the initial phase of oral CII feeding or after the immunization with CII for CIA induction. In these studies, Peyer's patches were isolated from mice that had been fed with CII or PBS but not immunized with CII. We examined the expression of IDO <italic>in situ</italic>. The expression of IDO by DCs increased in Peyer's patches of CII-fed mice, even though these mice had not been immunized.

IDO expression is detected constitutively in human regulatory plasmacytoid DCs and can be induced by classical DC maturation stimuli, namely IFN&#x003b3; and lipopolysaccharide or prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, which contribute to their immunoregulatory capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In our study, the phenotype of DCs from tolerized mice showed an immature tolerogenic state and low levels of surface MHC II and CD86 molecules, and expressed high levels of IDO compared with DCs from CIA mice. Our study suggests that IDO is expressed constitutively in immature DCs upon repeated oral administration of CII in an animal model without artificial administration of CTLA-4 immunoglobulin or other DC-modifying agents.</p><p>Because IDO expression on DCs plays a crucial role in the induction of regulatory T cells and inhibition of the antigen-specific T-cell response, we performed mixed lymphocyte cultures to determine whether DCs isolated from Peyer's patches of tolerized mice and CIA mice have an IDO-dependent effect on CII-specific T cells. DCs from the tolerized mice inhibited the proliferation of CII-specific T cells and inflammatory cytokine production compared with DCs from CIA mice, and these suppressive effects were more evident after CII stimulation and were abrogated by addition of 1-MT, an IDO inhibitor. These findings suggest that the functional activities of IDO from tolerized mice could affect the T-cell response.</p><p>In the resting state, autoreactive T cells residing in the periphery are suppressed effectively by regulatory T cells, which are thought to prevent the development of autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].
