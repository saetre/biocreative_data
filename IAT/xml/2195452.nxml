Phase 1 mutations arise from DNA replication across the uracil residue or the abasic site, generated by the uracil-DNA glycosylase, yielding transitions or transversions at G:C pairs. Phase 2 mutations result from the recognition of the U&#x02236;G mismatch by the Msh2/Msh6 complex (MutS Homologue), followed by the excision of the mismatched nucleotide and the repair, by the low fidelity DNA polymerase &#x003b7;, of the gap generated by the exonuclease I. These mutations are mainly focused at A&#x02236;T pairs. Whereas in activated B cells both G:C and A&#x02236;T pairs are equally targeted, ectopic expression of AID was shown to trigger only G:C mutations on a stably integrated reporter gene. Here we show that when using non-replicative episomal vectors containing a GFP gene, inactivated by the introduction of stop codons at various positions, a high level of EGFP positive cells was obtained after transient expression in Jurkat cells constitutively expressing AID. We show that mutations at G:C and A&#x02236;T pairs are produced. EGFP positive cells are obtained in the absence of vector replication demonstrating that the mutations are dependent only on the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. This implies that the generation of phase 1 mutations is not a prerequisite for the expression of phase 2 mutations.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Affinity maturation of the humoral immune response arises from the stepwise introduction of single nucleotide substitutions into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes during B cell proliferation in germinal centers.

SHM is initiated by deamination of deoxycytidine (C) to deoxyuridine (U) in single-stranded DNA, produced during the transcription of the variable (V) gene. Phase 1 mutations are introduced during replication across the G:U mismatch and result in G:C to A&#x02236;T transitions. If the U base is removed before replication by uracil-DNA glycosylase, the replication of the abasic site, created by a translesion DNA polymerase, gives rise to both transitions and transversions. Phase 2 mutations are mainly restricted to A&#x02236;T pairs surrounding a U&#x02236;G mismatch and involve the mismatch repair machinery. The recognition of the U&#x02236;G mismatch by the Msh2/Msh6 complex results in a mutagenic patch repair mechanism involving exonuclease I and the low-fidelity DNA polymerase &#x003b7; (POL&#x00397;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-DiNoia1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Rada1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In activated B cells, G:C and A&#x02236;T pairs are equally targeted at V genes. However, in B cell lines, as well in non-B cell lines in which AID is ectopically expressed, mutations at G:C pairs are mainly found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Bachl1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Yoshikawa1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>; why mutations at A&#x02236;T pairs are almost always absent remains unclear. In activated B cells, A&#x02236;T mutations are strictly dependent on the Msh2/Msh6 pathway and are presumed to be introduced during patch repair by POLH, in the absence of DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Martomo1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Neuberger1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

The absence of mutations at A&#x02236;T pairs in B or non-B cell lines expressing AID could be explained either by the prevalence of phase 1 mutations at G:C pairs preventing MMR from occurring or, alternatively, by recruiting a high fidelity DNA polymerase during the patch repair.</p><p>In order to examine if AID is able to trigger mutations in the absence of DNA replication in a non-B cell line, we developed a highly sensitive assay based on the reversion of nonsense mutations of the EGFP gene cloned in a non replicating vector.

We transfected the SHM vectors into cells that do not express the T antigen to prevent the plasmids from replicating, which was confirmed by a DpnI replication assay (data not shown).

The mutated EGFP protein is truncated and non-fluorescent. If the stop codon reverts fluorescence is restored and the cells can be detected by flow cytometry in the green fluorescence channel. The number of vector molecules present in transfected cells can not be evaluated precisely thus, it is not possible to estimate a mutation rate. The mutation level is, therefore, a relative value and corresponds to the percentage of fluorescent cells. This value depends on the percentage of cells transfected with an SHM vector. Consequently, the mutation level was expressed as the percentage of fluorescent cells relative to the transfection efficiency. Transfection efficiency was estimated using a plasmid containing a wild-type EGFP gene and was typically around 30&#x02013;50&#x00025; in Jurkat cells, 15&#x02013;35&#x00025; in Jurkat-AID cells.</p><fig id="pone-0001480-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001480.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>SHM vectors used to monitor SHM in AID-expressing cell lines (A) <italic>p</italic>mutEGFP vector: EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein), a variant of the GFP gene, is placed under the control of the CMV promoter (human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter/enhancer); pUC&#x02013;prokaryotic origin of replication; AMP<sup>R</sup> &#x02013;ampicillin resistance gene; SV40 ori&#x02013;eukaryotic origin of replication; Kan<sup>R</sup>/Neo<sup>R</sup>&#x02013;kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene (B) <italic>p</italic>EM7-EGFP vector: EGFP is placed under the control of both an eukaryotic (CMV) and prokaryoric (EM7) promoter; pUC&#x02013;prokaryotic origin of replication; SV40 ori&#x02013;eukaryotic origin of replication; Kan<sup>R</sup>/Neo<sup>R</sup>&#x02013;kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene (C) Sequence contexts of premature stop codons in the EGFP gene.</title><p>The upper row corresponds to the wild-type sequences and the lower row to the mutated sequences.

Our system is based on the reversion of a nonsense mutation in an EGFP gene, cloned downstream of the CMV promoter/enhancer. The data demonstrate that transiently transfected DNA can be mutated in a AID dependent manner in non-B cells. Both G:C and A&#x02236;T mutations were detected, suggesting that the lesion introduced by AID is sufficient for triggering both types of mutations. The high sensitivity of our transient assay is probably due to the high plasmid copy number introduced in each cell (10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> per cell) and to the fact that the reversion of only one stop codon per cell is sufficient to be detected on a FACS analyzer.</p><p>In general, phase 1 mutations, located at the level of the U&#x02236;G mispairs, are only found after the replication fork has passed the abasic site produced by uracil-DNA glycosylase and a dNTP has been inserted opposite the abasic site. The fact that the reporter gene can not replicate demonstrates that, not only G:C, but also A&#x02236;T mutations are not typical phase 1 mutations.</p><p>How can we explain the mutability of the reporter gene in the absence of DNA replication in Jurkat-AID cells? Numerous studies have shown that the rate of mutation of V regions is proportional to the rate of transcription. The biochemical demonstration that AID deaminates C in single stranded (ss) DNA led to the proposal that transcription triggers separation of the DNA strands, each ss DNA is then exposed to the action of AID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Bachl1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Bransteitter1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Ramiro1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The EGFP reporter gene is under the control of a strong promoter and this could explain its high mutability, caused by the formation of ss DNA created by the supercoiling of the DNA. It is interesting to observe that all three types of codons were reverted in the Jurkat-AID cell line and that the TAG-52 codon also reverted at a significant level in Jurkat cells without AID. The high mutability of the TAG-52 codon can be explained by the influence of secondary structures. Wright and coworkers showed that the position of the nucleotide within the stem loop structure determines the mutability of the nucleotide in prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Wright1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Wright2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Wright3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The most hypermutable bases are located immediately next to stems in stable DNA stem-loop structures (SLS). In light of this, we can assume that the background mutation for the TAG-52 codon, which lies within two adjacent hotspot motifs, is considerably higher compared to the other codons, due to a secondary structure effect (SLS effect). This phenomenon is amplified in AID expressing cells.</p><p>How can the formation of a U&#x02236;G mismatch by AID trigger the reversion of the stop codons? Theoretically the elimination of a mismatch in non-dividing cells by MMR can operate without distinguishing between the two DNA strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-MacPhee1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of a U&#x02236;G mismatch this results, with equal probability, either in a G&#x02236;C &#x02192; A&#x02236;T transition or in the maintenance of the sequence. Clearly none of the reversions of the three stop codons in the EGFP gene correspond to a G&#x02236;C &#x02192; A&#x02236;T transition. We therefore postulate that the reversion of the stop codon is introduced during MMR. MMR involves the recognition of the U&#x02236;G mismatch by the Msh2/Msh6 heterodimer, endonucleotide cleavage of one of the DNA strands and the creation of a gap by exonuclease I. While gap repair is usually error-free due to the activity of high fidelity DNA polymerase &#x003b4; &#x00026; &#x003b5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Lindahl1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Modrich1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, during phase 2 of SHM, the gap could be repaired by error-prone DNA polymerases that insert mispaired nucleotides at A&#x02236;T pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Neuberger1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Casali1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. A key question is why the mechanism that normally insures the fidelity of DNA repair in non-B cells seems ineffective in Jurkat-AID cells? DNA mismatch repair is normally used to correct mispairing occurring during DNA replication. Its efficiency is based on its ability to distinguish between parental and neosynthetized DNA strands. In the absence of DNA replication a mismatch will be repaired with equal probability to fix the mutation or to restore the wild type sequence. If theorically mutagenic mismatch repair in the absence of DNA replication does not require a specialized DNA polymerase, the high rate of mutation observed during SHM is achieved by the recruitment of specialized error-prone DNA polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Casali1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001480-Seki1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>These results strongly support the view that, even in non dividing cells, mismatch repair can trigger mutations at distance from the initial mismatch. In addition, phase 2 mutations can be expressed independently of phase 1 mutations, before the passage of the replication fork.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p><italic>p</italic>mutEGFP-TAG182, <italic>p</italic>mutEGFP-TAG52, <italic>p</italic>mutEGFP-TAA52 were obtained as follows.
