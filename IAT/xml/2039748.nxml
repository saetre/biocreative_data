These lesions can occur at successive times and in distant parts of the genome constituting a permanent threat to the genetic integrity. Numerous repair pathways have evolved to reestablish and maintain the genetic information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The recent identification of DNA methyltransferase I at repair sites indicated that not only the genetic but also the epigenetic information is restored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The repair of DNA lesions involves multiple steps including initial damage recognition, intracellular signaling and the recruitment of repair factors. For the latter step so called loading platforms are considered to play a central role by locally concentrating and coordinating repair factors at sites of DNA damage. These loading platforms have no enzymatic activity of their own but interact with numerous proteins through highly conserved binding motifs. XRCC1 (X-ray cross complementing factor 1) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) both fulfill these criteria and are therefore considered to act as central loading platforms in DNA replication and repair (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]).</p><p>XRCC1 was first identified in the Chinese Hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cell line EM9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This cell line shows a defect in single strand break repair (SSBR) and increased sensitivity to alkylating agents and ionizing irradiation resulting in elevated frequency of spontaneous chromosome aberrations and deletions. The importance of XRCC1 is further underlined by the embryonic lethality of <italic>XRCC1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The fact that XRCC1 interacts with various proteins involved in SSBR and base excision repair (BER), including PARP-1, PARP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] Polymerase-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and DNA Ligase III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] suggests that XRCC1 acts as a loading platform in these pathways. Interestingly, XRCC1 also interacts with PCNA and it was proposed that this interaction facilitates efficient SSBR during DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>PCNA forms a homotrimeric ring around the DNA allowing both stable association with and sliding along the DNA double helix. Therefore PCNA is often referred to as a "sliding clamp" mediating interaction of various proteins with DNA in a sequence-independent manner. Photobleaching experiments have shown that in DNA replication PCNA acts as stationary loading platform for transiently interacting Okazaki fragment maturation proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the last few years it has become evident that PCNA is not only essential for DNA replication but also for various DNA repair pathways including nucleotide excision repair (NER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], base excision repair (BER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], mismatch repair (MMR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Recently it has been shown, that accumulation of PCNA at DNA repair sites is independent of the RFC complex, which loads PCNA onto DNA during DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore PCNA plays also an important role in postreplicative processes such as cytosine methylation and chromatin assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In most cases, proteins involved in these processes directly bind to PCNA through a conserved PCNA-binding domain (PBD). This raises the question of how binding is coordinated and sterical hindrance avoided in DNA replication and repair. Recent studies have shown that posttranslational modifications of PCNA such as ubiquitinylation and sumoylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] mediate a switch between DNA replication and different repair pathways.</p><p>To study the dynamics of the two loading platforms XRCC1 and PCNA at DNA repair sites in Hela cells we used a combination of microirradiation, live cell microscopy and photobleaching techniques. We found that XRCC1 and PCNA exhibit distinct recruitment and binding kinetics at repair sites resulting in different capacities to respond to successive DNA damage events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>XRCC1 is less tightly associated with repair sites than PCNA</title><p>XRCC1 and PCNA have no known enzymatic function, are present at repair sites and interact with a high number of different proteins suggesting that they act as loading platforms in DNA repair. To investigate the role of XRCC1 and PCNA in DNA repair we performed immunostainings of microirradiated Hela cells. We employed a confocal laser scanning microscope to generate DNA damage at preselected subnuclear sites with a long wavelength UV diode laser in BrdU-sensitized cells as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Microirradiated sites stained positive for phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (&#x003b3;H2AX), a marker for double strand breaks (DSBs), and poly(ADP-Ribose) which is generated by PARP at single strand breaks (SSBs) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). This indicates that microirradiation with a 405 nm laser generates a mixture of different types of DNA damage that are substrates for distinct DNA repair pathways involving XRCC1 and/or PCNA. Immunofluorescence stainings with specific antibodies revealed that endogenous PCNA and XRCC1 are both present at DNA damage sites as early as 2&#x02013;4 min after irradiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To investigate the binding properties of XRCC1 and PCNA at DNA repair sites we performed salt extraction experiments. Microirradiated cells were permeabilized for 30 s followed by extraction with phosphate buffer containing 500 mM NaCl for 1 min. Immediately after salt extraction, the cells were fixed and stained for endogenous proteins showing that XRCC1 and PCNA were both extracted in non-S phase cells that were not microirradiated. In microirradiated non-S phase cells only XRCC1 was extracted while PCNA could still be detected at DNA damage sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), which is in good agreement with an earlier study, where detergent resistant foci of PCNA could be observed after local UV irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] we also detected a partial colocalization of XRCC1 with PCNA at replication sites, but noticed dramatically different binding properties. Thus XRCC1 was readily extracted, whereas PCNA was still stably associated with sites of DNA replication (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Taken together these results show that endogenous XRCC1 and PCNA are both present at DNA replication and repair sites but exhibit different binding properties.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Immunochemical detection of endogenous XRCC1 and PCNA at DNA repair sites.

We first determined the recruitment kinetics of XRCC1 and PCNA in living cells by quantifying the amount of GFP- and RFP-tagged XRCC1 and PCNA accumulated at microirradiated sites. The intensity values were corrected for background and for total nuclear loss of fluorescence over the time course and normalized to the pre-irradiation value.</p><p>A direct comparison of GFP- and RFP-tagged XRCC1 and PCNA showed a significantly slower recruitment of PCNA in contrast to the very fast accumulation of XRCC1 at microirradiated sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The fluorescence intensity of PCNA at the irradiated site increased during the observation period of 5 min, while XRCC1 accumulation reached a maximum about 1&#x02013;2 min after irradiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). These kinetic differences are in good agreement with earlier studies comparing the recruitment of XRCC1 and PCNA to laser-induced DNA damage sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Recruitment of XRCC1 and PCNA at DNA damage sites in living cells.

Two separate spots were microirradiated in living cells coexpressing GFP-XRCC1 and RFP-PCNA. After 5 min one region was bleached with a high energy laser pulse for 300 ms and the fluorescence recovery was determined. After bleaching of the repair foci we observed complete recovery of the XRCC1 signal within 24 s (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Since fluorescence intensity at repair sites had already peaked and did not increase any further, the measured recovery has to be attributed to a rapid turnover of XRCC1.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Mobility of XRCC1 and PCNA at DNA damage sites.

FLIP data from 9 individual experiments are shown as mean curves. The scheme of the experiment is outlined in the inset. Two separate subnuclear spots of transiently transfected Hela cells were microirradiated. Half of the nucleus containing one irradiated site was repeatedly bleached for 1 s over a total time period of 150 s, starting 5 min after microirradiation. The decay of the fluorescence intensity at the microirradiated site within the non-bleached half of the nucleus was measured and plotted over time. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-8-81-4"/></fig><p>Within the first 10&#x02013;15 s both fusion proteins showed a rapid loss of fluorescence due to depletion of highly mobile, unbound fluorescent molecules within the region of interest. After this initial phase XRCC1 and PCNA exhibited dramatically different dissociation kinetics. We could observe a rapid decrease of XRCC1 fluorescence to 10% of the initial intensity within the observation period while the intensity of PCNA was only reduced to 34% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This argues for a constant exchange of fluorescent XRCC1 molecules between the damage site and the bleached half of the nucleus, while most RFP-PCNA molecules remained bound at DNA repair sites.</p><p>These results show that the two loading platforms XRCC1 and PCNA exhibit distinct recruitment kinetics and mobility (association and dissociation rates) at DNA repair sites, which is consistent with an involvement of XRCC1 and PCNA in distinct repair pathways. On the one hand, PCNA is involved in repair pathways where the synthesis of long stretches of DNA requires a stable and processive repair machinery. On the other hand, XRCC1 is part of the short patch BER pathway where only a single nucleotide needs to be replaced and no processive and stable machinery is required.</p><p>To further investigate the role of XRCC1 and PCNA as central loading platforms in DNA repair we extended our photobleaching analysis to their respective interaction partners DNA Ligase III and I. In a previous study we compared the recruitment kinetics of theses highly conserved DNA Ligases and found that they are recruited to DNA repair sites with distinct kinetics. Using mutational analysis and binding studies we could show, that DNA Ligase I is recruited to repair sites through interaction with PCNA, while DNA Ligase III is recruited via its BRCT domain interacting with XRCC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. FRAP analysis revealed that both DNA Ligases show a high turnover at repair sites, with DNA Ligase I recovering faster than DNA Ligase III (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Interestingly, DNA Ligase III showed the same recovery rate as its loading platform XRCC1, while the mobility of DNA Ligase I and PCNA at repair sites differed dramatically (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrate that these loading platforms and their interacting repair factors have independent binding properties at repair sites. We speculate that even transient interaction of repair factors with their respective loading platform enhances the efficiency of DNA repair by local concentration of enzyme activities at repair sites, allowing faster recognition and binding of repair substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Flexible response of XRCC1 and PCNA to multiple DNA damage events</title><p>To investigate whether the different binding properties of XRCC1 and PCNA have functional consequences we tested their ability to respond to multiple DNA lesions. Successive DNA lesions were introduced with a time interval of 2.5 min at separate spots and the recruitment kinetics were determined for each individual spot. We observed a constant decrease of PCNA accumulation at sites irradiated at later time points (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In contrast, XRCC1 accumulation at early and late irradiated sites was similar.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Flexible response of XRCC1 to multiple DNA damage events. (A) Consecutive/Successive DNA lesions were introduced with a time interval of 2.5 min, starting 4 min after microirradiation of the first spot. One spot irradiated in close proximity to the nucleoli was not evaluated (arrowhead) (B) The recruitment kinetics of XRCC1 and PCNA at consecutively microirradiated sites were evaluated and plotted over time. Representative curves of one Hela cell are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-8-81-5"/></fig><p>These differences can be explained by the tight binding of PCNA at repair sites leading to a depletion of the cellular pool of PCNA molecules available for repair of subsequent damages.</p><p>In contrast, the dynamic binding of XRCC1 enables fast exchange between multiple DNA damages sites separated in time and space. Taken together these findings argue for a role of PCNA as a stationary loading platform in DNA repair allowing efficient and accurate repair, whereas the fast recruitment and high turnover of XRCC1 enables a flexible response to multiple DNA damage events occurring at distant sites and successive times in the genome.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we found that XRCC1 and PCNA exhibit distinct recruitment and binding kinetics at repair sites, which goes beyond earlier studies comparing only the accumulation of XRCC1 and PCNA at repair sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Efficient repair of DNA lesions requires avid recognition of the damage and coordinated recruitment of a multitude of repair factors. The principle dilemma faced by the repair machinery is that the stable complex formation required for processivity and completion of multi-step processes is incompatible with a flexible response to later changes like subsequent DNA damages. Our live cell recruitment and photobleaching analyses showed that XRCC1 and PCNA represent opposite strategies. We clearly demonstrate that the stable binding of the processivity factor PCNA limits its capacity to respond to successive damage events. While the avid and transient binding of XRCC1 might be sufficient for single nucleotide replacement but allows a flexible response to multiple consecutive DNA lesions. This type of live cell analysis should also help to explore the flexibility of other repair factors and complex cellular machineries in response to changing requirements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamicin supplemented with 10% FCS.
