While RDE-4 is typically essential for RNAi, we report that in the presence of high concentrations of trigger dsRNA, <italic>rde-4</italic> deficient animals are capable of silencing a transgene. By multiple criteria the silencing occurs by the canonical RNAi pathway. For example, silencing is RDE-1 dependent and exhibits a decrease in the targeted mRNA in response to an increase in siRNA. We also find that high concentrations of dsRNA trigger lead to increased accumulation of primary siRNAs, consistent with the existence of a rate-limiting step during the conversion of primary to secondary siRNAs. Our studies also revealed that transgene silencing occurs at low levels in the soma, even in the presence of ADARs, and that at least some siRNAs accumulate in a temperature-dependent manner. We conclude that an RNAi response varies with different conditions, and this may allow an organism to tailor a response to specific environmental signals.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The RNA interference (RNAi) and micro-RNA (miRNA) pathways employ small RNAs to modulate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Paddison1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In both pathways the small RNAs are &#x0223c;21&#x02013;25 nucleotides in length and are processed from dsRNA precursors by the RNase III enzyme Dicer.

Rather, RDE-1 acts downstream of 1&#x000b0; siRNA production to facilitate a sequence specific interaction between the 1&#x000b0; siRNA and targeted mRNA. While not understood in detail, RDE-1 is also required to recruit RRF-1, an RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Yigit1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>). RRF-1 amplifies the RNAi response by using the mRNA as a template for producing secondary (2&#x000b0;) siRNAs, which ultimately direct the cleavage of the targeted mRNA by the enzyme, CSR-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Aoki1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0004052-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004052.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>siRNA-mediated silencing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</title><p>(A) dsRNA consisting of a sense (gray) and antisense (black) strand, is processed into primary (1&#x000b0;) siRNAs by the RNase III enzyme DCR-1, in concert with the dsRBP, RDE-4. As is typical of products of RNase III enzymes such as DCR-1, 1&#x000b0; siRNAs are double-stranded, with a monophosphate (p) at the 5&#x02032; terminus and a hydroxyl at the 3&#x02032; terminus, which overhangs the duplex by two nucleotides; each strand is &#x0223c;23 nucleotides long. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies show that human Dicer prefers to cleave from one end of the dsRNA substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Zhang2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, and although not definitively proven, experiments with cell-free extracts indicate <italic>C. elegans</italic> DCR-1 acts similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Ketting1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the three 1&#x000b0; siRNAs shown from left to right represent successive cleavage from the end of the duplex. (B) The Argonaute protein RDE-1 escorts one strand of the primary siRNA to its target mRNA which contains a complementary sequence. (C) The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RRF-1, is recruited to the target message where it synthesizes secondary siRNAs that are antisense to the mRNA. The siRNAs are generated by <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis, are 21&#x02013;22 nucleotides in length, and contain a 5&#x02032; triphosphate (ppp).

In addition to &#x0201c;sense&#x0201d; mRNA, the arrays often give rise to antisense transcripts that allow formation of dsRNA, which can trigger silencing by the RNAi pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Knight1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Robert1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. While not yet proven, the antisense RNA may arise by read-through transcription of repeats juxtaposed in a converging orientation, or alternatively, by spurious transcription from a cryptic promoter. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, silencing of transgenic DNA occurs readily for genes expressed in the germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Mello1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Stinchcomb1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> but less so from genes expressed in the soma. The somatic tissue of <italic>C. elegans</italic> is less susceptible to transgene-induced silencing, at least in part, because of the existence of the RNA editing enzymes called Adenosine Deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Knight1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>). ADARs convert A&#x02236;U base pairs in dsRNA to the less stable I&#x02236;U mismatch, thus shifting the dsRNA: ssRNA equilibrium to effectively decrease the amount of dsRNA. Not surprisingly, dsRNA that is pre-treated with ADAR is inefficient in triggering an RNAi response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Scadden1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In theory, <italic>C. elegans</italic> that lack ADARs should have higher concentrations of dsRNA than wildtype animals. We were interested in the effects of higher than normal concentrations of dsRNA on the RNAi pathway. To this end, we compared transgene silencing in wildtype animals with that occurring in mutant strains lacking all ADAR activity, as well as to that occurring in strains designed to express even higher concentrations of dsRNA. We found that, contrary to previous reports, <italic>rde-4</italic> mutant animals are not completely RNAi defective. Instead, in the presence of high concentrations of trigger dsRNA, <italic>rde-4</italic> animals silence a transgene through an <italic>rde-1</italic> dependent mechanism, that by all criteria, corresponds to the canonical RNAi pathway. We also find that high concentrations of dsRNA trigger lead to increased accumulation of primary siRNAs, consistent with the existence of a rate-limiting step during the conversion of primary to secondary siRNAs. Our studies also revealed that transgene silencing occurs at low levels in the soma, even in the presence of ADARs, and that at least some siRNAs accumulate in a temperature-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> encode two ADAR genes, <italic>adr-1</italic> and <italic>adr-2</italic>, and our studies employed a double mutant containing homozygous mutations in both genes (herein referred to as <italic>adr</italic>).

As mentioned, because of their repetitive nature, most transgenic arrays introduced into <italic>C. elegans</italic> produce dsRNA. In addition, the GFP&#x0005b;IR&#x0005d; included in this array allowed additional dsRNA to be synthesized by heat shock.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Overexpression of dsRNA leads to silencing in <italic>adr;rde-4</italic> worms</title><p>As shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Knight1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, in the absence of heat shock, GFP expression from the transgenic array is dramatically reduced in <italic>adr</italic> mutants compared to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004052-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, &#x02013; panels).

Since pre-miRNA processing requires only a single DCR-1 cleavage event, one possibility is that RDE-4 increases the affinity of DCR-1 for long dsRNA so that multiple cleavage events can occur before the enzyme dissociates. Alternatively, DCR-1 may be more often bound to the abundant miRNA precursors, and RDE-4 functions to divert DCR-1 from the processing of miRNA precursors to the processing of long dsRNA. This mechanism might be especially useful in responding to long dsRNA associated with viral replication. Consistent with this idea, both <italic>rde-1</italic> and <italic>rde-4</italic> have roles in suppressing VSV replication in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, although to different extents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Schott1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>RDE-4 is necessary for accumulation of certain endo-siRNAs, including the X-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004052-g007">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Duchaine1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Lee1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>). The importance of these endo-siRNAs remains unclear as RDE-4-deficient worms develop normally and are fertile. However, our finding that the level of the X-cluster endo-siRNAs is influenced by cultivation temperature raises the possibility that some endo-siRNAs have roles in environmental responses, for example, to down-regulate metabolic processes at lower temperatures. As reported by others, we saw a dependence upon RDE-4 for accumulation of X-cluster endo-siRNAs, and in addition, we found that X-cluster accumulation was not dependent upon RDE-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004052-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). This suggests that these small RNAs are not entering into the canonical RNAi pathway despite their dependence upon DCR-1/RDE-4. Thus, RDE-4 appears to have multiple cellular roles, one in canonical RNAi and another in the endo-siRNA pathway. It will be interesting to determine if these roles are separable in the cell, such as in cellular localization or through distinct complexes. Alternatively, the separation of the pathways may be dependent upon sorting of siRNAs following processing by the DCR-1/RDE-4 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Accumulation of primary siRNAs suggests an siRNA amplification step is rate limiting <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>During an RNAi response, 1&#x000b0; siRNAs are present at low levels relative to the more abundant 2&#x000b0; siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Pak1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Sijen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further studies are necessary to determine whether one of the proteins involved in RNAi is limiting or perhaps the mRNA target itself has been consumed in the reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Keeping silencing at bay</title><p>The studies we describe were performed with a transgenic array that encodes GFP as well as a heat shock inducible GFP hairpin. Upon heat shock, dsRNA transcribed from the hairpin enters the RNAi pathway so that GFP expression is silenced. In addition, even without heat shock, low levels of antisense transcripts are produced from this repetitive transgenic array <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Knight1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Presumably, these antisense transcripts hybridize with a fraction of the much more abundant GFP sense mRNA to produce a small amount of GFP dsRNA. Thus, in the absence of heat shock, we observed that WT animals exhibited robust GFP expression, but also showed detectable levels of GFP siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004052-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). As further evidence that a low level of silencing was occurring in these animals even in the absence of heat shock, <italic>sur-5::gfp</italic> expression from the transgenic array in the WT strain was lower than that of the same array in the <italic>rde-1 or rde-4</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004052-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, compare - lanes between strains).</p><p>Silencing in wildtype animals by the low levels of dsRNA produced in the absence of heat shock was ameliorated, at least in part, by the presence of ADARs. This is evidenced by the observation that, in <italic>adr</italic> mutants, the low level of dsRNA was sufficient to completely silence GFP expression. ADAR enzymes are quite sensitive to substrate inhibition, and at high concentrations of their dsRNA substrate, are catalytically inactive (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Bass1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>). This is consistent with our observation that in WT animals expressing normal amounts of ADAR, the increased amount of dsRNA produced during heat shock was able to trigger robust silencing.. Of course, it is also possible that the dsRNA binding capability of ADARs, rather than their deaminase activity, is responsible for antagonizing RNAi. In this scenario, ADARs would sequester dsRNA so that it was unavailable to the dsRNA binding proteins involved in RNAi. However, at high concentrations of dsRNA as produced during our heat shock protocol, ADARs would be titrated, allowing the excess dsRNA to enter the RNAi pathway.</p><p>Our study with the GFP transgenic array has interesting implications in regard to expression of endogenous transcripts. The data suggest a model whereby there is a constant interplay between mRNA expression and its silencing, dictated by the relative levels of sense and antisense transcripts, as well as by processes that regulate silencing, such as ADARs. Transcriptome profiling indicates many genes give rise to both sense and antisense RNA (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Kapranov1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Zhang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>), and we speculate that such genes may be subject to RNAi-mediated regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains</title><p>Transgenic strains were generated in the Bristol strain N2. <italic>C. elegans</italic> culture conditions were as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004052-Brenner1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.
