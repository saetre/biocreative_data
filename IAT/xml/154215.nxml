Ribonuclease III of the gram-negative bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> processes rRNA and mRNA precursors, and its catalytic action can regulate gene expression by controlling mRNA translation and stability. It has been proposed that <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III can function in a non-catalytic manner, by binding RNA without cleaving phosphodiesters. However, there has been no direct evidence for this mode of action. We describe here an RNA, derived from the T7 phage R1.1 RNase III substrate, that is resistant to cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> by <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III but retains comparable binding affinity. R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA is recognized by RNase III in the same manner as R1.1 RNA, as revealed by the similar inhibitory effects of a specific mutation in both substrates. Structure-probing assays and Mfold analysis indicate that R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA possesses a bulge&#x02013; helix&#x02013;bulge motif in place of the R1.1 asymmetric internal loop. The presence of both bulges is required for uncoupling. The bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge motif acts as a &#x02018;catalytic&#x02019; antideterminant, which is distinct from recognition antideterminants, which inhibit RNase III binding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Members of the ribonuclease III superfamily of double-stranded (ds) RNA-specific endoribonucleases play essential roles in prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA maturation and decay pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c1">1</xref>). Eukaryotic RNase III orthologs participate in ribosomal RNA maturation and cleave precursors to snRNAs and snoRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c2">2</xref>). The functionally and structurally distinct eukaryotic ortholog Dicer performs a critical early step in RNA interference (RNAi), by cleaving dsRNAs to 21&#x02013;23 bp fragments. These species, termed small interfering (si) RNAs, exert selective inhibition of gene expression through homology-dependent RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c5">5</xref>). Dicer also cleaves precursors to micro-RNAs, which exert cistron-specific translational control, and perhaps participate as well in other gene regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c7">7</xref>).</p><p>RNase III orthologs are highly conserved in the Bacteria, and participate in species-specific RNA maturation and decay pathways as well as in rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c9">9</xref>). Bacterial RNase III orthologs exhibit the simplest primary structures of the superfamily members, and consist of a C-terminal dsRNA-binding motif (dsRBM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c11">11</xref>) and an N&#x02010;terminal catalytic (nuclease) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c15">15</xref>). The most-studied Bacterial ortholog is <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c16">16</xref>), which is active as a homodimer, and requires a divalent metal ion (preferably Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) to hydrolyze phosphodiesters. The dsRBM and catalytic domains as isolated polypeptides possess dsRNA-binding and dsRNA-cleaving activities, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c17">17</xref>). The catalytic domain exhibits the same strict dsRNA specificity and dimeric structure as the holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c17">17</xref>). Thus, the dsRBM is not required for conferring double-strand specificity nor is it critical for dimer stability. These findings are consistent with the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> RNase III, which is dimeric and exhibits an extensive subunit interface that defines a putative dsRNA-binding cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c15">15</xref>).</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III recognizes its substrates through specific structural and sequence features (reactivity epitopes) that are contained within a double helical structure of at least one full turn (&#x0003e;11 bp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c18">18</xref>). Two specific W-C base-paired regions, termed the proximal box (pb) and distal box (db) represent sites of enzyme&#x02013;substrate contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c19">19</xref>) as well as sites in which specific W-C bp inhibit RNase III binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c20">20</xref>). The inhibitory W-C bp are termed RNase III antideterminants, and are proposed to play a role in cleavage site selection as well as protect other dsRNAs with important functions from inadvertent cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c20">20</xref>).</p><p>RNA internal loops represent an additional type of reactivity epitope that can alter the normal pattern of double-strand processing, to cleavage of a single strand. Bacteriophage T7 expresses transcripts containing RNase III cleavage sites. The T7 substrates are hairpin structures with internal loops, and cleavage of a single phosphodiester within the internal loop 3&#x02032; segment separates the flanking mRNAs, allowing their independent translation. The prolonged physical half-lives of T7 mRNAs are also due in part to the 3&#x02032; hairpin structures created by the catalytic action of RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c21">21</xref>). One of the T7 substrates is R1.1 RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f1">1</xref>A, inset), which has been the subject of a number of biochemical and structural studies to identify substrate reactivity epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c25">25</xref>).</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase III also cleaves transcripts expressed by bacteriophage lambda, and is an important participant in the lysis&#x0002f;lysogeny decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c26">26</xref>). Translation of the lambda cIII mRNA is RNase III-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c27">27</xref>), and it has been proposed that cIII protein synthesis is stimulated by binding of RNase III to the cIII mRNA 5&#x02032; leader sequence without concomitant cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c27">27</xref>). However, there has been no direct biochemical evidence for such a function of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III, or any other RNase III ortholog. Given the key functional roles of RNase III superfamily members in global regulation, host defense and genome maintenance, it is of interest to determine whether RNA structures can be identified that allow binding of RNase III, but are resistant to cleavage. We describe in this report the use of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection technology to isolate and characterize a binding-competent, cleavage-resistant RNA ligand for RNase III.</p></sec><sec><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Chemicals and reagents were molecular biology grade and were generally obtained from Sigma or Fisher Scientific.

R1.1 RNA is cleaved by RNase III at a single phosphodiester (indicated by the arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f1">1</xref>A, inset), which directly creates the mature 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends of the flanking gene 1 and 1.1 mRNAs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c21">21</xref>). Two recent findings prompted the use of R1.1 RNA as a starting substrate to search for a cleavage-resistant, binding-competent sequence. First, an R1.1 RNA variant which contains a sequence-randomized internal loop retains comparable cleavage reactivity as the parent substrate (I.C.-J. and A.W.N., manuscript submitted for publication). While this finding demonstrated the absence of a strict sequence requirement for cleavage, it was also noted that &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of the sequence-randomized R1.1 RNA pool was highly resistant to cleavage. This raised the possibility that some of the cleavage-resistant sequences might possess appreciable binding affinity. Secondly, the intercalating agent ethidium bromide can uncouple <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III binding and cleavage of R1.1 RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c31">31</xref>). The uncoupling is dependent upon formation of an ethidium&#x02013;substrate complex which retains binding affinity but is refractory to cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c31">31</xref>). An ethidium binding site implicated in inhibition was mapped to the internal loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c31">31</xref>). Thus, a ligand-induced alteration in internal loop structure can suppress the catalytic step, raising the possibility that a specific RNA structure may exist which could exert the same effect.</p><p>We used <italic>in vitro</italic> selection (SELEX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c35">35</xref>), and specifically applied a negative selection strategy wherein only RNA sequences resistant to cleavage by RNase III would be competent for amplification by reverse transcription and PCR (RT&#x02013;PCR) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f1">1</xref>B) using the primer pair shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f1">1</xref>A. The cleavage-resistant population would be expected to include any binding-competent, cleavage-resistant sequences, which would be identified in a subsequent screen. The starting substrate was R1.1&#x0005b;SxN&#x0005d; RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f1">1</xref>A), a 109 nt R1.1 RNA variant containing a randomized internal loop of 4<sup>9</sup> (262 144) different sequences. To assist in amplification, cloning and sequence analysis, the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; flanking sequences of R1.1&#x0005b;SxN&#x0005d; RNA contained RT and PCR primer binding sites, as well as restriction enzyme sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>The cleavage reactivity of R1.1&#x0005b;SxN&#x0005d; RNA was compared with R1.1&#x0005b;Sx&#x0005d; RNA, which contains the R1.1 internal loop sequence. Cleavage of internally <sup>32</sup>P-labeled R1.1&#x0005b;Sx&#x0005d; RNA at the canonical site is expected to produce two radiolabeled fragments of approximately equal size (53 and 56 nt). The formation of these products is consistent with a denaturing polyacrylamide gel analysis of a representative <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f2">2</xref>A). The assay shows that R1.1&#x0005b;Sx&#x0005d; RNA and R1.1&#x0005b;SxN&#x0005d; RNA are both reactive, with the single predominant band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f2">2</xref>A, lanes 2 and 4) consistent with the RNase III-dependent production of two similarly sized species. Although this gel system was unable to resolve the two products, the relevant result is that the cleavage pattern of R1.1&#x0005b;SxN&#x0005d; RNA is qualitatively the same as that of R1.1&#x0005b;Sx&#x0005d; RNA. The shorter fragments produced in lower amounts (indicated by the arrowheads in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f2">2</xref>A) include the products of cleavage of the secondary site in the internal loop (indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f1">1</xref>A). Secondary sites are recognized at higher enzyme concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c36">36</xref>). In summary, the similar cleavage patterns of the two RNAs is consistent with the conservation of the canonical cleavage site in many other R1.1 RNA variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c24">24</xref>), and justifies the use of R1.1&#x0005b;SxN&#x0005d; RNA as a substrate for <italic>in vitro</italic> selection.</p><p>To maximize cleavage of the reactive population, R1.1&#x0005b;SxN&#x0005d; RNA was treated with a high (200 nM) concentration of RNase III. The products were subjected to RT&#x02013;PCR and the amplified DNA sequences transcribed to provide substrate for a new round of selection and amplification. Aliquots of the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled transcripts from each round were assessed for their resistance to cleavage. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f2">2</xref>B summarizes the cleavage assays, and shows that the early rounds provided an R1.1&#x0005b;SxN&#x0005d; RNA population exhibiting a successively greater resistance to cleavage. By round four, the percent resistance to cleavage approached 80&#x00025;, which was essentially unchanged by round six (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f3">3</xref>B). The &#x0223c;20&#x00025; residual reactivity probably reflects several factors, including forcing conditions for enzymatic cleavage, the occurrence of nonspecific (i.e. nonenzymatic) cleavage events and new sequence heterogeneity generated during each round of transcription and RT&#x02013;PCR.</p><p>To assess general trends in the sequence of the internal loop, batch sequencing of the PCR products was performed after each round. The results (data not shown) revealed an enrichment in cytosine residues at most of the positions. This trend was verified by sequencing individual clones (see below). The R1.1&#x0005b;SxN&#x0005d; RNA pool obtained at round six was subjected to RT&#x02013;PCR, the amplified DNAs cloned into a plasmid, and the sequences determined for 330 clones. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg329tb1">1</xref> provides the aligned sequences of 86 of the 330 cloned sequences. The 86 sequences were designated either as Class I or Class II R1.1 RNA variants (see below), and were chosen on the basis of the absence of nucleotide deletions, insertions or other undirected mutations external to the internal loop (with one important exception, as described below). Approximately 40 of the sequenced plasmids were linearized by <italic>Xho</italic>I digestion, the cloned sequence transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> by T7 RNA polymerase, and the RNAs assessed for their RNase III cleavage reactivities. The results (data not shown) reveal that the selected R1.1 sequences are resistant to cleavage.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Class I R1.1 RNA variants</title><p>The Class I R1.1&#x0005b;Sx&#x0005d; RNA variants exhibit cytosine-rich internal loops. The internal loop 5&#x02032; segment (positions 17&#x02013;20) exhibits a &#x0003e;50&#x00025; average cytosine content at each of the four positions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg329tb1">1</xref>). Moreover, 72 of the 78 Class I RNAs contain two or three adjacent cytosine residues within the internal loop 3&#x02032; segment. The cytosine enrichment is consistent with the batch DNA sequencing analysis. The Class I R1.1 RNA variants also exhibit a single nucleotide change (A9U) in the lower stem, which changes the canonical AU W-C base pair to a UU mismatch. Batch DNA sequence analysis (data not shown) revealed that this mutation dominates the R1.1&#x0005b;SxN&#x0005d; RNA pool after the fourth round of selection. The involvement of this unprogrammed mutation in conferring cleavage resistance is addressed below.</p><p>The reactivities of the Class I R1.1&#x0005b;Sx&#x0005d; RNA variants were examined within the context of the 60 nt R1.1 RNA structure. The internal loop sequences and the A9U mutation of clones R1.1&#x0005b;CL68B&#x0005d; and R1.1&#x0005b;CL14A&#x0005d; were incorporated into R1.1 RNA, providing R1.1&#x0005b;CL68B&#x0005d; RNA and R1.1&#x0005b;CL14A&#x0005d; RNA. To assess the involvement of the A9U mutation, the same R1.1 RNA variants were prepared but which instead lacked this mutation (R1.1&#x0005b;CL68B;U9A&#x0005d; RNA and R1.1&#x0005b;CL14A;U9A&#x0005d; RNA). A cleavage assay shows that R1.1&#x0005b;CL68B&#x0005d; RNA and R1.1&#x0005b;CL14A&#x0005d; RNA are resistant to RNase III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f3">3</xref>A, lane 2 and B, lane 2). Thus, the inhibitory actions of the internal loop sequences are manifested in the 60 nt canonical R1.1 hairpin. Gel shift assays (data not shown) revealed that neither R1.1&#x0005b;CL68B&#x0005d; RNA nor R1.1&#x0005b;CL14A&#x0005d; RNA are detectably bound by RNase III. The same variants which instead lack the A9U mutation are cleaved by RNase III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f3">3</xref>A, lane 4 and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f3">3</xref>B, lane 4). However, the A9U mutation on its own does not inhibit cleavage of either R1.1 RNA or R1.1&#x0005b;Sx&#x0005d; RNA (data not shown). We conclude that the A9U mutation cooperates with the variant R1.1 internal loop sequences to confer inhibition.</p><p>The cleavage resistance of the Class I R1.1 RNA variants may reflect formation of a novel RNA conformation. To examine this we used native gel electrophoresis, which can detect alternative RNA conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c37">37</xref>). The Class I R1.1 RNA variants R1.1&#x0005b;CL68B&#x0005d; RNA and R1.1&#x0005b;CL14A&#x0005d; RNA, as well as their counterparts lacking the A9U mutation were electrophoresed in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The three cleavage-resistant Class I RNAs electrophorese at a faster rate than R1.1 RNA, while the cleavage-competent RNAs lacking the A9U mutation comigrate with R1.1 RNA (data not shown). We conclude that the lack of reactivity of Class I RNAs correlates with an altered conformation, which is in turn dependent upon the A9U mutation. A possible structure of the alternative conformation is considered below (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Class II R1.1 RNA variants</title><p>The Class II R1.1 RNAs are fewer in number than the Class I RNAs, and lack the A9U mutation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg329tb1">1</xref>). Cleavage assays were performed on eight Class II R1.1 RNA variants. The results reveal that all of the RNAs are resistant to RNase III (data not shown). Thus, the A9U mutation is not absolutely required for inhibition. A representative variant, R1.1&#x0005b;CL17C&#x0005d; RNA, electrophoreses in a nondenaturing gel at a slightly faster rate than R1.1 RNA (data not shown). Thus, for at least one Class II RNA, cleavage resistance correlates with an altered conformation.</p></sec><sec><title>R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA: a binding-competent, cleavage-resistant Class II R1.1 RNA variant</title><p>Gel shift assays revealed that none of the Class II R1.1 RNA variants are detectably bound by RNase III (data not shown), with one exception. A cleavage assay of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f4">4</xref>A) confirmed the expected resistance to cleavage by RNase III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f4">4</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;12). Less than 5&#x00025; of the RNA is cleaved in the presence of an excess (200 nM) of RNase III. However, a gel shift assay reveals that R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA binds RNase III to form a complex with similar electrophoretic mobility as the complex involving R1.1 RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f4">4</xref>C, compare lanes 7&#x02013;12 with lanes 1&#x02013;6). The complex is detectable at a relatively low (&#x0223c;5 nM) RNase III concentration, with the RNA fully bound by &#x0223c;50 nM RNase III. The <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for the complex containing R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA is 43 nM, while the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of the complex containing R1.1 RNA is 34 nM. While the gel shift assays yielded some variation in <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>, the ratio of <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for the two complexes was consistently 1.5&#x02013;2.0. We conclude that R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA binds RNase III with comparable affinity as R1.1 RNA. The gel shift assay also shows that unbound R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA exhibits a comparable gel electrophoretic mobility as R1.1 RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f4">4</xref>C, compare lanes 1 and 7), indicating similar structures.</p><p>The comparable binding affinities of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA and R1.1 RNA suggest a common mode of recognition by RNase III. However, it is possible that R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA binds RNase III in a manner distinct from that of a competent substrate. For example, the RNA may bind to a site that does not involve the catalytic site. Since technical limitations prevented the use of competition gel shift or cleavage assays as definitive tests (I.C.-J. and A.W.N., unpublished experiments), we instead examined the effect on RNase III binding of site-specific substrate mutation. The distal box (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f4">4</xref>A) is a 2 bp segment which engages in contacts with RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c19">19</xref>), and is also a site where specific W-C base pair substitutions block RNase III recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c20">20</xref>). If R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA and R1.1 RNA are recognized in the same manner, then a distal box mutation that inhibits R1.1 RNA binding should also affect binding of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA. A single substitution (UG&#x02192;GU) was introduced in the lower position of the distal box of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f4">4</xref>A). This substitution has been shown to inhibit RNase III recognition of a minimal variant of R1.1 RNA (A. Pertzev and A.W.N., manuscript in preparation). A gel shift assay reveals that the mutation strongly inhibits R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA binding to RNase III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f5">5</xref>A, compare lanes 4&#x02013;6 with lanes 10&#x02013;12). As expected, the binding of R1.1 RNA is also inhibited, although to a lesser extent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f5">5</xref>A, compare lanes 1&#x02013;3 with lanes 7&#x02013;9). Quantitation of the gel shift assay is summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f5">5</xref>B. The weaker effect of the mutation on R1.1 RNA binding may reflect the somewhat greater binding affinity of this RNA. The common inhibitory effect of a distal box mutation provides strong evidence that R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA binds RNase III in the same manner as R1.1 RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural analysis of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA</title><p>Mfold analysis reveals a hairpin structure for R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA essentially the same as that of R1.1 RNA. However, the Mfold structure of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA has a bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge motif in place of the R1.1 internal loop (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f6">6</xref>B). Nucleotide A20, and nucleotides A48 and U49 provide 1 and 2 nt bulges, respectively, with the two bulges separated by three GC base pairs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f6">6</xref>B). Terbium (Tb<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup>) ion was used as a structural probe of the proposed bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge motif, and to identify other features potentially involved in uncoupling. Tb<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> cleaves RNA within unstructured, conformationally flexible regions, and is relatively insensitive to specific sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c39">39</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f6">6</xref>A shows the Tb<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> cleavage pattern for 5&#x02032; <sup>32</sup>P-labeled R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA. For comparative purposes, R1.1 RNA and R1.1&#x0005b;WC-R&#x0005d; RNA were also examined. The latter RNA is a variant of R1.1 RNA in which the internal loop is replaced by a fully W-C base paired sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c24">24</xref>). For R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA, Tb<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> cleavage sites occur at A20 and at A48&#x0002f;U49, with some cleavage occurring at the nucleotides that flank the two bulge positions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f6">6</xref>A, lane 4; summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f6">6</xref>B). The Tb<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> reactivity pattern is consistent with the proposed bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge motif.</p><p>For R1.1 RNA, the cleavage pattern in the internal loop region is qualitatively distinct from that of the corresponding region of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA. In particular, the 5&#x02032; proximal segment of the internal loop (A17-C20) is uniformly reactive to Tb<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup>, with significant cleavage also occurring at U45 and U47 in the 3&#x02032; proximal segment of the internal loop (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f6">6</xref>A, lane 9; summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f6">6</xref>B). The reactivity pattern of R1.1 RNA is consistent with an unstructured internal loop, as also indicated by the Mfold analysis and by the absence of stable hydrogen bonds within the loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c25">25</xref>). For R1.1&#x0005b;WC-R&#x0005d; RNA, the absence of significant Tb<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> cleavage in the region corresponding to the internal loop (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f6">6</xref>A, lane 6) is distinct from the R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA pattern, and is consistent with the presence of a regular double-helical structure. It should also be noted that for all three RNAs, conservation of an overall hairpin structure is indicated by strongly reactive sites in the tetraloop and flanking nucleotides.</p></sec><sec><title>Both bulged nucleotide positions in R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA are required for uncoupling</title><p>The bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge motif is implicated in uncoupling, as it is the distinguishing feature of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA. The three GC bp most likely are not directly responsible for uncoupling, as revealed by the reactivity of an R1.1 RNA variant in which the internal loop is replaced by four GC base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c20">20</xref>). It therefore is likely that one or both of the bulges is required to suppress cleavage. Two variants of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA were prepared which carried either a deletion of A20 or a deletion of A48 and U49. A third variant was synthesized in which all three nucleotides were deleted. A cleavage assay reveals that deletion of either bulge is sufficient to allow cleavage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f7">7</xref>, compare lanes 6 and 8 with lane 4). However, the variant exhibiting a deletion of both bulge positions exhibits the greatest extent of cleavage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f7">7</xref>, lane 10). For all three R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA variants, the product sizes are consistent with RNase III cleavage of the primary and secondary R1.1 RNA cleavage sites.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study has described the isolation and characterization of a T7 R1.1 RNA variant that is recognized by RNase III but is resistant to cleavage. An <italic>in vitro</italic> selection protocol allowed the isolation of cleavage-resistant sequences from a R1.1 RNA pool containing a sequence-randomized internal loop. Gel shift analysis of selected RNAs identified R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA as a species with a binding affinity comparable to that of R1.1 RNA. Mfold analysis and Tb<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> ion structure probing indicate that R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA possesses a bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge motif in place of the unstructured, &#x0005b;4&#x0002f;5&#x0005d; asymmetric internal loop. The restoration of cleavage reactivity by deletion of either bulge demonstrates that both bulges are necessary to confer resistance. The precise structure of the motif remains to be determined. For example, there are two alternatives to the A20 bulge, involving either A21 or A22. It is also not known whether bulge nucleotide identity is important for uncoupling, or whether the bases are extrahelical or intrahelical. R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA undergoes a minor amount of cleavage (&#x0223c;5&#x00025;) at high enzyme concentrations and extended reaction times. It is therefore possible that R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA variants may exhibit an even greater resistance to cleavage and&#x0002f;or stronger binding affinity. The low reactivity prevented an accurate determination of the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for RNase III cleavage of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA. However, based on the gel shift behavior (this study) and the similar <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values for <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III binding and cleavage of R1.1 RNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c40">40</xref>), the inhibition of cleavage is expected to reflect a reduction in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>.</p><p>The mechanism of substrate-dependent uncoupling is unclear. R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA may exhibit a specific type of &#x02018;dsRNA mimicry&#x02019;&#x02014;a term originally applied to describe the sustained reactivity of internal loop-containing substrates towards an otherwise strictly double-strand-specific nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c18">18</xref>). The bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge motif would permit RNase III recognition, but in contrast to a regular double-helical structure (or a &#x0005b;4&#x0002f;5&#x0005d; internal loop), it would block productive engagement of the scissile phosphodiesters at the active site, perhaps by hindering a conformational change. In this regard, a structural change in RNase III has been detected in association with the catalytic step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c40">40</xref>). The mechanism of uncoupling ultimately will require a structural analysis of an RNase III&#x02013;R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA complex.</p><p>Substrate structure-dependent uncoupling of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III suggests that RNase III orthologs in general could function as non-catalytic, RNA-binding proteins. Transplantation of the bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge motif into heterologous substrates could provide one test for this proposal. Alternatively, structurally distinct motifs may be necessary to uncouple RNase III ortholog action. A cleavage-resistant RNA recognized by RNase III may provide a novel gene-regulatory element. Through recruitment of RNase III as an RNA-binding protein, an mRNA could be stabilized or translationally regulated by a 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-end-localized RNA&#x02013;protein complex. Expression of a cleavage-resistant, binding-competent RNA may exert a dominant-negative effect on RNase III function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>RNA processing antideterminants are proposed to play key roles in the site-specificity of ribonuclease action as well as protect functionally important sequences from inadvertent cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c41">41</xref>). Since the bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge motif of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA does not block RNase III recognition, it may be regarded an example of a &#x02018;catalytic&#x02019; antideterminant for RNase III. This can be distinguished from recognition antideterminants, which block cleavage by inhibiting RNase III binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c20">20</xref>).</p><p>The 5&#x02032; untranslated leader of the phage lambda cIII mRNA has been proposed to bind RNase III, with this event serving to activate cIII protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg329c27">27</xref>). This study supports the feasibility of such a mechanism, and further analysis of the RNase III&#x02013;cIII mRNA interaction is warranted. An Mfold analysis of the cIII mRNA 5&#x02032; leader does not reveal a bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge motif similar to that of R1.1&#x0005b;CL3B&#x0005d; RNA (I.C.-J. and A.W.N., unpublished results). However, other structures may exist which also can uncouple RNase III action.</p><p>The cleavage resistance of the Class I R1.1 RNA variants and the involvement of the A9U mutation also are of interest. Mfold analysis of selected Class I R1.1 RNA variants indicates a novel base-pairing interaction involving C residues in the 5&#x02032; segment of the internal loop and the three consecutive G residues at positions 10&#x02013;12 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg329f8">8</xref>). This pairing creates a stem&#x02013;loop structure in place of the R1.1 lower stem and internal loop. Disruption of the internal loop and lower stem would be sufficient to block RNase III recognition and cleavage, and also would explain the altered nondenaturing gel electrophoretic mobilities of the Class I RNAs. Mfold also reveals that the A9U mutation is required for the alternative conformation. The A9U mutation may destabilize the R1.1 lower stem by creating a UU mismatch, thereby allowing the pairing of the C-rich 5&#x02032; proximal segment of the internal loop with the consecutive G residues. The inability of the A9U mutation on its own to inhibit cleavage may reflect an insufficient number of C residues in the R1.1 internal loop to allow the alternative base-pairing. Further structural analysis of Class I R.1 RNA variants should provide a critical test of the existence of the proposed conformation, and provide further insight on structure&#x02013;reactivity correlates of RNase III substrates.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg329f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (Previous page and above) <italic>In vitro</italic> selection strategy for isolating cleavage-resistant variants of R1.1 RNA.
