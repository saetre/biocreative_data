De-synchronization of circadian feedback oscillators in humans causes &#x02018;jet lag&#x02019;, likely contributes to sleep - , psychiatric - , metabolic disorders and even cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the disintegration of tissue-specific clocks are complex and not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Based on their circadian expression and cell culture experiments, the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors SHARP-1(Dec2) and SHARP-2(Stra13/Dec1) were proposed as novel negative regulators of the molecular clock. To address their function <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated <italic>Sharp-1</italic> and <italic>Sharp-2</italic> single and double mutant mice. Our experiments reveal critical roles for both factors in regulating period length, tissue-specific control of clock gene expression and entrainment to external cues. Light-pulse experiments and rapid delays of the light-dark cycle (experimental jet lag) unravel complementary functions for SHARP-1 and SHARP-2 in controlling activity phase resetting kinetics. Moreover, we show that SHARP-1 and 2 can serve dual functions as repressors and co-activators of mammalian clock gene expression in a context-specific manner. This correlates with increased amplitudes of <italic>Per2</italic> expression in the cortex and liver and a decrease in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of double mutant mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The existence of separate mechanisms regulating phase of entrainment, rhythm amplitude and period length has been postulated before.

In constant darkness (DD), circadian activity rhythms remained stable without significant differences in free-running period lengths (&#x003c4;) in single homozygous null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002762-g001">Figure 1D,E</xref>). However, when <italic>Sharp</italic> gene dosage was further lowered, we observed a significant lengthening of &#x003c4; (up to 0.5 h) in mice with only one or no functional <italic>Sharp</italic> allele left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002762-g001">Figure 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002762.s002">Figure S2</xref>) indicating a high degree of functional redundancy between both genes. The loss of one <italic>Sharp</italic> gene resulted in a broadened &#x003c4; distribution indicating an elevated variability in pacemaker regulation while in the double mutants &#x003c4; was consistently shifted towards higher values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002762-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Because <italic>Sharp-2</italic> expression in the SCN is rapidly activated after nocturnal light exposure, and remains elevated in the SCN in constant light conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002762-Honma1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, we speculated that the <italic>Sharps</italic> could also be involved in the light synchronization of the SCN clock by light. Using a standard Aschoff type II paradigm, 15 min light pulses were given at <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> time (ZT)14, running-wheel activity was monitored after subsequent release into DD and the resulting phase shifts were calculated by comparison of activity onsets of light-pulsed animals and non-pulsed controls. Similar to what was seen for the period length in DD, <italic>Sharp-1</italic> deficiency did not significantly affect phase shifting behavior when compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002762-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed, however, a markedly pronounced prolonged resetting kinetics (transition phase) in <italic>Sharp-2</italic>-deficient animals (data not shown). To further substantiate this finding, we tested WT and S2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals in an Aschoff type I setup applying a light pulse 2 hrs after activity onset under DD conditions (Circadian time (CT)14) when phase shift transients are more easily assessable. In this paradigm total phase shift amplitudes were again comparable between genotypes but S2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice needed consistently longer to complete the transition phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002762.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We further reduced the gene dosage analyzing mice with only one functional <italic>Sharp-2</italic> (S1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>S2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>) or <italic>Sharp-1</italic> (S1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>S2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) allele and homozygous double-deficient animals (S1/2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>). S1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>S2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not show a significant change in phase shifts (68&#x000b1;9 min) compared to WT animals (83&#x000b1;10 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002762-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). However, mice lacking both <italic>Sharp-2</italic> and one <italic>Sharp-1</italic> wild-type allele(s) as well as double mutants displayed marked reduction in phase shift responses (27&#x000b1;9 min and 19&#x000b1;5 min, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002762-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Although we again detected a functional redundancy of both <italic>Sharp</italic> genes in this paradigm, <italic>Sharp-2</italic> loss-of-function cannot be fully compensated for by only one <italic>Sharp-1</italic> wild-type allele. The amount and direction of photic activity phase shifts depends on the time of light exposure and involves differential molecular signaling mechanisms. To get a first idea about the circadian dependence of phase responses in <italic>Sharp</italic> mutant animals we also exposed all animals to light pulses at ZT22 (phase advancing) and ZT10 (no phase shift in wild-type mice). For both time points no significant differences were detected between wild-type and all <italic>Sharp</italic> single and double mutant animals (data not shown) indicating that the shape of the photic phase response curve is preserved in the absence of <italic>Sharp-1</italic> and/or <italic>Sharp-2</italic> and that the influence of both genes on clock resetting is restricted to phase delays.</p><fig id="pone-0002762-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002762.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Disturbed phase shifting and clockwork resetting.</title><p>(a) Acute activity phase shifts determined for WT and <italic>Sharp</italic> mutant mice upon a single 15 min light pulse given at ZT14 following the Aschoff type II protocol.

In the presence of BMAL1 and CLOCK or NPAS2, the SHARP proteins can either repress or activate E-Box mediated clock gene transcription.

This tissue-specific clockwork composition appears as the key to SHARP functions. Further molecular and behavioral studies are required to dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may be modulated by SHARP-1/2 in different cell types or tissues. The mechanism that determines the context-dependent switch between a repressing versus activating mode of SHARP function remains to be determined. However, our data with SHARP constructs lacking only the basic domain implies that this may occur post-translationally regulating the E-Box binding. The existence of separate mechanisms regulating phase of entrainment, rhythm amplitude and period length of the circadian system has been postulated before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002762-Xu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002762-Roenneberg1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

A XbaI fragment inluding 4 kb 5&#x02032; upstream and parts of intron 2 was placed 3&#x02032; of the neoR cassette.

With the primer pairs Ex1s and Ex4as the expected 335 bp long product is amplified, in the hetero- and homozygous mutant additional aberrant products of increased size (&#x0003e;1.3 kB) are detected (left). With the primer pairs Ex3s and Ex5as, no product is amplified in homozygous mutants, cDNA input was checked with Gapdh primers (right). Three aberrantly PCR products (A, B, C) were detected in homozygous sharp-1 mutant cDNA (higher magnification depicted at the very right). (C) The PCR products A, B, C were subloned and sequenced. The analysis of the sequences revealed that transcripts corresponding to aberrant splice variant A may potentially result in an ORF of 49 aa lacking any known functional or homology region. Transcript A is not spliced at the junction from exon 2 to intron 2 and runs into a stop codon after seven residues. Transcripts B and C are unspliced already at exon 1 leading to an ORF of 21aa purely consisting of exon 1 encoded residues. (D) Putative aberrant protein variants from the mutated sharp-1 allele depicted as bar graphs. If expressed, Protein A (49 aa) will be comprised of exon 1 and 2 containing residues including a few additional aberrant amino acids, Protein B, C (21 aa) only contains the residues encoded by exon 1 followed by an immediate stop codon. (E) Reporter gene assay comparing the effect of the potentially expressed aberrant proteins A and B, C and wild-type SHARP-1 on an E-Box containing reporter. Whereas full-length SHARP-1 efficiently repressed reporter gene activation, neither constructs encoding aberrant products A or B, C showed any effect.
