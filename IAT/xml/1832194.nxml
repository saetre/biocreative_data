The genetic basis of statin-related muscle disorders is largely unknown. Because mutations in the <italic>COQ2 </italic>gene are associated with severe inherited myopathy, we hypothesized that common, mild genetic variation in <italic>COQ2 </italic>would be associated with inter-individual variation in statin intolerance.

Reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with statins has revolutionized clinical cardiology; this family of drugs is generally well-tolerated, easy to administer, and has very good patient acceptance. However, the potential for adverse effects exists. From clinical trials, the statin discontinuation rate due to adverse events ranges between 1 and 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Frequently reported adverse effects include gastrointestinal complaints, rashes, dizziness, pruritus and headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Statin-related skeletal muscle disorders range from benign myalgias &#x02013; such as non-specific muscle aches or joint pains without elevated serum creatinine kinase (CK) concentration &#x02013; to true myositis with &#x0003e;10-fold elevation of serum CK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The incidence of muscle aches and pains with statin monotherapy ranges from 1 to 7%, whereas severe myopathy, defined as &#x0003e;10-fold elevation of serum CK with muscle pains, weakness and tenderness, occurs in up to 0.5% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Life-threatening rhabdomyolysis with muscle necrosis and subsequent electrolyte alterations, myoglobinuria and renal failure is extremely rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Rhabdomyolysis is frequently related to use of a statin in combination with such agents as fibric acid derivatives, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics or antifungal agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Recently, genomic variations have been evaluated with respect to inter-individual differences in response to statin therapy, both in terms of LDL-lowering and clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A few studies have also reported associations between polymorphisms in candidate genes and decreased adherence to or increased discontinuation of statin drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the role of genetic polymorphisms in predicting adverse events associated with statin use remains to be established. Potential candidate genes whose products might be determinants of statin intolerance include those encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] or ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Ubiquinone, also known as coenzyme Q<sub>10 </sub>(CoQ10), is synthesized, together with mevalonate, by all cells. In theory, inhibition of mevalonate synthesis by statins reduces not only the biosynthesis of cholesterol but also of CoQ10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Indeed, reduced CoQ10 concentrations have been suggested as a potential mechanism for statin-induced myotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A role for genetics as a potential determinant was recently demonstrated in two siblings with primary CoQ10 deficiency each of whom was homozygous for a missense mutation in the <italic>COQ2 </italic>gene encoding para-hydroxybenzoate-polyprenyl transferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which is the second enzyme in the CoQ10 biosynthetic pathway. Given the association of CoQ10 deficiency with statin-induced myotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we hypothesized that genetic variation in <italic>COQ2 </italic>was associated with inter-individual variation in statin tolerability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Clinical and demographic data</title><p>Descriptive baseline clinical features of statin-intolerant patients and controls are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Specifically, homozygotes for rare alleles of SNP1, SNP2 and the 2-SNP haplotype &#x02013; ~15% of the study sample &#x02013; had significantly increased odds of statin intolerance, defined primarily through muscle symptomatology. Significant clinical differences between patients with statin intolerance and control subjects included significantly elevated serum CK both on treatment and at baseline, and elevated serum AST on treatment only. Upon review, there is no clear evidence for the use of other medications that could affect muscle function. Furthermore, the amount and intensity of exercise in the two groups was not recorded, although it was unlikely to have been significantly different.</p><p>Genetic determinants of statin intolerance include both common SNPs and rare mutations. For instance, a study conducted primarily in a sample of patients with statin-induced myopathy ascertained through neurology clinics indicated that up to 10% of statin-intolerant subjects were heterozygous or homozygous for disease-causing mutations in rare metabolic myopathies, namely carnitine palmitoyl transferase II deficiency and McArdle disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, muscle biopsies from statin-intolerant patients showed that about half had significant qualitative abnormalities in mitochondrial and fatty acid metabolism without a discrete molecular defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Such findings are consistent with a biological basis for statin myopathy that has a variety of genetic determinants. The findings from the present study indicate that polymorphism in the <italic>COQ2 </italic>gene may be one such cause out of many in the general population. Mechanistic implication of the ubiquinone pathway is further provided by a recent report of altered ubiquinone levels in muscle biopsies from patients on statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Some have questioned the clinical significance of statin-related side effects. For instance, a recent systemic overview of randomized clinical trials on risks associated with statin therapy appeared to show no excess of myalgias or CK elevations in patients on statins compared to placebo in 74,000 subjects involved in 35 trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the translation of these findings from controlled clinical trials to the "real world" of clinical practice is questionable. There is little doubt that most clinicians who prescribe statin drugs regularly would be aware of these side effects and would consider them to be an important clinical problem that interferes with statin compliance for many patients.</p><p>While our findings support a relationship between <italic>COQ2 </italic>genetic variation and statin intolerance, limitations of this study, as with most association studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] include: 1) small sample size; 2) absence of a replication sample; 3) absence of a functional consequence of the genetic variants tested; and 4) absence of genetic associations with intermediate quantitative traits, specifically CK on treatment or muscle pathology. Furthermore, the markers studied may have been in linkage disequilibrium with unmeasured functional marker in <italic>COQ2 </italic>or in some proximal gene that was the actual mechanistic basis of the association.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Thus, in this preliminary analysis, we found that genetic variation in <italic>COQ2</italic>, as defined by two genotypes and a haplotype derived from the two most informative SNPs of this gene, was associated with increased odds of statin intolerance, defined primarily through muscle symptomatology. Clearly, additional mechanistic and genetic studies are required to confirm these observations. But these preliminary pharmacogenetic results are consistent with the idea that statin intolerance which is manifested primarily through muscle symptoms is associated with genomic variation in <italic>COQ2 </italic>and thus perhaps with the CoQ10 pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>We studied 291 patients from a single tertiary referral lipid clinic population.

SNP genotyping was performed using validated TaqMan genotyping assays purchased from Applied Biosystems (ABI, Foster City, CA). Although several rare <italic>COQ2 </italic>SNPs have been identified, we chose to focus on two SNPs that were most polymorphic and thus more likely to serve as informative markers for the gene. SNP1 was a synonymous polymorphism in exon 5 (Assay ID C_28947991_10, rs6535454). SNP2 was a non-coding polymorphism in intron 4 (Assay ID C_28947992_10, rs4693075). SNP genotyping was performed using an allelic discrimination assay (TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>SNP Genotyping Assays, ABI, Foster City, CA) using the ABI Prism<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>7900 HT Sequence Detection System (SDS) and genotypes were read using automated software (SDS 2.3, ABI, Foster City, CA). Reactions were run in 5 uL volumes using an amplification protocol of 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes, followed by 50 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds, then 60&#x000b0;C for 1.5 minutes. Blinded replication of 5% of samples showed no discrepancies between genotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.0 (Cary, NC), with a nominal level of significance defined as P &#x0003c; 0.05. Significance of the deviation of SNP genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed using chi-square analysis. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium between <italic>COQ2 </italic>alleles was determined using correlation coefficients as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Two-site maximal likelihood haplotypes were constructed using PHASE version 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Dominant and recessive genetic models of association of statin intolerance with either individual <italic>COQ2 </italic>SNP genotypes or <italic>COQ2 </italic>haplotype were evaluated using chi-square analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JO carried out the SNP genotyping, participated in the statistical analysis and manuscript preparation.
