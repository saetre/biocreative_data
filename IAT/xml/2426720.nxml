The common feature of these diseases is neuroinflammation, defined as the presence of activated microglia and inflammatory mediators. Microglia, resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), are central to the inflammatory response. These cells actively monitor their environment and can become over-activated in response to diverse stimuli to produce cytotoxic factors, such as superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], nitric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>].</p><p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal degenerations characterized by progressive loss of photoreceptor cells. More than 158 genes causing this inherited retinal disease have been identified in about two-thirds of the cases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/retnet">Retnet</ext-link>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which these gene mutations lead to photoreceptor apoptosis have not been clearly elucidated. In a recent study, we showed several inflammatory events and factors were involved in the retinal degenerative process of <italic>rd</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. In this widely used retinitis pigmentosa animal model, a mutation in the gene encoding the &#x003b2; subunit of retinal cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase results in elevation of cGMP levels in rod photoreceptors, leading to massive cell death by apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In that study, the activation of microglia, as well as expression of chemokines and microglia-derived neurotoxic cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;), coincided with or preceded the occurrence of photoreceptor apoptosis, suggesting inflammatory response may play an important role in the retinal degeneration in <italic>rd</italic> mice.</p><p>The proinflammatory responses of immune cells, including microglia, involve the signal transduction molecule transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-&#x003ba;B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B contributes to microglia activation and production of proinflammatory molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>] that can lead to neurotoxicity in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B signaling begins with phosphorylation and degradation of I&#x003ba;B, a key component of the cytoplasmic NF-&#x003ba;B complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], and releases the p50 and p65 subunits that translocate to the nucleus and promote transcription of proinflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. In many neurodegenerative diseases, a significant increase of NF-&#x003ba;B activity was detected in neurons and microglial cells in brains of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>].

Nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B was noted in the microglial cells in the OPL and ONL. In a previous study [6], we showed cytokine TNF-&#x003b1;, a representative target and inducer gene for NF-&#x003ba;B activation, was also primarily produced in the activated microglial cells in the outer retina of <italic>rd</italic> mice. Taking our previous study and the present one together, we propose that activation of NF-&#x003ba;B may be associated with photoreceptor cell death through regulation of gene expression of proinflammatory and neurotoxic molecules (e.g., TNF-&#x003b1;) in microglial cells in the <italic>rd</italic> retina.</p><p>As in CNS neurodegenerative diseases, alteration of NF-&#x003ba;B expression has been reported in several retinal degenerations both in vitro and in vivo. Krishnamoorthy and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] showed cultured 661W mouse photoreceptor cells constitutively expressed NF-&#x003ba;B, and light exposure of these cells resulted in lowering of NF-&#x003ba;B levels in both the nuclear and cytosolic fractions in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. reported in vivo expression of NF-&#x003ba;B in photoreceptor cells was increased at 3 h and its nuclear translocation was evident at 12 h after continuous light exposure for 3 h. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B was also observed in neuronal cells in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer 24 h following retinal ischemia and reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. In the latter study, P65 labeling was partially colocalized with apoptotic cells in the inner nuclear cell layer. Consistent with the aforedescribed two animal models of retinal degeneration, our study revealed marked NF-&#x003ba;B activation in the retina of <italic>rd</italic> mice, a typical model for inherited retinal dystrophy.</p><p>In contrast to previous studies on retinal degenerations, activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in the <italic>rd</italic> retina in the present study was primarily in microglial cells, rather than in neuronal cells, including photoreceptor cells. This observation might imply a distinct function of NF-&#x003ba;B activation in retinal degeneration in this animal model. Pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic roles of NF-&#x003ba;B in neuronal and glial cells including microglia and astrocytes have been identified and proposed in several CNS neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. These studies reported that activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in neurons played a neuroprotective role in the neurodegenerative conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. In this scenario, NF-&#x003ba;B influences the neurodegenerative process by directly promoting cell survival gene expression, such as Bcl-2, Mn-SOD, and inhibitor of apoptosis protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>], or reducing cell death gene expression, such as Bxl-x and Bax in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. In contrast, the role of NF-&#x003ba;B activation in glial cells, especially microglia are usually neurotoxic as production of many proinflammatory cytokines and proapoptotic substances including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, iNOS, and the cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) were regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B in glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,32]. In retinal degenerations, NF-&#x003ba;B showed a neuroprotective role in photoreceptor apoptosis in vitro as transfection of these cells with a dominant negative mutant IkB greatly enhanced kinetics of down modulation of NF- B, resulting in a faster photo-oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [20]. The function of NF-&#x003ba;B in the retina in vivo appeared unclear, although P65 immunolabeling positive cells were TUNEL negative in light-induced photoreceptor degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. The present study suggests a neurotoxic role of NF-&#x003ba;B in photoreceptor apoptosis by not only showing its persistent high expression levels in <italic>rd</italic> retinas spanning from P12 to P18 when the photoreceptor cell loss took place, but also revealing its activation in microglial cells and co-occurrence of increased TNF-&#x003b1; production in microglial cells in a typical period (from P12 to P14) of retinal degenerations of <italic>rd</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is an important signaling molecule in microglial activation. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B indirectly influences neurodegenerative process by regulating gene expression in microglial cells, including pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; [33]. TNF-&#x003b1; may serve as both target and inducer gene of NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Like other neurodegenerative diseases, TNF-&#x003b1; and other NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent gene products may be responsible for persistent NF-&#x003ba;B activation and sustained chronic retinal inflammation in <italic>rd</italic> mice, even as the photoreceptor cells disappeared in the advanced stage.</p><p>In summary, the present study showed marked activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in microglial cells in the retinal degenerative process of <italic>rd</italic> mice. Alteration of NF-&#x003ba;B activity may promote photoreceptor apoptosis via initiation and perpetuation of chronic inflammation in the <italic>rd</italic> retina, making it an extremely attractive target for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grants from Micheal Panitch Research Fund (M.O.M.T.), the Mr. and Mrs. John Linn Research Fund (H.Z.) and a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health (NIH R01-DA DA15020; S.L.).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Minghetti</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Role of inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.</article-title><source>Curr Opin Neurol</source><year>2005</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>315</fpage><lpage>21</lpage><comment>Click here to read</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15891419</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Colton</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Production of superoxide anions by a CNS macrophage, the microglia.</article-title><source>FEBS Lett</source><year>1987</year><volume>223</volume><fpage>284</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2822487</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r3"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Samouilov</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lancaster</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Zweier</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nitric oxide uptake by erythrocytes is primarily limited by extracellular diffusion not membrane resistance.</article-title><source>J Biol Chem</source><year>2002</year><volume>277</volume><fpage>26194</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12006567</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="r4"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Dickson</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name><name><surname>Brosnan</surname><given-names>CF</given-names></name><name><surname>Berman</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cytokine production by human fetal microglia and astrocytes.
