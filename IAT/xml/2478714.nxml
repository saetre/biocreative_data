Interpretation of vascular phenotypes exhibited by signalling pathway mutants has historically been hindered by an inability to comprehensively image the normal sequence of events that shape the basic architecture of the early mouse vascular system. We have employed Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) using frequency distance relationship (FDR)-based deconvolution to image embryos immunostained with the endothelial specific marker PECAM-1 to create a high resolution, three-dimensional atlas of mouse vascular development between E8.0 and E10.0 (5 to 30 somites). Analysis of the atlas has provided significant new information regarding normal development of intersomitic vessels, the perineural vascular plexus, the cephalic plexus and vessels connecting the embryonic and extraembryonic circulation. We describe examples of vascular remodelling that provide new insight into the mechanisms of sprouting angiogenesis, vascular guidance cues and artery/vein identity that directly relate to phenotypes observed in mouse mutants affecting vascular development between E8.0 and E10.0. This atlas is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mouseimaging.ca/research/mouse_atlas.html">http://www.mouseimaging.ca/research/mouse_atlas.html</ext-link> and will serve as a platform to provide insight into normal and abnormal vascular development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cardiovascular system is the first functional organ system to develop in the mammalian embryo.

Shortly after its formation, this early vascular circuit is remodelled by angiogenesis, the proliferation, sprouting and pruning of pre-existing vessels, transforming it into a complex network of branched endothelial tubes of varying diameter, length and identity. Such remodelling of pre-existing vessels is dependent on both genetically hardwired events and hemodynamic forces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-leNoble1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-Lucitti1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Given the complex nature of the vascular system and the diversity of biological processes required for its assembly and refinement, it is hardly surprising that a large number of signalling pathways are employed in its development.

Correct interpretation of how these pathways regulate vascular development between E8.0 and E10.0 would therefore improve our understanding of how they contribute to later vascularization events. Such interpretation is often impeded however, by the complex nature of the vascular phenotypes, an inability to observe the vasculature of the mutants in its entirety and an incomplete understanding of the normal sequence of vascular remodelling events that occur during this period of development. Previous studies in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-Isogai1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-Isogai2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and chick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-Coffin1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-Poole1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> have provided insight into normal vascular development, but have limited applicability to the sequence of vascular remodeling events in the mammalian embryo primarily due to differences in anatomy and the increased use of plexus bed intermediates in mammals compared to zebrafish. We have sought to address this issue by generating a high resolution, three-dimensional (3D) atlas of the developing mouse vasculature between E8.0 and E10.0 (5&#x02013;30 somites).</p><p>The mouse embryo grows rapidly between E8.0 and E10.0 and undergoes complex morphological and conformational changes that present significant challenges to current imaging technologies. These challenges are further complicated by the inherent properties of the vascular system as a 3D network of branched, interconnected tubes of varying length and size. Accurate assessment of vascular development at this stage therefore requires a 3D imaging modality capable of visualizing the vasculature in its un-manipulated entirety in embryos of increasing size while retaining sufficient isotropic resolution (on the order of a few microns) to capture the details of the finest capillaries. Without these properties, significant positional information about the vasculature is lost and artefacts are introduced. While confocal microscopy has been used to generate an atlas of vascular development in zebrafish embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-Isogai1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and study projections of the vasculature of dissected mouse embryos prior to E8.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-Drake1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, it does not provide sufficient specimen coverage to create the 3D images necessary to visualize the complete embryonic vasculature in mouse embryos beyond this time point. Later embryonic stages have been studied using corrosion casting and electron microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-Hiruma1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

The collection of all images comprises an atlas of normal development of the embryonic mouse vasculature, which is made freely available to other researchers. Analysis of this atlas has resulted in significant new information regarding the normal vascular development in the mouse embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Acronyms for the vessels discussed in this paper are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002853-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0002853-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002853.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Acronyms Used.

Results presented below also illustrate one of the key benefits of the molecular specificity of FDR-deconvolution OPT as compared to imaging based on perfusion of the vascular lumen in that we were able to visualize endothelial cells and vasculature that is disconnected from the rest of the vascular tree and thus identify the origins of vessels at an earlier period of development. FDR-deconvolution OPT is the only imaging technique that has been shown to provide the combination of resolution, specimen coverage and molecular specificity necessary to image the complete vascular network in whole mouse embryos. Sufficient resolution is made possible in OPT imaging only by the inclusion of FDR-based deconvolution, which was shown to provide a factor of two resolution improvement over standard OPT imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-Walls2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Our implementation of FDR-based deconvolution is performed entirely in software and can thus be used in conjunction with any OPT device without the need for hardware modification.

As the embryo turned, the posterior end of the nearly completed UV was brought into contact with the base of the allantois, thereby allowing connection between the extraembryonic (allantoic) and embryonic portions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002853-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). By the end of turning (&#x0223c;14 somites), the remaining cells had joined together to complete the UV as bilateral axial vessels running the length of the trunk from the SV through to the allantois (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002853-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). At the 7 somite stage, several small branches were observed to extend from the rudimentary UV, which, by the 14 somite stage, developed into a capillary plexus permeating the body wall surrounding the intraembryonic coelom dorsal to the UV (data not shown). This plexus continued to develop along the UV with increasing age, eventually becoming continuous with either the rudimentary PCV or the intersomitic veins (see below). To our knowledge, this is the first report of how the embryonic portion of the UV is established.

Intersomitic arteries and veins (ISA and ISV) are branches of the DA and PCV respectively that extend dorsally between the borders of their adjacent somites. The development of intersomitic vessels over time can be followed in a single embryo at a single time point as they emerge in a temporally regulated fashion along the anterior posterior axis from oldest to youngest, similar to their adjacent somites. Comparison of embryos at different stages of development revealed that there was a distinction in the development of intersomitic vessels bounded by the first 5 (occipital) somites compared to those bounded by trunk somites (at least for somites 6&#x02013;20). As such we refer to these intersomitic vessels as &#x0201c;occipital&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;trunk&#x0201d; respectively.</p><p>We observed the occipital intersomitic vessels to consist of three interconnected vessels: a transient ISA, a transient arteriovenous shunt (AVS), and a persistent ISV. The ISAs formed first, initiating bilaterally as dorsal sprouts from the DA as early as 5 somites. At the level of each dorsal ISA, a lateral branch originating from the DA was observed to extend towards the CCV, eventually connecting the two major vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002853-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). This created a direct communication between the DA and CCV and comprised an AVS. Upon reaching the dorsal margin of the bounding somites, the distal tips of the ISAs branched longitudinally, fusing with the neighboring ISAs to form the vertebral artery (VTA). Shortly after VTA formation, the ISV emerged as a branch between the CCV and the ISA. We cannot comment on the origin of this vessel as we did not observe any instances when the ISV was connected to solely either the CCV or the ISA. The fusion of the ISV to the ISA created a temporary triangular vascular structure involving the ISA, the AVS and the ISV. This was a short-lived structure, as regression of the ISA and AVS quickly followed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002853-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). All ISAs and AVS of the occipital region had regressed by the 18 and 28 somite stage respectively, leaving the CCV connected to the VTA via an ISV and the DA fully separated from the VTA and CCV.

This lateral branch became progressively more defined with age and formed the rudiment of the ISV, eventually connecting to either a rudimentary PCV or directly to the capillary plexus from the UV. A small number of branches of PECAM-1 expression were also observed to extend from the UV capillary plexus or the rudimentary PCV towards the rudimentary ISV.

The vasculogenic activity in the vicinity of the PCV and its juxtaposition to the newly emerging ISVs makes it difficult to determine whether the ISV truly sprouts from its accompanying or is generated by (PECAM-1 negative) angioblasts recently added to the PCV by vasculogenesis.

This vessel was observed to develop bilaterally, but not necessarily at the same somite level. At the 20 somite stage, this vessel was still present in the same location, and at the 25 somite stage had developed into an artery feeding the developing limb. Additional branches were noted at this stage, originating from the DA and the neighbouring ISAs and connecting to the capillary plexus of the developing limb bud.

The resulting 3D reconstruction of autofluorescence views and its corresponding 3D reconstruction of either filtered or unfiltered Cy3 views were co-registered.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Point spread function acquisition</title><p>The point spread function of the optical system was required for the FDR-deconvolution process described below. A solution of silica beads (micromod sicastar-greenF 40-02-403) was mixed into 1&#x00025; LMP agarose. A plug was cut out of the agarose and subjected to the same clearing process as the specimens. The plug was hung from the stepper motor, and images were acquired using the GFP1 filter set and the 4&#x000d7; zoom setting. The motorized focus moved the focal plane through the specimen, and an image of the bead plug was acquired at each step. An isolated bead was found in the stack. The data was resampled to approximate the PSF of the system at a wavelength of 600 nm rather than 535 nm, and at zoom settings of 5&#x000d7; and 6.3&#x000d7;.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Frequency Distance Relationship (FDR)-based Deconvolution and Filtering</title><p>The stack of Cy3 views acquired over a complete revolution were subjected to Frequency Distance Relationship (FDR)-based deconvolution as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002853-Walls2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and according to the equation<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002853.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where (<italic>R<sub>x</sub></italic>, <italic>R<sub>z</sub></italic>, &#x003a6;) is the Fourier equivalent of the sinogram space (<italic>r<sub>x</sub></italic>, <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic>, <italic>&#x003c6;</italic>).
