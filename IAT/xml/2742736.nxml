Biochemical assays showed that the four compounds stimulate autophagy and inhibit mTORC1 signaling in cells maintained in nutrient-rich conditions. The compounds did not inhibit mTORC2, which also contains mTOR as a catalytic subunit, suggesting that they do not inhibit mTOR catalytic activity but rather inhibit signaling to mTORC1. mTORC1 inhibition and autophagosome accumulation induced by perhexiline, niclosamide or rottlerin were rapidly reversed upon drug withdrawal whereas amiodarone inhibited mTORC1 essentially irreversibly. TSC2, a negative regulator of mTORC1, was required for inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by rottlerin but not for mTORC1 inhibition by perhexiline, niclosamide and amiodarone. Transient exposure of immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts to these drugs was not toxic in nutrient-rich conditions but led to rapid cell death by apoptosis in starvation conditions, by a mechanism determined in large part by the tuberous sclerosis complex protein TSC2, an upstream regulator of mTORC1.

Anabolic functions such as ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis are inhibited under conditions of nutrient limitation, while catabolic pathways such as autophagy are activated. Autophagy, a process of cellular self-eating, can temporarily compensate for lack of extracellular nutrients by engulfing cytoplasmic components within double-membraned autophagosomes, degrading them by fusion with lysosomes and releasing building blocks for macromolecular synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Yoshimori1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Klionsky1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have developed an assay to detect chemicals that cause a rapid increase in cellular autophagosome content. A screen of &#x0003e;3,500 approved and off-patent medications, as well as compounds with known pharmacological activity led to the identification of three drugs approved for use in humans (amiodarone, niclosamide and perhexiline) and the pharmacological agent rottlerin. Consistent with their ability to modulate autophagy, we show that these chemicals also control mTORC1 signaling. Rottlerin inhibits mTORC1 signaling via TSC2 while the other drugs inhibit mTORC1 signaling in a TSC2-independent manner. Transient exposure to niclosamide, perhexiline or rottlerin causes reversible inhibition of mTORC1 signaling and is not toxic to cells in conditions of nutrient and growth factor sufficiency. However, these drugs selectively kill cells in starvation conditions. Drugs already approved for human use that can reversibly inhibit mTORC1 signaling and stimulate autophagy are valuable pharmacological tools to evaluate the therapeutic potential of manipulating mTORC1 and autophagy in disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Development of an automated microscopy screen for chemical modulators of autophagy</title><p>Upon autophagy induction, the cytosolic Atg8 protein, also called LC3, is recruited to the membrane of nascent autophagosomes and controls autophagosome expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Xie1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

This processing step, which also occurs with EGFP-LC3, yields a polypeptide (EGFP-LC3II) with increased electrophoretic mobility. When autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, EGFP-LC3II is degraded by lysosomal hydrolases and the labile LC3II moiety is degraded faster than the more stable EGFP moiety, leading to transient accumulation of EGFP, which is also eventually degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Ding1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Supplementing DPBS with amino acids did not protect the cells from drug-induced death whereas supplementing with glucose increased survival considerably during exposure to niclosamide, rottlerin or amiodarone, and fully for perhexiline. Addition of both glucose and serum to DPBS rendered cells resistant to niclosamide, rottlerin and perhexiline. By contrast, rapamycin was not any more toxic to cells in DPBS or other starvation conditions than in complete medium.</p><p>The observation that some chemicals that inhibit mTORC1 signaling and stimulate autophagy also selectively killed cells in starvation conditions was not anticipated given the established role of autophagy in promoting survival during starvation. Therefore, we next investigated the death mechanism involved. TSC2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> MEFs were exposed to chemicals for 4 h in complete medium or in starvation conditions. The drugs were then washed away and after 24 h, the cells were stained with FITC-Annexin V and propidium iodide. Annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and labels cells actively undergoing apoptosis while propidium iodide is excluded by viable cells with an intact plasma membrane and therefore labels dead cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that in starvation conditions, the four chemicals caused a considerable increase in cells labeled with FITC-Annexin and propidium iodide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007124-g010">Fig. 10</xref>).

Each of the four chemicals showed interesting similarities to and differences from the well-characterized mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Rapamycin inactivates mTORC1 very rapidly, within a few minutes of cellular exposure. Niclosamide also rapidly inhibits mTORC1 signaling but this inhibition is initially partial, complete inhibition being achieved after 1&#x02013;2 h incubation. The three other chemicals required 1&#x02013;2 h incubation to inhibit mTORC1 signaling, strongly implying that they do not inhibit mTORC1 directly, but target upstream mTORC1 control pathways. Rapamycin is highly potent, complete mTORC1 inhibition being achieved at low nanomolar concentrations. Niclosamide is also potent, with sub-micromolar activity while the other three chemicals inhibit mTORC1 at micromolar concentrations. Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 independently of TSC1/TSC2, similar to amiodarone, perhexiline and niclosamide. By contrast, rottlerin can only inhibit mTORC1 signaling in TSC2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> cells, implying that it inhibits mTORC1 signaling upstream of TSC2. All four compounds selectively inhibit mTORC1 but not mTORC2 signaling, as does rapamycin.</p><p>Notably, the chemicals identified in this study differ from rapamycin with respect to the reversibility of mTORC1 inhibition. Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 signaling irreversibly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Hosoi1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by niclosamide, perhexiline and rottlerin is reversed upon drug removal, while amiodarone is only slowly reversible. Pharmacologically, reversible inhibition is considered a favorable property, especially for drug targets whose activity is necessary for normal cellular functions, because prolonged inhibition caused by irreversible inhibitors can lead to severe side effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Patrick1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. This property should facilitate the fine-tuning of chemical inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in cells or animals for studies of mechanism of action or therapeutic potential.</p><p>The effects of transient exposure on cell proliferation and viability between the four compounds and rapamycin also differed considerably. Transient exposure to nanomolar concentrations of rapamycin caused long-lasting inhibition of cell proliferation, consistent with its irreversible mode of mTORC1 inhibition. By contrast, 4 h incubation with niclosamide, rottlerin and perhexiline at concentrations that were sufficient to profoundly inhibit mTORC1 signaling and stimulate autophagy had little or no effect on cell viability or proliferation in cell culture medium containing nutrients and serum. This result is consistent with the reversible nature of mTORC1 signaling inhibition by these chemicals and demonstrates that strong but transient inhibition of mTORC1 signaling and stimulation of autophagy are not deleterious to cells. The observation that amiodarone killed cells while niclosamide, perhexiline, rottlerin and rapamycin did not suggests that amiodarone acts on targets other than mTORC1 and autophagy to induce toxicity.</p><p>The effects of short exposure to the four chemicals on cell survival and proliferation in starvation conditions also differed from those of rapamycin. Transient exposure to rapamycin did not kill cells but was cytostatic and affected equally cells in complete medium and in starvation conditions. By contrast, the four autophagy-stimulating chemicals all enhanced to varying degrees cell killing in starvation conditions, with niclosamide and rottlerin showing the most pronounced effect. Killing was rescued partially by glucose and totally by further addition of serum, indicating that an interplay between energy status sensing, growth factor signaling and drug action is important for cell death. This observation was unexpected because autophagy is a well-established survival response to starvation and we anticipated that stimulators of autophagy would increase cell survival in starvation conditions. However, a form of death termed type II or autophagic death has been attributed to unregulated autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Kroemer1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Galluzzi1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Lockshin1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. It can be suggested that simultaneous exposure to multiple autophagy stimuli might overactivate autophagy and transform a normally protective response into a death mechanism. However this does not appear to be the case because dying cells showed the presence of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of their plasma membrane, indicating that death occurred through apoptosis. The observation that TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells are very significantly, but not completely, protected from death in starvation firmly implicates the TSC1/TSC2 signaling cascade in the death mechanism. The interesting observation that rapamycin does not trigger cell death in starvation but that upstream inhibitors of mTORC1 signaling do indicates that death does not result from mTORC1 inhibition per se. Rather, it implies the involvement of a TSC2-dependent but mTORC1-independent cell survival pathway. Lee et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Lee1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref> showed that loss of TSC2 activates p53 and increases cell death in response to glucose starvation and that inactivation of mTORC1 by rapamycin protects TSC2 mutant cells from starvation-induced death. They did not observe this effect in TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, which responded similarly to rapamycin treatment and were as resistant to glucose starvation as TSC2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Since TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells were used in the present study, the death pathway we speculate upon must be distinct from that identified by Lee at al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Lee1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Perhexiline, niclosamide, amiodarone and rottlerin most likely inhibit mTORC1 signaling by acting on upstream regulatory pathways, unlike the recently described inhibitors of mTORC1/2 Torin1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Thoreen1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref> and Ku-0063794 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-GarciaMartinez2">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref> and the dual PI3k/mTOR inhibitors PI-103 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Fan1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref> and NVP-BEZ235 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Serra1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>, which inhibit these kinases directly.</p><p>Rottlerin is a widely used pharmacological agent believed until recently to inhibit PKC&#x02202; selectively.

It is tempting to speculate that rottlerin inhibits mTORC1 signaling through the phosphorylation of Ser 1345 on TSC2 by AMPK. However, there are currently no antibodies available to study this phosphorylation on TSC2. Although it is possible that rottlerin stimulates autophagy via AMPK, TSC2 and mTORC1, this is unlikely to be the only mechanism because LC3 processing still occurs in TSC2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells in which rottlerin does not inhibit mTORC1 signaling.</p><p>Niclosamide is a salicylanilide antihelmintic drug that was approved for use in humans nearly 50 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Anand1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007124-Fairweather1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>.
