RNA editing by site-selective A-to-I modification also regulates protein function through recoding of genomically specified sequences. The adenosine deaminase ADAR2 is the main enzyme responsible for recoding editing and loss of ADAR2 function in mice leads to a phenotype of epilepsy and premature death. Although A-to-I RNA editing is known to be subject to developmental and cell-type specific regulation, there is little knowledge regarding the mechanisms that regulate RNA editing in vivo. Therefore, the characterization of ADAR expression and identification of alternative ADAR variants is an important prerequisite for understanding the mechanisms for regulation of RNA editing and the causes for deregulation in disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here we present evidence for a new ADAR2 splice variant that extends the open reading frame of ADAR2 by 49 amino acids through the utilization of an exon located 18 kilobases upstream of the previously annotated first coding exon and driven by a candidate alternative promoter. Interestingly, the 49 amino acid extension harbors a sequence motif that is closely related to the R-domain of ADAR3 where it has been shown to function as a basic, single-stranded RNA binding domain. Quantitative expression analysis shows that expression of the novel ADAR2 splice variant is tissue specific being highest in the cerebellum.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The strong sequence conservation of the ADAR2 R-domain between human, mouse and rat ADAR2 genes suggests a conserved function for this isoform of the RNA editing enzyme.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear pre-mRNA editing has been recognized as an important mechanism for the generation of protein diversity in mammals (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004225-Bass1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004225-Maydanovych1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>).

In our 5&#x02032;-RACE analysis of the mouse Adar2 gene the different 5&#x02032;-sequences upstream of exon 1 indicated that exon 0 is probably expressed from a different promoter than the one used for the expression of the regular ADAR2 splice variants. There is no discernable consensus upstream splice site for exon 0, and the only mouse EST sequence that includes exon 0 as well as the single cDNA clone we obtained from mouse brain, lack any further upstream sequences derived from additional untranslated exons. The fact that the 5&#x02032;-region of exon 0 overlaps with the location of a CpG-Island (according to UCSC human genome browser), further supports the notion that a transcriptional start site is close by. Generally, CpG islands are associated with genes, particularly housekeeping genes, in vertebrates. CpG islands are particularly common near transcripton start sites, and are often associated with promoter regions. In this case, the CpG island is 209 bp long with a GC content of 63.3&#x00025;.

Alternatively, translation could initiate at the first ATG and lead to premature termination precluding the translation of the R-domain. Furthermore, we cannot formally rule out that the 10 bp deletion seen in the available zebrafish sequence is subject to polymorphisms and another allele that lacks the deletion exists as well. The different configuration of ADAR2 exon 0 in zebrafish could be an indication of evolutionary changes in the regulation of A-to-I RNA editing that took place during the development of higher vertebrates.</p><p>The ADAR3 genome architecture is strongly conserved to the one of ADAR2 with respect to the splice donor site directly following the R-domain sequence.</p><p>We will refer to this ADAR2 isoform as ADAR2R from here on based on the presence of the highly conserved R-domain.</p><p>Another interesting observation is that the sequence of exon 1 that serves as 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) in the major splice form of ADAR2, is more strongly conserved across species than other 5&#x02032;-UTR sequences. Indeed, in ADAR2R, this part of exon 1 is translated and therefore contributes to the ADAR2R protein sequence. This could explain why the sequence is conserved more strongly and further supports the notion that ADAR2 fulfills a conserved function in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Differential expression of ADAR2R mRNA in human tissues</title><p>We next addressed the question where and to what extent ADAR2R is expressed in human tissues.

With respect to ADAR2R expression, the currently available evidence does not suggest that this protein isoform is stimulated by interferon. Since the ADAR2R isoform is identical to the ADAR2 major isoform except for the small N-terminal extension, an increase or decrease of ADAR2R upon interferon stimulation of cells would generally result in the up- or downregulation of the overall amount of ADAR2. However, such an effect was not observed in several studies analyzing ADAR expression during interferon induction (see references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004225-George1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004225-George2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004225-Yang2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>). ADAR2 expression remains unaltered by interferon action, whereas ADAR1 is strongly induced by interferon.</p><p>Due to the small difference in molecular weight between the ADAR2 major protein isoform, several ADAR2 splice variants, and the ADAR2R isoform, the unambiguous detection of endogenously expressed ADAR2R would require an isoform specific antibody. However, such an antibody is not available. In fact, due to the sequence nature of the R-domain (highly repetitive as well as highly conserved between ADAR2R and ADAR3), this strategy may not be successful. When using an antibody that recognizes all ADAR2 splice variants however, a signal that likely represents ADAR2R is detectable above background in brain tissues that show ADAR2R expression as separate band or showing a likely double band (such as figure 3 in Feng et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004225-Feng1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and figure 3 in Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004225-Singh1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>). However, due to the potential presence of other ADAR2 splice variants with similar molecular weights, the use of a general ADAR2 antibody cannot formally prove the presence of ADAR2R. In the future, highly sensitive proteomics mass-spec technology may resolve this issue.</p><p>When recombinantly expressing ADAR2R in HeLa and HEK293 cells, we did not detect any differences in general adenosine deaminase activity displayed by ADAR2R compared to the ADAR2a major splice variant (data not shown). If the R-domain in ADAR2R conveys a selective binding affinity to a specific nucleic acid substrate, then a functional difference between ADAR2R and ADAR2a will likely be limited to the activity on that specific target.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Recoding SNP within R-domain of human ADAR2R</title><p>When comparing the cDNA of the initially cloned mouse ADAR2R sequence, we noticed an A-to-G discrepancy changing a genomically encoded Arginine codon (AGG) to a Glycin codon (GGG). Since in mouse this position has not been mapped as a genomic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the sequence alteration is within the highly conserved R-domain sequence motif, this base discrepancy may represent a site of RNA editing. The ADAR2 pre-mRNA is already known to be subject to selfediting by the ADAR2 protein at another site, where the base modification creates an alternative splice site in intron 1 that leads to the expression of a truncated, nonfunctional protein.</p><p>We also noted that within the human ADAR2 exon 0 sequence, there is a recoding SNP annotated that alters an Isoleucin (ATC) to a Valin (GTC) codon upstream of the R-domain. Since this SNP is also of the A-to-G type, there could be A-to-I RNA editing being responsible for some of the observed discrepancies, even though individuals with both alleles of the gene would be able to produce both isoforms without the need for editing.</p><p>To test if these two nucleotide positions within the ADAR2 exon 0 sequence may be subject to an RNA-based modification, we performed RT-PCR on human brain total RNA amplifying the exon 0 sequence encompassing both putative editing sites. In parallel, the corresponding genomic region was amplified from genomic DNA prepared from the same specimen that gave rise to the total RNA. This ensures that any SNP can be distinguished from post-transcriptional base modifications.</p><p>For both sites, we did not detect any mixed sequence populations when analyzing the gene-specific amplicons (data not shown). This means that at least in human total brain, there is no detectable RNA editing involving these two positions. We cannot formally rule out that RNA editing may occur at low levels (below the detection limit of the RT-PCR sequencing analysis) or selectively within specific cell types, or at specific time points.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>5&#x02032; RACE</title><p>For confirmation of the mouse Adar2 cDNA sequence at the 5&#x02032;-end, a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) experiment was performed with total RNA isolated from mouse brain using TRIzol-reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
