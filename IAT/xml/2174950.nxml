The mammalian proteoglycan Perlecan binds and regulates signaling by Sonic Hedgehog, Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), among others, in contexts ranging from angiogenesis and cardiovascular development to cancer progression. The <italic>Drosophila </italic>Perlecan homolog <italic>trol </italic>has been shown to regulate the activity of Hedgehog and Branchless (an FGF homolog) to control the onset of stem cell proliferation in the developing brain during first instar.

Analysis of the initiation of neuroblast proliferation at second instar demonstrated that <italic>trol </italic>regulates this event by modulating signaling by Hedgehog and Branchless, as it does during first instar. Trol protein is distributed over the surface of the larval brain, near the regulated neuroblasts that reside on the cortical surface. Mutations in <italic>trol </italic>also decrease the number of circulating plasmatocytes. This is likely to be due to decreased expression of <italic>pointed</italic>, the response gene for VEGF/PDGF signaling that is required for plasmatocyte proliferation. Trol is found on plasmatocytes, where it could regulate VEGF/PDGF signaling. Finally, we show that in second instar brains but not third instar brain lobes and eye discs, mutations in <italic>trol </italic>affect signaling by Decapentaplegic (a Transforming Growth Factor family member), Wingless (a Wnt growth factor) and Hedgehog.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These studies extend the known functions of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>Perlecan homolog <italic>trol </italic>in both developmental and signaling contexts.

The general structure of the protein core determines the family the HSPG belongs to: Syndecans contain a transmembrane domain, Glypicans are tethered to the cell surface via a GPI linkage and Perlecans are secreted components of the extracellular matrix. Both the protein core and glycan chains play important roles in HSPG function through protein-protein and sugar-protein interactions. Genetic studies, first in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and later in mouse and zebrafish, demonstrated the importance of the heparan sulfate chains on all three types of HSPGs for signaling by multiple growth factors such as the Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs), Hedgehogs, Wnts and Transforming Growth Factors (TGF&#x003b2;s) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]).</p><p>Perlecan is the largest member of the HSPG family with a core protein of approximately 450kD in size. Perlecan has been linked to signaling by the heparan-dependent growth factors FGF2, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) in mammalian systems (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Studies of Perlecan knock-out mice have demonstrated roles for Perlecan in vascular development and chondrogenesis as well as maintenance of basement membrane integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additional mammalian studies have revealed Perlecan's functions in angiogenesis and carcinogenesis ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). Mutation of Perlecan in humans leads to the muscle tone symptoms of Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, possibly through altered excitability of the neuromuscular junction and the skeletal abnormalities of Silver-Handmaker syndrome, presumably through effects on chondrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Studies of Perlecan in invertebrate model systems have led to additional insights into Perlecan function. The single Perlecan gene in <italic>C. elegans </italic>is encoded by the <italic>unc-52 </italic>locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>unc-52 </italic>result in embryonic or adult paralysis due to defects in body wall muscle cells ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]). Mutations in <italic>unc-52 </italic>also enhance cell migration defects caused by decreased netrin, FGF, TGF&#x003b2; or Wnt signaling. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Perlecan is encoded by the <italic>trol </italic>gene on the X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which was initially implicated in the control of stem cell division in the developing larval brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the larval brain, <italic>trol </italic>promotes the cell cycle progression of mitotically arrested neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] through modulation of FGF and Hedgehog signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These <italic>Drosophila </italic>studies were the first to link Perlecan to Hedgehog signaling. More recently, studies of oogenesis in <italic>Drosophila </italic>have uncovered a role for Perlecan in the maintenance of epithelial cell polarity through interactions with the extracellular matrix receptor Dystroglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The many signaling pathways associated with HSPGs in general and Perlecan in particular led us to ask what other biological processes may require Perlecan function. We used a series of <italic>trol </italic>mutants to investigate several phenotypes ranging from overall developmental progress to specific alterations of stem cell division and hemocyte production. Furthermore, analysis of signaling pathway response genes revealed that while mutations in Perlecan decrease signaling in multiple pathways, at least some of these effects are tissue specific.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Development and lethal phase</title><p>We had previously shown that the viable <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>and the lethal <italic>trol</italic><sup>8</sup>, <italic>trol</italic><sup>4</sup>, and <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>sd </italic></sup>alleles form an allelic series of increasing severity based on their onset of neuroblast proliferation phenotype in first instar larval brain lobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and phenotypic analysis of a fifth <italic>trol </italic>allele, <italic>trol</italic><sup>7</sup>, revealed that <italic>trol</italic><sup>7 </sup>is the strongest allele with respect to the first instar proliferation phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Unexpectedly, <italic>trol</italic><sup>7 </sup>mutant larvae appeared healthier overall than other <italic>trol </italic>mutant larvae, suggesting that the order of allelic severity determined by analysis of first instar brain lobes would be different from one based on developmental progression. To test this hypothesis, we examined the lethal stage and developmental progression of larvae mutant for <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22</sup>, <italic>trol</italic><sup>8</sup>, <italic>trol</italic><sup>4</sup>, <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>sd </italic></sup>and <italic>trol</italic><sup>7</sup>. In all the experiments, crosses were designed to use sibling controls in order to minimize the effects of genetic background, which can be significant in fly stocks kept in reproductive isolation from each other for years in our laboratory. For the lethal <italic>trol </italic>alleles, <italic>y trol</italic><sup><italic>x </italic></sup><italic>/Binsn </italic>stocks were used as the source of mutant and control larvae. At this stage of first instar, mutations in <italic>y </italic>produce one of the few reliable phenotypic markers. Thus <italic>trol </italic>mutant animals were identified as <italic>y </italic>mutant larvae that are <italic>y trol</italic><sup><italic>x </italic></sup>hemizygous males and sibling controls were a mixed population of <italic>y</italic><sup>+ </sup>animals: <italic>y trol</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup><italic>/Binsn </italic>heterozygotes, <italic>Binsn </italic>homozygous females and <italic>Binsn </italic>hemizygous males. Note that while <italic>Binsn </italic>homozygous females and hemizygous males can become viable adults, not all <italic>Binsn/Binsn </italic>or <italic>Binsn/Y </italic>larvae reach adulthood. Thus our comparison provides a measure of developmental progression and lethal phase that will err on the side of minimizing the <italic>trol </italic>mutant phenotype. For analysis of the viable <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>allele, additional crosses were required to produce wild-type sibling controls from the homozygous <italic>y trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>stock. <italic>y trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>animals were crossed to the wild-type strain Canton Special (CS) to produce <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22</sup>/CS heterozygous females. These females were mated to CS males to generate hemizygous <italic>y trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>male larvae and <italic>y</italic><sup>+ </sup>sibling control larvae (a mixture of heterozygous <italic>y trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22</sup><italic>/CS </italic>female, homozygous <italic>CS </italic>female and hemizygous <italic>CS </italic>male) for the developmental studies. One hundred mutant and sibling control animals for each allele were collected at early first instar and monitored at 24 hour intervals for developmental progression and viability. Of these, only 1 mutant <italic>trol</italic><sup>4 </sup>and no <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>sd </italic></sup>animals pupariated. However, when the same numbers of <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22</sup>, <italic>trol</italic><sup>8 </sup>and <italic>trol</italic><sup>7 </sup>mutant larvae were analyzed and compared to sibling controls, 102%, 38% and 23% of the animals were able to pupariate, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The pupariation assay resulted in shifts of perceived functional severity for both <italic>trol</italic><sup>4 </sup>and <italic>trol</italic><sup>7</sup>, with <italic>trol</italic><sup>4 </sup>appearing stronger and <italic>trol</italic><sup>7 </sup>appearing weaker.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotypic series of <italic>trol </italic>alleles</bold>.

One possibility is that <italic>trol </italic>modulates the activity of different signaling pathways in different tissues. For example, a mutation that affects the ability of Trol to function in the Hh pathway would have a severe effect on developmental decisions that require Hh activity and very little effect on decisions that do not require Hh signaling. To address this possibility we investigated the impact of <italic>trol </italic>mutations on two distinct developmental events and several signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of trol mutations on TNb proliferation</title><p><italic>trol </italic>was initially identified as a mutation on the X chromosome that affected the proliferation pattern of neuroblasts in the brain lobes and ventral ganglion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since neuroblasts in the thoracic region of the ventral ganglion begin proliferation in early second instar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we evaluated the ability of thoracic neuroblasts (TNbs) to enter S phase in <italic>trol </italic>mutant animals. We adapted the idea of phenotypic classes to produce a scale for the extent of TNb proliferation at four hours post molt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;G</xref>). Five TNb classes were defined as follows: Class 1, no neuroblasts labeled; Class 2, a small number of labeled neuroblasts with no distinct segmental pattern; Class 3, labeled neuroblasts in a segmentally repeated lines with very few labeled neuroblasts in between the lines or in the medial region of the ventral ganglion; Class 4, labeled neuroblasts in a segmentally repeated line with some labeled neuroblasts in between the lines or in the medial region of the ventral ganglion; and Class 5, labeled neuroblasts in heavily populated segmental pattern with many labeled neuroblasts in the medial portion of the ventral ganglion. When both sides of a ventral ganglion did not conform to a single class, the sample was scored as the higher class. This will have a conservative effect of scoring a partial loss-of-proliferation TNb phenotype as more wild-type. Thus we can have greater confidence in the significance of TNb proliferation phenotypes observed compared to controls.</p><p>We first examined the onset of TNb proliferation in wild-type sibling controls to determine the time point at which to assay the <italic>trol </italic>mutants (data not shown). In our hands, high levels of 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled TNbs were first observed in control samples between 2&#x02013;5 hours post molt depending on genetic background. This timing is slightly earlier than the previous observation that TNb mitosis begins between 28&#x02013;34 hours post hatching, or 4&#x02013;10 hours post molt (pm) to second instar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To evaluate the TNb proliferation phenotype produced by the different <italic>trol </italic>alleles, at least twenty samples for each mutant and sibling control (generated as described above) were allowed to incorporate BrdU from 4&#x02013;5 hours pm and scored for TNb class. The average score and standard error of the mean were calculated for each group of sibling controls. The control value for each study was set to a value of 4 to control for genetic background effects between experiments. Setting controls to a value of 4 on our 5 point scale was chosen to allow evaluation of over-proliferation (&#x0003e;4) as well as under-proliferation (&#x0003c;4) mutant phenotypes. To obtain the TNb phenotype score for each mutant allele we normalized the score for each sample to the respective sibling control and calculated the average and standard error of the mean (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>mutants had a significantly higher than normal level of TNb proliferation (TNb score &#x0003e;4) while the remaining <italic>trol </italic>mutants showed decreased TNb cell division compared to controls. The differences between mutant and control BrdU incorporation were statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05) for each mutant allele. Comparison between mutants showed a phenotypic trend from <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>having hyperactive TNb proliferation to <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>sd </italic></sup>as the mutant with the fewest labeled TNbs.

In combination with our genetic studies, these complexes suggested that the Trol protein regulates neuroblast division by binding growth factors that stimulate neuroblast proliferation in a manner similar to Perlecan-mediated promotion of ligand-receptor binding described in mammalian systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This model predicts that Trol protein should be localized near the regulated neuroblasts, i.e. the optic lobe and central brain neuroblasts of the first instar brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and the thoracic region of the second instar brain ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization studies in the third instar larval brain by Voigt et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] had revealed that only a few isolated cells at a distance from the optic lobe proliferation centers express <italic>trol</italic>. This led the authors to suggest that Trol is unlikely to regulate neuroblast proliferation by promoting binding of FGF-type ligands to their receptors since this would require Trol protein localization near the responding cells. However, since Trol is a secreted protein with a long half-life, mRNA expression patterns may not accurately portray protein localization. In addition, Voigt et al conducted their <italic>in situ </italic>analysis at late third instar, 2&#x02013;3 days after the activation of neuroblast division at late first or early second instar. Thus the expression pattern observed for <italic>trol </italic>message at late third instar may not reflect expression of <italic>trol </italic>at earlier larval stages. Furthermore, a study of <italic>trol </italic>mRNA localization by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization in embryos showed either no obvious staining in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] or expression in a small subset of glial cells in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, analysis of Trol protein localization with an anti-Trol antibody in embryos revealed localization to the basement membrane of the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This evidence further suggests that <italic>trol </italic>message patterns may not reflect Trol protein localization. To address the conflicting models, we took advantage of a Trol protein trap in which the GFP gene is inserted within the endogenous <italic>trol </italic>locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Analysis of GFP localization in larval brains demonstrates that Trol-GFP is found in a layer, presumably the basal lamina, encompassing the entire outer surface of the larval brain with little to no signal detectable at internal sites within the brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B&#x02013;E</xref>). Trol-GFP was also observed in the basal lamina surrounding nerves emanating from the larval brain. The distribution of Trol over the entire brain was further verified by immunohistochemistry using an anti-Trol antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). This localization of the Trol protein is consistent with the model that Trol binds Bnl and Hh and facilitates their signaling to promote neuroblast proliferation, as the regulated neuroblasts are found at the surface of the cellular cortex in both the brain lobes and the ventral ganglion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. To determine if the localization of Trol-GFP to the basal lamina was unique to the larval brain, we examined Trol-GFP in the salivary glands. As in our larval brain studies, Trol-GFP is found on the surface of the gland, presumably as a component of the basal lamina (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of Trol-GFP in the larval brain</bold>.

A number of studies have elegantly shown that the larval lymph gland is the source of larval hemocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the primary lobe of the third instar lymph gland prohemocytes arise in the medullary zone while maturing hemocytes are found in the adjacent cortical zone. Hemocytes are then released into the hemolymph and are present as three types of circulating cells: plasmatocytes (95%), lamellocytes (1&#x02013;5%) and crystal cells (rare). Each cell-type has characteristic morphology and can be easily identified under a compound microscope. Mature circulating larval hemocytes are still undergoing cell division, albeit at a low rate, as shown by staining of hemocytes with phosphohistone H3, an M phase marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Expression of an activated Ras (Ras<sup>v12</sup>) in circulating hemocytes increases the percentage of circulating hemocytes that stain for phosphohistone H3 and results in a 40-fold increase in the number of hemocytes through activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The Ras-MAPK pathway is activated by Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) among others. Signaling by mammalian homologs of both growth factors has been linked to mammalian Perlecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, studies of PDGF/VEGF receptor (<italic>PVR</italic>) in <italic>Drosophila </italic>revealed that <italic>PVR </italic>is expressed in plasmatocytes and that decreased PVR function leads to increased hemocyte cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus it seemed likely that mutations in <italic>trol </italic>could decrease PDGF/VEGF signaling in circulating plasmatocytes, resulting in decreased numbers of circulating plasmatocytes in <italic>trol </italic>mutants. To address this hypothesis, we determined the relative number of circulating plasmatocytes in third instar <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>or <italic>trol</italic><sup>7 </sup>and sibling control larvae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

We also assayed expression of <italic>hh </italic>and its response gene <italic>ptc </italic>in third instar brains and eye discs. In the <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>second instar ventral ganglion we observed a significant drop in the level of both <italic>dpp </italic>and <italic>wg </italic>compared to controls. The <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>mutation also resulted in diminished signaling efficiency by both growth factors as indicated by a larger drop in the level of their response genes <italic>salm </italic>and <italic>slp </italic>compared to the ligands themselves. In contrast, the <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>sd </italic></sup>mutation decreased only <italic>dpp </italic>expression, but the efficiency of both <italic>dpp </italic>and <italic>wg </italic>signaling was impaired. Thus in the second instar ventral gangion, wild-type function of <italic>trol </italic>appears to be required for normal signaling by <italic>hh</italic>, <italic>bnl</italic>, <italic>dpp </italic>and <italic>wg </italic>(Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

Alternatively, decreased expression of <italic>dpp </italic>and <italic>wg </italic>could be due to positive feedback between Dpp signaling and <italic>dpp </italic>expression and Wg signaling and <italic>wg </italic>expression, respectively. To test the latter possibility, we blocked Dpp signaling by over-expression of <italic>daughters against dpp </italic>(<italic>dad) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and assayed for <italic>dpp </italic>message levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). <italic>(EP)dad </italic>females were crossed to <italic>hsGAL4 </italic>males to drive expression of <italic>dad</italic>. Embryogenesis and first instar larval development were carried out at 18&#x000b0;C to limit expression of <italic>dad </italic>and inhibition of Dpp signaling at early stages. Upon molt to second instar, larvae were moved to 25&#x000b0;C for one hour to induce expression of <italic>dad</italic>. Larval brains were dissected and the ventral ganglia harvested for RNA isolations. Inhibition of Dpp signaling was confirmed by analysis of <italic>salm </italic>mRNA levels. Similarly, we inhibited Wg signaling by over-expression of <italic>shaggy </italic>(<italic>sgg</italic>), and assayed for <italic>wg </italic>message levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Decreased Wg signaling was verified by analysis of <italic>slp </italic>expression levels. As shown by our qRT-PCR analysis, inhibition of Dpp signaling by over-expression of <italic>dad </italic>resulted in a drop in expression of the <italic>dpp </italic>ligand itself.

Mutations in a second gene, <italic>anachronism</italic>, also affect the onset of neuroblast proliferation but in the opposite manner: in <italic>anachronism </italic>mutants, mitotically regulated neuroblasts begin cell division too early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, when a lethal <italic>trol </italic>mutation was combined with a viable allele of <italic>anachronism</italic>, the lack of neuroblast division was rescued (double mutants exhibited the <italic>anachronism </italic>phenotype of premature neuroblast division) but lethality was not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This outcome suggested that <italic>trol </italic>function is required for other developmental events necessary for survival. Further analyses revealed that <italic>trol </italic>modulates Hh and Bnl signaling in the first instar brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Here we have demonstrated that <italic>trol </italic>function is required for developmental progression to third instar and for pupariation. Analogous to its function in the first instar brain, <italic>trol </italic>is required to initiate the division of a second, independent and spatially distinct population of neuroblasts in the second instar brain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This initiation of division is also dependent on Bnl and Hh signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We have also demonstrated that the Trol protein is localized to the surface of the brain at all larval stages, which places it in close proximity to the regulated neuroblasts. This localization is consistent with our model where Trol regulates Bnl and Hh signaling to cells adjacent to the regulated neuroblasts by binding the growth factors directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Trol protein localization to the basal lamina is not limited to the larval brain, as Trol-GFP studies also showed Trol protein in the basal lamina surrounding the salivary glands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). <italic>trol </italic>function is not limited to the nervous system, as mutations in <italic>trol </italic>also diminish the number of circulating plasmatocytes by decreasing expression of <italic>pnt</italic>, a PVR response gene in plasmatocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We speculate that <italic>trol </italic>may be necessary for signaling by the <italic>Drosophila </italic>PDGF and/or VEGF growth factor, just as mammalian Perlecan has been shown to function during angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Our studies of Dpp and Wg indicate a positive feedback between <italic>dpp </italic>expression and Dpp signaling and <italic>wg </italic>expression and Wg signaling in the second instar ventral ganglion. Signaling by Dpp and Wg is also dependent on <italic>trol </italic>in the second instar brain, but not (or very little) in the third instar brain lobes and eye discs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), despite the fact that Dpp and Wg signaling are taking place in those tissues. In fact, even Hh signaling appears to be independent of <italic>trol </italic>in this context. These results highlight an important concept in <italic>trol</italic>, and indeed, in proteoglycan function: that the Trol protein will be used at different times and places to regulate the signaling of different growth factors. Deciphering the role of <italic>trol </italic>in different developmental decisions will require that we examine each event individually, as <italic>trol </italic>will not necessarily mediate the same molecular mechanism each time.</p></sec><sec><title>Involvement of HSPGs in growth factor signaling</title><p>The requirement for heparan sulfate proteoglycans in signaling by different families of growth factors is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], but what is not yet clear is why different organs and tissue types use different HSPGs to modulate these signaling pathways. One possibility is that the specific mechanism(s) through which these molecules modulate signaling activity allows for site-specific variations in the regulation of signaling activity. HSPGs with varied amino acid sequence can act in the same signaling pathway, such as Syndecan-4 and Perlecan for FGF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] or Glypicans, Syndecan-3 and Perlecan for Hh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].

Furthermore, Perlecan isolated from various endothelial cell sources has different binding affinities for FGF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. These data initially suggested that the protein core of the HSPG might have little to do with signaling specificity and that the main functional domain of HSPGs is concentrated in the sequence of the heparan sulfate chains.</p><p>The carbohydrate-centric view is being challenged by studies that indicate a role for the protein-protein interactions of HSPGs with growth factors and other signaling molecules. For example, expression of chimeric molecules has shown that the cytoplasmic tail of Syndecan is specifically required for FGF2 signaling in addition to its heparan sulfate chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Perlecan protein-protein interactions include the ability of Perlecan to bind growth factors and extracellular matrix molecules at various sites on its protein core. Further mechanisms that allow for differential regulation include processing of HSPGs. These studies suggest a reason for the use of a particular HSPG during an individual developmental decision &#x02013; the flexibility of combining both carbohydrate-based regulation and protein-based regulation of cell-cell signaling may make a specific HSPG uniquely suited for a given situation.</p><p>In the context of combined carbohydrate and protein inputs into HSPG function, it becomes clear that a given HSPG may be expressed and function in very specific contexts that take advantage of its unique regulatory abilities. It is interesting to note that we have connected Perlecan with FGF and Hh signaling in the developing fly brain while mouse studies have shown that Perlecan knock-out mice have cerebral cortex abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. <italic>trol </italic>mutant larvae have decreased numbers of circulating hemocytes that are likely due to decreased Ras-MAPK signaling by VEGF/PDGF. Perlecan knock-out mice also have defects in chondrogenesis and cardiovascular development and mammalian studies have demonstrated a role for Perlecan in angiogenesis driven by FGFs, VEGF and PDGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Finally, we have shown that Perlecan is required for SHH signaling during human prostate cancer growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which reveals a new system for the investigation of the mechanism of Perlecan action. Further analysis of the ability of HSPGs to substitute for each other in cell fate decisions and the means by which they individually regulate cell-cell communication will lead to a clearer understanding of the inputs necessary for cells to carry out a developmental or disease progression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Stocks of the viable <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>b</italic>22 </sup>allele and the lethal <italic>trol</italic><sup>4</sup>, <italic>trol</italic><sup>7</sup>, <italic>trol</italic><sup>8 </sup>and <italic>trol</italic><sup><italic>sd </italic></sup>alleles have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].
