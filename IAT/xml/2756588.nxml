We scanned billions of phage-displayed peptides to map the binding specificities of the SH3 domain family in the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Although most of the SH3 domains fall into the canonical classes I and II, each domain utilizes distinct features of its cognate ligands to achieve binding selectivity. Furthermore, we uncovered several SH3 domains with specificity profiles that clearly deviate from the two canonical classes. In conjunction with phage display, we used yeast two-hybrid and peptide array screening to independently identify SH3 domain binding partners. The results from the three complementary techniques were integrated using a Bayesian algorithm to generate a high-confidence yeast SH3 domain interaction map. The interaction map was enriched for proteins involved in endocytosis, revealing a set of SH3-mediated interactions that underlie formation of protein complexes essential to this biological pathway. We used the SH3 domain interaction network to predict the dynamic localization of several previously uncharacterized endocytic proteins, and our analysis suggests a novel role for the SH3 domains of Lsb3p and Lsb4p as hubs that recruit and assemble several endocytic complexes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Significant diversity exists in protein structure and function, yet certain structural domains are used repeatedly across species to execute similar functions. The SH3 domain is one such common structural domain. It is found in signaling proteins and mediates protein&#x02013;protein interactions by binding to short peptide sequences generally composed of proline. To investigate both the generality and selectivity of peptide binding by SH3 domains, we examined peptide specificity for almost all SH3 domains encoded within the proteome of the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, using a range of experimental methods. We found that although most of the intrinsic binding specificity for SH3 domains can be summarized by the two previously described canonical binding modes, each individual SH3 domain that we studied utilizes unique features of its cognate ligand to achieve binding selectivity. Moreover, some domains exhibit binding specificities that are distinct from the two canonical classes. We integrated peptide-SH3 domain binding data from three complementary screening techniques using a Bayesian statistical model to generate a protein&#x02013;protein interaction network for the budding yeast SH3 domain family. This network was highly enriched in endocytosis proteins and their interactions. By examining these interactions in detail, we show that our SH3 domain network can be used to predict the temporal localization of several previously uncharacterized proteins to dynamic complexes that orchestrate the process of endocytosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="20"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Families of peptide recognition modules (PRMs), such as PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1), SH2 (Src homology 2), and SH3 (Src homology 3) domains bind peptide motifs within proteins to mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions required for the assembly of stable or transient biological complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Pawson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here, we present the first high-resolution analysis of the yeast SH3 domain family. First, we used large-scale phage-displayed peptide libraries and extensive sequencing to generate high-resolution binding profiles, which we show accurately represent binding specificity across multiple SH3 domain ligand positions. Second, we used the resulting specificity profiles to identify putative interactions in the yeast proteome, which were subsequently confirmed using oriented synthetic peptide arrays. Third, we conducted large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens to generate a physical interaction network mediated by the set of yeast SH3 domains. Finally, the datasets were integrated using Bayesian networks to generate a global SH3 domain interaction map in yeast.</p><p>Applying the integrated probabilistic network revealed an intricate array of SH3-mediated interactions amongst proteins that make up the endocytic machinery. Investigation and comparison of the dynamics of protein localization within this network showed that the modular network predictions of the spatiotemporal dynamics of several novel endocytotic components were correct. In particular, our analysis predicts that the SH3 domains from Lsb3p and Lsb4p interact with multiple endocytic proteins and therefore might act as hubs to cluster these proteins at sites of endocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Yeast SH3 Domain Specificity Map</title><p>We used peptide phage display to conduct a large-scale analysis of yeast SH3 domain specificity.

We expressed the domains in bacteria as proteins fused to the C-terminus of glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) and purified 24 out of 27 fusion proteins in a stable, soluble form. For two of the three recalcitrant domains, the C-terminal domain of Bem1p (Bem1-2) and the Bud14p domain, we extended the sequence boundaries by examining the conservation of the domain regions across diverse fungal species. Based on this analysis, the domain boundaries for these two SH3 domains were extended, enabling the isolation of stable GST fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s011">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s023">Text S1</xref>). The third recalcitrant domain, the N-terminal domain of Sla1p (Sla1-1), could only be purified in tandem with Sla1-2, and we denoted the dual domain protein as Sla1-1/2.</p><p>The GST-SH3 domain fusion proteins were used as targets in binding selections with a combination of random and biased peptide&#x02013;phage libraries. We were successful in obtaining ligands for all SH3 domains except Bud14 and Cdc25, and we isolated a total of 1,871 unique peptides. These results extend results from our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Tong1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and represent nearly an 8-fold increase in binding data. The set of aligned ligands for each domain was used to compile a position weight matrix (PWM), which captures the frequency of amino acid preferences at each ligand position. Some ligand sets contained two distinct groups of ligands, and for these, two separate PWMs were compiled (see below). From each PWM, a sequence logo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Schneider1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> was generated to graphically represent the specificity at each amino acid position in each ligand set.</p><p>To compare the binding specificities for the yeast SH3 domain family on a global scale, we clustered all domains in an unrooted tree based on their specificities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We generated a set of 10,000 random peptides from the yeast proteome and used these to score each phage-derived PWM. The match of each PWM with each peptide was calculated using an information score yielding a 10,000-dimensional profile vector for each PWM. This profile vector describes the binding specificity in a cellular context by sampling the sequences that the domains would be exposed to in the cell. The similarity between PWMs was computed as the Pearson correlation between these vectors. PWMs were then clustered according to this similarity measure using a complete linkage algorithm. Hence, the tree represents natural yeast SH3 domain specificity as it clusters binding profiles based on endogenous protein ligands. Overall, our results are consistent with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Tong1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>; in addition, this higher resolution analysis reveals that each domain exhibits specificity across multiple ligand positions, including the core motif and flanking positions.</p><fig id="pbio-1000218-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000218.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Endogenous specificity map for the yeast SH3 domain family.</title><p>PWMs were generated using phage-derived binding peptides, and a PWM-based scoring algorithm was used to search the yeast proteome for closely matching sequences, which were subsequently aligned in an unrooted clustergram.

Notably, the SH3 domains from Cyk3p and Rvs167p, and a protein fragment containing the two N-terminal domains from Sla1p (Sla1-1/2) exhibit dual specificity for both ligand classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, the specificity map uncovered many specificity profiles that do not cluster with either of the canonical classes. For instance, the SH3 domains of Bem1p, Hof1p, Myo3p, and Myo5p comprise a distinct cluster, which we denote as class III, and are characterized by their preference for poly-proline ligands, without the requirement for flanking charged residues. The SH3 domains of the paralogs Pin3p and Lsb1p exhibit dual specificity, recognizing class II ligands and a ligand set (&#x0002b;XXXPXP) that resembles class I ligands, but with different residue spacings, thus was left unclassified. The SH3 domain of Pex13p also exhibits dual specificity for class II ligands and for a second motif characterized by a positively charged residue located between proline residues, which does not fit any defined class. The specificity profiles for the paralogs Boi1p and Boi2p (PXXXPX&#x0002b;) resemble class II, but with proline spacings that differ from the canonical binding motif, and have also been left unclassified. Finally, as observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Tong1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, the SH3 domain of Fus1p exhibits a unique specificity profile that does not include prolines.</p><p>To compare the intrinsic specificities of yeast SH3 domains, we quantified the specificities using a specificity potential (<italic>SP</italic>) score, which was applied previously to the PDZ domain family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Tonikian1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>SP</italic> value summarizes the specificity observed in each column of a PWM as a numerical value ranging from zero (least specific) to one (most specific; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s012">Table S3</xref>). We had sufficient peptide data (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003e;10) to calculate reliable <italic>SP</italic> scores for 26 distinct specificity profiles.

In an ideal scenario, unique peptides representing the entire proteome of the organism would be spotted onto an array and assayed individually for interactions with a PRM of interest. However, in practice, a filtering step is required to generate an array of manageable size. In a strategy dubbed WISE (whole interactome scanning experiment), natural ligands for PRMs are identified by computationally scanning the proteome for sequence patterns similar to known ligands, and these are tested for interactions using synthetic peptide array (SPOT) technology. Proteome scanning can use regular expressions (REs), which describe discrete text patterns, or PWMs, which describe probabilistic positional frequency-based patterns. Although both methods rely heavily on the quality of the information they are based upon, REs run a higher risk of missing candidate ligands (higher false-negative rate), whereas PWMs often fail to catch strict position-specific rules. Following identification of putative natural ligands by either filtering method, the peptides are tested for interactions by SPOT.</p><p>We used the WISE approach to generate a yeast SH3 domain interaction network independently by creating a set of 15 REs based on SH3 domain specificity profiles identified in this study and previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Tong1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, and searching for matches in the yeast proteome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s023">Text S1</xref>). The stringency of the REs was set very low in order to maximize the number of putative ligands tested on the array. Although this approach potentially identifies a number of false positives, the goal is to capture as many interactions as possible, thus minimizing the number of false negatives. This analysis identified 2,953 peptides within 1,693 proteins (almost one-third of all yeast ORFs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s015">Table S6</xref>).

Subsequently, peptide arrays were screened for binding individually with 26 SH3 domains. In total, we identified 295 peptides that showed a positive signal with at least one SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s016">Table S7</xref>).</p><p>Peptides identified by either PWMs or REs address the ability of a domain to bind to a ligand outside of its protein and cellular context, but the peptides are identified by independent computational approaches with different strengths and weaknesses. To address this, we used the PWMs to define a set of peptides of similar size to the one defined by the REs. Interestingly, this analysis revealed only an approximately 30&#x00025; overlap between the peptide sets defined by REs and PWMs. To examine the PWM-defined peptides experimentally, we tested in the SPOT assay the ten peptides with the highest PWM score for each SH3 domain. Of the 230 PWM high-scoring peptides, 113 were not included in the original WISE interactome, and approximately 55 of these gave a significant SPOT signal with at least one SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s017">Table S8</xref>). The 55 peptides predicted by PWM but missed by RE that yielded a significant SPOT signal can be regarded as false-negative interactions for the RE approach; therefore, the false-negative hit rate for the RE-defined peptides appears to be approximately 20&#x00025;. Notably, of the 230 PWM high-scoring peptides, 69 did not generate a SPOT signal, which suggests that the PWM false-positive rate is on the order of approximately 30&#x00025;.</p><p>The SPOT approach is semiquantitative, so we also examined the correlation between interaction signals and dissociation constants, but we found that, as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Landgraf1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, it was much poorer than that observed with the phage-display score (unpublished data). Thus, although SPOT assays can be used to validate PWM-predicted interactions, further development of the method is required to obtain highly accurate quantitative signals. Taken together, our SPOT analysis of the yeast SH3 interactome yields a weighted graph of more than 5,000 edges, which served as an additional source of semiquantitative information to be integrated into a map of yeast SH3 domain interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Yeast Two-Hybrid Screens</title><p>To complement the phage display and SPOT experiments, we performed large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens.

Only 26 interactions were identified in both screens (10.7&#x00025; or 4.4&#x00025; of the interactions identified by the ORFeome or gDNA screens, respectively). Using the ORFeome screen, we identified an average of 11.0 interactions per SH3 domain, whereas we detected an average of 22.6 interactions per SH3 domain in the gDNA screen. One major reason for the difference in these numbers is that we sequenced approximately 200 positive single colonies from each gDNA library screen in an attempt to saturate the system. Furthermore, although we repeated the ORFeome screening twice, this is not expected to achieve complete saturation according to a recent analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Yu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

To do so, we curated a comprehensive &#x0201c;gold-standard&#x0201d; set of 42 SH3 domain interactions from the literature (see below). Within this gold-standard set, only five were identified by the ORFeome screen, whereas 28 were identified by the gDNA screen.

The first step in the endocytic pathway is the recruitment to the plasma membrane of the coat module proteins, which include clathrin, Sla1p, Pan1p, End3p, and Sla2p. The assembly of the coat module occurs prior to and independent of actin assembly. However, the subsequent movement of the coat proteins into the cell, and subsequent coat disassembly, are dependent upon actin polymerization. One to two minutes following coat module assembly, Las17p (the yeast ortholog of WASP) is recruited, which activates the Arp2/3 complex to promote actin assembly. The SH3 protein Sla1p is thought to inhibit the actin polymerizing function of Las17p. This inhibition appears to be relieved by the recruitment of members of the WASP/Myo complex, including Vrp1p and the SH3 proteins Bbc1p, Myo3p/Myo5p, and Bzz1p. Actin polymerization triggered by the WASP-myosin complex leads to recruitment of the actin module proteins, which include actin, Cap1p, Cap2p, Sac6p, Abp1p (SH3 protein), and the Arp2/3 complex, leading to further actin polymerization. As the vesicle begins its movement into the cell, the scission module, consisting of Rvs161p and the SH3 protein Rvs167p, is recruited.

It has been established that numerous proteins arrive at sites of endocytosis in a choreographed manner, but it is not known how the sequential recruitment, assembly, and functions of endocytic proteins are achieved. Our Bayesian interaction network contains 29 of the 60 or so known yeast endocytosis proteins, including ten that contain SH3 domains. To gain insights into the roles of SH3-mediated interactions in endocytosis, we screened for putative ligands for these ten SH3 domains using our Bayesian scoring algorithm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s022">Table S13</xref>). The interacting proteins were grouped with the respective protein modules described above, and the putative SH3-mediated interactions at each stage of endocytosis were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s022">Table S13</xref>). This analysis uncovered a vast array of putative SH3 domain&#x02013;mediated interactions, with 53 connections among 19 known or putative endocytic proteins, and suggested that interactions are likely to become more prevalent as additional proteins are recruited to the endocytic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction network suggests that the majority of SH3 domain&#x02013;mediated interactions are established 35 to 15 s prior to vesicle internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g006">Figure 6C to 6E</xref>). This timing suggests that SH3 domains play a particularly important role at the stages encompassing assembly of the WASP/Myo module, actin polymerization, membrane invagination, and vesicle scission.</p><fig id="pbio-1000218-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000218.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Yeast SH3 domain interaction network underlying endocytosis.</title><p>SH3 domain&#x02013;mediated interactions predicted by the Bayesian model are shown for endocytosis proteins.

We therefore examined in greater detail the relationships between SH3 domain&#x02013;mediated interactions and protein dynamics during endocytosis. For each protein, we summed Bayesian probability scores (or interaction scores) based on interactions with proteins from within its corresponding module compared to interactions with proteins from external modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s022">Table S13</xref>). This analysis revealed that proteins have the highest total interaction score for interactions occurring within the same module. This was the case for 11 of 13 endocytic proteins for which a suitable Bayesian probability score and dynamic data were available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s022">Table S13</xref>). For instance, the network identified a large number of interactions between members of the WASP/Myo module (Bbc1p, Bzz1p, Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3p, and Myo5p), which arrive following the coat module, 35 to 25 s prior to vesicle internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g006">Figure 6C and 6D</xref>). Summing their Bayesian probability scores across all modules revealed that each of these proteins has the highest combined interaction score for interactions within the WASP/Myo module. This finding provides support for the conclusion that the SH3 domain&#x02013;mediated interactions are required for the assembly of this module, and that interactions between these proteins are established upon their temporal recruitment to the endocytic site.</p><p>Subsequent to the formation of an SH3 domain&#x02013;mediated network within the WASP/Myo module, the network analysis points to the formation of an SH3 domain&#x02013;mediated network within the actin module (e.g., Abp1p, Ark1p, Prk1p, and Sjl2p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Toret1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>), at 25 to 10 s prior to vesicle internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g006">Figure 6D and 6E</xref>). Interestingly, proteins from the actin module also appear likely to engage in many interactions with members of both the WASP/Myo and actin modules, suggesting extensive cross-talk between these two modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, the interaction scores for proteins within the same module were higher than those for proteins in different modules, underscoring the predictive potential of using interaction scores to place endocytic components into their respective modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s022">Table S13</xref>).</p><p>Our network analysis, which incorporates both SH3 domain&#x02013;mediated interactions and dynamics of endocytic proteins, suggests that members from the same endocytic module engage in tighter SH3 domain&#x02013;mediated interactions and have similar spatiotemporal dynamics. This raises the possibility of predicting the dynamics of putative endocytic proteins based on their SH3 domain interaction profile. Thus, an uncharacterized endocytic protein is predicted to be part of the module within which it registered the highest interaction scores. For example, if an uncharacterized protein is implicated as a member of the WASP/Myo module because it has high scores with SH3 domains within the WASP/Myo module, then we predict that its dynamics will follow a similar pattern to those of other proteins in that module. Analogously, an uncharacterized SH3 domain protein would be predicted to be part of the module containing its best-predicted binding partners.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we quantitatively examined the protein dynamics of five uncharacterized endocytosis proteins (Scd5p, Aim21p, Scp1p, Bsp1p, and Lsb3p), each of which had a high SH3 interaction score with at least one of the established endocytic modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s022">Table S13</xref>). We predicted that Scd5p, a protein first identified as a suppressor of defects in cells depleted of clathrin heavy chain (Chc1p) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Nelson1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, arrives with and is part of the late coat module (with Sla1p, and Sla2p, etc., but not with the early coat protein, clathrin) and/or WASP/Myo module. We also predicted that Aim21p, a fungal-specific protein, is a component of the WASP/Myo module, and that Scp1p, a conserved member of the Calponin/transgelin family of actin-associated proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Goodman1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, is part of the actin module.</p><p>Two closely related SH3 domain proteins, Lsb3p and its paralog Lsb4p, had high interaction scores across several modules, most significantly with early (e.g., coat and WASP/Myo) and late (actin) modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s022">Table S13</xref>). Notably, we observed that the score for a particular module did not exceed the median interaction score across all other modules by more than 2-fold. This unique pattern of interactions suggests that Lsb3p and Lsb4p may play a role to cluster and to coordinate the activities of several module components at the site of endocytosis. In addition, Bsp1p, an adapter that links the yeast synaptojanins, Inp52p and Inp53p, to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and participates in actin contractile ring function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Wicky1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, showed a similar interaction profile, and therefore, we speculated that it too might be a cross-module protein together with Lsb3p and Lsb4p.</p><p>To test our predictions in vivo, each protein was C-terminally tagged with GFP and expressed from its endogenous locus in yeast cells. The dynamics of each protein were analyzed individually and in tandem with Abp1p-RFP.

Simultaneous, two-color analysis with Abp1p-RFP, a marker for actin polymerization, revealed that Scd5p-GFP arrives prior to actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). However, Scd5p-GFP patches were immotile throughout their lifetime, like proteins of the WASP/Myo module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). These dynamics establish Scd5p as a component of the WASP/Myo module with similar dynamics to Bzz1p, suggesting that it might participate in late coat formation and/or coordinate this module with the WASP/Myo module. Moreover, Scd5p was recently reported to have a role in phospho-regulation of the endocytic coat complexes and its spatial dynamics may have a role in this essential function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Zeng1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>For Aim21p-GFP, we observed that it is located in immotile patches with a lifetime of 10&#x000b1;1 s, similar to the patch dynamics reported for Bbc1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Kaksonen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Furthermore, Aim21p-GFP arrives when actin begins to polymerize, as revealed by two-color analysis with Abp1p-RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, as predicted, Aim21p localizes as a component of the WASP/Myo module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g006">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000218.s022">Table S13</xref>).</p><p>Scp1p is expected to be part of the actin module as it is predicted to bind the SH3 domain of Abp1p. Indeed, Scp1p-GFP formed patches with a lifetime of 15&#x000b1;2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) and colocalized with Abp1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Kaksonen2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. These patch dynamics are indicative of proteins in the actin module. Scp1p patches had shorter lifetimes than Abp1p. However, Scp1p-GFP exhibited weak fluorescence intensity, which likely accounted for this lifetime decrease. Two-color analysis revealed strong colocalization between Scp1p and Abp1p with the fluorescence intensity of the patches peaking together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7C</xref>; unpublished data).</p><p>As mentioned above, Lsb3p and Lsb4p scored highly across all modules, predicting a long lifetime at the patch. As expected, Lsb3p-GFP patches were long-lived with a lifetime of 36&#x000b1;9 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Lsb3p-GFP patches arrived at the cell cortex as an immotile patch, but showed an initial slow movement into the cell to a depth of about 200 nm. The initial slow movement was then followed by a fast, more randomly directed movement further into the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Two-color simultaneous imaging with Abp1p-RFP revealed that, like Sla1p, Lsb3p-GFP arrived early at endocytic sites but persisted late with the actin module proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Kaksonen2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. These dynamics are consistent with the prediction that the Lsb3p and Lsb4p SH3 domains interact with Sla1p and several actin module proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, Lsb3p and Lsb4p appear to provide continuity in the context of a continuously evolving endocytic protein composition.</p><p>Finally, we analyzed the dynamics of Bsp1p, which our model suggested interacts with proteins in all modules, similar to Lsb3p and Lsb4p. However, in contrast to the Lsb proteins, Bsp1p-GFP patches were short-lived with a lifetime of 13&#x000b1;2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Bsp1p-GFP colocalized well with Abp1p-RFP and displayed an Abp1p-like motility behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Kaksonen2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that Bsp1p functions within the actin module. Two-color analysis revealed that Bsp1p consistently arrived approximately 1 to 2 s after Abp1p-RFP, in a manner similar to descriptions for Cof1p, Ark1p, or Prk1p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Okreglak1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Toret2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

Bsp1p is not well characterized, and further studies are necessary to understand the nature of the discrepancy between its predicted interactions with proteins of multiple modules and its appearance only late in the pathway during the burst of actin assembly.</p><p>Our SH3 domain network contains only approximately half of the 60 proteins implicated in endocytosis and, as underscored by the Bsp1p example, a number of SH3-independent interactions must control endocytosis protein localization. To emphasis this point, we also analyzed the dynamics of yeast twinfilin (Twf1p), a highly conserved actin monomer-sequestering protein involved in regulation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Goode1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, which was not predicted to bind to any SH3 domain.

The patches were initially immotile at the cell surface but subsequently underwent a highly motile phase, after which the patch moved long range into the center of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000218-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), in a manner characteristic of proteins comprising the actin module.</p><p>In summary, SH3 domain interactions are powerful predictors of spatiotemporal localization of yeast SH3 domain proteins.

We have integrated the data from three independent screening techniques (phage display, peptide arrays, and yeast two-hybrid) into a Bayesian model to generate a yeast SH3 domain interaction map.

Our interaction map captures a significant proportion of literature-validated interactions and therefore serves as an accurate reference for additional in-depth studies of yeast SH3 domain biology. Proper interpretation and use of our interaction map requires consideration of additional factors such as cellular concentration, localization, and competition from other SH3 domains to identify physiologically relevant interactions.</p><p>Applying our model to proteins involved in endocytosis revealed that there is a significant connection between the time at which a protein arrives at the endocytic patch and its predicted SH3 domain interactions. This correlation was used to accurately predict the spatiodynamics of several uncharacterized endocytic proteins.

Sla1p appears in the coat module, whereas its predicted interactions are more consistent with it being a component of the WASP/Myo module.

Unlike Sla1p, Bsp1p is less well studied and lacks any obvious homology with other proteins.

Since some interactions are supported by more than one report, this amounts to a total of 41 nonredundant interactions mediated by SH3 domains and supported by at least one experiment. One paper reported a yeast two-hybrid interaction between Las17p and a protein fragment encoding both SH3 domains of Bzz1p. As the SH3 domains were not tested individually for interaction with Las17p, we counted the interaction twice to account for the two SH3 domains, thus resulting in 42 total SH3-mediated interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Soulard1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.

The resulting discrete data were then fed directly into the learning algorithm. In the preprocessing step, the SPOT peptide binding data was discretized into four bins. The discretized data were then used as one feature of the learning algorithm.</p><p>To ensure a reliable set of gold-standard true-positive interactions for efficient machine learning, we used the curated list of 42 bona fide domain&#x02013;peptide interactions for the yeast SH3 domains deposited in the DOMINO database, as described above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000218-Ceol1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. We generated the true-negative set by using the &#x0201c;random with constraints&#x0201d; logic. Specifically, we included only pairs of proteins where protein A is annotated to localize to the cell membrane and where protein B is annotated to localize to the nucleus. Proteins with overlapping annotations were excluded as well. Although the first member of each gold-standard negative set was chosen to be one of the proteins containing SH3 domains, its interacting partner was under no such constraint. Since the proportion of real interactions is very low in the space of possible interactions, one can use random domain&#x02013;ligand pairs to get a set likely to contain only negatives. However, we improved upon this set by filtering out only those pairs that do not occur in known interaction databases and are annotated to occur in nonadjacent cellular compartments. Specifically, we included only pairs of proteins where protein A is annotated to localize to the cell membrane and where protein B is annotated to localize to the nucleus. Proteins with overlapping annotations were excluded as well.</p><p>Performance of each data source was evaluated using the AUC (area under the curve) in the ROC curve. This corresponds to an evaluation of how well each data source corresponds to the gold-standard data. Finally, the performance of the Bayesian data integration was assessed using the AUC in a ROC curve analysis with 10-fold cross-validation. Ten-fold cross-validation corresponds to splitting the gold standard into a training (9/10) and a testing (1/10) set ten times in a rotating fashion and evaluating its accuracy for each split.

A brief description of the experimental techniques listed is provided as follows: 1) Overlay assay: the SH3 domain protein is run on SDS gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane is then probed with the interactor (or vice versa); 2) Spot synthesis overlay: peptides are chemically synthesized on array format, and the membrane is probed with GST-SH3 fusion protein; 3) Phage-display/two-hybrid: random nonapeptides are selected with phage display and compared with yeast two-hybrid analysis to map the peptide; 4) Alanine scanning: each amino acid of the binding peptide is substituted with Ala and the effect of the mutation on SH3 binding is analyzed; 5) Mutagenesis analysis: each amino acid of the binding peptide is mutated with any other amino acid and the effects of the mutation on SH3 binding are analyzed; 6) Co-IP: the SH3 domain is immunoprecipitated and the presence of interactors in the complex is revealed by western blot analysis with specific antibodies; and 7) Affinity coprecipitation: the SH3 domain is precipitated with an affinity column (GST column) and the presence of interactors in the complex is revealed in Western blot analysis with specific antibodies.</p><p>(0.09 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000218.s020.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000218.s021"><label>Table S12</label><caption><p><bold>Predicted yeast SH3 domain interactions based on Bayesian networks.</bold> The yeast proteome was scanned for putative SH3 domain interactions based on our Bayesian model.

The proteins are separated into their known endocytic modules. For each protein, the total predicted SH3-mediated interaction score (taken by summing all associated Bayesian probability scores) for every endocytic module (abbreviations for the respective modules are as follows: C, coat; W/M, WASP/Myo; S, scission; A, actin) is calculated. The time frame represents the point at which the protein appears (START) and is no longer observed (END) during endocytosis, with the lifetime taken as the difference between the two time points. Each protein was predicted to be part of the module for which it obtained the highest interaction score (highlighted in yellow). Cross-module proteins were considered to be proteins with interaction scores for a particular module that did not exceed the median interaction score across all modules by more than 2-fold. We could not predict the localization of Rvs167p because its corresponding scission module is only comprised of two proteins, itself and Rvs161p, which is not predicted to bind to any SH3 domain proteins required during endocytosis. To reduce the effect of weak interactions, predictions were only made for proteins that had module interactions scores of five and higher. Based on this criterion, the modular localization of some proteins could not be predicted (N/A).</p><p>(0.03 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000218.s022.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000218.s023"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p><bold>Supporting </bold><bold>Materials and Methods</bold><bold>.</bold></p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000218.s023.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Hugo Y.
