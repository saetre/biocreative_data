Introduction</title><p><italic>&#x003b3;</italic><italic>&#x003b4;</italic> T cells have a nonredundant role in regulating immune homeostasis. In comparison to <italic>&#x003b1;&#x003b2;</italic> T cells, they lack receptor diversity yet demonstrate remarkable plasticity in response to both infectious and noninfectious stimuli. As an extension of their dichotomous nature, <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells have been held liable for both instigating over-zealous immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] as well as reigning in inflammation by controlling activated macrophages and promoting wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In humans, the main subset of peripheral blood <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells usually comprises between 1 and 5% of circulating T cells and bears the canonical V<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>9V<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>2 T cell receptor. These V<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>9V<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>2 T cells are unique to primates, and they respond to endogenous and exogenous stress-induced molecules that are nonpeptidic in nature and preclude the requirement for processing or presentation by classical MHC molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Isopentylpyrophosphate (IPP) is the prototypical phosphoantigen recognized by V<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>9V<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>2 T cells that was first isolated from lysates of mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It was later determined to be a metabolite in the mevalonate pathway in all eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells, including <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. During the initial phase of infection with low bacterial inocula of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, V<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>9V<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>2 T cells are activated by endogenous mevalonate metabolites through the accumulation and dephosphorylation of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, primates have evolved the ability to readily respond to bacterial infection as well as endogenous damage by sensing the dysregulation of the mevalonate pathway, which may be considered a stress-associated &#x0201c;alarmin&#x0201d; for these primordial lymphocytes.</p><p>We have shown that stimulating the small pool of human <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells present in PBMC with IPP markedly augmented the early proinflammatory response to Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 (TSST-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. TSST-1 is a staphylococcal superantigen that exerts a potent inflammatory response by bridging V<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2 specific <italic>&#x003b1;&#x003b2;</italic> T cell receptors with conserved regions of the MHC class II molecules of antigen presenting cells (APCs) outside the peptide-binding groove [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Ferry et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] demonstrated the presence of specific V<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> T cell signatures of various superantigenic toxins, including TSST-1, in the blood of patients with staphylococcal TSS. We previously demonstrated that IPP-activated <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells augment the levels of proinflammatory cytokines within the first 6 hours post-TSST-1 treatment, thereby changing the kinetics and magnitude of the immune response to the superantigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We have also shown that High Mobility Group Box Protein-1 (HMGB-1) is released following TSST-1 stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. HMGB-1 is a highly conserved nonhistone DNA-binding protein found in virtually all nucleated cells and is regarded as being the late mediator of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Activated monocytes secrete HMGB-1 after exposure to endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and it is detectable in the serum of septic patients within 24 hours. Importantly, neutralizing the effects of HMGB-1 at this late time point, either by anti-HMGB-1 antibodies or antagonists, rescued mice from sepsis-induced mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In contrast to endotoxin, which activates only macrophages to secrete HMGB-1, both T cells and macrophages participate in the nuclear translocation and subsequent release of HMGB-1 into the extracellular environment following TSST-1 stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. </p><p>The first aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence exerted by IPP-primed V<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>9V<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>2 T cells on the change in costimulatory molecule expression that could explain their ability to enhance the immune response to TSST-1.

IPP-Primed <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T Cells Induce an Early Upregulation of CD40 following TSST-1 Stimulation</title><p>Following overnight treatment with IPP, CD40 expression was upregulated in comparison to those that were untreated (IPP + TSST-1 versus TSST-1 alone; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The elevated CD40 expression was observed up to 6 hours postsuperantigen stimulation, after which time CD40 was downregulated or internalized. We previously demonstrated that CD40L (CD154) is expressed on T cells within 3 hours following exposure to TSST-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], therefore, the down-regulation of CD40 beyond 6 hours is likely a consequence of CD40 binding to CD40L on TSST-1-activated T cells. We verified that up-regulation of CD40 expression in populations exposed to IPP was solely attributed to the presence of activated <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells, since removal of <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells completely abrogated the effect of IPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The effect of IPP-activated <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells over time on CD40 expression following TSST-1 stimulation was further verified using 2-way ANOVA (IPP x time interaction, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05).

Extracellular cell-surface expressed HMGB-1 has been called amphoterin to differentiate it from intracellular HMGB-1 found in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

T cells, which are nonadherent cells in suspension (stained in red), do not express HMGB-1 on the surface in this manner. Adherent monocytes bearing surface expressed HMGB-1 subsequently released it following TSST-1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>; top right panel). Overnight treatment with IPP alone also led to a change in extracellular HMGB-1 expression in PBMC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>; bottom left panel). There was an observable modification on both the morphological appearance of macrophages as well as the distribution of HMGB-1 around the perimeter, which became less concentrated in vesicle-like foci and more dispersed. Overnight incubation of PBMCs with IPP followed by TSST-1 stimulation resulted in significantly more HMGB-1 being released into the extracellular environment compared to TSST-1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>, upper and lower right panel).

The actual secretion of HMGB-1 into the extracellular milieu from TSST-1 stimulated PBMC was further verified by Western blot of cell culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>), which again substantiated that IPP pretreatment followed by TSST-1 stimulation led to its greater release than PBMC stimulated with TSST-1 without IPP-activation of <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells (IPP + TSST-1 versus TSST-1 alone, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05, paired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Overnight treatment with IPP resulted in a notable up-regulation of CD40 on monocytes in the presence of <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells. We previously demonstrated that impeding the CD40-CD40L interaction with CD40 monoclonal antibodies (but not the CD86 or CD80 interaction) completely blocks TSST-1-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The early up-regulation of CD40 on monocytes by IPP-primed <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells in the current study provides a basis for the prior observation that TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> levels increased 3-to 4-fold during the early phase of the immune response to TSST-1 in PBMC containing activated <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This early augmentation was also abrogated after depletion of <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This study also demonstrates that the exaggerated response to TSST-1 by activated <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells is through the direct modulation of the responsiveness of monocytes and not <italic>&#x003b1;&#x003b2;</italic> T cells since we found that the upregulation of CD25 on <italic>&#x003b1;&#x003b2;</italic> T cells was affected only by stimulation with TSST-1 and not IPP. The regulation of CD40 expression by activated <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells appears to parallel the mechanism of linking innate to adaptive immunity by glycolipid responsive V<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>14 + NK T cells stimulated with <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-galactosylceramide. It was found that the rapid release of TNF<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IFN<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> to ovalalbumin, acquisition of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity, and maturation of dendritic cells were all dependent on the CD40-CD40L interaction induced by the priming of V<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>14+ NK T cells by <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-galactosylceramide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast to CD40, CD86 expression was found to be reduced in PBMC treated with IPP overnight. This monocytic phenotype may be reflective of a state described as &#x0201c;immature dendritic cells&#x0201d; in which cycling of the HLA-DR molecule is rapid and levels of CD86 are relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Taken together, these studies suggest that innate T lymphocytes responsive to specific &#x0201c;alarmins&#x0201d; influence the ability of APC to effectively stimulate cells of adaptive immunity, and the CD40-CD40L interaction likely plays a pivotal role in this process. This scenario is in agreement with recent demonstrations that <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells induce early dendritic cell maturation and share an intimate relationship with APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Eberl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] further provided evidence that human <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells are activated by microbial mevalonate metabolites and interact with monocytes and local macrophages to drive the acute inflammation in bacterial infections. Thus, <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells provide a direct link between innate and adaptive immunity. It should be noted, however, that these studies primarily used either expanded <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cell lines or a large number of purified <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells in coculture conditions. The conditions used in this study may be more reflective of the physiological state in which a small number of <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells present in peripheral blood would be able to immediately respond to their stress-associated antigens, such as IPP. This early event would preclude the possibility of any expansion of <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells, but it would lead to the efficient priming of APC.</p><p>This study also provides the first demonstration that IPP-primed human peripheral blood <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells influence the secretion of HMGB-1 by macrophages. This finding is similar to the work by Semino et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] who demonstrated that NK cells reciprocally activate autologous dendritic cells, and this interaction was also mediated through the secretion of HMGB-1. It is feasible that the enhanced HMGB-1 secretion observed in cells containing activated <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells could be in response to an increase in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] due to the fact that IPP-stimulated <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells are particularly susceptible to activation-induced cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] as a self-limiting precaution. During apoptosis, HMGB-1 is normally tightly bound to nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] as opposed to necrosis where HMGB-1 is released from cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, work by Urbonaviciute et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] showed that biologically active HMGB-1 may also be released from apoptotic cells. One of the main ligands for extracellular HMGB-1 is the receptor for advanced glycation end (RAGE) products, a member of the Ig superfamily. The expression of RAGE increases following activation on both dendritic cells and antigen stimulated T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The release of HMGB-1 and its subsequent binding to RAGE is required for the clonal expansion, survival, and functional polarization of naive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. </p><p>Both dendritic cell maturation and Th1 polarization are events that have been attributed to the activity of <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells and HMGB-1, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our findings connect these two previously unrelated concepts and brings forth the suggestion that <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells mediate this effect and link innate and adaptive immunity by influencing the early upregulation of CD40 expression and release of HMGB-1 from APC, thereby priming the immune response to subsequent stimuli.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported in part by a Grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to A.W.Chow (MT-7630), and by the
