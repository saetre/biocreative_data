The mating response of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is mediated by a GPCR signaling system and this model organism has been used extensively in the past to study mammalian GPCR function. We show here that human Frizzled receptors (Fz1 and Fz2) can be properly targeted to the yeast plasma membrane, and that they stimulate the yeast mating pathway in the absence of added Wnt ligands, as evidenced by cell cycle arrest in G1 and reporter gene expression dependent on the mating pathway-activated <italic>FUS1</italic> gene. Introducing intracellular portions of Frizzled receptors into the Ste2p backbone resulted in the generation of constitutively active receptor chimeras that retained mating factor responsiveness. Introducing intracellular portions of Ste2p into the Frizzled receptor backbone was found to strongly enhance mating pathway activation as compared to the native Frizzleds, likely by facilitating interaction with the yeast G&#x003b1; protein Gpa1p. Furthermore, we show reversibility of the highly penetrant G1-phase arrests exerted by the receptor chimeras by deletion of the mating pathway effector <italic>FAR1</italic>. Our data demonstrate that Frizzled receptors can functionally replace mating factor receptors in yeast and offer an experimental system to study modulators of Frizzled receptors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian Wnt proteins are secreted lipid-modified signaling molecules which control aspects of embryonic development.

With regard to signal transduction, the majority of literature has dealt with the so called canonical signaling pathway which is quite divergent from classical GPCR signaling. In the canonical pathway, the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (Dv1) inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3-&#x003b2; (GSK3&#x003b2;) leading to stabilization and nuclear translocation of the &#x003b2;-catenin protein and transcription of specific response genes (for a recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Nelson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, there is also evidence that Frizzled receptors can exert functions independently of &#x003b2;-catenin. These phenomena were called &#x02018;noncanonical&#x02019; Wnt-Fz signaling and common features with classical GPCR signal transduction were described (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Veeman1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Wang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>). This includes sensitivity of Wnt-stimulated calcium flux and other signaling events to pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of G proteins of the G<sub>i</sub>-class. Furthermore, Wnt-11-stimulated Rho GTPase activity was shown to depend on G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; signaling. Frizzled receptors were also described to couple to the visual G protein transducin (G<sub>t</sub>). Dishevelled was found to recruit &#x003b2;-arrestin, a known modulator of GPCR function, to regulate Wnt5A/Fz4 signaling in human cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Chen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, a direct role of Frizzled receptors as GDP-GTP exchange factors for G&#x003b1; proteins has not yet been demonstrated.</p><p>Key principles of GPCR signaling have been unraveled using yeast as a model system. This includes the genetic demonstration of signaling through G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; proteins, as well as the identification of the first member of the regulator-of-G protein-signaling (RGS) class of G&#x003b1; GTPase activators, termed Sst2p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Dohlman1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

When haploid cells of mating type a and &#x003b1; meet, they extend a projection toward the other (&#x0201c;shmoo&#x0201d;), stop their cell cycle, start transcription of mating genes, and finally fuse to form a diploid cell. The mating process involves specific signaling proteins such as secreted pheromones (<bold>a</bold> and &#x003b1;-factor), GPCR-class pheromone receptors (Ste2p and Ste3p), a heterotrimeric G protein (G&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;), a G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; - activated MAP kinase cascade leading to expression of pheromone-responsive genes, and growth arrest via CDK-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000954-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0000954-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000954.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the GPCR-controlled mating pathway in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</title><p>Shown is the situation for mating type a haploid yeast cells.

Overexpression of Frizzled receptors leads to increased accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, a feature of the activated mating pathway, and activation of a specific mating pathway reporter. We devised specific receptor chimeras between Frizzleds and the yeast &#x003b1;-factor receptor Ste2p for pharmacological studies with Wnt-ligands and &#x003b1;-factor pheromone, and identify chimeras mediating highly penetrant G1-phase arrests.

We first explored the feasibility to express human Fz1 in a yeast wildtype strain by a related approach: We took advantage of the nutritional reporter Ura3p fused to the C-terminus of Fz1 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000954-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. The <italic>URA3</italic> gene encodes orotidine-5&#x02032;-phosphate decarboxylase which functions in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines in the cytosol. Used as a fusion tag it provides information on the fate of the tagged protein. Absence of growth on minimal media lacking uracil indicates insufficient cytosolic Ura3p levels, which may result from improper protein synthesis or transport. Yeast expressing our initial Fz1-Ura3p construct failed to grow in the absence of uracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000954-g002">Fig. 2A, top</xref>), and we reasoned that this might be the result of improper targeting of the protein to the yeast secretory pathway. To circumvent potential problems with the N-terminal sorting information of the mammalian Fz1, we devised a chimeric receptor consisting of human Fz1 with the amino acids N-terminal to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) replaced with the extracellular N-terminal tail from the yeast &#x003b1;-factor receptor Ste2p (termed signal sequence &#x0201c;s&#x0201d; in the following).

Therefore, we were interested to investigate the morphological changes of a yeast wildtype strain following galactose-induction of s-Fz1, Ste2-Fz1(i) or s-Fz1-Ste2(i) receptor expression in liquid culture. For this purpose, we first monitored the relative growth rates of the strains grown in repressing or inducing medium. The result was consistent with the plate growth assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000954-g003">Fig. 3</xref>): In the absence of receptor expression the three strains grew comparably to the empty-vector control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000954-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). When switched to inducing medium, following a lag-phase due to adaptation, the strains grew differentially with the s-Fz1 strain showing significant growth retardation, and the strains carrying the chimeric receptors showing almost complete growth arrest. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000954-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>). Consistently with a differential ability of the three receptor constructs to induce G1 arrest, we determined significantly lowered budding indices down to &#x0223c;0.4 for the s-Fz1 strain, &#x0223c;0.3 for Ste2-Fz1(i) and &#x0223c;0.2 for s-Fz1-Ste2(i) after 24 hours grown in the inducing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000954-g009">Fig. 9C</xref>). Moreover, while the s-Fz1 expressing strain was able to recover from the G1 arrest after 24 hours, as indicated by an increased budding index up to &#x0223c;0.6, the receptor chimeras appeared to be permanently arrested.

However, commonly used functional tests for GPCRs in mammalian cells (e.g. modulation of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C activities) could not be applied successfully to Frizzled receptors. In this work, we have attempted to use yeast as a model organism to study Frizzled function. We show that overexpressed human Frizzled 1 and Frizzled 2 receptors partially induce G1 cell cycle arrest in wildtype yeast cells, a feature of the activated mating pathway, and significant P<italic><sub>FUS1</sub></italic>-dependent reporter gene induction.</p><p>Specific receptor chimeras between Fz1/2 and the yeast &#x003b1;-factor receptor Ste2p showed that the predicted intracellular portions of Fz1/2 are sufficient to signal to the mating pathway if incorporated into Ste2p, as indicated by a highly penetrant G1 cell cycle arrest, and P<italic><sub>FUS1</sub></italic>-reporter activity. Moreover, the effect on growth arrest and ability to induce P<italic><sub>FUS1</sub></italic>-reporter activity seen for Ste2-Fz1(i) and Ste2-Fz2(i) were almost indistinguishable, which is in line with the proposed receptor model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000954-g006">Fig. 6</xref>): Despite their different modes of signaling reported in higher eukaryotes (canonical vs. non-canonical; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Gazit1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Zilberberg1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Liu3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Slusarski1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Ahumada1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, respectively), the predicted intracellular portions of Fz1 and Fz2 differ by only three amino acids.

Different reasons may account for this result. First, the basal activities observed for both receptor classes were close to the maximal response observed for the &#x003b1;-factor-activated native Ste2 receptor, hence the response may be already saturated. On the other hand we observed &#x003b1;-factor responsiveness of the Ste2-Fz1/2(i) receptor constructs despite similar basal activity, albeit at significantly lower potency as compared to native Ste2p. More importantly, at least for the canonical Frizzled 1, the LRP5/6 co-receptors appear crucial for Wnt ligand binding and signaling in mammalian cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Nelson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>). Yeast does not express known co-receptors of this type, such molecules may have to be supplemented in the heterologous yeast system as well.

Consequently, the lipid-modified Wnt-ligands (approximately 40 kDa) may not pass through the yeast cell wall to reach the receptors. A possible solution to this problem may be the use of an autocrine Wnt-Fz activation system, similarly as described for the autocrine activation of the C5a receptor through an &#x003b1;-factor prepro/C5a ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Baranski1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Among the four mammalian G&#x003b1; - subfamilies the G<sub>i</sub>-subfamily shares the closest sequence similarity with yeast Gpa1p. This subfamily encompasses G<sub>o</sub> and G<sub>t</sub>, which have been proposed previously to be involved in Frizzled 1 and Frizzled 2 signaling, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Gazit1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Zilberberg1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Liu3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Slusarski1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000954-Ahumada1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our report demonstrates that human Frizzled receptors can signal to the mating pathway in yeast, and this coupling can be made particulary efficient by introducing intracellular sequence elements of the Ste2 mating factor receptor into the Frizzled backbone.

Cells were disrupted by vortexing at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes following addition of acid-washed glass beads (0.45 mm diameter). The crude protein extract was cleared by centrifugation at 3000&#x000d7;g for 5 minutes. The protein concentration was determined using the Biorad protein assay. 20 &#x000b5;g extract were electrophoresed using a 4&#x02013;12&#x00025; gradient NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel system (Invitrogen). The proteins were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-c-myc detection using a monoclonal antibody from Roche (clone 9E10) was performed either through enhanced chemiluminescence (Biorad Immun-Star HRP substrate kit; and Hyperfilm from Amersham Biosciences) or chromogenic detection (Invitrogen Western Breeze kit). As loading control, a rabbit anti-Kss1p polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) was used at 1&#x02236;200 dilution, and detected using the Invitrogen Western Breeze kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>Microscopic inspections of agarose-embedded galactose-induced s-Fz1-GFP, Ste2-Fz1(i)-GFP or s-Fz1-Ste2(i)-GFP expressing yeast strain MH272-1da were performed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000954.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000954.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dres.
