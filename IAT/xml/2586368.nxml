Nightshade (Solanaceae) species are models for a widespread, yet poorly understood, program of eudicot growth, where short side branches are initiated upon floral termination. This &#x0201c;sympodial&#x0201d; program produces the few-flowered tomato inflorescence, but the classical mutants <italic>compound inflorescence</italic> (<italic>s</italic>) and <italic>anantha</italic> (<italic>an</italic>) are highly branched, and <italic>s</italic> bears hundreds of flowers. Here we show that <italic>S</italic> and <italic>AN</italic>, which encode a homeobox transcription factor and an F-box protein, respectively, control inflorescence architecture by promoting successive stages in the progression of an inflorescence meristem to floral specification. <italic>S</italic> and <italic>AN</italic> are sequentially expressed during this gradual phase transition, and the loss of either gene delays flower formation, resulting in additional branching. Independently arisen alleles of <italic>s</italic> account for inflorescence variation among domesticated tomatoes, and <italic>an</italic> stimulates branching in pepper plants that normally have solitary flowers. Our results suggest that variation of Solanaceae inflorescences is modulated through temporal changes in the acquisition of floral fate, providing a flexible evolutionary mechanism to elaborate sympodial inflorescence shoots.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Among the most distinguishing features of plants are the flower-bearing shoots, called inflorescences. Despite a solid understanding of flower development, the molecular mechanisms that control inflorescence architecture remain obscure. We have explored this question in tomato, where mutations in two genes, <italic>ANANTHA</italic> (<italic>AN</italic>) and <italic>COMPOUND INFLORESCENCE</italic> (<italic>S</italic>), transform the well-known tomato &#x0201c;vine&#x0201d; into a highly branched structure with hundreds of flowers. We find that <italic>AN</italic> encodes an F-box protein ortholog of a gene called <italic>UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS</italic> that controls the identity of floral organs (petals, sepals, and so on), whereas <italic>S</italic> encodes a transcription factor related to a gene called <italic>WUSCHEL HOMEOBOX 9</italic> that is involved in patterning the embryo within the plant seed. (F-box proteins are known for marking other proteins for degradation, but they can also function in hormone regulation and transcriptional activation) Interestingly, these genes have little or no effect on branching in inflorescences that grow continuously (so-called &#x0201c;indeterminate&#x0201d; shoots), as in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. However, we find that transient sequential expression of <italic>S</italic> followed by <italic>AN</italic> promotes branch termination and flower formation in plants where meristem growth ends with inflorescence and flower production (&#x0201c;determinate&#x0201d; shoots). We show that mutant alleles of <italic>s</italic> dramatically increase branch and flower number and have probably been selected for by breeders during modern cultivation. Moreover, the single-flower inflorescence of pepper (a species related to tomato, within the same Solanaceae family) can be converted to a compound inflorescence upon mutating its <italic>AN</italic> ortholog. Our results suggest a new developmental mechanism whereby inflorescence elaboration can be controlled through temporal regulation of floral fate.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Plant flower production is largely determined by the number of inflorescences, the branches produced on flower stems.

To address this question, we sequenced the coding region of all 22 lines and un-branched controls and found that all were identical except CC5721. Interestingly, this line carried four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were shared with at least one un-branched variety, indicating that the <italic>s</italic> mutation in CC5721 may have arisen independently from a genetically distinct progenitor line (GenBank accessions FJ190665, FJ190666, and FJ190667). Two pieces of evidence lend support to this claim. Firstly, the four SNPs were distributed close (all within 1,000 bp) to the <italic>s</italic> lesion. Secondly, we sequenced a short segment of DNA from the tightly linked bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) 298N3 and found that CC5721 had six SNPs and a 9&#x02013;bp insertion-deletion (indel) that distinguished it from the other 21 domesticated types carrying <italic>s-classic</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060288-g003">Figure 3</xref>b) (GenBank accessions FJ215691 and FJ215692). Still, in the absence of a geographic distribution of haplotypes, we cannot exclude a remote possibility that CC5721 arose as a result of an intra-genic recombination between <italic>s-classic</italic> and an unbranched variety. Regardless, at least three independently arisen alleles of <italic>s</italic> (<italic>s-classic</italic>, <italic>s-multiflora</italic>, and Rose Quartz Multiflora) are responsible for a major portion of the diversity in tomato inflorescence architecture.</p><fig id="pbio-0060288-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Inflorescence Variation in Domesticated Tomatoes Is Due To Independently Arisen Alleles of <italic>s</italic></title><p>The <italic>s-classic</italic> allele was first described 100 years ago as a highly branched variety called &#x0201c;Wonder of Italy,&#x0201d; and garden varieties resembling <italic>s</italic> remain popular for their aesthetic value and prolific fruit production &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060288-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

Initial expression of <italic>AN</italic> in <italic>s</italic> mutants was delayed, and subsequently detected in only a small subset of SIMs compared to wild-type. In those meristems expressing <italic>AN</italic>, the signal was deeper and more intense than normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060288-g005">Figure 5</xref>H). In situ hybridization from older inflorescences revealed some meristems lacking <italic>S</italic> and <italic>AN</italic> activity altogether, which we verified by whole-mount in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060288-g005">Figure 5</xref>H and unpublished data) This indicates that different meristems are at different phases of ISU maturation, and may also reflect the frequent observation of modified leaves or bracts in older <italic>an</italic> inflorescences if some meristems retain a more vegetative state. Taken together, these expression patterns support a mechanism where <italic>S</italic> and <italic>AN</italic> promote successive stages in the progression of an inflorescence meristem to floral specification through sequential transient activities that gradually promote maturation of SIMs (expressing <italic>S</italic>) to early FMs (expressing <italic>AN</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060288-g005">Figure 5</xref>I). Loss of either gene provides SIMs with an extended period of indeterminacy that facilitates ISU elaboration according to an underlying program of sympodial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060288-g005">Figure 5</xref>J). Furthermore, the observation that <italic>S</italic> expression is maintained in <italic>an</italic> mutants and vice-versa, and that their expression is restricted to temporally distinct domains, supports the notion that these genes have separate but overlapping functions in the maturation of individual ISUs, consistent with the enhancement of weak <italic>an</italic> alleles by <italic>s</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060288-sg005">Figure S5</xref>)<italic>.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>A Branched Inflorescence Is Based on the Gradual Transition of an Inflorescence Meristem to a Floral Meristem</title><p>The expression patterns of <italic>S</italic> and <italic>AN</italic> along with their mutant phenotypes lead to a model in which temporal differences in the maturation of a SIM to an FM can regulate the duration of sympodial inflorescence branching. In other words, a slower transition enables more inflorescence branching and vice-versa. This suggests that the SIM phase and the early FM phase of a single flower can each provide a developmental window in which a compound inflorescence can form. We tested this hypothesis genetically by taking advantage of mutants of <italic>single flower truss</italic> (the tomato ortholog of <italic>FT</italic>, which is a major component of florigen), whose inflorescences are indeterminate vegetative shoots with single flowers separated in space by leaves &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060288-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060288-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).
