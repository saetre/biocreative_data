We established a detection system in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to investigate the impact of sequence constraints on the usage of the homology based DSB repair via single strand annealing (SSA), which leads to recombination between direct repeats with concomitant loss of one repeat copy. First of all, we find the SSA frequency to be inversely proportional to the spacer length between the repeats, for spacers up to 2.4 kb in length. We further show that SSA between divergent repeats (hom<underline>e</underline>ologous SSA) is suppressed in cell cultures and <italic>in vivo</italic> in a sensitive manner, recognizing sequence divergences smaller than 0.5%. Finally, we demonstrate that the suppression of homeologous SSA depends on the Bloom helicase (Blm), encoded by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>mus309</italic>. Suppression of homeologous recombination is a novel function of Blm in ensuring genomic integrity, not described to date in mammalian systems. Unexpectedly, distinct from its function in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the mismatch repair factor Msh2 encoded by <italic>spel1</italic> does not suppress homeologous SSA in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA double strand breaks (DSB) can be repaired in two fundamentally different ways, either via mechanisms involving homologous recombination, or without the use of extensive homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Single strand annealing (SSA) is a mechanism based on homologous recombination. It can be used for repair if the DSB occurs between repeated sequences that have the same orientation (direct repeats). The repeats recombine with each other, whereby one repeat and the sequence between the repeats is lost.</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), the efficiency of homologous recombination was shown to depend on the length of uninterrupted sequence identity, as well as on the percentage of sequence identity within the region of homology. It was suggested that the strict homology requirement serves to avoid ectopic (nonallelic) recombination between related but nonidentical sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Based on this line of reasoning it was proposed that diverged introns may help to maintain the integrity of duplicated genes. According to this hypothesis, fast-evolving introns interrupt the homology between otherwise conserved paralogs, thereby inhibiting ectopic homologous recombination between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Recombination between similar, nonidentical sequences is termed hom<underline>e</underline>ologous recombination, to distinguish from homologous recombination between perfectly matching sequences. In several species the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway was shown to be involved in the suppression of homeologous recombination. In <italic>E. coli</italic> the MMR components MutL, MutS and MutH suppress interspecies recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the MutS homologs Msh2 and Msh3 prevent homeologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and Msh2 and Msh6 were shown to suppress homeologous SSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In murine cells mutant for <italic>msh2</italic>, the frequency of homeologous, intrachromosomal recombination and the gene targeting frequency with non-isogenic constructs is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Besides the MMR components, RecQ helicases also contribute to genomic stability. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, RecQ prevents illegitimate, ectopic recombination between short stretches of identical sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> the sole RecQ homolog, Sgs1, suppresses homeologous recombination, notably spontaneously occurring, chromosomal translocations between related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> the RecQ helicase system is more sophisticated, consisting of three paralogs (RecQ4, RecQ5 and Blm), similar to the situation in mammals with five RecQ members. Drosophila Blm was shown to partially rescue the sensitivity of <italic>sgs1</italic> mutant strains to a DNA alkylating agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Loss of Blm causes sterility in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the sperm show high frequencies of chromosome nondisjunction and chromosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). <italic>Drosophila blm</italic> mutants are also impaired in DNA synthesis during homologous repair (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In a system setup that allows the detection of different modes of DNA repair, homologous repair from the homologous chromosome (HR-h) was found to be decreased in <italic>blm</italic> mutants, while SSA frequency increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>blm</italic> mutants are more prone to crossing over, deletions of flanking sequences and template disruption during DSB repair (DSBR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Mice and humans mutant for <italic>blm</italic> exhibit enhanced sister chromatid exchange (SCE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and murine cell lines deficient for <italic>blm</italic> exhibit chromosomal instability (CIN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>A recent model summarizes the complex role of Blm in HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). It postulates that Blm displays both pro- and anti-recombination activities. On the one hand it removes Rad51 from the single stranded 3&#x02032; overhang or disrupts the already formed D-loop, thereby inhibiting HR at an early stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). On the other hand Blm would also promote HR by unwinding the DNA double helix in front of the D-loop in order to allow for DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>); at a late stage it disrupts the D-loop during HR to facilitate DNA repair via synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and it also dissolves double Holliday junctions (DHJ) during DSBR, thereby suppressing crossing over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>Here we have tested SSA frequencies in the fruitfly <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, using a reporter system with two tandemly arranged genes and a rare-cutting restriction enzyme site in between. After intracellular cleavage, SSA (consisting of resection of DNA ends, annealing of remaining single strands and repair of gaps/protruding strands) results in the expression of a green fluorescent protein. We find that the shorter the spacer between the direct repeats and the more perfect their sequences are matching, the higher the SSA frequency. SSA is thus under tight control in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and highly sensitive to sequence divergence and distance between direct repeats. Besides the proposed functions of Bloom helicase in the repair of DSBs mentioned above, we found a novel role for Blm in the inhibition of homeologous recombination: it suppresses SSA between divergent sequences. This suggests an additional role for Blm in the maintenance of genomic integrity. In contrast to results in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>spel1</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the mismatch repair gene <italic>MSH2</italic>, did not show any involvement in the suppression of homeologous SSA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid sequences</title><p>All plasmids that contain tester constructs were generated using standard cloning procedures, and corresponding sequences are available on request.

In order to determine parameters that influence the frequency of SSA, we developed an SSA detection system in which different parameters can be modified. The tester construct contains the 18-bp cleavage site for the rare cutting endonuclease I-SceI, which allows for the induction of a DSB, producing a staggered cut with a 4 bp 3&#x02032; overhang. A first copy of the metallothionein B gene (<italic>mtnB</italic>), including the regulatory enhancer/promoter DNA, is located upstream of this cleavage site. A second <italic>mtnB</italic> copy, without enhancer and promoter but fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), is downstream of the cleavage site. Upon SSA of these two <italic>mtnB</italic> copies, expression of the MtnB-EGFP fusion protein is inducible via the <italic>mtnB</italic> enhancer/promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). We first analyzed SSA frequencies in a transient transfection assay in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Plasmids containing the tester constructs were cotransfected with a second plasmid expressing I-SceI under the actin promoter. Expression of MtnB-EGFP was induced by CuSO<sub>4</sub> addition to the culture medium, and positive cells were detected by flow cytometry. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of DNA constructs for SSA detection. <bold>(A)</bold> One of the two direct repeats, the one upstream of the I-SceI endonuclease cleavage site, is under the control of the <italic>mtnB</italic> enhancer/promoter. The coding region of the downstream repeat, lacking regulatory sequences for transcription, is fused in-frame to the <italic>EGFP</italic> cDNA. Induction of transcription does not lead to expression of EGFP protein, unless the DSB, generated by the endonuclease I-SceI, is repaired via SSA of the flanking metallothionein copies. <bold>(B)</bold> All constructs contain an I-SceI endonuclease recognition site (I-SceI), which is flanked by genomic (gen) or cDNA copies of <italic>mtnB</italic>. The length of sequence identity between tandem duplicates is indicated by blue bars and numbers, which represent nucleotide numbers. The longest stretch of sequence identity is 259 nt in the construct containing two genomic <italic>mtnB</italic> copies (MtnBgen-gen). This identity is disturbed in several constructs either by a silent point mutation (MtnBgen*-gen, MtnBcDNA-cDNA*) or the absence of the intron (MtnBcDNA-gen, MtnBgen-cDNA).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn793f1"/></fig></p><p>We measured SSA frequency in a construct with two identical genomic copies (259 bp) of <italic>mtnB</italic> (MtnBgen-gen) and compared it with two further constructs: one harboring a point mutation in the intron of the first <italic>mtnB</italic> copy (MtnBgen*-gen), and the other containing an intronless first <italic>mtnB</italic> copy (MtnBcDNA-gen) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). SSA in these constructs can form intermediate heteroduplex structures, including a non-matching DNA region, which consists of only 1 nt in MtnBgen*-gen, whereas in MtnBcDNA-gen the nonmatching region comprises 61 nt. We found that the single mismatch in the heteroduplex of MtnBgen*-gen reduces SSA frequency to 50% of that observed with MtnBgen-gen. SSA in MtnBcDNA-gen, with the nonmatching 61 bp intron, is even reduced to 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). SSA in S2 cells therefore seems to be strictly regulated, sensing a 1-bp pair mismatch within a 259 bp DNA stretch. This points to the existence of a control mechanism to suppress homeologous SSA in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Besides the impact of sequence divergence on SSA frequency, we also wished to examine the role of the spacer length between two direct repeats since in human cell culture experiments, efficiency of SSA decreases with increasing spacer length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The SSA constructs mentioned above have spacer sequences of 191 bp and 13 bp upstream and downstream of the I-SceI cleavage site, respectively. We added additional spacer sequences of 1 kb and 2.2 kb to either side of the I-SceI site and analyzed SSA frequencies. Identical as well as divergent repeats showed a decrease in SSA with increasing spacer length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>SSA recombination is impaired by mismatches and spacer DNA in transiently transfected S2 cells.

As usual, the I-SceI endonuclease gene was provided on a different plasmid. This resulted in only a few green cells, which confirms that most of the EGFP expression observed in the regular SSA tester constructs is caused by intra-plasmid recombination events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). To further analyze whether these intra-plasmid recombinations result in the predicted SSA products, we transfected S2 cells with MtnBgen-gen, MtnBgen-cDNA, MtnBcDNA-gen, or MtnBcDNA-cDNA plasmid constructs. We sorted EGFP positive cells, isolated plasmid DNA from these cells and performed PCR with primers spanning the direct repeats.

We expressed I-SceI during embryonic and larval stages in male flies harboring the SSA tester construct (as outlined in Materials and Methods section). Offspring of these males were then screened for green flies. We first investigated whether the integration of the same construct into different genomic loci influences SSA frequency. For this we inserted the MtnBgen-gen transgene into the genome either randomly with the aid of a P-element transposase, or at a predefined <italic>attP</italic> &#x02018;landing site&#x02019; on the third chromosome by the phage <italic>C31</italic> integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). There was considerable variation in the percentage of green progeny of flies with insertions at different loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Therefore, to more accurately compare SSA frequencies of different tester transgenes, we chose to insert them at the same genomic locus via the <italic>C31</italic> integrase system. We started out by testing if SSA frequency depends on the spacer length as in S2 cells and human cell lines. For this we compared MtnBgen-gen with and without the intervening 2.2 kb spacer DNA. Similar to the cell culture results, the spacer reduced the frequency by 91% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). We next investigated whether sequence divergence also reduces SSA frequency <italic>in vivo</italic> like in S2 cells. Indeed, SSA proved to be very sensitive to mismatches, since 1 nt difference in a 259 nt stretch reduced SSA frequency by 58% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). As a control to ensure that the point mutation itself does not influence the readout, we also tested MtnBgen*-gen*, where the same point mutation is present in both <italic>mtnB</italic> copies, thereby restoring a 259 nt repeat of identical sequence. The SSA frequency of MtnBgen*-gen* was as high as that of MtnBgen-gen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). We next analyzed the influence of a longer stretch of unpaired DNA, located within the duplication, on SSA. MtnBcDNA-gen showed a pronounced and highly significant reduction of SSA in comparison to MtnBgen*-gen. As expected the same reduction was also seen when we reversed the order of the genomic and the cDNA copy of <italic>mtnB</italic> (MtnBgen-cDNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). The reduction is probably due to the fact that in a heteroduplex generated by MtnBcDNA-gen the 61 bp intron of the genomic copy bulges out as a large non-matching loop, whereas in MtnBgen*-gen the heteroduplex is distorted only by a 1-bp mismatch. However, an alternative explanation is the reduced length of identical sequence flanking the site of interruption (Figure S1). We therefore analyzed SSA of MtnBcDNA-cDNA*, where we had introduced a silent point mutation in the <italic>mtnB</italic> cDNA at the site where the intron is normally located. Interestingly, the SSA frequency in MtnBcDNA-cDNA* was significantly higher than in the intron-containing construct MtnBcDNA-gen. Thus, not only the length of the identical sequence but also the size of the unmatched DNA sequence itself influences the efficiency of SSA. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F). We also verified that repair occurred via SSA, rather than via unequal crossing over, by exploiting the fact that unlike SSA, DSB repair via homologous repair depends on Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In a <italic>rad51</italic> mutant background, EGFP positive flies emerged with similar frequency as in controls, indicating that most, if not all repair occurred via SSA (data not shown). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><italic>In vivo</italic> detection of SSA in the male germline.

Sequencing analysis of the repair products revealed an interesting fact. Neither mutant, nor control flies showed any evidence for discontinuous mismatch repair of the heteroduplex DNA (540 potential mismatches in total), since all the MtnB-MtnD SSA repair products contained pure <italic>mtnB</italic> type sequence upstream and <italic>mtnD</italic> type sequence downstream of the recombination site; in other words, discontinuous repair patterns were never seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C).

Because we already induce DSB formation in embryos, we performed a control experiment with <italic>spel1</italic> deficient parents to exclude any contribution of <italic>spel1</italic> gene product to the embryo by heterozygous parents (Figure S6). If spel1 suppresses SSA between divergent sequences, the effect should be most evident in the divergent MtnB-MtnD construct. However, analysis of this construct in flies with <italic>spel1</italic> deficient parents showed that SSA frequency (2 events/850 flies) was as low as in wildtype flies (5 events/1950 flies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here we describe some critical sequence constraints for recombination via single strand annealing (SSA) in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> SSA frequency was highest with identical tandem repeats and a minimal length of spacer DNA between them. A single nucleotide difference between 259 nt long direct repeats is recognized and reduces SSA frequency by 50%. We identified <italic>blm</italic>, coding for the Bloom helicase of the RecQ helicase family, as a gene responsible for the suppression of SSA between divergent repeats (termed hom<underline>e</underline>ologous SSA), thereby preventing potentially deleterious recombination events such as chromosomal translocations between paralogous genes. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the sole RecQ helicase Sgs1 is involved in inhibiting SSA between divergent sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In contrast to results in yeast, the gene product of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Msh2 ortholog <italic>spel1</italic> did not show any suppression of SSA between divergent sequences.</p><p>Most obviously, SSA can reduce any fortuitously duplicated DNA sequence back to one copy. Recent studies in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and drosophilids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) have revealed an unexpected genomic variability within one and the same species, notably duplications of DNA segments, both coding and noncoding. In most cases these are thought to be stochastic events without any benefit for the carrier, but such duplications undoubtedly also allow for the generation of gene families whose members have overlapping but distinct, important functions. Thus an organism faces the task of removing useless, if not detrimental DNA duplications yet preserving gene family members, which are particularly abundant in higher eukaryotes including insects and mammals. A typical example is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> metallothionein family with the closely related, chromosomally linked members <italic>mtnB</italic> and <italic>mtnD</italic> that must have arisen by duplication. Fortunately, the tendency of introns to diverge faster than coding sequences mounts an additional barrier against such undesired gene losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>); in agreement with this notion, the introns are most divergent between mtnB and D. Compared to identical repeats, we indeed find SSA between <italic>mtnB</italic> and <italic>mtnD</italic> transgenes to be strongly reduced, and also show that the homolog of human Bloom helicase (but not the MSH2 homolog spellchecker), is an important discriminatory component. The guardian function of Bloom helicase in preventing ectopic SSA recombination appears particularly important in higher organisms, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which harbor many gene families.</p><p>In addition to these general considerations, a specific substrate for naturally occurring SSA could be the hybrid element insertion (HEI) process in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; the corresponding P-elements located on sister chromatids recombine in concert with a nearby locus on the homologous chromosome, resulting in a deletion and a duplication product. The generated duplication is prone to undergo SSA because the P-element is still located between the duplicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In this process, SSA would preserve the original genome sequence.</p><p>An alternative way of looking at SSA is in the context of the synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA) mechanism, which was demonstrated to be a major pathway for DSB repair in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In the SDSA model, a DSB is followed by 5&#x02032; resection of the DNA ends, as it is the case in SSA. The resulting 3&#x02032; overhangs may invade homologous templates to copy the DNA sequence spanning the DSB. The invasive strand is subsequently unwound and anneals with the other overhang to restore the original sequence. Thus, SSA resembles SDSA without DNA synthesis. In addition, the factors involved in SSA are a subset of those in SDSA. Therefore, one might also consider SSA as a side reaction of SDSA, which could explain the tight sequence constraints for SSA. If a DSB is going to be repaired via SDSA in a region that contains divergent DNA repeats, the 3&#x02032; overhangs may anneal without DNA synthesis, form heteroduplexes and undergo SSA. In this context, rejection of heteroduplexes promotes faithful DNA repair via SDSA instead of SSA.</p><p>Another possible benefit of strict sequence constraints during heteroduplex rejection may become apparent when two or more DSBs occur simultaneously in similar sequences. Recombination between these sequences would lead to chromosomal translocations, which would most likely be deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p><p>So far no evidence existed for the involvement of Blm in the control of sequence constraints during homologous recombination, despite an established role of Blm in safeguarding the genome during DSB repair. A model published recently summarizes the complex involvement of Blm in homologous repair (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). It includes the removal of Rad51 from the single stranded 3&#x02032; overhang, dissociation of the D-loop, unwinding of the DNA double helix in front of the D-loop and dissolution of double Holliday junctions (DHJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). This essential role in HR makes it difficult to investigate a possible additional function of Blm in the suppression of HR between divergent sequences. Different from the situation in HR, such an analysis is possible in SSA, where Blm is not essential.</p><p>We show here with several substrate constructs that Blm suppresses SSA between divergent sequences but not between identical ones. As discussed before, this might be important during SDSA in regions containing repeat sequences. In addition one might speculate that Blm also suppresses strand invasion at ectopic templates during HR, which would be in line with the yeast data, where Sgs1 inhibits chromosomal translocations between similar but divergent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, analyzing homologous repair with an ectopic donor sequence, we could not detect significant differences in repair frequencies between constructs that contained an identical donor sequence and others that contained donor sequences harboring mismatches since repair events occurred very rarely.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila blm</italic> mutants, a general shift from HR towards SSA was reported, but only if HR used the homologous chromosome as a template (HR-h) and not if the sister chromatid was used (HR-s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In our experiments the SSA tester constructs were always in a heterozygous state, hence HR-h was not possible. As observed by others under comparable conditions, we did not see a general shift towards SSA in <italic>blm</italic> mutants if the repeats were identical. We find however that the SSA frequency was only elevated in <italic>blm</italic> mutants when heteroduplexes could be generated between divergent repeats. Data from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> suggest that heteroduplexes are unwound rather than degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We therefore propose that the Blm helicase unwinds heteroduplexes during DSB repair in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>Although we saw a pronounced, robust effect in <italic>blm</italic> mutants, it is likely that we still underestimate the impact of Blm on the suppression of homeologous recombination. Firstly, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has only one RecQ helicase, Sgs1, which suppresses recombination between divergent sequences, whereas <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> has three RecQ helicases: RecQ4, RecQ5 and Blm. Redundancy between these helicases in the suppression of homeologous recombination appears possible. Secondly, the parents of the investigated flies were heterozygous for <italic>blm</italic> since Blm deficient females are sterile. Thus a parental contribution of Blm mRNA or protein cannot be excluded. Indeed we have observed that maternal contribution of DSB repair factors can improve DNA repair efficiency in embryos (unpublished results).</p><p>The mismatch repair (MMR) system was found to suppress recombination between divergent sequences in various species, such as <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>) and the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> MMR factor MutS as well as the MutS homologs Msh2 in yeast and mice suppress homeologous recombination. Thus it was quite unexpected that <italic>spel1</italic> mutant flies, encoding the Drosophila Msh2 homolog, did not show increased SSA frequency between divergent sequences. In these experiments residual <italic>spel1</italic> activity can be excluded because the <italic>spel1</italic> gene is deleted. Furthermore, a control experiment where both parents were homozygous mutants yielded the same result. This suggests that in contrast to the situation in other model organisms, MMR is not involved in the suppression of homeologous recombination in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. However, we cannot exclude that another component of the MMR machinery in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, Msh6, contributes to the suppression of homeologous recombination.</p><p>Recapitulating the results presented in this work, one can state that in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Blm revealed a novel function in suppressing DSB repair between divergent sequences. In contrast to the situation in mammals and yeast where Msh2 also suppresses homeologous recombination, in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the Msh2 ortholog, Spel1, was not suppressing recombination between divergent sequences. Based on these data we propose that Bloom helicase, by increasing recombination fidelity, helps to inhibit chromosomal rearrangements, and thus might specifically prevent the loss of related genes that originated by duplication. Our studies have shed light on the way different species handle the difficult task of maintaining genome integrity while repairing damage to their DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn793/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>&#x02018;Controlled Gene Integration&#x02019; project of the European Union (LSHG-CT-2003-503303 to W.S.); the Schweizerischer Nationalfonds; the Kanton Z&#x000fc;rich.
