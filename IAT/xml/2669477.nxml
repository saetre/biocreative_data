Testicular sperm was isolated using 52% isotonic Percoll (Amersham Bioscience) and resuspended in PBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Epididymal sperms were recovered from the corpus and caudal regions of the epididymis by puncture of the ductuli and the sperm drops were flushed with PBS containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF). Sperm smears then were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS (PBS-BSA, w/v) for 60 min at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with human RNase9 antiserum (1:400). Parallel smears incubated with mouse non-immune serum served as a negative control. After three washes with PBS, smears were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200).

The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 20 mM lanthanum nitrate with 3% perchloric acid, and the insoluble tRNA was removed by centrifugation. The amount of solubilized tRNA was determined by ultraviolet absorbance at 260 nm. Catalytic activity was expressed as pmol of RNA digested in 1 sec by 1 pmol of RNase9. Recombinant protein HEL-75 (with no RNase activity) was used to control for bacterial RNase contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

The penetration index was calculated by dividing the number of eggs penetrated by the number inseminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].

The first 26 amino acids of RNase9 were identified a putative signal peptide by SignalP3.0 software. After cleavage of the signal peptide, the mature RNase9 protein was 179 amino acids in length, with a pI of 5.92.

The fusion tag can be released easily with the enterokinase site fused between the tag and target protein. SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF showed the mass of RNase9 protein was 19 kD, consistent with the theory (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>). Western blot analysis also indicated that the natural RNase9 protein was slightly larger than the recombinant RNase9. <italic>RNase9 </italic>was expressed in all tissues (epididymis, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, stomach, and testis) except muscle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Furthermore, expression of RNase9 was higher in adults than in elderly men or boys (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Indirect immunofluorescence staining showed that RNase9 protein was localized predominantly to the post-equatorial region of the sperms' head: approximately 80% of the epididymal and ejaculated spermatozoa were positive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). RNase9 protein signal was detected in the epithelial cells of the epididymal tubule and no fluorescence was detected in the testis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). RNase9 protein had no detectable RNase activity towards yeast tRNA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The enzyme activity of RNase 1 was determined under the same experimental conditions with the same amount of substrates in order to obtain a direct comparison. Meanwhile, we used the recombinant HEL-75 protein as a control to eliminate the possibility of contamination by bacterial RNase. Comparing the two group spermatozoa that were blocked with RNase9 anti-serum and pre-immune serum respectively, there was no significant difference in motility and fertility of sperm (p &#x0003e; 0.05) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Ribonuclease activity</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Enzyme</td><td align="left">Activities* &#x000b1; SD</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">RNase1</td><td align="left">0.167 &#x000b1; 0.002<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">RNase9</td><td align="left">0.011 &#x000b1; 0.007<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">HEL-75</td><td align="left">0.002 &#x000b1; 0.001<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Ribonuclease activities were measured as pmol RNA digested per pmol enzyme per second. <sup>&#x02020;</sup>Value represents the mean of three independent experiments.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Motility parameters analysis of sperm</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Parameters</td><td align="center">A</td><td align="center">B</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">VAP(um s-1)</td><td align="center">33.80 &#x000b1; 0.97</td><td align="center">36.31 &#x000b1; 1.52*</td></tr><tr><td align="left">VSL(um s-1)</td><td align="center">33.34 &#x000b1; 1.11</td><td align="center">30.82 &#x000b1; 1.89*</td></tr><tr><td align="left">VCL(um s-1)</td><td align="center">48.19 &#x000b1; 1.07</td><td align="center">45.75 &#x000b1; 0.86*</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>N = 10.

To overcome these difficulties, we constructed a normal adult human epididymis cDNA library[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and cloned <italic>RNase9</italic>. Human <italic>RNase9 </italic>share homology with mice, rats, monkeys, and chimpanzees and belongs to the RNase A family. However, <italic>RNase9 </italic>lacks the conserved catalytic triad and the family's signature motif (CKXXNTF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This may explain the loss of ribonucleic activity with purified RNase9 protein. In addition, RNase9 was found to have a pI that is lower than that of other RNase A family members. The relatively high pI of typical RNases is thought to be important for their ribonucleic activity, since the positive charge increases the affinity of the enzyme to the negatively charged RNA substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies showed that most RNase genes are expressed in a wide range of tissues except for RNase 3 and RNase 8, which are expressed prominently in eosinophils and placenta, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Likewise, human <italic>RNase9 </italic>also is expressed in many tissues. In contrast, rat <italic>RNase9 </italic>is located on chromosome 15 and expression was localized to the epididymis. There are no other reports about RNase9 at present.</p><p>In the sperm, the postacrosomal region or equatorial segment is involved in sperm-egg plasma membrane fusion. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that the RNase9 protein is expressed on the post-equatorial region of the sperm head. Taken together with our RT-PCR results and immunofluorescence staining results, these findings suggest that the RNase9 protein is synthesized maily by the epididymis and always binds to the surfaces of epididymal and ejaculated spermatozoa. We know that the sperm membrane undergoes substantial remodeling to induce sperm maturation during epididymal transit and many epididymal proteins take part in this process. Further study into the actual roles of RNase9 protein is needed.</p><p>Many proteins in the epididymis are androgen-regulated, such as &#x003b2;-defensin 118 (DEFB118), cystatin-related epididymal specific (CRES) protein, disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Rat <italic>RNase</italic>9 is also androgen dependent. At present, the relationship between human RNase9 and androgens is unknown and the castration test is limited by experimental conditions, but RT-PCR results in different individuals showed indirectly that the expression of <italic>RNase9 </italic>was highest in adults. Whether the expression of <italic>RNase9 </italic>is androgen-regulated is not known and requires further study. Additional approaches are under development to analyze the reproductive biology in <italic>RNase9 </italic>knockout animal models.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>J L was responsible for gene cloning, recombinant protein expression, antibody preparation, ribonuclease activity assay and wrote the manuscript.
