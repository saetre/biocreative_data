The spirochete is maintained in an enzootic cycle, alternating between a tick vector (<italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>) and vertebrate host. Uninfected larval ticks acquire <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>after feeding on a vector-competent host, and spirochetes colonize and persist within the tick midgut for months as the tick molts to the nymphal stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the infected-unfed tick, <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>is associated with the midgut epithelium, existing in a non-replicative state in a nutrient poor environment. When infected nymphs begin to feed, the number of spirochetes increases as nutrients required for growth become more abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The spirochetes move from the midgut of the feeding tick to the hemolymph and then to the salivary glands where they can be transferred to a na&#x000ef;ve host, a process that occurs no earlier than 24 hours after tick attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Small rodents or birds are the primary reservoirs of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>; however, <italic>I. scapularis </italic>occasionally transmits the bacterium to larger vertebrates, including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Upon infection in humans, spirochetes disseminate from the site of inoculation and may move to tissues other than the skin resulting in numerous clinical manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Symptoms of the primary infection are typically observed days to weeks after the tick bite and include flu-like symptoms that may be accompanied by a macular rash known as erythema migrans. If left untreated other symptoms may present months after inoculation, resulting in arthritis, myocarditis, and/or lesions of the peripheral and central nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>While <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>has evolved to survive in vastly different environments, it has limited biosynthetic capabilities and must obtain most nutrients from its surrounding environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is an essential component of peptidoglycan, the rigid layer responsible for strength of the microbial cell wall. Many bacteria can synthesize GlcNAc <italic>de novo</italic>; however, <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>must import GlcNAc as a monomer or dimer (chitobiose) for cell wall synthesis and energy. Therefore, <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>is normally cultured <italic>in vitro </italic>in the presence of free GlcNAc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In the tick much of the GlcNAc is polymerized in the form of chitin, as this is the major component of the tick exoskeleton. In addition, chitin is an integral part of the peritrophic matrix that encases the blood meal during and after tick feeding. This membrane functions as a permeability barrier, enhances digestion of the blood meal, and protects the tick midgut from toxins and pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. GlcNAc oligomers released during remodeling of the peritrophic matrix may be an important source of GlcNAc for <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>in the nutrient limiting environment of the unfed-infected tick midgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Previous reports have demonstrated that <italic>Borrelia </italic>species cannot reach high cell densities <italic>in vitro </italic>when cultured without free GlcNAc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recent reports by Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] extended this work in <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>with three significant findings. First, they observed that spirochetes cultured without free GlcNAc exhibit biphasic growth when the culture is followed for an extended period of time (up to 200 hours). Following an initial log phase, the cells bleb and enter a death phase before recovering and entering a second exponential phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Second, Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] demonstrated that cells cultured without free GlcNAc, but supplemented with chitobiose, exhibit normal growth and reach high cell densities. Based on these results they hypothesized that the second exponential phase might be due to the import of chitobiose via a phosphotransferase system (PTS) encoded by three genes (BBB04, BBB05 and BBB06) on circular plasmid 26 (cp26). Annotation of the genome sequence originally identified this group of genes (<italic>celB, celC </italic>and <italic>celA</italic>) as a cellobiose (dimer subunit of cellulose) transport system. However, functional analysis of BBB04 (<italic>celB</italic>) by Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] revealed that this group of genes is responsible for the import of chitobiose. Based on these findings they proposed renaming this set of genes, with BBB04 (<italic>celB</italic>), BBB05 (<italic>celC</italic>) and BBB06 (<italic>celA</italic>) now designated <italic>chbC</italic>, <italic>chbA </italic>and <italic>chbB</italic>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We have adopted this nomenclature for this communication. Finally, Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] demonstrated that a <italic>chbC </italic>mutant can be maintained in ticks and mice, and that the mutation of this gene does not affect transmission of spirochetes. While these results suggest that <italic>chbC </italic>is not essential for virulence of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, the studies were conducted in pathogen-free ticks and mice in a controlled laboratory environment. We hypothesize that <italic>chbC </italic>may still play an important role for survival of spirochetes in a natural setting, as ticks are often infected with more than one pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and <italic>chbC </italic>may be important for <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>to compete with other microorganisms to colonize the tick midgut. Therefore, this study was conducted to further investigate the regulation of <italic>chbC</italic>.</p><p>Alternative sigma factors are an important mechanism used by many bacteria to regulate gene expression, and can coordinate the expression of multiple genes needed to adapt to a variety of stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>encounters differences in temperature, pH and nutrient availability as it cycles between vector and host. Substantial investigation has focused on the differential expression of genes key to colonization, survival, and transmission of spirochetes during its enzootic life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Examination of the <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>genome reveals this organism possesses only two genes that encode for alternative sigma factors, BB0771 (<italic>rpoS</italic>) and BB0450 (<italic>rpoN</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that these two sigma factors regulate the expression of numerous genes in different environments, and are essential for colonization and survival in both the tick and mammal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this investigation we examine the role of RpoS and RpoN on biphasic growth, the utilization of chitobiose, and the expression of <italic>chbC </italic>in the absence of free GlcNAc.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of <italic>rpoS </italic>mutation on growth in BSK-II without GlcNAc</title><p>To determine if the alternative sigma factor, RpoS, is involved in the regulation of biphasic growth, we compared the growth of an <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant strain (A74) to a wild-type strain (B31-A) in the presence and absence of free GlcNAc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Growth of B31-A and A74 were similar in complete medium, although the wild-type strain reached a slightly higher cell density of 8.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>compared to 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>for the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant. When cells were cultured in the absence of free GlcNAc there was a considerable difference in the ability of the two strains to initiate a second exponential phase. Initially, both strains grew from a starting cell density of 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>to ~2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>by 72 h before entering a death phase characterized by a loss of motility and the formation of blebs near the cell midpoint (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). As expected, the wild-type strain exhibited biphasic growth, initiating a second exponential phase by 200 h and reaching a peak cell density of 3.65 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>by 290 h. During the second exponential phase cells exhibited normal morphology characteristic of cells cultured in the presence of GlcNAc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant strain did not initiate a second exponential phase by 381 h.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Mutation of <italic>rpoS </italic>delays biphasic growth during GlcNAc starvation</bold>.

When cultured in the absence of free GlcNAc, WC12 exhibited a growth pattern similar to the wild-type B31-A strain. The cells grew to 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>by 72 h before entering the characteristic death phase, and then initiated a second exponential phase by 200 h. Taken together, these results suggest that RpoS plays a role in the initiation of the second exponential phase when cells are cultured in the absence of free GlcNAc, possibly due to the regulation of genes important to the process.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of RpoS on the expression of <italic>chbC</italic></title><p>Previously, Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] used Northern blot analysis to demonstrate increased expression of <italic>chbC</italic>, the membrane-spanning component of the chitobiose PTS transporter, in the second exponential phase of wild-type cells cultured in the absence of free GlcNAc. They also demonstrated that mutation of the <italic>chbC </italic>gene resulted in a failure of the cells to initiate a second exponential phase by 200 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. From these data they concluded that <italic>chbC </italic>expression is critical for initiation and growth of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>cells in the second exponential phase when cultured in the absence of free GlcNAc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Since we have shown the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant failed to initiate a second exponential phase in the absence of free GlcNAc by 381 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), we hypothesized that the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant may not exhibit a second exponential phase because RpoS is involved, directly or indirectly, in the regulation of <italic>chbC </italic>transcription. To test this hypothesis, RNA was collected from B31-A, A74 and WC12 at various times during growth in media lacking free GlcNAc, and the expression of <italic>chbC </italic>was evaluated by real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Mutation of <italic>rpoS </italic>delays the up regulation of <italic>chbC </italic>expression during GlcNAc starvation</bold>.

Fold differences in <italic>chbC </italic>expression were calculated by comparing expression at the various time points to the expression at 44 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This time point was chosen as the baseline as cells are still in the first exponential phase and in the presence of residual free GlcNAc or chitobiose from yeastolate or rabbit serum (see below). Prior expression studies conducted by Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] demonstrated that <italic>chbC </italic>levels remain low in the presence of free GlcNAc. In addition, we evaluated the expression of <italic>chbC </italic>in cells cultured in the absence of GlcNAc and supplemented with high or low concentrations of chitobiose (data not shown).

In contrast, expression of <italic>chbC </italic>in the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant did not change from baseline levels for the first 340 h. However, expression did increase by 6-fold at 381 h, which may correspond to this strain beginning to enter a second exponential phase after 400 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). When expression of <italic>chbC </italic>was evaluated in the <italic>rpoS </italic>complemented mutant (WC12), levels increased as cells entered the second exponential phase similar to that observed in the wild type.

At about 200 h cells cultured in both low and high concentrations of chitobiose entered a second exponential phase. In comparison to the wild type, these results suggest that RpoS is important for chitobiose utilization, as the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant cultured in the absence of free GlcNAc and supplemented with chitobiose could not initially utilize free chitobiose as a source of GlcNAc.

With exception of the first death phase, these results are consistent with those obtained for the wild type cultured in 15 &#x003bc;M chitobiose, and further support our hypothesis that the source of GlcNAc during growth in the second exponential phase in the wild type, and the third exponential phase in the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant, is not free chitobiose.</p><p>Inspection of A74 growth without GlcNAc and without chitobiose revealed triphasic growth similar to, though less pronounced than, that observed in A74 cultured in 15 &#x003bc;M chitobiose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

This second exponential phase corresponds to that observed when A74 is grown in the presence of chitobiose, suggesting there is a small amount of free chitobiose present in BSK-II. After a second death phase, cells entered a third exponential phase at 385 h and reached a peak cell density of 1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>at 574 h before entering stationary phase. This final exponential phase may explain the slight increase in <italic>chbC </italic>expression observed by qRT-PCR at 381 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the role of RpoS in chitobiose utilization, we evaluated the growth of the <italic>rpoS </italic>complemented mutant, WC12, in BSK-II without GlcNAc and supplemented with low (5 &#x003bc;M) and high (75 &#x003bc;M) concentrations of chitobiose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). As expected, growth of the complemented mutant was similar to that observed for the wild type. In the presence of high concentrations of chitobiose, the complemented mutant exhibited a single exponential phase and reached a peak density of 8.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>by 117 h before entering stationary phase. In contrast, when the complemented mutant was cultured with the low concentration (5 &#x003bc;M) of chitobiose biphasic growth was observed. In the first exponential phase cells grew to a peak cell density of 5.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>at 96 h before blebbing and entering a death phase. This was a 3.5-fold higher cell density than that observed in the complemented mutant cultured without GlcNAc and without chitobiose. At 170 h the complemented mutant entered a second exponential phase, which peaked at a cell density of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1</sup>.

In addition, they attempted to identify the promoter regions for 10 dually transcribed genes, but were only able to find putative promoter elements for five of the genes which were highly similar to the consensus sequence generated from the absolutely RpoS-dependent genes.

As the preparation is derived from yeast it likely contains chitobiose and/or longer GlcNAc oligomers available to <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>as a source of GlcNAc. Previously, Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] suggested that yeastolate was the source of GlcNAc for growth of the wild type in the second exponential phase, as cells failed to exhibit a second exponential phase by 250 hours when cultured without GlcNAc and without yeastolate. However, we hypothesized that yeastolate may not be the source of GlcNAc during the second exponential phase, since <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>can utilize chitobiose in the absence of free GlcNAc to maintain normal growth and reach optimal cell densities in a single exponential phase. To test this hypothesis we followed growth of wild-type cells in BSK-II without free GlcNAc and yeastolate for an extended period of time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In contrast to the previous report, biphasic growth was observed in cells cultured without GlcNAc and yeastolate, suggesting that the source of GlcNAc for growth in the second exponential phase was not chitobiose or GlcNAc oligomers present in yeastolate. Additionally, cells cultured without GlcNAc and yeastolate reached a peak cell density of 9.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>in the first exponential phase prior to entering a death phase at 93 hours. This was approximately 2-fold lower than that reached in cells cultured without free GlcNAc only. This suggests that cells cultured in the absence of free GlcNAc with yeastolate exhausted the residual free GlcNAc and/or GlcNAc oligomers present in yeastolate before declining in density. A second exponential phase was observed in the culture without GlcNAc and yeastolate beginning at 266 hours, reaching a peak cell density of 3.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells ml<sup>-1 </sup>at 434 hours before entering stationary phase. Furthermore, when chitobiose was added to cells cultured without GlcNAc and yeastolate a single exponential phase was observed, though the growth rate was slightly reduced.

RpoS and RpoN are the only two alternative sigma factors encoded by <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, and have been shown to play key roles in the regulation of genes necessary for colonization of both the tick vector and mammalian host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A previous report demonstrated that biphasic growth in a medium lacking free GlcNAc is dependent on <italic>chbC </italic>expression, as <italic>chbC </italic>transcript levels in wild-type cells were increased during the second exponential phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We added to those results here by demonstrating that RpoS in the B31-A background regulates biphasic growth, as initiation of the second exponential phase was delayed by more than 200 h in the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant when compared to the wild type and <italic>rpoS </italic>complemented mutant (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;C</xref>). Our results also suggest the delay in the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant is due, at least in part, to its inability to up regulate <italic>chbC </italic>before 340 h during GlcNAc starvation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In contrast, <italic>chbC </italic>transcript levels increased in the wild type and <italic>rpoS </italic>complemented mutant, corresponding to the initiation of a second exponential phase in these strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Taken together, these results confirm the requirement for <italic>chbC </italic>expression during growth in the second exponential phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and suggest that RpoS regulates biphasic growth in media lacking free GlcNAc through regulation of <italic>chbC </italic>transcription.</p><p>Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] previously demonstrated that wild-type <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>can efficiently transport and utilize chitobiose in the absence of free GlcNAc to grow to optimal cell densities in one exponential phase, with optimal growth occurring at chitobiose concentrations &#x02265; 18 &#x003bc;M. We confirmed those observations and also demonstrated that <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>exhibits biphasic growth when cultured with low concentrations (&#x02264; 15 &#x003bc;M) of chitobiose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This observation suggests that free chitobiose, and potentially longer free GlcNAc oligomers, are not the source of GlcNAc for growth in the second exponential phase, as was previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In fact, growth of the wild type without GlcNAc but supplemented with longer GlcNAc oligomers, chitotriose and chitohexose, results in optimal cell densities and only one exponential phase (Rhodes and Nelson, manuscript in preparation). This observation suggests that <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>employs one or more enzymes for the breakdown of longer GlcNAc oligomers, and that this mechanism of obtaining sequestered (or bound) GlcNAc in the form of chitin is turned on during the first exponential phase.</p><p>Chitin and chitobiose may serve as an important nutrient source during the tick molt, as the peritrophic membrane encasing the blood meal is turned over and GlcNAc oligomers are released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Previous laboratory studies by Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] demonstrated that <italic>chbC </italic>is not necessary for <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>to complete an infectious cycle, leading them to suggest that the genome is still evolving and retains non-essential functional genes. However, we argue that selective pressure must be involved in the retention of this three component PTS, as it is also found in other <italic>Borrelia </italic>species (<italic>garinii </italic>and <italic>afzelli</italic>) that cause Lyme borreliosis and to our knowledge there has not been a strain isolated in which this transport system is not present. This may be an instance in which mixed infection studies would be appropriate to determine the competitive index (i.e. degree of virulence attenuation) for the <italic>chbC </italic>mutant as compared to the wild type.</p><p>To further demonstrate that free chitobiose or longer GlcNAc oligomers are not the source of GlcNAc in the second exponential phase, we followed the growth of cells in a medium lacking free GlcNAc and yeastolate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Yeastolate is the only component of BSK-II that may contain GlcNAc oligomers, as it is derived from an organism with a chitinous cell wall. Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] previously reported that there was no second exponential phase by 250 hours when cells were cultured without free GlcNAc and yeastolate, and therefore, suggested that chitobiose and possibly other GlcNAc oligomers present in yeastolate may be the source of GlcNAc for growth in the second exponential phase. However, our results demonstrate that wild-type cells do exhibit a second exponential phase in the absence of free GlcNAc and yeastolate, and reach a peak cell density in the second exponential phase by 434 hours. This result suggests yeastolate alone is not the source of GlcNAc for growth in the second exponential phase.</p><p>One possible explanation for the biphasic growth observed in the absence of free GlcNAc or limiting amounts of chitobiose is that a mutation has occurred allowing for the outgrowth of a mutant population. A previous report from Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] suggested this was not the case as cells back-diluted from the second exponential phase into a medium without GlcNAc still exhibited biphasic growth. However, in that experiment cells that were back-diluted grew almost 10-fold higher in the first exponential phase compared to cells in the first exponential phase from the original culture. This suggests the back-diluted cells were now able to utilize a GlcNAc-containing medium component that they were not previously able to use. In fact, unpublished data from our laboratory supports the hypothesis (Rhodes and Nelson, manuscript in preparation) that neopeptone (an enzymatic digest of protein) and rabbit serum supply GlcNAc sequestered in the form of glycoproteins or proteoglycans that <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>can acquire and utilize for growth in the second exponential phase. Numerous reports have demonstrated adhesion of <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>to mammalian cells through the binding of glycoproteins such as fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], glycosaminoglycans such as heparin sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and proteoglycans such as decorin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The ability to bind these substrates brings the spirochetes into close proximity with bound GlcNAc, and may represent a valuable source of this sugar when free GlcNAc or GlcNAc oligomers are not available. A deglycosylation mechanism has recently been described in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, in which exoglycosidases sequentially remove sugar residues from host glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We suggest that <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>may employ similar mechanisms by which they can release and utilize bound GlcNAc from host-derived glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans and/or proteoglycans. Results described above suggest that some, if not all, of the GlcNAc imported into the cell in the second exponential phase comes in the form of chitobiose. The proposed mechanism for obtaining GlcNAc from glycoproteins would be consistent with this as the oligosaccharide portion of N-linked glycoproteins is attached to the amino acid asparagine through chitobiose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This core chitobiose residue as well as others present throughout the oligosaccharide moiety may be sources of GlcNAc for <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>during growth in the second exponential phase.</p><p>A second possible explanation for biphasic growth is that it is the result of scavenging of GlcNAc released from dead <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>cells. While it cannot be ruled out that some growth in the second exponential phase may be due to scavenging of GlcNAc from dead cells, it is unlikely that all of the growth is due to scavenging as the peak cell density in the second exponential phase is &#x0003e; 5-fold higher than the cell density reached in the first exponential phase. Therefore, there would not be a sufficient amount of GlcNAc present in dead cells to account for the cell density reached in the second exponential phase. This point was made previously by Tilly <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Since our experiments with the A74 <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant strongly suggest that RpoS plays an important role in biphasic growth and <italic>chbC </italic>expression in the B31-A background in the absence of free GlcNAc, we also evaluated the ability of the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant to utilize free chitobiose. Unlike the wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and <italic>rpoS </italic>complemented mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant could not utilize chitobiose initially and did not show chitobiose-stimulated growth until 200 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant began a second exponential phase at 200 h with or without the addition of free chitobiose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), and triphasic growth was observed in the absence of free GlcNAc and chitobiose. These results indicate there is a small amount of free chitobiose present in BSK-II, most likely as a component of the yeastolate or rabbit serum. The addition of a low (15 &#x003bc;M) concentration of free chitobiose also resulted in triphasic growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), but in this case growth in the second exponential phase was more than 30-fold higher when compared to culturing the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant in the absence of free GlcNAc and chitobiose. Together, these results strongly suggest that RpoS, at least partially, regulates chitobiose utilization, and further demonstrate that free chitobiose is not the source of GlcNAc in the second exponential phase of the wild type or the third exponential phase of the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant.</p><p>Previous reports have demonstrated that a RpoN-RpoS cascade regulates the expression of outer membrane lipoproteins, such as OspC and Mlps (multicopy lipoproteins), in <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore, we generated a high-passage B31-A <italic>rpoN </italic>mutant to determine if RpoN is involved in the regulation of chitobiose utilization. We were surprised to discover that our <italic>rpoN </italic>mutant behaved similarly to the wild type, exhibiting only one exponential phase when cultured without GlcNAc and supplemented with 75 &#x003bc;M chitobiose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This result suggests that RpoN is not involved in the utilization of free chitobiose, and therefore this pathway appears to be regulated by only RpoS and RpoD. While our results do seem to challenge the well established RpoN-RpoS paradigm in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, our experiments were performed under different conditions. Typically, RpoS-dependent genes are evaluated <italic>in vitro </italic>in a temperature-dependent manner where cultures are shifted from 23&#x000b0;C to 35&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, our experiments were conducted exclusively at 33&#x000b0;C as we observed a change in the phenotype of the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant at this temperature (biphasic growth and decreased <italic>chbC </italic>expression) that could be restored when the wild-type gene was re-introduced on a plasmid. In addition, we are not the first group to demonstrate RpoS regulation in the absence of RpoN. Despite evidence of direct regulation of <italic>rpoS </italic>by RpoN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], Fisher <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] also showed that RpoS can regulate genes in the absence of RpoN. It is interesting to note that in this microarray study BBB05 and BBB06 (<italic>chbA </italic>and <italic>chbB</italic>, respectively) declined by 40&#x02013;50% in a <italic>rpoN </italic>mutant. No changes in BBB04, BBB05, or BBB06 transcription were reported for their <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant. However, in that study, Fisher <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] did not starve cells for GlcNAc, a technique that in our hands results in a modest 2-fold increase in <italic>rpoS </italic>transcript levels (data not shown), and a corresponding increase in <italic>chbC </italic>expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Additionally, Lybecker and Samuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] recently demonstrated that two <italic>rpoS </italic>transcripts exist, a shorter RpoN-regulated transcript previously identified by Smith <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that predominates at high cell density, and a longer transcript that does not possess the canonical RpoN-dependent promoter whose translation is regulated by the small RNA (sRNA) DsrA<sub>Bb </sub>at low cell density.</p><p>Our physiological and molecular data evaluating chitobiose utilization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and <italic>chbC </italic>expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) in the wild type versus the <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant strongly suggests that RpoD and RpoS both regulate chitobiose transport. To determine if the <italic>chbC </italic>gene has a promoter similar to other RpoS-dependent genes we identified the transcriptional start site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and the putative <italic>chbC </italic>promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). While not conclusive, it is possible that regulation of <italic>chbC </italic>by RpoS is through direct binding to the promoter region as the spacing between the -10 and -35 consensus sequences is similar to that of two of the dually transcribed promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). On the other hand, the sequence of the extended -10 <italic>chbC </italic>promoter element is more like that of the predicted RpoD consensus, and it has been shown that the extended -10 element plays a significant role in sigma factor selectivity in <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that RpoS regulates <italic>chbC </italic>expression indirectly through an unknown regulator, rather than through direct binding and transcription from the <italic>chbC </italic>promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we used a physiologic and molecular approach to demonstrate that chitobiose utilization and <italic>chbC </italic>expression are dually regulated by RpoD and RpoS. We determined the <italic>chbC </italic>transcriptional start site, and identified the putative promoter region. Finally, we provided evidence that the second exponential phase observed in cells cultured in the absence of free GlcNAc is not due to components found in yeastolate, and suggest that the source of GlcNAc in the second exponential phase is sequestered in components of serum and/or neopeptone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>Wild-type <italic>B. burgdorferi </italic>strain B31-A and <italic>rpoS </italic>mutant strain A74 were generously provided by Patricia Rosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].
