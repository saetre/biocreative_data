LD first emerged at about the same time as viral protease inhibitors (PIs) were first introduced but it is currently thought that both PIs and a second class of anti-viral drugs &#x02013; nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) &#x02013; contribute to the development of this syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Studies <italic>in vitro </italic>have shown that PIs affect fat-cell differentiation and the expression of adipose markers in the subcutaneous fat tissue of patients with LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The cellular target of NRTI was identified as the mitochondrial polymerase-&#x003b3; involved in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) repair and replication. NRTI toxicity seems to involve mostly massive mtDNA depletion, resulting in a mitochondrial cytopathy; it has also recently been implicated in fat redistribution syndrome (see for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). In human primary preadipocytes, NRTIs have been described to induce a strong mtDNA and to affect the function of mitochondrial respiratory chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recent studies on 3T3-F442A preadipocytes exposed to stavudine (d4T), zidovudine (AZT), ddC or didanosine (ddl) showed that d4T, ZDV and ddC decreased adipocyte mtDNA while ddl had no effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo </italic>mtDNA depletion in adipose cells has been shown to be associated with a dysfunction of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, NRTIs were also described to decrease transcription of mtRNA in absence of depletion of mtDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, they were shown to alter expression of both mitochondrial and lipid metabolism genes. These data suggest that NRTIs may also cause mitochondrial dysfunction by other means than through inhibition of DNA polymerase gamma and in this context, disruption of expression of lipid metabolism genes offers an explanation for NRTI-induced lipoatrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Adipose tissue, which was once thought to function primarily as a passive depot for the storage of excess lipid, is now understood to play a much more active role in metabolic regulation, secreting numerous proteins, including leptin, resistin, adiponectin, acylation-stimulating protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in response to various stimuli. These secreted proteins have pleiotropic effects; their involvement in glucose and fat metabolism may affect insulin resistance. Based on their anatomical location, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues may be involved in controlling the efficiency of lipolysis or the metabolic disturbances associated with visceral obesity, including glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipoproteinemia (see for review[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). Furthermore, levels of adipokines and of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), IL-6 and the plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) released have been shown to be higher in visceral than in abdominal subcutaneous tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. All of these are hypoxia target genes and further suggesting that hypoxia might regulate adipogenesis. Adipocyte differentiation <italic>in vitro </italic>is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, indicating that oxygen is an important physiological regulator of adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, angiopoietin-like 4 protein (ANGPTL4), also known as PPAR&#x003b3; angiopoietin-related (PGAR) or fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF), is a protein that has been reported to be expressed in adipose tissue and placenta and associated with adipose differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The <italic>angptl4 </italic>gene was recently demonstrated to display hypoxia-induced expression in various cell types and to modulate angiogenesis in tumor and ischemic tissues, suggesting that this protein could provide a link between metabolic disorders and the regulation of angiogenesis by hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Adipose tissue has been shown to have unique properties in plasticity, a capacity for vascular remodeling, and susceptibility to angiogenesis inhibitors. These characteristics result from the maintenance of immature adipose vessels, which facilitates vascular/tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In an obese mouse model, angiogenesis inhibitors designed to inhibit tumor growth were shown to reduce adipose tissue mass by cutting off the blood supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The reciprocal regulation of adipogenesis and angiogenesis was suggested by blocking VEGF signaling, which inhibited adipose tissue formation <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The redistribution of body fat in patients with LD entails the visceral accumulation of white adipose tissue and subcutaneous fat wasting. It remains unclear why adipose tissue is affected differently in different regions of the body, as in the lipo-atrophic and lipo-hypertrophic phenotype characteristic of LD. Various hypothesis were proposed to explain abnormal body-fat distribution in HIV-1-associated adipose redistribution syndrome. The neurological hypothesis was bases on neuroanatomical studies showing autonomic control of white adipose tissue by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic branch, with separate sets of autonomic neurons innervating either the subcutaneous or the visceral fat compartment. Fliers et al proposed that adipose redistribution syndrome is mediated by effects of antiretroviral treatment on the central nervous system and could indicate a change in autonomic balance resulting in redistribution of adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. An immunological hypothesis was also brought by the data reporting that fat accumulation in the breast in women on antiretroviral treatment was associated to a particular immunologic profile characterized by good T-helper activity and normalization of macrophage-derived cytokines (IL-12, TNF-(alpha)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In order to investigate whatsoever O2 might have a role in the LD phenotype, the effects of hypoxia on adipogenesis were investigated. We demonstrated that hypoxia modified the pattern of production of crucial adipocyte factors, including PPAR&#x003b3;, leptin, the angiogenic factors VEGF and ANGPTL4. In addition, levels of the transcription factor HIF-1&#x003b1; were stable in hypoxic preadipocyte nuclei. Moreover, triglyceride (TG) accumulation in adipocytes was strongly inhibited during adipogenesis following hypoxia. These data are consistent with pO<sub>2 </sub>(oxygen partial pressure) variations having an effect on the molecular and metabolic status of adipocytes. We then investigated the toxicity of NRTI in adipose cells under normoxia and hypoxia. We provide here the first demonstration that the effects of NRTI treatment on adipose cells depend on pO<sub>2 </sub>in culture conditions. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that pO<sub>2</sub>-adipogenesis-angiogenesis state differs in adipose tissues from different anatomical origins, by studies of hypoxia-induced angiopoietin ANGPTL4 expression in sections of adipose tissue. Staining depended on the location of fat deposits and the results obtained suggested that staining was associated with hypoxic microenvironments, which may be in a different metabolic state, thereby partly accounting for differences in the response to NRTI treatment.</p><p>These results provide new insights into the effects of antiretroviral treatment, differently affecting different regions of the body, as observed for the lipo-atrophic and lipo-hypertrophic phenotype characteristic of LD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effects of hypoxia on adipogenesis</title><p>We investigated whether low pO<sub>2 </sub>affected adipogenesis by allowing human primary preadipocyte to differentiate in the presence of the standard cocktail of adipogenic hormones (+ MIX) under gaseous hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>) or chemical hypoxia (DFO). We then compared TG accumulation with that in normoxia (20% O<sub>2</sub>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Under normoxia, 80 to 90% of preadipocytes differentiated into mature adipocytes loaded with TG droplets, as demonstrated by colorimetric quantification of Red-Oil staining. However, adipocyte differentiation was inhibited when adipogenesis was induced under hypoxia (DFO or 1% O<sub>2</sub>), consistent with previous results for the preadipocyte-like L1 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>We investigated the effect of hypoxia on the production of adipocyte factors, mRNA synthesis for the transcription factor PPAR&#x003b3;, and the adipokine leptin in confluent preadipocytes cultured under DFO treatment. We also assessed expression of the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF, which has been reported to be a hypoxia response factor upregulated in rodent adipocyte cell lines treated with drugs mimicking hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. PPAR&#x003b3; cDNA levels decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), despite increases in leptin and VEGF levels, showing that hypoxia can modulate key markers of adipogenesis and angiogenesis in human preadipocytes.</p><p>The cellular response to hypoxia is strongly linked to the stabilization of HIF-1&#x003b1;, which regulates hypoxia-responsive genes. We investigated HIF-1&#x003b1; stabilization and leptin protein production in preadipocytes cultured under hypoxia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Following the exposure of cells to hypoxia (+DFO), immunofluorescence staining showed, as expected, accumulation of the transcription factor HIF-1&#x003b1; in the nucleus (a) and of leptin protein in cytoplasmic vesicles (b). Double-staining experiments indicated that leptin was produced mostly in preadipocytes expressing the hypoxic marker HIF-1&#x003b1; (c). These data strongly suggest that pO<sub>2 </sub>variations may affect the molecular and metabolic status of adipose cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of hypoxia on adipogenesis</bold>.

We investigated the dual toxicity of NRTI in fat deposits, taking into account the possible effects of variations of pO<sub>2 </sub>on adipogenesis, by assessing the toxicity of NRTI in adipose cells under normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Quantification of mtDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) revealed that NRTI treatment induced severe mtDNA depletion in preadipocytes maintained in normoxia (20% O<sub>2</sub>). However, no NRTI-induced depletion was observed in preadipocytes cultured in hypoxia (DFO), despite weak decreases in mtDNA content the low pO<sub>2</sub>. We investigated the effect of NRTI on metabolically active adipose cells by quantifying mtDNA levels in mature adipocytes treated with NRTI during differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Adipocytes gave similar results to preadipocytes: mtDNA depletion in NRTI-treated cells under normoxia and no significant depletion under hypoxia.</p><p>We assessed TG accumulation in mature adipocytes treated with NRTI during differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). No TG accumulation was detected in preadipocytes, with or without NRTI. Lipid accumulation levels were similar in adipocytes differentiated in normoxia and treated with NRTI and in untreated cells. Differentiation was strongly inhibited under hypoxia (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Paradoxically, NRTI-treated adipocytes were refractory to the inhibition of adipogenesis under hypoxia, as cells accumulated TG to levels similarly to cells under normoxia. In order to determine whether, in this condition, hypoxia can induce lipid accumulation independently of adipocyte differentiation, expression of the two adipocyte markers, PPAR&#x003b3; and leptin, was evaluated (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that NRTIs treatment (black bars) did not modify <italic>PPAR&#x003b3; </italic>nor <italic>leptin </italic>gene expression in normoxia compared to control cells (hatched bars). These data also showed that, as described in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <italic>PPAR&#x003b3; </italic>gene expression was down regulated and <italic>leptin </italic>gene expression was up-regulated in preadipocytes (P) treated by DFO compared with normoxia (20%). However, in the treated adipocytes (DFO, A, NRTI) where hypoxia did not inhibit differentiation since the amount of lipids was maintained (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), expression of PPAR&#x003b3; was down regulated and the leptin was up-regulated. These data suggest that, in this condition, hypoxia can induce lipid accumulation independently of adipocyte differentiation marker PPAR&#x003b3;, as previously described by Fink et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the effect of NRTI depends on pO<sub>2 </sub>conditions.

In the present study, we found that O<sub>2 </sub>availability affected the expression of genes encoding adipokines, such as leptin, which has been shown to induce angiogenesis and to influence angiogenic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We found that the production of leptin protein was associated with stabilization of the transcription factor HIF-1&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), confirming the results of previous studies showing that leptin is encoded by a hypoxia-inducible gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. TG accumulation was inhibited in preadipocytes maintained in hypoxia during adipogenesis, consistent with data obtained in a rodent rodent preadipocyte cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Yun <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that adipogenesis was regulated via the inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3; 2 gene expression by the product of the HIF-1-regulated gene DEC1/Stra13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, The effects of adipose tissue metabolism, which depends on O<sub>2 </sub>availability, on response to NRTI treatment has been proposed as a model for investigating the differential effects of anti-retroviral drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the present work, we tested the hypothesis that the effects of NRTI depend on pO<sub>2</sub>. We first demonstrated that the effects of NRTI on mtDNA content were O<sub>2</sub>-dependent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), suggesting that mitochondria, which are highly active in normoxic conditions, need to replicate their mtDNA in such conditions, rendering them more sensitive to NRTI polymerase-&#x003b3; inhibition than cells maintained in hypoxia. Surprisingly, NRTI-treated cells were refractory to the hypoxia-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), suggesting that the consequences of hypoxia may be profoundly modified by NRTI treatment. In LD patients, NRTI-associated mtDNA depletion in adipocytes has been reported to affect the function of mitochondrial respiratory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Under hypoxia, mitochondrial respiration inhibitors have been shown to induce the redistribution of intracellular O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Hagen <italic>et al</italic>. used the renilla luciferase system to determine intracellular O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations. They showed that O<sub>2 </sub>was redistributed to cells not registering hypoxia, thereby preventing the stabilization of HIF-1&#x003b1;. If inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain restores intracellular O<sub>2 </sub>availability then, given that lipogenesis requires high pO<sub>2 </sub>levels, as shown in this study, NRTI-treated cells may not register hypoxia and thus accumulate TG similarly to cells in normoxic conditions. O<sub>2 </sub>is a major regulator of the glycolytic pathway and of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In particular, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation generates a chemo-osmotic gradient favoring the entry of pyruvate into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to generate citrate, a crucial step for fatty acid synthesis. Under hypoxia, anaerobic glycolysis generates pyruvate that does not enter the TCA cycle. This molecule is instead transformed into lactic acid, decreasing the amount of citrate available for fatty acid synthesis. Succinate accumulation has been reported to link this mitochondrial TCA intermediate to the cytosolic inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1; prolyl hydroxylase, leading to the stabilization and activation of HIF-1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Metabolic regulation mechanisms of this type add an additional level of complexity to the pattern of HIF-1&#x003b1;-regulated gene expression.</p><p>LD syndrome highlights regional differences in adipocyte biology. Studying the heterogeneity in function and responsiveness of fat from visceral and subcutaneous deposits could provide new insight in pathological process. Indeed, differences in insulin action, lipolytic or antilipolytic responses and cytokine production have shown that the metabolic status of adipose tissues may depend on their location in the body (see for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). However, little is known about quantitative or qualitative differences in vascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Endothelial progenitor cells have been detected in the stroma vascular fraction isolated from adipose tissue, providing further evidence for a link vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, no data are available regarding the microcirculation and pO<sub>2</sub>. Nevertheless, the presence of the angiogenic factor VEGF, which is produced and secreted in rat adipose tissue, has been shown to be dependent on the fat deposit considered, being highest in omental deposits[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In obese patients, visceral fat deposits have been shown to release more VEGF and IL-6 than abdominal subcutaneous tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The recently described hypoxia-induced adipokine ANGPTL4 was found to be a good candidate molecule for studies of the metabolic states of adipose cells according to pO<sub>2 </sub>microenvironment. ANGPTL4 was strongly expressed in the peri-adrenal adipose tissue around a pheochromocytoma and in lipohypertrophic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>), in which adipose fat mass increases, suggesting that through secretion of angiogenesis modulators adipocytes may have autocrine effects on their own growth. In non-pathological tissues, only visceral adipose tissue was found to express ANGPTL4. If the expression of this protein was associated with a hypoxic microenvironment, then adipogenesis levels would be expected to be low in that zone but NRTI treatment would modify the adipogenic metabolism of cells that would become refractory to hypoxia.</p><p>Our study shows that (i) Hypoxia may modify the adipogenic metabolism of primary human adipose cells; (ii) Toxicity of NRTI depends of oxygen environment of adipose cells; and (iii) The differential expression of ANGPTL4 suggests modulation of pO<sub>2 </sub>environment according to the anatomical origin of the adipose tissue. Thus, our data suggest that the LD phenotype may be a differential consequence of NRTI effects, depending on the metabolic status of the targeted adipose tissues. However, more extensive investigations on the relationships between hypoxia, angiogenesis and adipogenesis are required to elucidate the physiopathology of adipose tissue in LD or in obesity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, drug treatments and quantification of lipid accumulation</title><p>Fragments of waste adipose tissues collected from subcutaneous abdominal wall were obtained during cosmetic surgery on healthy subjects. For studies using adipose tissue from HIV-infected patients the samples were obtained from waste abdominal fat in lipohypertrophic zone during repair surgery. The tissue sample was cut into small pieces and processed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Preadipocytes from the stromal vascular fraction were cultured in medium (1:1 mixture of Ham's F12/Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum, FCS, and antibiotics). Confluent cells were allowed to differentiate for 12 to 15 days. Their differentiation was favored by adding a mixture (Mix) containing 8.5 nM insulin (Sigma Aldrich), 1 &#x003bc;M dexamethasone (Sigma Aldrich), 250 nM isobutyl methyl xanthine IBMX (Sigma Aldrich) and 1 &#x003bc;M pioglitazone (generously provided by V.
