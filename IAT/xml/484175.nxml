Recent reports indicate that misregulation of homeotic gene expression is associated with gastrointestinal cancer in mammals. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of the <italic>caudal</italic>-related homeobox genes are poorly understood. In this study, we have identified a DNA replication-related element (DRE) in the 5&#x02032; flanking region of the <italic>Drosophila caudal</italic> gene. Gel-mobility shift analysis reveals that three of the four DRE-related sequences in the <italic>caudal</italic> 5&#x02032;-flanking region are recognized by the DRE-binding factor (DREF). Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of these DRE sites results in a considerable reduction in <italic>caudal</italic> gene promoter activity. Analyses with transgenic flies carrying a <italic>caudal</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion gene bearing wild-type or mutant DRE sites indicate that the DRE sites are required for <italic>caudal</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings indicate that DRE&#x0002f;DREF is a key regulator of <italic>Drosophila caudal</italic> homeobox gene expression and suggest that DREs and DREF contribute to intestinal development by regulating <italic>caudal</italic> gene expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Homeobox genes encode DNA-binding proteins that play crucial roles during development in defining the body plan and determining cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c3">3</xref>). For example, the <italic>Drosophila caudal</italic> gene participates in defining the anteroposterior axis during early embryogenesis, and its expression is maintained in several organs including gut, gonads and compartments of genital discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c5">5</xref>). Evidence of the primary role played by the maternal and zygotic expression of the <italic>caudal</italic> gene in gut organogenesis and differentiation has recently been provided, since the <italic>caudal</italic> gene transactivates several genes involved in intestinal development, such as <italic>folded gastrulation, fork head</italic> and <italic>wingless</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c6">6</xref>). A recent report suggests that the <italic>Drosophila caudal</italic> is involved in the innate immune system and is responsible for the constitutive, tissue-specific local expression of antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c7">7</xref>). Several vertebrates have been characterized, including <italic>Xcad-1</italic>, <italic>Xcad-2</italic> and <italic>Xcad-3</italic> in Xenopus; <italic>CdxA</italic>, <italic>CdxB</italic> and <italic>CdxC</italic> in chicken; <italic>Cdx-1</italic>, <italic>Cdx-2</italic> and <italic>Cdx-4</italic> in mouse; and <italic>CDX1</italic> and <italic>CDX2</italic> in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c8">8</xref>). <italic>CDX1</italic> and <italic>CDX2</italic> are known to play essential roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c9">9</xref>), and the expression of these genes is altered in gastrointestinal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c12">12</xref>). Although the human <italic>CDX2</italic> gene is a known target of PTEN&#x0002f;phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling via an NF-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B)-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c13">13</xref>), little is known about other mechanisms that are likely to regulate <italic>caudal</italic>-related homeobox genes. Our present interest in characterizing additional <italic>caudal</italic> regulatory mechanisms stems from our observation that four putative DRE-related sequences are present in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the <italic>caudal</italic> gene.</p><p>DRE is known to be important for the expression of DNA replication-related genes (DNA polymerase &#x003b1; subunits and PCNA) as well as various cell cycle- and cell proliferation-related genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including <italic>dE2F</italic>, <italic>cyclin A</italic> and <italic>D-raf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c18">18</xref>). The transcription factor, DREF, binds specifically to the DRE sequence as an 80 kDa homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c19">19</xref>) and a human homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> DRE-binding factor (DREF) has been identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c20">20</xref>). The DRE&#x0002f;DREF regulatory system has also been implicated as a target of differentiation signals. For example, the <italic>zerkn&#x000fc;llt</italic> (<italic>zen</italic>) gene encodes a homeodomain-containing protein that is expressed in the dorsal region of the early embryo at the cellular blastoderm stage and is involved in differentiation of the amnioserosa and the optic lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c22">22</xref>). Zen expression represses DNA replication-related genes by reducing DREF activity in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c24">24</xref>). Hence, the DRE&#x0002f;DREF regulatory system may co-regulate and thereby coordinate growth- and differentiation-signaling pathways.</p><p>In the present study, we have investigated whether the <italic>caudal</italic> gene is regulated by the DRE&#x0002f;DREF regulatory system. Our results indicate that DREF binds to three DRE sites in the <italic>caudal</italic> gene promoter and that the DRE sites are required for efficient promoter activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>The following double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a 6 bp linker sequence recognized by BglII and BamHI were synthesized chemically.

Both of these constructs contain all the four DRE sites.</p><p>However, further deletion extending to &#x02212;1032, which removes DRE3 and DRE4, greatly decreased luciferase activity, suggesting that the promoter region containing the DRE3 and DRE4 sites are necessary for positive regulation of <italic>caudal</italic> transcription. Additional removal of the DRE2 site in the &#x02212;627 construct did not diminish luciferase activity beyond the reduction observed with the &#x02212;1032 construct. Further reduction of reporter activity was detected in the &#x02212;125 construct in which the zygotic transcription start site is compromised.</p><p>To further examine the function of the DRE sites in the <italic>caudal</italic> promoter, mutant reporter plasmids bearing the same mutations in DRE1, DRE3 and DRE4 as those used in the gel-mobility shift assay were constructed and transient transfection assays were performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. The DRE2 site was excluded from the analysis because complex formation with DREF was not detected with this site (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh688f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh688f3">3</xref>). Single point mutation in the DRE1, DRE3 or DRE4 sites all reduced luciferase activity to some extent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh688f5">5</xref>). This effect was enhanced by mutations of either two or all the three DREs. Thus, DRE1, DRE3 and DRE4 are all likely to contribute to <italic>caudal</italic> gene activation.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> roles of DRE sites in <italic>caudal</italic> gene expression</title><p>To investigate the role of the DRE sites in <italic>caudal</italic> gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, we established transgenic flies carrying a <italic>cad</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion gene (<italic>caudal</italic> promoter region, &#x02212;2648 to &#x0002b;165, fused to <italic>lacZ</italic>), or <italic>cadDmut7</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> (a <italic>cad</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion gene derivative with base-substitution mutations in all three DRE sites). <italic>Drosophila caudal</italic> is known to be expressed in the gut, gonads and compartments of the genital discs of third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c5">5</xref>) and in the anal plates and hindgut of adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c33">33</xref>).

Caudal is known to be expressed in the gut, gonads and compartments of the genital discs of third instar larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c5">5</xref>), in the anal plates and hindgut of adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c33">33</xref>), as well as in the salivary gland and ejaculatory duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c7">7</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of <italic>Drosophila caudal</italic> gene regulation are not well defined. In this study, we found that four DRE-related sites are located in the 5&#x02032;-flanking regions of <italic>Drosophila caudal</italic> gene and showed that three out of the four sites are recognized by DREF. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the requirement of DRE sites for <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of the <italic>caudal</italic> gene. Thus the <italic>Drosophila caudal</italic> gene is positively regulated by DRE&#x0002f;DREF system at the transcriptional level.</p><p>It is well known that the DRE&#x0002f;DREF system activates transcription of a wide variety of DNA replication- and cell-cycle-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c19">19</xref>). In addition, Hart <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c37">37</xref>) proposed a novel function of DREF as an antagonist of the chromosomal BEAF (boundary element-associated factor), which is involved in the boundary activity of the scs&#x02032; element of the <italic>Drosophila 87A7 hsp70</italic> locus. We previously reported that the <italic>caudal</italic> gene transactivates E2F gene expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c38">38</xref>) and here showed that the <italic>caudal</italic> homeobox gene expression is governed by DREF. Therefore, the present study supports the notion that the DRE&#x0002f;DREF system may be a master regulatory mechanism for the coordinated expression of cell proliferation-related genes.</p><p>Our results from analyses with transgenic flies carrying <italic>cad</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion genes with or without mutation in the DRE sites show that the <italic>lacZ</italic> staining signals of <italic>cadDmut7</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> were decreased in several tissues including hindgut (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh688f6">6</xref>A). In particular, decreased &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression of <italic>cadDmut7</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> in the hindgut suggests that DREF might be involved in hindgut development by regulating the <italic>caudal</italic> gene. In mammals, <italic>CDX1</italic> and <italic>CDX2</italic>, mammalian homologs of the <italic>Drosophila caudal</italic> gene, are also expressed in the intestine and colon where they appear to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c39">39</xref>). The importance of <italic>CDX1</italic> and <italic>CDX2</italic> in cell proliferation and differentiation is also supported by data from the study of several cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c41">41</xref>). A human homolog (hDREF&#x0002f;KIAA0785) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> DREF has been identified. In addition, it has been reported that the histone 1 gene is transactivated by hDREF, suggesting that hDREF may play a role in regulating human genes related to cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c20">20</xref>). Therefore, we examined the possibility that hDREF binding sites might be located in the human <italic>CDX1</italic> promoter and found candidate hDREF binding sites in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of human <italic>CDX1</italic> gene. Recently, we reported that the DNA binding activity of DREF is regulated by a redox mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c28">28</xref>) and that DREF is a key regulator of <italic>Drosophila catalase</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c25">25</xref>), suggesting that expression of DREF target gene expression may be regulated by the intracellular redox state through modulation of DREF binding activity. The down-regulation of <italic>CDX1</italic> and <italic>CDX2</italic> is also known to be associated with colon cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c45">45</xref>). Therefore, the presence of candidate hDREF binding sites in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of <italic>CDX1</italic> raises interesting questions concerning the transcriptional regulation of <italic>CDX</italic> gene by the human DRE&#x0002f;DREF system. In particular, alteration of <italic>CDX</italic> expression in colon cancer may be associated with aberrant redox regulation of hDREF function.</p><p>Caudal has recently been shown to function as an innate immune response transcriptional modulator that controls the constitutive local expression of antimicrobial peptides cecropin and drosomycin in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c7">7</xref>). For example, <italic>caudal</italic> is absolutely necessary for constitutive expression of <italic>Cecropin</italic> and <italic>Drosomycin</italic> in ejaculatory duct or salivary gland, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh688c7">7</xref>). Our results demonstrate a marked reduction of <italic>caudal</italic> reporter expression in salivary gland and ejaculatory duct of flies carrying <italic>cadDmut7</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh688f6">6</xref>A). Therefore, we examined the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the <italic>Cecropin</italic> gene, and detected DRE-related sequences. These findings suggest that in addition to controlling <italic>caudal</italic> gene expression and its possible role in human <italic>CDX</italic> gene regulation, the DRE&#x0002f;DREF system may function in the innate immune response of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh688f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The nucleotide sequences and relative positions of DRE-related sequences in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of <italic>Drosophila caudal</italic> gene promoter.
