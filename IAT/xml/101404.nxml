DAP is a neurotoxin, which, when consumed, causes a disease called Lathyrism. Lathryrism may manifest as Neurolathyrism or Osteolathyrism, in which the nervous system, and bone formation respectively, are affected. DAP ammonia lyase is produced by a few microorganisms such as Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas, and is capable of detoxifying DAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>S. typhimurium PU011, a non-virulent bacterial strain isolated in our lab, was found to produce DAP ammonia lyase enzyme when grown in minimal medium containing DAP. There was a direct correlation between biomass yield and enzyme activity, until 16 h post inoculation in minimal medium containing DAP. Following ammonium sulphate precipitation and passing through Sephadex G100, CM-Sephadex and DEAE-Sephacel for crude enzyme extract preparation, about 68-fold enzyme purity was obtained. The purified enzyme gave maximum activity at pH 8.0 and was stable up to 45 degrees C. The Km value for the substrate was found to be 0.685mM, calculated from a Line Weaver Burk plot.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A new bacterial strain, S.typhimurium PU 011, which is capable of producing DAP ammonia lyase, was isolated.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Lathyrus sativus</italic>, belonging to the family of leguminoceae, is a popular drought resistant legume plant whose grains serve as food in the drought prone areas of Asia and Africa.

Medical scientists evince keen interest in understanding the causes of neurolathyrism as a model for neurodegenerative diseases striking the more affluent sections of the human population. The scourge of neurolathyrism, known since ancient times, mainly affects the poor rural classes in developing countries. Though different methods such as boiling in water and development of DAP free cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], had been tried, as yet no effective method has been developed for safe consumption by the famine hit, poverty ridden, malnourished hungry millions in the drought prone areas in central India and Africa.</p><p>Rajagopal et al.

The kinetics of production of biomass and DAP ammonia lyase activity by this organism is shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. A continuous increase in biomass and specific activity of enzyme with increase in incubation period was observed, the maximum reaching at 16 h post inoculation. Interestingly, a direct correlation between biomass yield and enzyme activity up to 20 h after inoculation was observed. Nagasawa et al.

The slots were cleaned by rinsing with electrophoresis buffer. Protein samples were loaded into the slots and the slots were filled with 1 &#x000d7; electrophoresis buffer. The gel cassette was then fixed with the upper buffer tank and then fixed onto the lower buffer tank. Both the tanks were filled with 1 &#x000d7; electrophoresis buffer and electrophoresis was carried out at a constant current of 15 mA.</p><p>After electrophoresis was over, the gel cassette was dismantled and the gel was placed in a tray containing Coomassiae Brilliant Blue staining solution (0.1 % Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R 250), 45 % Methanol, 10 % Glacial Acetic Acid and 45 % Distilled water) and the gel was agitated slowly for 4 h to overnight. The staining solution was poured out and replaced with destaining solution (45 % Methanol, 10 % Glacial Acetic Acid and 45 % Distilled water). Destaining was carried out for a minimum of 2 h with gentle agitation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The assistance rendered by M. K.
