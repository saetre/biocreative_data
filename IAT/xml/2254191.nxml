In neonatal testis of DicerCKO, the number of neonatal spermatogonia was also reduced to almost half those detected in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001738-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Note that the development of the seminiferous tubules in DicerCKO males is indistinguishable, compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001738-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that the reduction in the numbers of germ cells is due to an intrinsic defect in these cells.</p><p>The reduction in the numbers of PGCs in DicerCKO embryos might be caused either by cell death or by growth arrest of <italic>Dicer</italic>-deleted PGCs. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we assessed the number of apoptotic cells in the gonads. However, the number of apoptotic cells was not elevated in DicerCKO PGCs at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001738.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Next we examined the proliferation rate of DicerCKO PGCs by immunostaining for phosphorylated histone H3 ser10, a marker of M phase. The immunostaining analysis revealed that the proliferation of DicerCKO PGCs at E12.5 was attenuated. On average, we found that 4.9&#x00025; of PGCs in DicerCKO embryos were in M phase, whereas 9.0&#x00025; of PGCs in control embryos were in M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001738-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

MiR-19a and -19b may regulate PTEN dosage, and consequently regulate PGC proliferation. In fact, our functional analysis showed that the number of PGCs in DicerCKO embryos was decreased due to a defect of proliferation rate rather than apoptosis.

Taking into account the fact that PGCs have the potential to give rise to pluripotent embryonic germ cells, it is likely that the expression of the cluster miRNAs in PGCs may underlie the plasticity of PGCs to dedifferentiate into pluripotent EG cells. This speculation is supported by the evidence that EG cells could not established from E11.5 DicerCKO PGCs (unpublished data). It has been reported that the majority (about 40&#x00025;) of all miRNAs are expressed from either miR-17-92 or miR-290-295 clusters in ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001738-Calabrese1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.

Three of these miRNAs belong to miR-200 superfamily and share similar seed sequence. Bioinformatic analysis showed that miR-141 and -200c are encoded within 500 bp in the mouse genome, indicating that they are generated from the same pri-miRNA. Interestingly, the locus encoding miR-141/200c is close to the &#x0201c;pluripotent cluster&#x0201d; consisting of Nanog, Stella/PGC7/Dppa3 and Gdf3 on mouse chromosome 6 (&#x0223c;2000 kb). Close association between miR-141/200c and the pluripotent cluster is also observed in the short arm of the human chromosome 12 (&#x0223c;700 kb). In addition, there is a perfect match between the sequences of miR-141/200c in the mouse and human, suggesting that miR-141/200c may have similar functions in the two species. Notably, the genomic region including miR-141/200c and the pluripotent cluster is characterised as an oncogenic region for the formation of the germ cell tumor (GCT) in human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001738-Hart1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, though the definitive connection with oncogenesis is yet unclear. Because it has been known that GCTs express stem cell-specific genes, including Nanog, which are also expressed in PGCs, it is possible that misregulation of miR-141/200c is a contributing factor for GCT formation. Supporting this speculation, a recent report showed that miR-141 functioned in promoting cell proliferation in cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001738-Meng1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>By contrast, the expressions of miRNAs belonging to let-7 family (let-7a, d, e, f and g) were up-regulated after E11.5 and reached the highest levels at E13.5.

Interestingly, the up-regulation of the let-7 family was only observed in male PGCs. These results illustrate a possible mechanism involving miRNA regulating sex-specific PGC differentiation. In E13.5 male PGCs, it may be necessary to maintain high levels of miR-17-92 cluster for further proliferation of male germ cells after birth. Indeed, our results showed that neonatal spermatogonia also showed highly expressed miR-17-92 cluster and that DicerCKO neonatal spermatogonia showed poor proliferation. Perhaps, up-regulation of male-specific miRNA, including the let-7 family, may play a role in preventing cell cycle progression despite high levels of expression of miR-17-92 cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Dispensable function of miRNA in repression of transposable elements</title><p>One of the major roles of small RNAs is thought to maintain genome stability through suppression of transposable elements, based on widely known fact that mutants of RNAi machinery prevent silencing of transposable elements in many eukaryotes, including <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001738-Tabara1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001738-Ketting1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001738-Vagin1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>Neurosporra crassa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001738-Nolan1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>Trypanosma bruceii</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001738-Djikeng1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001738-Shi1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our study, however, showed that LINE-1 and IAP expression were in fact down-regulated in DicerCKO PGCs and were comparable in DicerCKO neonatal spermatogonia, indicating at least that Dicer is dispensable for silencing these retrotransposons in the germ cell lineage. Previous reports and our results may illustrate the different functions of Dicer on repression of retrotransposons in PGCs and in preimplantation embryos or ES cells. An important difference amongst these cell types is that only PGCs and spermatogenic cells express piRNA-interacting proteins, Mili and Miwi2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001738-KuramochiMiyagawa2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the silencing retrotransposons may be governed by only piRNA in the germ cell lineage.

Taken together, miRNAs and their biogenesis have a distinct pathway from piRNAs in silencing retrotransposons and in germ cell development. The reason why DicerCKO PGC showed subtle expression of the retrotransposons remains elusive. One plausible explanation is that miRNAs negatively regulate the expression of molecules that repress retrotransposons. Alternatively, loss of Dicer may enhance other small RNA pathway by conceding effecter molecules that are necessary for both small RNA pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Distinctive roles of miRNA in spermatogenesis</title><p>Although young (at least &#x0223c;16weeks old) DicerCKO males are fertile, genotyping these progeny revealed that the mature spermatozoa were derived from <italic>Dicer</italic><sup>F/&#x00394;</sup> spermatogonia, which had escaped from Cre-mediated <italic>Dicer</italic> excision.
