The sensory receptors of the vestibular apparatus are the hair cells. Two types of hair cells are present in mammalian vestibular organs, called Type I and Type II hair cells, which differ substantially in their afferent contact. The Type I hair cell's basolateral membrane is completely enveloped in a large afferent nervous terminal, called a calyx. In contrast, Type II hair cells are contacted by numerous bouton-like afferent terminals. The soma of afferent neurons are located in the Scarpa's ganglion. Central projections of the vestibular nerve contact secondary neurons located in the brainstem (vestibular nuclei) and in the cerebellum, which provide the anatomical basis for the vestibular reflexes.</p><p>Most cases of dizziness and vertigo are due to problems in vestibular organs, presumably resulting in wrong afferent signaling interpreted by the brain as if the head is moving or turning when it is actually not.</p><p>Among the pharmacological compounds commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of vertigo and related vestibular disorders are histamine-related drugs, such as promethazine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], dimenhydrinate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and cinnarizine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], assumed to act at H1 histamine receptors, and betahistine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which has been shown to act as an H3 histamine receptor antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the site/s of action of these drugs have not been defined. Histamine H1, H2 and H3 receptor subtype expression has been reported in rat vestibular nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], suggesting the possibility that the antivertigo effect of histamine-related drugs occurs centrally. On the other hand, experiments performed on amphibian semicircular canals have shown that H1 and H3 receptor ligands affect the sensory input recorded from the afferent vestibular neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], indicating a possible peripheral site of action for these drugs. Consonant with the latter studies, we recently reported that H1 receptors are expressed in frog and mouse hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we report that a subpopulation of mouse Scarpa's ganglion neurons innervating both Type I and Type II hair cells express H3 receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Experiments were performed on mice (Swiss CD-1) about 3 weeks old. All experimental procedures involving animals were approved by the Ministero Italiano della Sanit&#x000e0;, and comply with the European international laws on animal research. Prior to any surgery, deep and irreversible anesthesia was obtained by means of alothane.</p><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>For RT-PCR experiments, brain and vestibular ganglia were removed immediately after decapitation of the animal. The superior and inferior vestibular ganglia were removed together. Since both ganglia similarly stained for the H3 receptor (H3R) antibody, no differential analysis was performed.</p><p>Total RNA was extracted from mouse brain (1 mouse/experiment for 3 experiments) and Scarpa's vestibular ganglia (50&#x02013;100 mice/experiment for 3 experiments) using QIAzol Lysis Reagent (QUIAGEN, Italy). Single-strand cDNA was synthesized from RNA (1 &#x003bc;g) using random hexamers and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA). Subsequently, PCR (30 s at 96&#x000b0;C, then 30 s at 62&#x000b0;C or 69&#x000b0;C for &#x003b2;-actin and H3 respectively, followed by 30 s at 72&#x000b0;C for 33 cycles) was performed on 2.5 &#x003bc;l cDNA using specific primers for H3 receptors designed in accordance with the published sequence. H3 receptors display alternative splicing mainly in the region of the third intracellular loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Primers for H3 receptors were designed around a nonspliced region, so that all variants would be detected, although not differentiated. The forward and reverse sequences were: 5'-TTCAACATCGTGCTGATCAG-3' 5'-TGTTCAGGTAGATGCTGAGG-3. As an internal control for cDNA yield, parallel RT-PCR was performed using specific primers for mouse &#x003b2;-actin. The primer sequences were: 5'-CAGATCATGTTTGAGACCTT-3' 5'-CGGATGTCMACGTCACACTT-3'. Negative control experiments were always performed by omitting the reverse transcriptase. The molecular weight (MW) of PCR products was estimated using the DNA MW marker VIII (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Italy).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>For immunofluorescence experiments ganglia were dissected from mice (n = 8), embedded in Jung Tissue Freezing Medium (Leica Microsystems, Italy) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Multiple 10 &#x003bc;m cryostat sections were obtained from the frozen samples, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, blocked for 60 min with bovine serum albumin (BSA) 3%, rinsed with PBS and then incubated for 2 hours with rabbit anti-rat H3R IgG (Alpha Diagnostic International, USA), diluted 1:50 in PBS. After a rinse in PBS (15 min), the sections treated with anti-H3 were incubated (30 min) with Alexa-fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) (Invitrogen, Italy).</p><p>No immunostaining was observed in control sections incubated with H3R antibodies preadsorbed with 20 M excess of the relative control peptide (Alpha Diagnostic International, USA), thus confirming anti-H3R antibody specificity.</p><p>For the colocalization study of histamine receptors and calretinin or calbindin, slices were incubated with rabbit anti-rat H3R IgG (Alpha Diagnostic International, USA) plus goat calretinin antiserum (Alpha Diagnostic International, USA), or plus goat calbindin antiserum (D28k-c20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Germany), all diluted 1:50 in PBS except for calretinin which was diluted 1:250. After a rinse in PBS (15 min) the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:1000). The immunostained slices were examined using the AFTER<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>fluorescence LED module (Fraen Corporation, Italy). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (ProLong<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gold antifade reagent with DAPI, Invitrogen, Italy). Slides were mounted on an Olympus BX41 light microscope, and digital images were captured with an Olympus Camedia C-5050 zoom digital camera (Olympus Italia, Italy). Several images were also acquired by mean of a TCS SP2 LEICA confocal microscopy system equipped with a LEICA DM IRBE inverted microscope.</p><p>In two additional experiments ganglia were not dissected directly from the mouse, but the petrous bone containing the whole inner ear was dissected out surgically and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB for 2&#x02013;3 hr. Bone was decalcified for at least 1 week in a 120 mM EDTA solution at 4&#x000b0;C before further processing into paraffin. Serial paraffin sections (10 &#x003bc;m) were brought to water, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, blocked for 60 min with BSA 3%, rinsed with PBS and then incubated for 2 hr with anti-H3R antibody (Alpha Diagnostic International, USA) diluted 1:50 in PBS. After a rinse in PBS (15'), the slices were treated with anti-H3R and incubated (30') with Alexa-fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). Slices were then washed 3 &#x000d7; 5 min with PBS, mounted in ProLong<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Molecular Probes) and examined with a TCS SP2 LEICA confocal microscopy system equipped with a LEICA DM IRBE inverted microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Neuron count and size</title><p>To estimate the percentage of ganglia neurons expressing H3 receptors, we calculated the ratio of cells staining for both H3 antibody and DAPI vs. cells staining for DAPI only in ganglia slices. All nuclei that were clearly recognizable were counted in slices. Since slices were 10 &#x003bc;m thick, and neuron soma ranged between 10 and 30 &#x003bc;m, in serial sections a same neuron could be counted twice. This would have yielded to an overestimation of H3 expressing neurons as they showed a larger soma (see Result sections). Therefore, we skipped one slice every count. The same was done for calculating the percentage of calretinin-positive neurons.</p><p>Finally, in some experiments ganglia tissue was stained with toluidine blue or hematoxylin/eosin, which stain neuron nuclei and cytoplasm. The diameter of each nucleus and soma was obtained by averaging the largest and the shortest diameters measured.</p><p>Analysis was performed with Microcal Origin (Version 6.0.

To test for this possibility we measured the soma and nucleus of neurons counterstained with hematoxylin/eosin or toluidine blue, which stain both nucleus and cytoplasm (see e.g. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). As depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, soma and nucleus diameter of neurons covary (correlation coefficient: 0.85), suggesting that neurons showing a small nucleus also have a small soma.

Moreover, antibodies anti-H3R protein stained neurons characterized by a relatively large soma and nucleus. This is the first report of H3 receptors expression by primary vestibular neurons, suggesting they could represent a peripheral target of histamine-related drugs, besides histamine receptors expressed by neurons of the vestibular nuclei, which are a central target.</p><p>About one fifth (21%) of H3R-positive neurons expressed calretinin, and virtually all co-labeled for calbindin. Calretinin was reported to selectively mark pure vestibular calyx afferents which innervate Type I hair cells only, while calbindin additionally labeled dimorphic afferents contacting both Type I hair and Type II hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A third neuronal subpopulation was also identified, characterized by the smallest soma, which stained with peripherin; these neurons make bouton-like synapses on Type II hair cells only.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that H3 receptors are expressed by calyx and dimorphic, but not bouton, afferent neurons.</p><p>Calyx, dimorphic and bouton afferents, beside innervating different proportions of Type I vs. Type II hair cells, show distinct regional distributions in the sensory epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and diverse resting and dynamic discharge properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The reason for this afferent diversity is not fully understood, although it has been proposed that it might serve to match different vestibular reflexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It seems interesting here to note that the expression of H3 receptors represents an additional difference among primary vestibular afferent neurons.</p><sec><title>Role of H3 receptors in vestibular ganglion neurons</title><p>H3 antagonists were shown to inhibit the afferent discharge recorded from the vestibular nerve of the axolotl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It was proposed that H3 receptors were localized post-synaptically to the hair cells, i.e. at the afferent vestibular nerve, since H3 antagonists were still effective when the synapse was blocked by a high Mg<sup>2+</sup>/low Ca<sup>2+ </sup>solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This hypothesis is consistent with the present results, and also with a recent study showing no evidence for H3 receptors expression by vestibular hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>On the whole, these results suggests that histamine, and related compounds, can affect the excitability of primary vestibular neurons through direct action on H3 receptors. This conclusion, however, does not exclude a possible pre-synaptic effect of H3 receptors upon glutamatergic neurotransmission between Scarpa's ganglion neurons and second order neurons located in the vestibular nuclei and in the vestibolocerebellum. Although in fact H3 receptors are commonly found on histaminergic nerve endings where, by acting as autoreceptors, they are responsible for histamine inhibiting its own release, they have also been found on nonhistaminergic endings whereby histamine can inhibit release of different neurotransmitters, among which glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The main original finding of the present study is that mouse vestibular ganglion neurons express histamine H3 receptors. Interestingly, data are consistent with H3 receptors being expressed by calyx and dimorphic, but not bouton, afferents. This suggests the possibility that histamine modulates distinct sensory pathways. Finally, it is possible to speculate that the anti-vertigo action reported for some histamine-related drugs involves H3 receptors expressed by primary vestibular neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TS carried out the molecular biology and the immunofluorescence experiments, and participated in the design of the experiments and analysis of data.
