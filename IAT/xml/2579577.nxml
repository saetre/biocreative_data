The PC is a hair-like cellular extension found at the surface of most vertebrate cells. This sophisticated microtubule-based organelle has been shown to sense multiple mechanical and chemical stimuli from the environment and to elicit specific cellular responses, which play crucial roles in embryonic development and homeostatic processes in adulthood. The PC has also recently been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and, as a consequence, a lack of PC was associated with increased proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Praetorius1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Christensen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>PC formation (ciliogenesis) takes place in quiescent or differentiated cells. PCs are assembled from the mother centriole of the unique centrosome present in these cells, which therefore corresponds to the basal body of PC. The mother centriole is docked at the membrane through its distal appendages and gives rise to the microtubule-based 9&#x0002b;0 axoneme, which forms the skeleton of this &#x0201c;antenna&#x0201d; like extension of the plasma membrane. Whereas the basal body shares many properties with classical centrosomes, made of two centrioles and of a pericentriolar matrix, the axoneme represents a unique domain, characterized by the exclusion of many proteins and the enrichment of specific soluble, cytoplasmic, as well as membrane-associated components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Praetorius1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Christensen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This sorting is achieved through a complex process mediated by highly conserved machineries, involved in both the selection of ciliary proteins, which likely contain specific motifs and the transport along the axonemal microtubule doublets. The components of these machineries can either be specifically devoted to ciliary-protein transport and/or ciliogenesis, as IFT (intraflagellar transport) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Scholey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, or participate in other cellular processes, as reported for the aPKC-par3-par6 polarity cassette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Fan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Sfakianos1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, the 14-3-3 adaptor protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Fan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and Kif3A, a kinesin required for the anterograde transport towards the tip of the PC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Scholey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although we could not find evidence for a role of &#x003b2;arr2 in the basic functions of the centrosome, &#x003b2;arr2 shares with other centrosome-associated proteins a role in cell cycle regulation. The centrosome participates in several different cell cycle regulatory events, such as G1/S transition, cytokinesis, and monitoring of DNA damage, functions which involve the recruitment of specific sets of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Doxsey1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

The strong additive effect of the simultaneous depletion of both &#x003b2;arrs likely reflects the fact that each isoform may have specific points of impact.</p><p>A role of &#x003b2;arr1 was reported in G1/S transition downstream of IGF receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Girnita1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, and via a receptor-independent enhancement of p27 transcription, which, in turn, inhibits G1/S transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Kang1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the mechanism by which &#x003b2;arr2 controls cell cycle appears to be different. &#x003b2;arr2 interacts with mdm2, the E3 ubiquitin ligase controlling the stability of p53, a transcriptional factor which plays a major role in cell cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Shenoy1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x003b2;arr2 was specifically reported to actively exclude mdm2 from the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Wang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, to stabilize p53 by this mechanism, leading to either induction of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Wang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> or cell cycle arrest at G2/M transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Wang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Boularan1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the lack of &#x003b2;arr2 would favour destabilization of p53 and then promote cell cycle progression and increased proliferation, as observed here in cells depleted for &#x003b2;arr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003728-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003728-g006">6</xref>). Altogether, these data support the idea that &#x003b2;arrs have distinct but converging roles in cell cycle regulation and control of cell proliferation.</p><p>Our results strikingly paralleled those reported on Polaris, a protein found at the centrosome in cycling cells, which is involved in intra-ciliary transport and required for ciliogenesis.

Altogether, these notions highlight the functional connections between centrosome-associated proteins, IFT proteins and p53 and highlight the centrosome as a meeting point for both proliferative and anti-proliferative controllers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Doxsey1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another similarity between &#x003b2;arr2 and Polaris is that the increased proliferation observed in &#x003b2;arrs-depleted cells is correlated with reduced ciliogenesis in response to serum starvation, as observed in &#x003b2;arr-deficient MEF and siRNA-treated RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003728-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003728-g006">6</xref> and ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Robert1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>). In a recent study, which also reported the localization of &#x003b2;arrs at PC, &#x003b2;arrs-deficient MEF cells did not show ciliogenesis defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Kovacs1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The discrepancy with our findings is likely due to differences in cell culture conditions. Indeed, the authors of the previous study found that only 20&#x00025; wild-type MEF cells formed PC, consistent with what was previously described for MEF grown in high serum conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Wheatley1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we analyzed ciliogenesis in response to serum starvation, a widely used experimental condition to induce PC assembly. In these conditions we repeatedly observed that &#x0223c;70&#x00025; of wild-type MEF cells were ciliated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003728-g005">Figure 5</xref>), as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Frew1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Altogether, these data suggest that the effect of &#x003b2;arrs expression on ciliogenesis is only observed upon serum starvation.</p><p>In addition, from our data, it appears that the effect on ciliogenesis is likely linked to uncontrolled proliferation rather than direct effect on the ciliogenesis itself. We observed a striking correlation between the inability to enter in G<sub>0</sub> in response to serum starvation, increased proliferation and reduced ciliogenesis. Therefore, if &#x003b2;arr-deficient cells are unable to enter in G<sub>0</sub> even in response to serum starvation they would not be able to build a cilium. In addition, we observed an increased proportion of cycling cells among ciliated single &#x003b2;arr1 and &#x003b2;arr2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003728.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Interestingly, an aberrant outgrowth of PC in cycling cells was recently described upon depletion of Cep97 and CP110 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Spektor1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that depletion of &#x003b2;arrs may also result in a disconnection between the presence of a PC and cell cycle arrest.</p><p>Although the &#x003b2;arr-dependent control of PC formation reflects the role of these proteins on cell proliferation, a direct role in ciliogenesis or in the transport of PC proteins cannot be excluded. The constitutive interaction of &#x003b2;arr2 with 14-3-3 and Kif3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003728-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003728-g008">8</xref>), which are both involved in ciliogenesis, can support this hypothesis. In addition, &#x003b2;arr2 interaction with Kif3A and 14-3-3 proteins might control its transport within PCs. Indeed, in photoreceptor cells, visual arrestin (varr) regulates the signalling activity of rhodopsin, the light-sensing GPCR. In response to light varr is transported from the inner segment (cell body) to the outer segment (rhodopsin containing compartment), through the connecting cilium, which is a modified PC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Calvert1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. In the absence of Kif3A, varr is unable to reach the outer segment in response to light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Marszalek1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that Kif3A is responsible for its transport through the connecting cilium. Finally, in the absence of light, varr is also localized in the connecting cilium and at the basal body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-vanVeen1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Peterson1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, paralleling our observations showing a constitutive targeting of &#x003b2;arr2 to PC. The possible role of Kif3A in the targeting of &#x003b2;arr2 to PC could not be tested in our cellular models, since depletion of Kif3A resulted in major ciliogenesis defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003728.s010">Figure S10</xref>) as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Lin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Takeda1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Corbit2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While this article was in preparation, a recent study reported that &#x003b2;arrs mediate the interaction of smo with Kif3A leading to the targeting of active smo to PC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Kovacs2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether this observation could account for a more general function of &#x003b2;arrs in the targeting of GPCRs to PCs is a key question to be addressed. Our preliminary results indicate that the Somatostatin type 3 receptor (SST3R), a GPCR described in neuronal PC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Handel1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, was efficiently targeted to the axoneme in &#x003b2;arr-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003728.s011">Figure S11</xref>). These data suggest that &#x003b2;arrs are not implicated in the targeting of all GPCRs to PC. Interestingly, contrasting with what was reported for smo, activation of SST3R is not required for PC targeting, which rather appears constitutive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003728.s011">Figure S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Berbari1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>) and dependent on Bardet Bield Syndrome proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Berbari1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another open issue is the exact function of &#x003b2;arr2 within the cilium in the context of GPCRs physiology. Our data indicate that &#x003b2;arr2 is constitutively localized to PC: it was found within the axoneme in serum-starved cells and this localization was not modified by the expression of constitutively active form of smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003728-g004">Figure 4</xref> and data not shown). One of the key functions of &#x003b2;arr2 at the plasma membrane is to mediate internalization of agonist-activated GPCRs through clathrin-coated pits. However, despite the presence of clathrin-coated pits at the base of primary cilia (unpublished observations), there is no evidence in the literature for internalization of proteins found in the membrane of PC. Finally, &#x003b2;arr2 might participate in the desensitization of activated GPCRs localized at PC, as shown for odorant receptors in olfactory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Dawson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Palmitessa1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003728-Ge1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> and reminiscent of the function of varr in the outer segment of visual cells.

To discriminate between Ki-67 negative and positive cells, the average fluorescence intensity of Ki-67 was measured in ciliated cells and nuclei were considered as positive if their Ki-67-associated fluorescence was above this average value.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Deconvolution</title><p>Epifluorescence images were obtained with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss) using a 100&#x000d7; objective (plan-apo) coupled to a &#x0201c;piezzo&#x0201d; enabling acquisition of images every 200 nm in the Z plane. Deconvolution of z-stacks was achieved with metamorph and 3D reconstruction of deconvoluated images with the Imaris software (Bitplane, Scientific solutions, Zurich, Switzerland and Minneapolis, USA).

Description of the immunogenic peptides used to generate anti-&#x003b2;arr2 polyclonal antibodies: The rARR rabbit polyclonal antibody is sold as an antibody against both &#x003b2;arr2 and &#x003b2;arr1 but a single amino-acid difference in the immunogenic peptide makes it more specific for &#x003b2;arr2. The gBARR2 goat polyclonal was raised against a peptide specific of human &#x003b2;arr2 and not conserved in &#x003b2;arr1. However, a single amino acid difference between human and rodent &#x003b2;arr2 is likely to explain its poor reactivity against murine endogenous &#x003b2;arr2 observed in both western blot and immunofluorescence (data not shown). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding for &#x003b2;arr2-GFP, then fixed and stained for the anti-&#x003b2;arr2 antibodies, including the rabbit polyclonal rARR anti-arrestin (A) and the goat polyclonal gBARR2 anti &#x003b2;arrestin2 (B).

It has to be stressed here that, independently of the commercial source, we observed a variability between batches of commercial anti-&#x003b2;arr2 antibodies; while almost all batches did detect overexpressed &#x003b2;arr2, some were unable to detect endogenous &#x003b2;arr2 in neither western-blot or immunofluorescence experiments. The efficiency of each batch was then tested by western-blot using WT and &#x003b2;arrs-KO MEFs as described below.
