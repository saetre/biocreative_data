The first transcription unit begins with the exon 1 sequence and is responsible for the production of plasma SHBG by the hepatocytes, while the second begins with an alternative exon 1 sequence, which replaces the exon 1 present in liver transcripts. Alternative exon 1 transcription and translation has only been demonstrated in the testis of transgenic mice containing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene and in the human testis. Our goal has been to further characterize the 5' end of the SHBG gene and analyze the presence of the SHBG alternative transcripts in human prostate tissue and derived cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using a combination of <italic>in silico </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>studies, we have demonstrated that the SHBG gene, along with exon 1 and alternative exon 1 (renamed here exon 1A), contains four additional alternative first exons: the novel exons 1B, 1C, and 1E, and a previously identified exon 1N, which has been further characterized and renamed as exon 1D. We have shown that these four alternative first exons are all spliced to the same 3' splice site of SHBG exon 2, and that exon 1A and the novel exon 1B can be spliced to exon 1. We have also demonstrated the presence of SHBG transcripts beginning with exons 1B, 1C and 1D in prostate tissues and cell lines, as well as in several non-prostatic cell lines. Finally, the alignment of the SHBG mammalian sequences revealed that, while exons 1C, 1D and 1E are very well conserved phylogenetically through non-primate mammal species, exon 1B probably aroused in apes due to a single nucleotide change that generated a new 5' splice site in exon 1B.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The identification of multiple transcription start sites (TSS) upstream of the annotated first exon of human SHBG, and the detection of the alternative transcripts in human prostate, concur with the prediction of the ENCODE (ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements) project, and suggest that the regulation of SHBG is much more complex than previously reported.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Sex hormone-binding globulin is a dimeric glycoprotein that transports sex steroids in the blood and regulates their access to target tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Human SHBG gene is localized in the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13.1), in a region characterized as hotspot for genetic recombination, gene amplification, and integration of foreign genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In humans, the SHBG gene is constituted by a minimum of two different transcription units regulated by, at least, two different promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The first transcription unit is responsible for the production of plasma SHBG by the hepatocytes, and begins with the exon 1 sequence, which encodes for a leucine rich signal secretion peptide. This transcription unit is regulated by the promoter 1 sequence that contains several binding sites for liver enriched transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The second transcription unit begins with the alternative exon 1 sequence, which replaces the exon 1 present in the liver SHBG transcripts, and is regulated by an alternative promoter sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], that proved to be very active when it was transfected in the GC2 mouse germ cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The alternative exon 1 is found approximately 1.9 kb upstream of the exon 1 sequence, and does not contain an ATG in frame with the SHBG nucleotide coding sequence. It has been hypothesized that transcripts beginning with the alternative exon 1 could potentially initiate translation in the first ATG in frame found in exon 2, which encodes for the methionine 30 of the mature plasma protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The presence of SHBG mRNA has been demonstrated in human liver, brain, cardiac myocytes, adrenal glands, testis, prostate, mammary glands, placenta, fallopian tube, endometrium and granulose-lutein cells of the ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, transcription and translation of SHBG alternative exon 1 have only been shown in the testis of transgenic mice containing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene and in the human testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], resulting in a SHBG isoform that binds androgens and estradiol with high affinity, and accumulates in the acrosome of developing sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In the prostate, the presence of SHBG mRNA and protein has been described in epithelial and stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the transcription unit responsible for the synthesis of these SHBG mRNAs has not been characterized and it is unknown whether the protein found in the human prostatic tissues is translated locally or results from extravascularization of the liver secreted protein, as described in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our goal in the present study has been to identify novel SHBG TSSs since, as indicated by the ENCODE project, about two-thirds of the genes in the 1% of the analyzed human genome had unannotated 5' extensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and determine which SHBG transcription units are active in human prostate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC3, DU-145 and PZ-HPV7 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD).

Furthermore, in both <italic>Macaca </italic>mRNAs, the human 5' splice site was not found due to the presence of a GG sequence instead of the GT donor nucleotides of the human sequence, and therefore exon 1B and exon 1A are present in these mRNAs as one unique exon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of additional SHBG first exons using 5'RLM-RACE</title><p>To further characterize the 5' end of the SHBG gene, we used the FirstChoice<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>RLM-RACE kit to identify 5'capped SHBG transcripts from total RNA of the DU-145 and LNCaP cell lines. To perform the first round of the 5' RACE, we used a forward outer primer that recognized the adapter sequence linked to the 5' end of capped mRNAs, and a reverse primer against exon 5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Nested PCR was performed using a forward inner primer of the adapter sequence and a reverse primer recognizing exon 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In the DU-145 cell line, the two rounds of amplification resulted in one major product of 300 nucleotides approximately (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), that, after cloning and sequencing, corresponded to two different and novel SHBG mRNAs. One RACE product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, RACEfrag 1; 311 nucleotides) contained a novel SHBG first exon of 107 nucleotides followed by exons 2&#x02013;3, and the other RACE product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, RACEfrag 2; 279 nucleotides) consisted of a different and novel first exon of 75 nucleotides, also followed by exons 2&#x02013;3. In the LNCaP cell line, the two rounds of amplification resulted also in one major band of 300 nucleotides approximately (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), that after cloning and sequencing, corresponded to two different transcript sequences of 289 and 341 nucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, RACEfrags 3 and 4).

However, these two RACEfrags contain two different TSS in their 5' end, resulting in an exon of 137 nucleotides when TSS 1 (Chr 17: 7458018) is used, and an exon of 87 nucleotides when the transcription starts at TSS 2 (Chr 17: 7458070) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These sequences are also 27 and 79 nucleotides shorter than the sequence of the exon 1N (164 nucleotides), as the TSS of the later was located at the nucleotide 7457989 of the chromosome 17. Even so, the two variants of the alternative first exon found in the RACEfrags 3 and 4 and the exon 1N share the same 3' end and the same 5'splice site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Interestingly, the 5' end of exon 1N partially overlaps with the sequence of the novel first exon identified in the RACEfrag 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). However, based on our 5'RACE data, the TSS found in the RACEfrag 2, although it is localized further 5'upstream of the TSS described for exon 1N, does not extend the 1N sequence in the 5' end because it uses a different 5' splice site, and, therefore, generates a different 5' exon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>5'RLM-RACE procedure in DU-145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines</bold>.

To analyze the activity of the different SHBG transcription units in prostate tissues and prostate cancer cell lines, we performed RT-PCR using specific forward primers for each of the alternative first exons, as well as an exon 3 forward primer, to determine the global SHBG expression.</p><p>The analysis of cell lines using a specific exon 3 forward primer, showed that all the prostate cell lines analyzed expressed SHBG, with LNCaP and PZ-HPV-7 cells presenting higher relative amounts of total SHBG mRNA compared with the PC3 cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Using the exon 1 forward primer, the levels of SHBG mRNA were higher in PZ-HPV-7 cells than in PC3 cells, whereas almost no expression was found in LNCaP cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). On the contrary, when the exon 1A upper primer was used, the levels of SHBG mRNA were higher in LNCaP than in PC3 cells, whereas almost no expression was detected in PZ-HPV-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). For the exon 1B primer, the maximum levels were found in PZ-HPV7 cells, followed by PC3 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), whereas with the exon 1C primer, similar levels of SHBG were found in the three prostate cancer cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). As in the case of exon 3 forward primer, the use of exon 1D forward primer showed that the relative amounts of this transcript were higher in LNCaP and PZ-HPV7 than in PC3 cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). In contrast, we could not amplify transcripts containing exon 1E in any of the prostate cell lines tested, probably reflecting that their transcription is very low. It is noteworthy that in exon 1A and exon 1B specific RT-PCR products, a faintly upper-than-expected band was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, &#x003b2; band), that once sequenced corresponded to SHBG sequences that included the exon 1 sequence after the exon 1A or exon 1B. These results suggested that exon 1A/exon 1B and exon 1 can be alternatively spliced together and therefore are not always mutually exclusive. When exons 1A or 1B were spliced to exon 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, &#x003b1; band), the 5' consensus splice sites of both first exons and the consensus 3' splice site of exon 2 were used (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). However, when exons 1A or 1B were spliced to exon 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, band &#x003b2;), although the 5' consensus splice sites of exon 1A and 1B were the same, two different 3' splice sites of exon 1 were used, that we named a and b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). While exon 1A was found to be spliced only to the 3' splice site b, exon 1B was alternatively spliced to both a and b splice sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). Additionally, it was also observed that when exon 1A primers were used, a lower-than-expected band was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>; &#x003b3; band), that once sequenced corresponded to SHBG transcripts were exon 1A was spliced to exon 2 and exon 4 was skipped. Using exon 1D primers, a lower-than-expected band was also observed, but in this case, its sequence determined that it corresponded to an unspecific RT-PCR product. No SHBG sequences with non-canonical 5' and 3' consensus splice sites were obtained in any case.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of the different SHBG transcription units in prostatic and non-prostatic cells by RT-PCR</bold>.

As in the case of the prostate cancer cell lines, upper-than-expected RT-PCR bands were detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, &#x003b2; band) that, once sequenced, corresponded to specific SHBG transcripts whose exon 1A and 1B sequences were followed by the exon 1 sequence using the 3' splice sites a and b (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>).

As in the case of prostate cell lines and tissues, the upper-than-expected band corresponding to transcripts where exon 1B is followed by the exon 1 sequence, was also detected in the RH 30, HeLa and HepG2 cell lines. Specifically, in the RH 30 cell line, transcripts containing exon 1B-exon 1 were more abundant than exon 1B-exon 2 transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). The transcription unit containing exon 1C was identified in HeLa, HepG2, Hek 293, CW 9019, RH 30 and <italic>imr </italic>32 cells, but no detectable levels were found in any of the breast cancer cell lines analyzed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).

The major product found in the first round (1.2 kb), coincided with the expected size of the full-length transcript from exon 1C to exon 8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). The 1.2 kb PCR band from both cell lines were excised from the gel, purified and pooled to use it as template DNA for the second round PCR.

The analysis of 44 regions totaling 30 Mb or 1% of the human genome sequence showed that there is a coding protein gene every 62 kb, and that the novel TSSs often mapped upstream loci, since the newly identified TSSs localized on average 186 kb upstream of the most 5' annotated exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Additionally, an increasing number of reports indicate that many eukaryotic genes possess multiple transcriptional promoters associated with alternative first exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In this context, we decided to characterize the 5' end of the human SHBG gene.</p><p>In chromosome 17, where SHBG is localized, alternative splicing has been described to occur extensively, with an average of 5 transcripts per gene, and it has also been shown that in this chromosome, 76.6% of the genes display, at least, two transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the present study, we have used <italic>in silico </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>approaches in order to identify novel 5' SHBG alternative first exons. Using the FirstEF program we identified a potential novel SHBG first exon in the positive strand of chromosome 17, situated -278 nucleotides upstream of the TSS of the SHBG alternative exon 1. We named this potential novel SHBG first exon, exon 1B, and therefore we renamed the previously described alternative exon 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] as exon 1A. Using RT-PCR, we confirmed the presence of SHBG exon 1B transcripts in prostate tissues and cell lines. The length of exon 1B was 104 nucleotides (7471721&#x02013;7471824), but a 5' extension can not be excluded, since its TSS has not been identified yet. Exon 1B overlaps with the nucleotides 169&#x02013;66 of the 5'UTR sequence of the SAT2 gene [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_133491.2">NM_133491.2</ext-link>]. As the SAT2 gene is situated in the negative strand of the chromosome 17, SHBG and SAT2 genes would produce natural sense-antisense pair transcripts that overlap head to head. Moreover, the analysis of the SHBG 5'genomic sequence with the FirstEF program indicates that exon 1B is contained in a CpG island of 202 nucleotides of length (7471655&#x02013;7471855). In this regard, it has been estimated that over 20% of human transcripts might form sense-antisense pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and also that CpG island promoter regions are commonly associated with bidirectional promoter activity (approximately 15% of the imprinted genes have associated antisense transcripts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. One example is the Gabpa-Atp5j genes in mouse, which contain two over-lapping promoters in each direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. When this condition occurs in yeast and bacteria, there is potential for transcriptional interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and it has also been postulated that, in these CpG bidirectional promoters, the activity of one promoter might influence the epigenetic state of the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Using 5'RLM-RACE with cDNA obtained from DU-145 and LNCaP cells, we identified two additional SHBG first exons that were named exons 1C and 1E, and two different sequences corresponding to the previously described exon 1N. These two sequences resulted from two different TSSs, generating exon sequences 27 and 79 nucleotides shorter than exon 1N. We renamed these exon sequences as exon 1D.</p><p>Exon 1C has a length of 107 nucleotides and is localized 253 nucleotides upstream of exon 1B. As in the case of exon 1B, it also overlaps with the SAT 2 gene, specifically with the complete coding sequence of exon 3 and with 44 and 10 nucleotides of intron 3 and intron 2 respectively. The TSS identified by 5'RACE, with T as the nucleotide +1, is displaced just one nucleotide from a consensus Inr element or Cap motif (pyrimidine, pyrimidine, A(+1), N, T/A, pyrimidine, pyrimidine, where N is any nucleotide)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Exon 1D has a length of 137 or 85 nucleotides, depending on which TSS is used, and is localized 13.35 kilobases 5' upstream of exon 1 TSS. Exon 1E has a length of 75 nucleotides and its 3' end is situated only 13 nucleotides upstream of the TSS1 of exon 1D. It overlaps with the intron 1 sequence of the FXR2 gene [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_004860.2">NM_004860.2</ext-link>], situated also in the negative strand. This overlap was previously described in rat chromosome 10, where a GC rich sequence in the alternative promoter of rat SHBG overlapped with the 5' UTR of the FXR2 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These and our results, suggest that the 5' end of the SAT2 and FXR2 genes present a broad range of TSSs in the opposite strand, corresponding to the SHBG gene.</p><p>TATA boxes have been described to be six-fold more common in genes with single promoters than in genes with alternative promoters, and it has been suggested that strong TATA boxes might be incompatible with alternative promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, in exon 1E there is a TATAA sequence situated 30 nucleotides upstream from the TSS1 of exon 1D, probably regulating its transcription initiation. TATA-box directed transcription is normally associated with a sharply defined TSS situated 30&#x02013;31 downstream from the TATA sequence. In contrast, TATA-independent promoters normally present a much broad distribution of TSSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], suggesting that exons 1B, 1C and 1E might present additional TSSs than the ones presented here. Furthermore, while TATA-box promoters are normally associated with tightly regulated transcripts with a strong bias toward postnatal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], broad TSS promoters and CpG promoters are associated with ubiquitous transcripts, and, in the case of genes with alternative promoters, with a weak bias toward prenatal transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These data suggests a differential usage of the SHBG alternative promoters through different stages of development.</p><p>The full-length of transcripts beginning with exon 1B and 1C has been demonstrated. In the case of exon 1C transcript, although the size of the product of the first round PCR suggests that exons 6 and 7 are included in the full-length transcript, it has only been possible to sequence it from exon 1C to exon 5.</p><p>We have shown the presence of exon 1B, 1C and 1D transcripts in prostate cell lines and tissues as well as in several non-prostatic cell lines. These results support that the activity of these different transcription units is not restricted to prostate, as it would be expected for 1B and 1C transcripts, since their promoters do not contain a TATA sequence. As for the 1D transcripts, the activity of the putative TATA promoter remains to be proven. With regard to the relative abundance of the alternative transcripts, real-time PCR assays showed that the highest levels corresponded to the exon 1B transcript in the four cell lines analyzed. Although differences in primer efficiency could not be completely excluded, it would be interesting in the future to elucidate the meaning of these variations.</p><p>All the SHBG exons identified by 5'RACE in this study are very well defined in their 3' end by consensus splice sites sequences (AG/GTRAGT), and they are all spliced directly to the 3'splice site of exon 2, as it was previously described for SHBG exon 1 and exon 1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, when RT-PCR was performed in prostate cancer cell lines and prostate tissues using specific primers for exons 1A and 1B, two different 3'splice sites of exon 1 were used, a and b, both presenting a consensus -AG/G sequence for U2AF65 protein binding, but lacking a clear polypyrimidine tract and branch point. None of this alternative first exons contain in their sequence an ATG in frame with the SHBG coding sequence, suggesting that they act as 5' UTR sequences regulating the translation efficiency from the first ATG in frame of exon 2, which encodes the methionine 30 of the transcripts that begin with exon 1. In this regard, it has been reported that stable mRNA secondary structures in the 5'UTR region (&#x02265;-35 kcal/mol) can decrease considerably the translation efficiency by affecting ribosomal recruitment and positioning at the initiation codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The MFOLD program served us to predict a hairpin stability &#x02265;-40 kcal/mol for exons 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D (TSS1), and -35,8 kcal/mol for exon 1E, supporting that the secondary structure of the different alternative first exons could affect translation efficiency.</p><p>The functional significance of these novel alternative SHBG transcription units will rely on the demonstration of their protein coding capacity or of their action as natural antisense transcripts of genes located on the opposite DNA strand. We tested the former possibility by using different antibodies against SHBG, and detected bands of the expected size in human prostate samples but not in prostate cancer cell lines by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Our preliminary data of transient transfection experiments of different alternative SHBG full-length constructs showed that these transcripts are indeed translated, but their translation efficiency are negatively regulated depending on each specific 5'UTR sequence, as predicted by the MFOLD program. Further studies are required to fully assess and understand the contribution of the use of these alternative transcripts and their probable alternative promoters to regulate transcription and translation, as it has already been demonstrated for other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As for the second possible action, the discovery of novel 5'SHBG exons that overlap with the SAT 2 and FXR 2 sequences (exons 1B, 1C, 1D and 1E) suggests that SHBG-SAT 2 and SHBG-FXR 2 genes might be mutually regulated by transcriptional interference.</p><p>The phylogenetic comparison of the human SHBG alternative first exons with different vertebrate mammalian species showed that exons 1C, 1D and 1E are highly conserved across the species, but exon 1A and specially exon 1B, are by far less conserved. The variation in the degree of conservation of the different SHBG alternative first exons parallels the degree of conservation of their 5' splice sites: while the 5'splice site of exons 1A and 1B are only conserved within primate species, the ones of exons 1C, 1D and 1E are conserved in primate and non-primate species. These data suggest that 1A and 1B are recently evolved exons, with higher evolutionary turnover rate, especially exon 1B, which was created about 25 million years ago, when apes diverged from Old World monkeys.</p><p>The estimation of the total number of human protein-coding genes falls between 20000&#x02013;25000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], whereas those of simpler organisms as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>are not much lower, with 13000 and 18000 genes respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It was hypothesized that functional diversity of this limited number of genes is necessary to create the highly elaborated systems necessary for mammalian live [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage are well-described mechanisms that produce an elevated number of protein-coding and non-coding transcripts from a single gene locus. In the framework of the ENCODE project it was observed that 86% of the interrogated multi-exon gene loci in the ENCODE regions presented alternative splicing generating &#x0003e; 5.4 transcripts per gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Our analysis showed that, at least, one additional transcription unit (exon 1B) aroused in apes, due to a single nucleotide change that generated a new 5' splice site in exon 1B.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we have identified three novel alternative SHBG first exons (exons 1B, 1C and 1E), and further characterized an alternative SHBG first exon previously introduced in the public databases (exon 1D). We have also demonstrated the activity of the transcription units containing exons 1B, 1C and 1D in human prostate tissues and prostatic and non-prostatic cell lines. In view of these results, it will be necessary to determine the significance of these alternative TSSs in terms of regulation of expression of SHBG or overlapping genes on the opposite strand. Additionally, it would be interesting, in the future, to ascertain whether the appearance of a SHBG alternative transcript in humans confers any evolutionary advantage.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TP and ABD carried out the major part of the experiments and data analysis.
