However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene and coordinate multiple MDR-related genes expression are poorly understood. In a previous study, we identified a new 12 bp <italic>cis</italic>-activating region in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the human MDR1 gene, which we called inverted MED1. In the present study, we characterized the precise binding element, which we named invMED1, and revealed the presence of the LRP130 protein as the nuclear factor. Its binding intensity increases with the endogenous <italic>MDR1</italic> geneexpression and with the MDR level of CEM leukemia cells. Interestingly, the LRP130 level did not vary with the chemoresistance level. We observed the involvement of LRP130 in the transcriptional activity of the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene promoter, and moreover, in that of the MDR-related, invMED1-containing, <italic>MVP</italic> gene promoter. We used siRNAs and transcriptional decoys in two unrelated human cancer cell lines to show the role of the invMED1&#x0002f;LRP130 couple in both <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> endogenous genes activities. We showed that invMED1 was localized in the &#x02212;105&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 and &#x02212;148&#x0002f;&#x02212;143 regions of the <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> gene promoters, respectively. In addition, since the invMED1 sequence is primarily located in the &#x02212;160&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 bp region of mammalian MDR-related genes, our results present the invMED1&#x0002f;LRP130 couple as a potential central regulator of the transcription of these genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>One of the most investigated mechanisms of multidrug resistance (MDR) is drug efflux mediated by carriers with a broad substrate specificity. It results mainly from the overproduction of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a transmembrane protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. Pgp is encoded by the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene in human and by <italic>mdr</italic>1a and <italic>mdr</italic>1b genes in rodents. ABC transporters utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport a large variety of substrates including chemotherapeutic drugs across biological membranes. Other ABC transporters such as the multidrug resistance-associated proteins MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP4 and MRP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c5">5</xref>), and the breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c6">6</xref>), also named MXR (mitoxantrone resistance), may be overproduced alone or in any combination by chemoresistant cells. MDR3, a protein closely related to Pgp, acts as a phosphatidylcholine translocase and may also be involved in drug transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Although the lung resistance protein (LRP) is not an ABC transporter, it is involved in the MDR phenotype as the expression of its gene closely reflects the chemoresistance profile of many cancer cell lines and tumors. LRP was found to be identical to the major vault protein (MVP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c10">10</xref>) and makes up &#x0003e;70% of the total mass of the vault complex, a large-sized ribonucleoprotein found mostly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c11">11</xref>) and in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c13">13</xref>). Vaults are present with high levels in tissues chronically exposed to xenobiotics and may mediate multidrug resistance by transporting drugs away from their intracellular targets or by transporting them to exocytic vesicles or efflux pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c14">14</xref>). In several clinical studies, but not all, increased MVP expression is associated in general with a higher level of drug resistance analyzed <italic>in vitro</italic> by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c16">16</xref>). Interestingly, in acute myeloid leukemia, the worst response and&#x0002f;or survival rate to the treatment was observed in patients who co-expressed MVP and Pgp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c20">20</xref>). Moreover, in breast cancer, <italic>MVP</italic> expression, as well as <italic>MDR</italic>1 expression, have been correlated to the presence of nodal metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c21">21</xref>).</p><p>MDR-related genes share some common features concerning their transcriptional regulation. Human genes examined to date lack a TATA box, while other rodents homologs are TATA-dependent. In human, an initiator element (INR) has been functionally described in the <italic>MDR</italic>1 promoter and near-consensus INR sequences are present within the promoters of <italic>MRP</italic>2 and <italic>BCRP</italic> genes. Like most other TATA-less genes, MDR-related genes generally possess both CCAAT box and GC-rich elements for their constitutive transcription. Tumor suppressor and oncogene-responsive elements are also present, explaining the high level of expression often observed in drug-naive tumors. For example, <italic>MDR</italic>1, <italic>MRP</italic>1 and probably <italic>MVP</italic> human genes contain a p53 element. In addition, these genes together with MRP2 also contain an AP-1 element.</p><p>However, few data have been reported to date on an eventual link between regulatory elements specifically relevant to multidrug resistance and the transcription of MDR-related genes. Those that are available require confirmation, as this is the case for MEF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c23">23</xref>) and SXR binding elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c24">24</xref>). The latter seems to be the most interesting at the moment since it is present in human <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MRP</italic>3 genes (and also in the rat <italic>MRP</italic>2 homolog), and is thought to coordinate the regulation of drug metabolism and efflux, through co-activation of MDR-related and CYP3A4 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c24">24</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies, we identified a 12 bp region spanning the &#x02212;108 to &#x02212;97 bp sequence of the human <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene and suggested the presence of a transcriptional activator element in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c25">25</xref>); we reported the possible link that could exist between this region, which specifically binds an unknown factor, and the level of chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c26">26</xref>). Here, we characterized the <italic>cis</italic>-element&#x0002f;<italic>trans</italic>-acting factor couple involved and investigated its relation to the MDR phenotype. We precisely localized the <italic>cis</italic>-activating element at position &#x02212;105&#x0002f;&#x02212;100, which we named invMED1, and identified the LRP130 protein as a component of the nuclear factor that binds this element. We demonstrated that the invMED1&#x0002f;LRP130 complex formation increased with the chemoresistance level. We searched for the presence of the invMED1 sequence in MDR-related genes, and localized it in human <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> genes. Moreover, we have shown that an accurate transcriptional activity for both of them depends on the presence of the LRP130 protein. Finally, the presence of the invMED1 sequence in the &#x02212;160&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 region of several MDR-related genes in human and rodents suggests that the invMED1&#x0002f;LRP130 couple could be a possible central regulator of these MDR-related genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Cell culture medium (RPMI-1640), fetal calf serum (FCS), antibiotic and antimycotic solution (containing 10&#x02009;000 IU&#x0002f;ml penicillin, 10 mg&#x0002f;ml streptomycin and 25 &#x003bc;g&#x0002f;ml amphotericin B), trypsin&#x02013;ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were from Sigma (St Quentin Fallavier, France).

The retarded band that we previously detected with the 12 bp ODN still occurred with a 6 bp ODN centered on the &#x02212;108&#x0002f;&#x02212;97 promoter region (ODN6), but was lost when 5 bp ODNs (ODN5A and ODN5B) were used (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f1">1</xref>A). When 6 bp ODNs spanning a 10 bp window centered on the &#x02212;108&#x0002f;&#x02212;97 region were used, we showed that the only ODN that was involved in nuclear factor binding was ODN6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f1">1</xref>B), the mutation of which completely abrogated the binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f1">1</xref>C). The multiple bands seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f1">1</xref>B corresponded to non-specific binding or were specific to other factors whose binding elements could overlap invMED1; but they disappeared to the benefit of the invMED1&#x0002f;LRP130 couple interaction when the reaction was carried out in the presence of ODN12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>In order to determine whether the invMED1 flanking bases modified the binding of the nuclear factor, 6 bp ODNs were substituted at their first, last or both bases (ODN6L, ODN6R, ODN6LR, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f1">1</xref>D). In all cases, no retarded band could be detected. In addition, use of 8 or 10 bp ODNs (ODN8 and ODN10) did not significantly change the binding pattern when compared with that of ODN6. Moreover, when one or two extreme bases of these ODNs were substituted (ODN8LR and ODN10LR), no significant change was seen in the retardation pattern. These results suggest that the binding site for a nuclear factor on the &#x02212;108&#x0002f;&#x02212;97 region of the human <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene promoter is the actual invMED1 GGGAGC sequence, at position &#x02212;105&#x0002f;&#x02212;100.</p><p>It is interesting to note that we have found the same retarded band with the same characteristic retardation pattern in several other cell lines such as primary cultures of NHF skin fibroblasts, HepG2 hepatocarcinoma, HT-1080 skin fibrosarcoma, HeLa cervix carcinoma cell line, MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma, A549 lung carcinoma and IPC227 uveal (ciliary body) melanoma and others shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f2">2</xref>, while we did not find it in other uveal melanomas such as the human MU2 choroidal melanoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Presence of the invMED1 DNA sequence in promoter regions of MDR- and non-MDR-related genes</title><p>The characterization of the precise sequence of the invMED1 element allowed us to search for its presence in other MDR-related gene promoters. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh722tb1">1</xref> shows that the invMED1 sequence is present in 7 out of 16 human and rodent MDR-related gene promoters cloned to date. Interestingly, positions of these sequences in promoters are closely located in the &#x02212;160&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 region of these genes.</p><p>To calculate the occurrence of the invMED1 element, we analyzed the 1869 non-MDR-related human promoters that are deposited in the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epd.isb-sib.ch/">http://www.epd.isb-sib.ch/</ext-link>). Among these, 609 (32.5%) contained at least one invMED1 occurrence (most of the occurrences being partitioned between 1 in 449 promoters, 2 in 160 promoters and 3 in 24 promoters), for a total number of 900 occurrences in their &#x02212;499&#x0002f;&#x0002b;100 bp window relative to the &#x0002b;1 transcription start site.</p><p>The distribution of the A, C, G and T nucleotides out of the 600 bp for each promoter does not follow a random probability of 0.25 per nucleotide. Indeed, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f3">3</xref>A, the [C,G] percentage increases regularly from &#x02212;499 to &#x0002b;100 to reach 33% for G and 31% for C.</p><p>The theoretical probability of having one invMED1 occurrence would be 0.25<sup>6</sup>. Knowing that the invMED1 sequence is rich in GC (GGGAGC), and taking into account the nucleotide distribution between &#x02212;499 and &#x0002b;100, the probability of having an occurrence regularly increases from 0.00029 to 0.00067 and reaches a maximum of 0.00065 between the &#x0002b;1 and &#x0002b;100 region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f3">3</xref>B). One should thus expect to find a higher frequency of occurrences at position &#x02212;99&#x0002f;&#x0002b;100 than elsewhere. However, the observed&#x0002f;theoretical ratio for the invMED1 occurrence shows that the latter is more frequent in the &#x02212;299&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 window relative to the &#x0002b;1 start point. This result is consistent with our finding of invMED1 sequence in both <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> genes at positions &#x02212;105&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 and &#x02212;148&#x0002f;&#x02212;143, respectively. The same observation could be made with non-MDR-related rodent genes: 28% and 24.4% of the deposited 196 mouse and 119 rat promoters, respectively, contained at least one GGGAGC occurrence in the &#x02212;499&#x0002f;&#x0002b;100 region. Taking into account the nucleotide distribution, the observed&#x0002f;theoretical frequency was 1.9 in the &#x02212;199&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 region of mouse promoters, and 1.8 and 2.1 in the &#x02212;299&#x0002f;&#x02212;200 and &#x02212;199&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 regions of rat promoters, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of the nuclear factor with the invMED1 DNA sequence as a function of the chemoresistance level of CEM cells</title><p>Using the chemosensitive CEM parental cell line and its CEM&#x0002f;VLB0.45, CEM&#x0002f;VLB5 and CEM&#x0002f;VLB10 chemoresistant derivatives, we investigated the nuclear factor-binding capacity to invMED1 as a function of the chemoresistance level. In these cell lines, overexpression of the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene was the sole mechanism of MDR that we were able to determine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c28">28</xref>). We observed a correlation between the increasing level of expression of the MDR phenotype, the increasing <italic>MDR</italic>1 mRNA levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f4">4</xref>A), and the invMED1 binding intensity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f4">4</xref>B and C). This result suggests that the invMED1 binding capacity of the specific nuclear factor depends on the cellular level of the MDR phenotype. Interestingly, the LRP130 production levels in chemoresistant CEM cells did not significantly vary relative to the parental sensitive cells, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f4">4</xref>D.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the invMED1 binding factor</title><p>In order to characterize the nuclear protein(s) that binds to the invMED1 sequence, total nuclear proteins were fractionated by heparin&#x02013;sepharose chromatography with increasing KCl concentrations.

The data showed a single labeled band with an apparent molecular weight of &#x0223c;150 kDa. To further characterize the protein content of the labeled band, the latter was analyzed by nano-liquid-chromatography coupled with MS&#x02013;MS spectrometry, because of the very small amount of protein available. Twelve peptides were retrieved (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh722tb2">2</xref>), the sequences of which belong to a 130 kDa, leucine-rich protein named LRP130 (also named LRPPRC, Swissprot accession no.

The fragments analyzed covered 14.1% of the 1273 residues spanning the entire LRP130 sequence.</p><p>To verify that the invMED1 binding factor actually contained LRP130, an EMSA experiment was carried out with the &#x003b1;F-N anti-LRP130 monoclonal antibody. The supershift obtained suggests that LRP130 was directly involved in the binding to invMED1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f6">6</xref>A). Moreover, LRP130 was effectively eluted from DNA-affinity chromatography experiments with DNA reproducing repeats of the invMED1 sequence. This result was demonstrated by mass spectrometry analysis of the major protein band revealed by silver staining of an SDS&#x02013;PAGE experiment performed with the eluted fractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f6">6</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the invMED1 DNA sequence in the transcriptional activity of the <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> gene promoters</title><p>To test the role of the invMED1 sequence in the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene promoter, transient transfections of CEM cells with reporter plasmid constructs were carried out. The constructs tested contained either a full-length <italic>MDR</italic>1 promoter or a promoter in which the invMED1 sequence was deleted. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f7">7</xref>A, deletion of the invMED1 sequence reduced the relative transcriptional activity by &#x0223c;60%. Therefore, the invMED1 sequence appears to be a positive regulatory element of the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene promoter.</p><p>To support this result we extended this approach to the endogenous <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene in resistant CEM&#x0002f;VLB5 cells that had been transfected with a phosphorothioate-modified ODN6 decoy reproducing the invMED1 element. Transcriptional decoys are short, double-stranded ODNs reproducing a transcriptional element. When they are introduced in high quantities in the cell, such ODNs are thought to lure the specific nuclear factor (or members of the factor family) that naturally binds their sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c35">35</xref>).</p><p>Modulation of the presence of <italic>MDR</italic>1 mRNA induced by the transcriptional decoy was recorded to test the functional effect of the invMED1 element on expression of the endogenous <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f7">7</xref>B shows a significant decrease in the expression of <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene transcripts 3 days after transfer of the specific decoy. These results strongly suggest an activating role of invMED1 on the endogenous <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene. In addition, they confirm our previous finding that the 12mer ODN (ODN12) used as a transcriptional decoy for the human <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene promoter decreased the viability of resistant CEM&#x0002f;VLB0.45 cells in the presence of vinblastine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c25">25</xref>).</p><p>In order to evaluate the impact of the invMED1 DNA sequence on the transcriptional activity of endogenous <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> genes-expressing cells, we used the transcriptional decoy strategy in the human IPC227 ciliary body melanoma cell line, which co-expresses both MDR-related genes. We transfected phosphorothioate-modified, double-stranded ODN6 reproducing the invMED1 element sequence in the IPC227 cell line. Three days after transfection, cells were analyzed for their relative <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> transcript contents. After RT&#x02013;PCR, quantification of specific PCR products was done by laser scan densitometry. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f7">7</xref>C shows that an invMED1 decoy (ODN6) induced a marked decrease of the expression of <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> transcripts whereas the use of a decoy bearing a G&#x0002f;A substitution at position 3 (ODN6M) did not produce any significant effect on the level of both transcripts.

From a functional point of view, this result indicates that LRP130 exerts a positive transcriptional control on the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene. On the other hand, the same siRNA did not exert any significant transcriptional control over the invMED1-deleted construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f8">8</xref>), indicating that the transcriptional control played by LRP130 on the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene promoter depends on the invMED1 element.</p><p>To examine the role of LRP130 in the <italic>MVP</italic> gene expression, we constructed a reporter plasmid containing the <italic>MVP</italic> promoter region. The plasmid was then transiently transfected with or without an siRNA directed against LRP130 into CEM cells, and reporter gene expression levels were measured. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f9">9</xref>, inhibition of LRP130 by an siRNA resulted in an important reduction (&#x0003e;60%) of the reporter gene expression. This suggests that LRP130 exerts a positive effect on the <italic>MVP</italic> gene promoter activity.</p><p>To attribute a role to LRP130 in endogenous <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> genes expression, transient transfections of the human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line were performed, using siRNA-producing constructs directed against LRP130 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f10">10</xref>). Three days after transfection, the level of <italic>LRP130</italic> transcripts was significantly reduced. In addition, the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene was almost totally knocked down, the <italic>MVP</italic> mRNA levels were highly lowered, while the expression of <italic>MRP</italic>1, which does not contain an invMED1 sequence, did not change. This result suggests that LRP130 could up-regulate the transcription of <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> genes, although we cannot exclude possible post-transcriptional effects on their mRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>MDR-related genes are key components of the cell and tissue drug defense networks. Several studies have shown that <italic>MDR</italic>1 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by a number of <italic>cis</italic>-elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c36">36</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of human <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene regulation are not yet well defined. In a previous study, we used a 12 bp transcriptional decoy reproducing the &#x02212;108&#x0002f;&#x02212;97 region of the human <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene; we demonstrated its ability to reduce the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene transcription, thus resulting in the chemosensitization of resistant CEM&#x0002f;VLB0.45 cells to treatment with vinblastine, and showed the presence of a <italic>cis</italic>-element in the &#x02212;108&#x0002f;&#x02212;97 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c26">26</xref>). In this study, screening of pre-selected sequences by gel mobility shift assays allowed us to determine the precise boundaries of the nuclear factor-binding site at position &#x02212;105 to &#x02212;100, which we called invMED1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f1">1</xref>).</p><p>Sixteen human, mouse and rat MDR-related gene promoters have been cloned to date. We showed that seven of them possess an invMED1 sequence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh722tb1">1</xref>). The position similarities of the invMED1 elements found, particularly in the &#x02212;160&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 region (and more precisely &#x02212;105&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 and &#x02212;148&#x0002f;&#x02212;143 regions for <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic>, respectively), suggested a possible functional role. Directed deletion experiments and cell transfection with transcriptional decoys demonstrated that this sequence is required for the <italic>MDR</italic>1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f7">7</xref>A) and <italic>MVP</italic> promoters' activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f9">9</xref>). Besides the MDR-related genes, the analysis of 1869 human promoters deposited in the Eukaryotic Promoter Databank shows that only 32.5% have at least one occurrence of the GGGAGC hexanucleotide. Although the frequency of the latter increases with the increased G and C nucleotides between &#x02212;499 and &#x0002b;100 bp, our analysis showed that the observed frequency exceeded 1.8 times the theoretical frequency in the &#x02212;299&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 bp segment. The significant presence of the hexanucleotide in this area suggests its biological utility and is in all the cases consistent with the position of the functional invMED1 element in the MDR-related genes that we studied. The extended analysis to the rodent gene promoters of the Eukaryotic Promoter Database confirmed that the &#x02212;299&#x0002f;&#x02212;100 region displayed a frequency for the observed GGGAGC occurrence that was significantly higher than the theoretical one, suggesting its possible involvement in yet unknown gene regulatory processes.</p><p>A search for potential invMED1 binding protein candidates was carried out using promoter databases such as TRANSFAC&#x000ae; professional. No known or described nuclear factor was retrieved. We therefore performed a series of experiments to further identify potential candidates. Our results revealed the presence of LRP130 in the invMED1 binding nuclear complex (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh722tb2">2</xref>). We performed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in cellulo</italic> experiments to confirm the involvement of the LRP130 protein in the invMED1 transcriptional activity of the <italic>MDR</italic>1 gene (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f8">8</xref>). The LRP130 protein, also called LRPPRC, is a leucine-rich protein of &#x0223c;130 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c37">37</xref>), the function of which is still under investigation. This protein has been reported to bind to nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c38">38</xref>) and mitochondrial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c39">39</xref>) polyadenylated RNAs, possibly being involved in their transport. Mutations in its gene sequence have also been involved in the natural history of the Leigh syndrome, French&#x02013;Canadian type, a human cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c40">40</xref>). LRP130 seems to play several other intracellular roles, which are currently under investigation, like cytoskeletal organization, vesicular trafficking and chromosome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c42">42</xref>). Here we bring the proof of a new functionality that this protein exerts in the transcriptional regulation of two MDR-related genes, <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic>. Interestingly, our data are supported by two-hybrid experiments, which suggest a possible link between LRP130 and some factors involved in the transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c41">41</xref>).</p><p>The presence of an invMED1 sequence in multiple mammalian MDR-related genes suggests its possible link to the MDR phenotype. We investigated the invMED1-binding capacity of the LRP130 factor as a function of the chemoresistance level of CEM cell lines. The correlation observed between the level of expression of the MDR phenotype, the <italic>MDR</italic>1 mRNA level and the invMED1-binding intensity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f4">4</xref>), suggests that the transcriptional effect of the invMED1&#x0002f;LRP130 couple depends on the cellular level of the MDR phenotype. Even though the invMED1&#x0002f;LRP130 complex formation increased with the chemoresistance level, the total amount of LRP130 available in both sensitive and resistant cells remained almost identical in all the cell lines. This is probably due to the fact that the total amount of LRP130 in both sensitive and resistant cells is always largely above the very small quantity that is needed to form the invMED1&#x0002f;LRP130 complex.</p><p>Because of its involvement in the co-regulation of <italic>MDR</italic>1 and <italic>MVP</italic> genes, as we have shown in two different human cancer cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f7">7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh722f10">10</xref>), and possibly of other MDR-related genes, the invMED1&#x0002f;LRP130 complex may be regarded as a central element in the hypothesis of a functional multidrug resistance mechanism in which drugs could effectively be conveyed inside the cytoplasm by vaults and be expelled out of the cell by membrane pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh722c14">14</xref>). The involvement of LRP130 in several cellular mechanisms as well as the very weak fraction implicated in the activator complex allow the prediction that its knocking down may be harmful for cellular survival.
