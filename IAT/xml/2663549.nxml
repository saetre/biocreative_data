Under such hypoxic conditions, fibroblast proliferation with enhanced production of extracellular matrix (ECM) and marked fibrosis are key components to understanding tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Fibroblast proliferation with enhanced production of ECM is an important feature of hypoxia-associated lung diseases, and several in vitro studies have also shown that exposure to moderate hypoxia stimulates the proliferation of lung fibroblasts, with enhanced production of collagen molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, hypoxia is one of the factors known to cause secondary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. According to a WHO statement in 1996, there were approximately 140 million people living at altitudes above 2500 m and there are several areas of permanent habitation at altitudes in excess of 4000 m. After several weeks of exposure to high altitude, lowlanders develop pulmonary hypertension, which is not completely reversed by supplemental oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting development of vascular remodeling of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Secondary pulmonary hypertension is characterized by proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and pulmonary arterial fibroblasts with enhanced deposition of ECM in small pulmonary vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These results suggest that hypoxic enhancement of lung fibroblast proliferation contributes to the deposition of collagen fibrils in the lung and progression of hypoxia-associated lung diseases.</p><p>Under normal physiological conditions, the majority of pulmonary cells are in a quiescent state, so for proliferation of pulmonary cells, which underlies pulmonary remodeling, cells must enter the cell cycle. The most important molecular event necessary for progress of the cell cycle is phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-cyclin complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. CDK activity can be inhibited by CDK inhibitors (CKI) such as p21 and p27. Up-regulation of CKI blocks cell cycle progression in the G1 phase, and down-regulation of CKI is required for entry into the S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the effect of hypoxia on mammalian cell proliferation seems to be dependent on the cell type and on oxygen concentration. In several cell types, severe hypoxia or chemically induced anoxia has been shown to induce G1 cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], whereas moderate hypoxia has been shown to enhance cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The results of previous studies have suggested that p21 plays an important role in oxygen-dependent cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and that p27 regulates both hypoxic pulmonary remodeling and cell cycle arrest in severe hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>CKI p21 is a key regulator of the cell cycle when cells are exposed to oxidative stress or NO, and plays an important role in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation via induction of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In tumors expressing wild-type p53, the locations of cells undergoing apoptosis strongly correlate with regions of hypoxia, whereas tumors expressing mutant p53 have lower levels of apoptosis in hypoxic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. p53 knock-out mutant cells are more resistant to hypoxia-induced apoptosis, and have a selective growth advantage compared with wild-type p53 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These results support the view that p53 has opposite functions toward cell proliferation under hypoxia. In addition, p53 accumulation under hypoxic conditions is linked to hypoxia inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;), which is known to be a central transcriptional factor operating during hypoxia toward angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Given these previous findings, it seems likely that p21, p27 and p53 are key mediators in the hypoxic proliferation of lung fibroblasts. However, little is known about the interactions between these proteins in this situation. Moreover, it is also uncertain whether hypoxic accumulation of p53 induces functional p21 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], since severe hypoxia and anoxia have been reported to induce p53 protein by a pathway different from the pathway induced by DNA-damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The purpose of this study was to investigate the participation of and interaction between p21, p27 and p53 with respect to the effect of hypoxic pulmonary proliferation in cultured normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) during hypoxia, and with respect to anoxia chemically induced by desferroxamine (DFX). DFX is known as an iron chelator which depletes iron and inhibits oxygen, Fe<sup>2+-</sup>, and oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Chemicals and materials were obtained from the following sources: FGM-2 medium, recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF), gentamycin, streptomycin and amphotericin B came from Sanko Junyaku Co., Ltd.

The cells were then incubated for another 24 h in various oxygen concentrations, and various concentrations of DFX were added to some cultures. BrdU incorporation was measured using a BrdU proliferation assay kit in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were labeled with 10 ng/ml BrdU during incubation. After labeling, the cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed, air dried and treated with mouse anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (1:1000). After aspiration of the antibody solution, the cells were washed three times and incubated with peroxidase goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) at room temperature for 30 min, then the cells were washed three times and 100 &#x003bc;M substrate solution was added to each well.

Next, the cells were incubated for 24 h in various concentrations of oxygen. To measure the DNA content, the cells were harvested using trypsin and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and fixed with 70% ethanol.

Total cellular RNA was obtained from the cells by a single extraction with an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform mixture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Each sample was quantified, and then 25 &#x003bc;g of protein was loaded onto each lane of a 4 &#x02013; 12% Bis-Tris Nupage gel with MES SDS running buffer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane by electrophoresis at 100 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked using PBS, 0.2% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 h. All antibodies were diluted in the same blocking buffer. The membrane was then probed with rabbit anti-p21 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution), rabbit anti-p27 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution), mouse anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution), and mouse anti-&#x003b2;-actin monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution), and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature.

We also demonstrated that both severe hypoxia and DFX cause cell cycle arrest via the p53-p21 pathway, but that moderate hypoxia enhances cell proliferation via a p21 pathway that is independent of p53 and p27. Further, our results suggest that p27 may be involved in compensating for p53 in serum-stimulated NHLF proliferation.</p><p>Increased levels of growth factors derived from the accumulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; are thought to regulate pulmonary arterial cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions, given that partial HIF-1&#x003b1; deficiency decreases the remodeling of pulmonary arterioles in animals exposed to chronic hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Although HIF-1&#x003b1; regulates various transcriptional genes encoding angiogenic factors, severe hypoxia and iron depletion induce cell growth arrest. Our finding that severe hypoxia (0.1% oxygen) suppresses nucleotide synthesis is in line with the findings of previous studies in which several tumor cell lines were cultured under hypoxic conditions or with iron chelators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In other studies, it has been found that moderate hypoxia (1 &#x02013; 5% oxygen) enhances the proliferation of rat and bovine PASMC, airway-smooth muscle cells, lung fibroblasts and mesangial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our findings that DNA synthesis is increased during moderate hypoxia, and that the NHLF cell cycle progresses more quickly under hypoxic than normoxic conditions, are also compatible with previous findings.</p><p>There are some discrepancies regarding serum stimulation when we compare our results using NHLF and previous data obtained with human pulmonary artery fibroblasts which proliferate in the face of hypoxia and low levels of serum stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We do not have a complete answer for this discrepancy at this time. However, several papers have shown that normal fibroblasts (non-pulmonary artery fibroblasts) exposed to hypoxia need relatively high serum concentrations for posttranscriptional processing or cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], suggesting that pulmonary artery fibroblasts have a greater proliferative potential than normal fibroblasts. In addition, we assume that several CDK inhibitors associated with replicative senescence, which has been known to be associated with an increase in expression of p16, p21, and p19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], may play a role in this discrepancy. Further, serum depletion causes cell cycle arrest and an accumulation of p27 protein, and this degradation is enhanced by serum stimulation and hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Taken together, we speculate that this increase of CDK inhibitors likely influences cell growth and reactions to serum stimulation during hypoxia, and our cells require relatively high levels of serum to grow compared to the pulmonary artery fibroblasts. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>p21 has been shown to regulate cell cycle progression through either a p53-dependent or -independent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Under conditions of moderate hypoxia, we observed decreased p21 expression and increased DNA synthesis with progress of the cell cycle in NHLF. In these cells, however, p53 protein was not affected, and decreased p21 stability was observed. These results indicate that the decrease in p21 expression in moderate hypoxia is independent of the p53 pathway, and is probably induced by a decrease in the stability of p21 mRNA. The precise molecular mechanism responsible for p53-independent p21 mRNA instability after exposure to moderate hypoxia remains unclear. However, Esposio et al. found that p21 protects cells from oxidative stress by inhibiting DNA replication, and that oxidative stress stabilizes p21 mRNA through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In addition, hyperoxic conditions and application of hyperbaric oxygen induce p21 protein independently of p53 protein and lung injury caused by oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These observations may explain why a p53-independent decrease in p21 was observed in moderately hypoxic conditions. The decrease in p21 and cell proliferation during moderate hypoxia could be due to the secondary effects of decreased oxidative stress and release of free oxygen radicals. However, further studies are essential in order to determine the nature of the hypoxic regulation of p21.</p><p>p53 protein expression must ordinarily rely on post-transcriptional events, given that p53 protein is a very short-lived protein owing to fast proteasomal degradation, and that stabilization of the protein in response to a variety of stresses, including hypoxic stress, has been found to evoke a rapid increase in p53 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In the present study we found that p53 protein expression was increased after severe hypoxic exposure and incubation with DFX, and that p21 mRNA and protein expression also occurred. However, in several previous studies using tumor cell lines with the wild-type p53 gene, p53 accumulation caused by iron chelators was found to induce p21 mRNA, but p21 protein was not expressed in response to inhibition of p21 translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Fukuchi et al. reported that p21 protein accumulation caused by iron chelators was dependent on inhibition of the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and Le et al. reported that p21 translation in the presence of DFX required iron, since this translational disorder could be reversed by the iron donor ferric ammonium citrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This discrepancy between our results and those of previous studies could be explained by differences in the cell lines used, because different cell lines may have different hypoxic tolerances relative to each proteasomal activity or capacity for iron content. However, the precise mechanism underlying this discrepancy is unknown and the matter requires further investigation.</p><p>Mutations in p53 and reduced expression of p27 are frequently observed in many human cancer cells, and reduced expression of p27 is a common feature in cancers with mutations in p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Tumor development in p53 mutant mice was also found to be accelerated by loss of only a single allele of p27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. These findings indicate that p27 is an important cell cycle regulator in cells that have a mutated p53 gene. In the present study, gene silencing of p53 increased p27 protein expression, and gene silencing of p27 could not suppress the increase in moderate hypoxia-induced DNA synthesis. p27 protein expression was not affected by mild hypoxia in our experiments. On the contrary, p21 protein expression in p27 gene silenced NHLF was significantly decreased in mild hypoxia. These results indicate that p27 gene silencing could not suppress the growth of hypoxic NHLF because the regulation of the p21 protein, which may have a critical role in mild hypoxic proliferation, was still active. Surprisingly, silencing of the p53 gene did not induce a significant increase in DNA synthesis at ambient oxygen concentrations, whereas p21 expression was significantly suppressed in these cells and silencing of the p21 gene had a marked effect on proliferation. Given these results, we conclude that p27 does not play a central role in oxygen-dependent NHLF proliferation, but does play a role in compensating for p53-suppressed proliferation in NHLF. Wu et al. reported that in serum-stimulated fibroblasts from p53 knock-out mice, p21 could not be activated, but p27 protein could be induced without a decrease in cyclin A expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. This compensative role of p27 in the loss of the p53 protein is in line with the results of our study. In addition, our results regarding p21 and p53 gene silencing also suggest that accumulation of p53 during hypoxia or DFX treatment plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation via the p53-p21 pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We showed that decreased oxygen levels increased NHLF proliferation but very low oxygen levels caused cell cycle arrest. Decreased expression of p21 protein may play a p53-independent role during hypoxia-induced NHLF proliferation, but hypoxic cell cycle arrest is regulated by p21 induction by hypoxic accumulation of p53. p27 may have a compensatory role for the p53 pathway. Hypoxic pulmonary fibroblast proliferation may contribute to the progression of hypoxia-associated fibroblastic lung diseases and hypoxic pulmonary remodeling. We believe that a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms in hypoxic NHLF will lead to improved modes of therapy for hypoxia-associated changes in lung tissue structure and aid in the remodeling of the lung.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SM conceived the ideas investigated in this study, carried out the laboratory measurements and drafted the manuscript.
