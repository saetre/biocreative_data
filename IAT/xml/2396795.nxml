SVs release neurotransmitter at specialized sites called active zones (AZs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>), which appear by electron microscopy as domains containing docked SVs intermingled with tufts of electron-dense material. These electron-dense tufts are thought to represent the cytoskeletal matrix assembled at the AZ (CAZ), which is comprised of a collection of multidomain scaffold proteins including ELKS (ERC/CAST), Liprin1&#x003b1;, RIMs, RIMBPs, Bassoon, and Piccolo. The CAZ has hypothesized roles in structurally defining the AZ, maintaining it in register with postsynaptic structures, regulating its size, and recruiting key molecules involved in SV exocytosis such as Munc13 and voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fejtova and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>).</p><p>With the notable exceptions of RIMs and Munc13, our understanding of the roles played by individual CAZ proteins is very limited. In particular, the functions of the two largest CAZ proteins, Piccolo and Bassoon, have remained elusive because of their enormous sizes (&#x0003e;400 kD). Both are expressed very early during neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cases-Langhoff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhai et al., 2000</xref>) and are among the first proteins to arrive at newly forming synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shapira et al., 2003</xref>), which implicates them in nascent synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ziv and Garner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Waites et al., 2005</xref>).

The loss of Bassoon also reduces excitatory postsynaptic currents and increases the percentage of silent synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons; however, no overt structural defects are seen at these central nervous system synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altrock et al., 2003</xref>). This milder phenotype could be caused by a more ancillary role for Bassoon at conventional synapses or by functional redundancy of another CAZ protein such as Piccolo. Addressing these issues using conventional knockout strategies has been hampered by the very large sizes of the genes encoding Piccolo and Bassoon (&#x0003e;350 kb) and the existence of alternatively spliced transcripts and uncharacterized 5&#x02032; promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cases-Langhoff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">tom Dieck et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fenster and Garner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altrock et al., 2003</xref>). As a case in point, the Bassoon knockout mouse is not a genetic null but rather a deletion of two large central exons from the Bsn gene, leaving the N and C termini intact. Careful analysis of these mice has demonstrated that these domains, including the N-terminal Zinc finger motifs and C-terminal coiled-coil domain, are still expressed and synaptically localized, which suggests that the true phenotype of Bassoon loss could be masked by the continued expression of these fragments.</p><p>In the present study, we have overcome these limitations by using interference RNA to completely eliminate the expression of Piccolo in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our data reveal that although Piccolo is not essential for the formation of glutamatergic synapses, it does play a functional role in SV recycling. Specifically, synapses lacking Piccolo exhibit enhanced SV exocytosis rates, apparently caused by alterations in the activity-dependent dynamics of Synapsin1a at presynaptic boutons. These defects are not detected at synapses lacking Bassoon, which indicates that Piccolo has a specific role in coupling events at the AZ with the regulated recruitment of SVs from the reserve pool.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Design of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that selectively and efficiently knock down Piccolo</title><p>To eliminate the expression of Piccolo in developing neurons, we generated several shRNAs against sequences situated in the N terminus of Piccolo (Exon 1; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fenster and Garner, 2002</xref>). This region has been shown to encode segments of the highest molecular weight Piccolo isoforms (&#x0223c;560 kD; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenster et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fenster and Garner, 2002</xref>) shown previously to localize to presynaptic AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cases-Langhoff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenster et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhai et al., 2000</xref>). After developing and testing two such shRNAs &#x02013; Pclo6 and Pclo28 &#x02013; in HEK cells, we assessed their efficacy in neurons using plasmid-based transfection (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711167/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711167/DC1</ext-link>). Pclo28 was slightly more effective than Pclo6 at eliminating Piccolo expression, and was thus used for all further experiments presented in this paper. However, key experiments were repeated with Pclo6 to verify that the observed phenotypes were not caused by off-target effects (Fig. S2).</p><p>Given the low efficiency and potential overexpression associated with plasmid-based transfection, we next evaluated whether Pclo28 introduced via lentivirus would similarly eliminate Piccolo in cultured neurons. This was accomplished by subcloning both an EGFP-Synapsin1a reporter gene (for labeling presynaptic boutons expressing Pclo28; Fig. S1) and the H1-driven shRNA into the FUGW vector (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lois et al., 2002</xref>) to create LV/EGFP-Synapsin or LV/EGFP-Synapsin/Pclo28. As an initial measure of knockdown efficacy, lysates from 14-d-in-vitro (DIV) hippocampal neurons superinfected with lentivirus, in order to ensure nearly 100% infectivity, were Western blotted and probed with antibodies against Piccolo and several other neuronal proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). We observed a dramatic and selective loss of Piccolo in lysates from cells infected with Pclo28 and no effect on the levels of &#x003b2;-tubulin, Synaptophysin, Bassoon, or EGFP-Synapsin1a (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed whether lentiviral expression of Pclo28 reduced synaptic Piccolo. Hippocampal neurons infected with LV/EGFP-Synapsin or LV/EGFP-Synapsin/Pclo28 were immunostained after 14 DIV with antibodies against Piccolo and Bassoon. In control cells, EGFP-Synapsin exhibited a punctate pattern along microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive dendritic profiles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), with &#x0003e;90% of these puncta immunopositive for Piccolo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and F</xref>) or Bassoon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and G</xref>). In contrast, hippocampal cultures infected with LV/EGFP-Synapsin1a/Pclo28 exhibited a dramatic loss of Piccolo immunoreactivity at EGFP-Synapsin1a clusters, with &#x0003c;3% of clusters along dendritic profiles containing Piccolo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Importantly, this shRNA had no effect on Bassoon protein levels or clustering at EGFP-Synapsin1a sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C, E, and G</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that Pclo28 efficiently and selectively eliminates Piccolo from synapses.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of Piccolo does not affect synapse formation or morphology</title><p>The appearance of axonal EGFP-Synapsin1a and Bassoon clusters in the absence of presynaptic Piccolo expression indicates that Piccolo is not necessary for synapse formation. To evaluate this hypothesis, we immunostained cultured neurons infected with either LV/EGFP-Synapsin1a or LV/EGFP-Synapsin1a/Pclo28 with antibodies against several key presynaptic (Synaptophysin, RIM1&#x003b1;, and Munc13-1) and postsynaptic (PSD-95 and NR1) proteins. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, each exhibited a punctate pattern that reliably colocalized with EGFP-Synapsin-1a clusters along dendritic profiles, regardless of whether Piccolo was present (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) or absent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). These data indicate that the loss of Piccolo does not disrupt the synaptic targeting of multiple key pre- and postsynaptic proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Piccolo is not essential for the clustering of key pre- and postsynaptic proteins.</bold> Hippocampal neurons infected with LV/EGFP-Synapsin1a (EGFP-Syn; A) or LV/EGFP-Synapsin1a/Pclo28 (EGFPSynPclo28; B) and immunostained with antibodies against Synaptophysin (Syph), RIM1, Munc13-1, PSD-95, or NR1 subunits of the NMDA receptor after 14 DIV.

This was achieved by replacing EGFP-Synapsin1a in the pZOff vector with vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) tagged at its C terminus with HRP (VAMP2-HRP; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). VAMP2 is an essential transmembrane component of SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elferink et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sudhof et al., 1989</xref>), and in VAMP2-HRP, the C-terminal HRP is situated within the vesicle lumen. Upon reaction with hydrogen peroxide and DAB, HRP forms an electron-dense precipitate, enabling visualization of vesicles within boutons of neurons expressing pZOff/VAMP2-HRP. To verify that VAMP2-HRP did not affect Piccolo down-regulation, cultures expressing pZOff/VAMP2-HRP or pZOff/VAMP2-HRP/Pclo28 were immunostained with antibodies against Piccolo and HRP at 6 DIV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Under these conditions, Piccolo immunoreactivity was detected in the axons of untransfected neurons or those expressing VAMP2-HRP alone but not in axons of neurons expressing Pclo28. These data indicate that Pclo28 shRNA was not hampered by coexpression of VAMP2-HRP.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Loss of Piccolo does not affect synapse ultrastructure.</bold> (A) Schematic diagram of the pZOff/VAMP2-HRP vector used to express VAMP2-HRP with or without Pclo28 shRNA.

We first examined whether boutons lacking Piccolo were presynaptically active.

The former represents the subpopulation of SVs that are docked at the AZ plasma membrane and poised to undergo fusion with the arrival of an action potential, whereas the latter is a measure of the probability that SVs in the RRP will undergo fusion.

To date, the only protein that has been implicated in regulating SV translocation is the SV-associated phosphoprotein Synapsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Camilli et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greengard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ryan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chi et al., 2003</xref>). Mechanistically, Synapsin is hypothesized to mediate the clustering and retention of SVs within boutons via its ability to cross-bridge and tether them to the presynaptic actin/spectrin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greengard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ceccaldi et al., 1995</xref>). Activity-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Synapsin by CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), protein kinase A, MAPK, and protein phosphatases 2A and 2B appears to regulate the exocytosis kinetics of SVs, presumably by regulating Synapsin binding to SVs and/or the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greengard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ryan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jovanovic et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pyle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mozhayeva et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, Synapsin has also been shown to undergo an activity-dependent dispersion away from presynaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2001</xref>), and the rate of dispersion is linked to its phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2003</xref>). However, the precise relationship between Synapsin phosphorylation, dispersion, and SV exocytosis appears complex and has not been fully characterized.</p><p>To explore whether the loss of Piccolo impacts SV translocation via alterations in the properties of Synapsin, we evaluated whether the association and/or dispersion kinetics of Synapsin1a within presynaptic boutons were altered. Here, we took advantage of the fact that our shRNA expression vector contained EGFP-Synapsin1a. Initially, we used antibodies against Synapsin to verify that the lentiviral system did not lead to a gross overexpression of Synapsin at individual boutons. Surprisingly, we found no increase in Synapsin immunostaining at boutons expressing EGFP-Synapsin1a (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>), which indicates that endogenous Synapsin expression is down-regulated in the presence of EGFP-Synapsin to maintain similar total levels per bouton. Next, we quantified and compared the synaptic levels of EGFP-Synapsin1a in boutons of control neurons and those expressing Pclo28. We found no discernable differences in fluorescence intensity when cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). However, when cultures were fixed with methanol, which extracts soluble proteins, we observed a significant decrease (<italic>t</italic> test, P &#x0003c; 0.0001) in the intensity of EGFP-Synapsin1a at boutons lacking Piccolo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). This suggested that EGFP-Synapsin1a was not as tightly associated with SVs and/or actin-related structures in the absence of Piccolo but rather was shifted into a more soluble fraction. This concept was supported by FRAP experiments designed to monitor the steady-state exchange kinetics of EGFP-Synapsin1a fluorescence at individual boutons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>). Again, EGFP-Synapsin1a fluorescence recovered more quickly at boutons lacking Piccolo (&#x003c4;<sub>fast</sub> &#x0003d; 1.2 min and &#x003c4;<sub>slow</sub> &#x0003d; 11.9 min vs. &#x003c4;<sub>fast</sub> &#x0003d; 2.2 min and &#x003c4;<sub>slow</sub> &#x0003d; 33.7 min for control boutons; two-way ANOVA, P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>), which indicates that mechanisms regulating the association of Synapsin1a with SVs and/or the actin/spectrin cytoskeleton were altered in the absence of Piccolo.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Steady-state and activity-dependent dynamics of EGFP-Synapsin1a are altered at synapses lacking Piccolo.</bold> (A, left) Images of neurons infected with EGFP-Synapsin1a (green) and immunostained with Synapsin1a antibodies (red).

Here, an N-terminally EGFP-tagged SV2 was subcloned into our lentiviral vectors in place of EGFP-Synapsin1a. Like EGFP-Synapsin1a, EGFP-SV2 reliably labeled presynaptic boutons, exhibiting a high degree of colocalization with FM4-64 (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711167/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711167/DC1</ext-link>). However, in contrast to Synapsin1a, the exchange kinetics of EGFP-SV2 were not altered in the absence of Piccolo (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E and F</xref>). These data indicate that general presynaptic stability and SV retention were not significantly altered in the absence of Piccolo.</p><p>To assess whether the differences in steady-state exchange kinetics translated into activity-dependent differences in the dispersion kinetics of EGFP-Synapsin1a, we used an electrical stimulation protocol (10 Hz for 90 s) shown to promote the dispersion of Synapsin1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2003</xref>). Here, changes in the fluorescence intensity of EGFP-Synapsin1a at individual boutons were monitored both during stimulation and for the subsequent 10-min recovery period. In contrast to wild-type boutons, we observed both a more complete dispersion of EGFP-Synapsin1a and a slower rate of recovery in boutons lacking Piccolo (two-way ANOVA, P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, G and H</xref>). Intriguingly, we also observed remarkable, previously unreported heterogeneity in the extent of EGFP-Synapsin1a dispersion at individual boutons under both conditions. To evaluate whether the extent of EGFP-Synapsin1a dispersion was coupled to the rate of SV exocytosis, we simultaneously monitored the loss of EGFP-Synapsin1a and FM5-95 fluorescence from boutons during 5-Hz stimulation for 3 min. Our analysis revealed a tight correlation between the two events. At boutons with minimal EGFP-Synapsin dispersion (&#x0003c;10% for all time points), very little FM5-95 destaining occurred (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). In contrast, synapses with more complete EGFP-Synapsin dispersion (&#x0003e;40% after 30 s of stimulation) exhibited dramatic FM5-95 destaining (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). This feature was present both at control synapses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>) and those lacking Piccolo (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). A statistical analysis of the final fluorescence intensity values for EGFP-Synapsin and FM after the 3-min stimulation revealed a strong correlation between the extent of EGFP-Synapsin dispersion and that of FM5-95 destaining at both control boutons and those lacking Piccolo (control: &#x003c1; &#x0003d; 0.58, P &#x0003c; 0.0001; Pclo28: &#x003c1; &#x0003d; 0.59, P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). Although this tight correlation was observed for all synapses, the mean degree of Synapsin dispersion and FM destaining was greater at boutons lacking Piccolo, significantly shifting these correlation values to the lower right (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). These data strongly indicate that the accelerated SV exocytosis rates observed at synapses lacking Piccolo are coupled to concomitant increases in the dispersion kinetics of Synapsin1a.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Synapsin1a dispersion and FM destaining are tightly correlated.</bold> (A and B) FM5-95 destaining curves for individual EGFP-Synapsin1a puncta at boutons with (A) or without (B) Piccolo.

We found that synapses lacking Piccolo were active and capable of recycling FM dyes but exhibited enhanced rates of SV exocytosis. Mechanistically, this phenotype was not caused by changes in the size or release probability of the RRP of SVs but rather to an increased dispersion of Synapsin1a from presynaptic boutons. This dispersion defect could be rescued by inhibiting CaMKII activity but was not caused by hyperphosphorylation of known Synapsin1a phospho sites by CaMKII. Importantly, synapses lacking Bassoon did not share these features. Together, these data indicate that Piccolo negatively regulates SV exocytosis by modulating Synapsin dynamics, thus potentially coupling the mobilization of SVs in the reserve pool to events at the AZ.</p><sec><title>Roles of CAZ proteins at presynaptic boutons</title><p>So far, loss of function studies on CAZ proteins have primarily demonstrated defects in SV docking, priming, and fusion, as seen for Munc18, Munc13, and Rim1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weimer and Richmond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>). At present, it is unclear whether Piccolo and Bassoon are involved in these processes. Their high structural similarity and near-complete overlap of binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenster et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">tom Dieck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fejtova and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>), and thus likely functional redundancy, will make this issue difficult to resolve until the analysis of synapses lacking both proteins is possible.</p><p>However, studies of synapses lacking either Piccolo or Bassoon are beginning to reveal unique roles for each. For example, studies of photoreceptor ribbon synapses demonstrate a crucial functional role for Bassoon in the attachment of ribbons to the arciform density and in neurotransmission at these synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altrock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">tom Dieck et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the increase in number of presynaptically silent synapses in Bassoon-deficient hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altrock et al., 2003</xref>) argues for a potential role of Bassoon in key aspects of vesicle release, perhaps similar to Munc13, Munc18, and Rim1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weimer and Richmond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006</xref>). In contrast, we found no evidence that loss of Piccolo had any affect on the fraction of presynaptically silent synapses or on the size or release probability of the RRP of SVs. These data indicate that Piccolo does not directly participate in SV docking, priming, or fusion. Instead, our data reveal that Piccolo but not Bassoon influences the translocation of SVs from the reserve pool to the RRP by regulating the dynamic properties of Synapsin1a. These findings suggest that Piccolo may perform an integrative function within presynaptic boutons, coupling SV docking and fusion to the mobilization/recruitment of SVs from the reserve pool to the AZ.</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in the rates of SV exocytosis can be linked to altered Synapsin dynamics</title><p>Synapsins are a well-characterized family of presynaptic phosphoproteins thought to regulate the translocation of SVs from the reserve to the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Camilli et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greengard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hilfiker et al., 1999</xref>). This concept is supported by knockout studies showing that Synapsins are essential for maintaining the size of the reserve pool of SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ryan et al., 1996</xref>) and by dynamic imaging studies, including this one, demonstrating that they regulate SV exocytosis rates at a range of stimulus frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2003</xref>). Importantly, the dynamic properties of Synapsin, particularly its activity-dependent dissociation from SVs and the actin cytoskeleton, are regulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Torri Tarelli et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hilfiker et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Although Synapsin is phosphorylated by multiple kinases, several studies have implicated CaMKII as its most prominent regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schiebler et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benfenati et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ceccaldi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stefani et al., 1997</xref>). However, these studies used in vitro binding assays, and none assessed the direct contribution of CaMKII to either the dispersion kinetics of Synapsin or to SV exocytosis in intact neurons. Two studies that did examine these functions used serine-to-alanine phospho mutants to demonstrate that the two identified CaMKII sites were important for regulating the rates of Synapsin dispersion and SV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2003</xref>). However, neither was performed at physiological temperatures and neither used pharmacological tools to assess the role of CaMKII in these processes.</p><p>In this study, we have carefully analyzed both the relationship between Synapsin dispersion and SV exocytosis, and the regulation of these events by CaMKII in intact neurons at physiological temperature. Regarding the former, our analysis of thousands of boutons revealed a remarkable and previously unreported heterogeneity in the degree of EGFP-Synapsin dispersion and FM5-95 destaining per bouton (from &#x0003e;50 to 0%). From this data, we observed a tight correlation between Synapsin dispersion and SV exocytosis. Though other studies have suggested such a relationship, ours is the first to conclusively demonstrate it. We have also closely examined the role of CaMKII in regulating Synapsin dispersion. Surprisingly, blocking CaMKII activity with KN62 did not alter Synapsin dispersion in wild-type neurons, which suggests that other kinases may mediate this activity. This concept is supported by several previous studies indicating that protein kinase A and MAPK are important regulators of Synapsin, modulating its association with SVs or actin, respectively, and, in the case of MAPK, mediating SV exocytosis via Synapsin phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jovanovic et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hosaka et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jovanovic et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2001</xref>). Intriguingly, removing Piccolo from synapses caused Synapsin dispersion to be regulated by CaMKII. Furthermore, under these conditions, the enhanced rate of SV exocytosis was also CaMKII dependent, as both phenotypes could be rescued by inhibiting CaMKII with KN62. These data support our general conclusion that Piccolo negatively regulates SV exocytosis, apparently via a CaMKII-mediated mechanism.</p><p>We have also examined the phosphorylation state of Synapsin in the absence of Piccolo. We found that under basal conditions, Synapsin was hypophosphorylated at both CaMKII and MAPK sites. Although the levels of phosphorylation at both sites increased during stimulation, absolute levels of phosphorylation were always below those found in wild-type neurons. This finding was unexpected, as we had predicted based on multiple previous studies and our own experiments with KN62 that hyperphosphorylation of Synapsin would mediate its enhanced dispersion. However, total phosphorylation levels of Synapsin may not be predictive of its dispersion kinetics, as two other imaging studies have demonstrated that Synapsin dynamics are regulated through a complex combinatorial code of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at its seven phospho sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2003</xref>). Furthermore, given Piccolo's putative role as a molecular organizer of the AZ, multiple signaling pathways may be subtly altered in its absence, affecting the balance of presynaptic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in ways that are difficult to detect or interpret. In such a scenario, Synapsin would likely be one of many phospho proteins indirectly affected by the loss of Piccolo. However, if Synapsin dynamics/phosphorylation alone are altered (still a possibility given the lack of other detectable phenotypes), this would provide evidence for a more direct Piccolo&#x02013;Synapsin interaction, perhaps through one of the actin-regulating proteins (ie. GIT1, Abp1, and profilin) known to bind Piccolo.</p><p>In conclusion, we have found that Piccolo is not essential for excitatory synapse formation but is a negative regulator of SV exocytosis. These results indicate that one of Piccolo's functions at the AZ is to regulate the translocation of SVs from the reserve to the RRP through modulation of Synapsin dynamics. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that this role is not shared by Bassoon, providing one of the first indications that these proteins have nonoverlapping functions. Rather puzzling is the absence of other presynaptic phenotypes, especially given the large size of Piccolo and its numerous binding partners. One likely explanation is that many of these are masked by redundant features in Bassoon, issues that will hopefully be resolved by the characterization of synapses lacking both Piccolo and Bassoon.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Antibodies against Piccolo (rabbit), Bassoon (mouse), and MAP2 (rabbit and mouse) were used as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhai et al., 2000</xref>).

For this analysis, puncta that did not exhibit dispersion (percentage of initial fluorescence values &#x0003e; 90 for all time points) were excluded.</p><p>To compare extent of Synapsin dispersion to that of FM destaining, EGFP-Synapsin intensity was monitored during the 5-Hz destaining experiment (see FM destaining protocol).</p><p>To assess the role of CaMKII in Synapsin dispersion, coverslips were perfused with normal Tyrodes solution containing 10 uM KN62 (Tocris Bioscience) and incubated in the drug for 20 min before eliciting dispersion. EGFP-Synapsin intensity was monitored either before stimulation and every 5 s during stimulation (for dispersion curves), or before stimulation and at the last time point (t &#x0003d; 90 s; bar graphs).</p><p>FM5-95 destaining was also monitored after incubation with 10 &#x003bc;M KN62. For this experiment, boutons were first loaded with FM5-95 using high-K&#x0002b; stimulation as described. After waiting 15 min to allow for some recovery of EGFP-Synapsin after stimulation, cells were incubated for an additional 20 min in 10 &#x003bc;M KN62. SV exocytosis was then elicited by 5-Hz stimulation for 180 s, and both FM intensity and EGFP-Synapsin intensity were monitored over this time period (images taken every 10 s). Destaining curves were then plotted as described and compared with destaining curves from untreated coverslips of cultures infected with LV/EGFP-Synapsin or LV/EGFP-Synapsin-Pclo28.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows initial testing of Piccolo shRNA (Pclo28) using pZOff plasmid-mediated knockdown in COS7 cells and neurons. Fig. S2 demonstrates that another shRNA against Piccolo (Pclo6) produces the same phenotypes as Pclo28. Fig. S3 shows additional EM micrographs showing that VAMP2-HRP unambiguously labels the synapses of transfected neurons and does not obscure synaptic junctions or other synaptic structures. Fig. S4 shows that EGFP-SV2, like EGFP-Synapsin, is a reliable presynaptic marker.
