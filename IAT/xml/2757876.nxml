Unlike similar inflammation resulting from arrest of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B activation in the epidermal cells, the effect induced by caspase-8 deficiency did not depend on TNF, IL-1, dermal macrophage function, or expression of the toll-like receptor adapter proteins MyD88 or TRIF. Both interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and TANK-binding kinase were constitutively phosphorylated in the caspase-8&#x02013;deficient epidermis, and knockdown of IRF3 in the epidermis-derived cells from these mice abolished the expression of up-regulated genes. Temporal and spatial analyses of the alterations in gene expression that result from caspase-8 deficiency reveal that the changes are initiated before birth, around the time that cornification develops, and occur mainly in the suprabasal layer. Finally, we found that caspase-8&#x02013;deficient keratinocytes display an enhanced response to gene activation by transfected DNA. Our findings suggest that an enhanced response to endogenous activators of IRF3 in the epidermis, presumably generated in association with keratinocyte differentiation, contributes to the skin inflammatory process triggered by caspase-8 deficiency.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Members of the caspase cysteine-protease family can be activated by a variety of death-inducing agents to cleave death-related cellular proteins, thereby initiating programmed cell death. The caspases also serve other nonapoptotic cellular functions, of whose physiological significance and mechanisms little is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lamkanfi et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The epidermal keratinocytes of the skin are programmed to undergo spontaneous cell death while progressing along their pathway from the basal layer of the epidermis, a process which results in formation of the skin's cornified layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Candi et al., 2005</xref>). These cells express all the known caspases and can be induced by ligands of the TNF family to die in a caspase-dependent manner. Activation of this caspase-mediated cell death process apparently contributes to pathological damage of the epidermis in conditions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viard et al., 1998</xref>), sunburn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhuang et al., 2000</xref>), eczematous dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trautmann et al., 2000</xref>), and skin ulceration caused by parasitic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eidsmo et al., 2005</xref>) or Pemphigus foliaceus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Whether the apoptotic caspases also mediate the nonpathological cell death process that causes cornification has been a matter of controversy. Early studies suggested that caspase-3 is proteolytically processed and activated in the cornifying epidermis and that this activation is required for the programmed death of cells associated with the cornification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weil et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allombert-Blaise et al., 2003</xref>). In subsequent studies, however, such activation could not be confirmed, nor could processing of caspase-6 or -7 be discerned in the differentiating epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lippens et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rendl et al., 2002</xref>). More recent evidence points to a role for caspase-3 in controlling the rate of differentiation of the epidermal keratinocytes during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okuyama et al., 2004</xref>). This function, however, appears to be independent of the role of this enzyme in death induction and does not seem to involve its proteolytic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>). The only caspase shown conclusively to participate in the cornification process is caspase-14, which is quite selectively expressed and activated in the differentiating and cornifying layers of the epidermis and the hair follicles. Its participation, however, does not occur through activation of an apoptotic process and is not needed for the cornification itself but rather for associated processes such as hydration of the skin via proteolytic processing of filaggrin into free hygroscopic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denecker et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Caspase-8 is known mainly for its role as the proximal caspase in the cell death pathway activated by receptors of the TNF/NGF family. In this paper, we show that this enzyme is not required for the differentiation-associated death of the epidermal keratinocytes. However, its deficiency in these cells disrupts epidermal homeostasis and triggers a severe cutaneous inflammation associated, as in other inflammatory skin diseases, with aberrant epidermal growth and differentiation.</p><p>Generation of inflammatory mediators in the epidermis is shown in this study to be initiated before birth and independently of the adapter proteins for the toll-like receptors (TLRs), ruling out the possibility that the triggering involves either pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or new antigens to which the mice become exposed upon birth. Participation of a trigger that is endogenous to the keratinocytes is further indicated by our data showing that the inflammation is largely independent of dermal macrophages. We also show that the inflammation is independent of the major inflammatory mediators TNF, IL-1&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2;, thus differing from a similar disease caused by arrest of the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B activation pathway in the keratinocytes that crucially depends on TNF and on macrophage function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pasparakis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gugasyan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Hogerlinden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Omori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sayama et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We present evidence that an IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 activation pathway is constitutively activated in the caspase-8&#x02013;deficient epidermis and that, consistently, the genes that are overexpressed in this enzyme-deficient epidermis include many that are known to be IRF3 dependent. Our spatial analysis of the expression of inflammatory genes in the caspase-8&#x02013;deficient epidermis indicated that its location is largely suprabasal, suggesting that the trigger for its activation is related to the differentiation/cornification process. We found, moreover, that transfection of caspase-8&#x02013;deficient keratinocytes with DNA triggers activation of these genes more effectively than in caspase-8&#x02013;expressing cells. These findings lead us to suggest that certain endogenous activators of the response to foreign nucleic acids are generated in the epidermis, possibly in association with the cornification process, and that amplification of such signaling by the absence of caspase-8 contributes to the chronic skin inflammation caused by caspase-8 deficiency in the epidermis.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Mice expressing enzymatically inactive caspase-8 develop inflammation in various organs, including skin</title><p>To investigate structure&#x02013;function relationships for the various effects of caspase-8 in vivo, we used bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)&#x02013;mediated transgenesis to produce mice that express, besides their endogenous <italic>caspase-8</italic> alleles, an additional copy of the <italic>caspase-8</italic> gene or various mutants thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and not depicted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2008</xref>).

Cornification seemed unharmed. Moreover, outside-in dye penetration tests consistently failed to reveal any defect in epidermal barrier function, even as late as P7 (unpublished data). No conspicuous aberration was observed in the expression or localization of E-cadherin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090616/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>), the major mediator of intracellular adhesion in epithelial tissues and an essential contributor to epidermal barrier function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>).

Our investigation of the effect of caspase-8 deficiency on the epidermis disclosed no decrease in the effectiveness of the cornification. This finding is consistent with the results of several earlier studies that cast doubt on the supposition that caspases participate in the programmed cell death process that causes cornification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lippens et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rendl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>). We found, however, that epidermal deficiency of caspase-8 did have a pronounced effect on skin homeostasis in that it gave rise to a chronic inflammatory disease associated with a hyperproliferative state. In a previous study we found that caspase-8 deficiency in hepatocytes promotes chronic inflammation in the liver after partial hepatectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben Moshe et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2008</xref>). The present study shows that widespread inflammation also develops in mice that express an enzymatically inactive caspase-8 allele. Collectively, these findings suggest that apart from its roles in mediating death and, in certain tissues, also growth and survival, caspase-8 also acts to restrict inflammation.</p><p>As yet, little is known of mechanisms that underlie nonapoptotic functions of caspase-8. Nevertheless, there are some clues to the mechanism responsible for the nonapoptotic function of caspase-8 described in the present study. We previously reported that death induction by caspase-8 is compromised in BAC transgenic mice in which the aspartate residue upstream of the initial self-processing site in caspase-8 is mutated, yet these mice show no overt pathology in the skin or other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, unlike the apoptotic function of caspase-8, and similarly to various nonapoptotic functions of this enzyme, processing of caspase-8 is not required for its antiinflammatory activity. However, our present finding that the mere expression of an enzymatically inactive caspase-8 allele causes inflammation in the skin and in other tissues, apparently because of its interference with the function of coexpressed enzymatically active caspase-8 molecules, suggests that the restriction of inflammation by this enzyme, even though it is independent of its self-processing, does depends on its enzymatic activity. Moreover, the dominant-negative effect of the inactive molecules on the function of the enzymatically active coexpressed molecules suggests that the mechanism by which caspase-8 restricts inflammation depends, as in the case of caspase-8 induction of cell death, on the association of two or more caspase-8 molecules with one another.</p><p>Although caspase-3 reportedly also contributes to development of the epidermis through a function that is not apoptotic, this contribution, unlike that of caspase-8, takes place only prenatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okuyama et al., 2004</xref>). The fact that the skin of capase-3&#x02013;deficient mice is normal in appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leonard et al., 2002</xref>) further suggests that the functional role of caspase-3 in the epidermis is distinct from that of caspase-8. Yet another caspase, caspase-14, serves an important role in controlling epidermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denecker et al., 2007</xref>). However, we observed no deficiency in expression or processing of caspase-14 in the caspase-8&#x02013;deficient epidermis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090616/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>), suggesting that the function of caspase-8 in the epidermis is also distinct from that of caspase-14.</p><p>To obtain further clues to the mechanisms underlying the inflammation caused by caspase-8 deficiency, as well as to suggest potential treatments for skin diseases that might be related to that deficiency, it is important to identify the agents that trigger this inflammation. TNF is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, a skin disease that in some respects resembles the disease seen in our mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schottelius et al., 2004</xref>); in addition, this cytokine is critically involved in a skin disease of mice with epidermal-specific deletion of genes encoding proteins that participate in NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pasparakis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gugasyan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Hogerlinden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Omori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sayama et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore investigated the extent to which TNF contributes to the skin inflammation caused by caspase-8 deficiency. Our results showed that although TNF expression facilitates development of the disease, it is not crucial for it. We further established that IL-1&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, both of which are prominent players in a variety of inflammatory diseases, do not contribute to the mouse cutaneous inflammation. Notably, this last finding refutes the recent suggestion that the induced generation of IL-1&#x003b1; mediates the inflammatory skin disease inflicted by caspase-8 deficiency in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). In further disagreement with mechanisms suggested in that study, we also found that this disease was not affected when the mice were injected with a pharmacological inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase (SB203580; unpublished data), which was suggested by those authors to trigger the generation of IL-1&#x003b1;. In addition, pharmacological depletion of macrophages accumulating in the dermis in both diseases, which protects against the disease caused by interference with NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stratis et al., 2006</xref>), had no effect on our mice. It thus appears that whereas the disease caused by interference with NF-&#x003ba;B activation develops through a dialogue between the keratinocytes and cells of the immune system, the disease caused by caspase-8 deficiency in the keratinocytes reflects a cell-autonomous function of these epidermal cells.</p><p>We found that IRF3 and TBK1 (a protein kinase that participates in IRF3 activation) are constitutively phosphorylated in the epidermis of the <italic>Casp-8<sup>F/&#x02212;</sup>K5-Cre</italic> mice and that genes known to be induced by IFN and IRF3 are activated in the epidermis. Phosphorylated IRF3 could be discerned in the epidermis as early as P1, significantly before any pathological change became apparent (the limited sensitivity of western analysis precluded earlier assessment), strongly suggesting that the phosphorylation is a cause rather than a consequence of the disease.</p><p>IRF3 is known to be activated by extracellular molecular patterns associated with pathogens (PAMPs). In addition, cells possess mechanisms that also allow this transcriptional factor to be activated in response to intracellular molecular patterns associated with pathogens, or with the molecular changes resulting from cell damage (DAMPs). Some endogenous cellular components can activate these mechanisms even in the absence of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi and Flavell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Okabe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stetson et al., 2008</xref>). Because the disease in our <italic>Casp-8<sup>F/&#x02212;</sup>K5-Cre</italic> mice became apparent only a few days after birth (even though the gene deletion dictated by the expression of Cre under the K5 promoter occurs prenatally), it would have been reasonable to suspect that it was triggered by antigens and PAMPs, to which the mice were exposed for the first time after birth. This possibility, however, was ruled out by our findings that the generation of inflammatory mediators in the epidermis begins before birth and that the disease was not affected by deletion of <italic>MyD88</italic> or <italic>TRIF</italic>, genes encoding the major adapter proteins for the TLRs which signal for the effects of extracellular PAMPs.</p><p>We showed in this paper that caspase-8&#x02013;deficient keratinocytes exhibit enhanced gene activation by transfected DNA. Recently, we observed that cells deficient in caspase-8 also respond more effectively to viral RNA and that caspase-8 binds to components of the RIG-I signaling complex that mediates cellular responses to intracellular foreign ribonucleic acid, suppressing the complex-induced IRF3 activation but having little effect on the ability of the complex to activate NF-&#x003ba;B (unpublished data). These findings suggest that caspase-8 acts to restrain excessive activation of pathways of response to intracellular pathogenic components and to DAMPs and that its failure to so in the <italic>Casp-8<sup>F/&#x02212;</sup>K5-Cre</italic> keratinocytes contributes to the triggering of the cutaneous disease in <italic>Casp-8<sup>F/&#x02212;</sup>K5-Cre</italic> mice.</p><p>The nature of the endogenous cellular components that trigger the disease remains to be further defined. This study suggested that they are generated suprabasally in the epidermis and that their generation is initiated before birth (the time at which cornification starts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mack et al., 2005</xref>) and is greatly enhanced after birth (when cornification reaches its maximal extent). Our findings raise the possibility that generation of these endogenous activators is associated with the differentiation process that leads to the cornification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments in this study were performed with mice on the C57BL/6 background.

(A) To monitor the expression of transgenic BAC in vivo, we placed an IRES sequence and the GFP ORF flanked by the two sequences corresponding to the FRT recombination site downstream of the stop codon of <italic>caspase-8</italic>. To introduce this sequence into the shuttle vector, we inserted the homology arms upstream and downstream of the stop codon (BoxA and BoxB; Fig. S5, scheme), cloned from the RP24-238B22 DNA by PCR, into the SalI&#x02013;EcoRI and SpeI&#x02013;NotI sites of the pBC FRT-IRES/GFP-FRT vector.
