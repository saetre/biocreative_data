However, in vitro studies have shown that when hematopoietic progenitors acquire Notch signaling via Delta-like (Dll)1 or Dll4, they differentiate into the T cell lineage in the absence of a thymic microenvironment. It is not clear, however, whether the thymus supports T cell development specifically by providing Notch signaling. To address this issue, we generated mice with a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked allele of <italic>Dll4</italic> and induced gene deletion specifically in thymic epithelial cells (TECs). In the thymus of mutant mice, the expression of Dll4 was abrogated on the epithelium, and the proportion of hematopoietic cells bearing the intracellular fragment of Notch1 (ICN1) was markedly decreased. Corresponding to this, CD4 CD8 double-positive or single-positive T cells were not detected in the thymus. Further analysis showed that the double-negative cell fraction was lacking T cell progenitors. The enforced expression of ICN1 in hematopoietic progenitors restored thymic T cell differentiation, even when the TECs were deficient in Dll4. These results indicate that the thymus-specific environment for determining T cell fate indispensably requires Dll4 expression to induce Notch signaling in the thymic immigrant cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The thymus is the major necessary site for T cell development. In the physiological condition, hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), which reside in the fetal liver or BM, migrate into the thymus to differentiate into T lineage cells with a diverse and self-compatible TCR repertoire. The importance of the thymus in immunity has been well documented by observations in immunodeficient individuals, in human patients with DiGeorge syndrome, and in mice with the <italic>nude</italic> (<italic>FoxN1</italic>) mutation, which lack a thymus and effective T cells. However, it remains unclear how the thymus is essential for T cell development in vivo. T cell development is critically supported by specialized cellular microenvironments composed of the thymic stroma, the three-dimensional structure of epithelial cells, and mesenchymal-originated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). In addition to the cellular components, the thymus is known to produce some growth factors, including IL-7 and stem cell factor, which are likely to contribute to early T cell development. However, these growth factors were not specific for the thymus, as they were also found in other hematopoietic tissues. Thus, recent studies have focused on cellular components of the thymic environment to understand the molecular mechanism that contributes to the specification process for T cell lineage from HPCs migrating into the thymus.</p><p>There is accumulating evidence that Notch signaling is critical for the determination of T cell fate from HPCs. Previous studies using Cre-<italic>loxP</italic>&#x02013;mediated gene targeting showed that the specific deletion of <italic>Notch1</italic> or <italic>RBP-J</italic>, which codes the signal transducer downstream of Notch1 in HPCs, led to a complete defect of T cell development accompanied by a certain increase of B cells in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In contrast, implantation of HPCs with the enforced expression of the active form of Notch1, intracellular fragment of Notch1 (ICN1), induced the ectopic appearance of CD4 and CD8 double-positive (DP) cells in BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). A similar phenotype was observed on the monolayer culture of BM-derived stromal cells in the absence of a thymic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). These results clearly indicated that Notch1-mediated signal is both essential and sufficient for T cell specification at the branch point of T versus B cells. However, it remains to be clarified whether the thymic environment accomplishes its role for T cell development by providing Notch signaling into HPCs in vivo. In fact, both Delta-like (Dll)1 and Dll4 among Notch ligands (NotchL) were detected in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Moreover, any stromal cells with the forced expression of NotchL, such as Dll1 and Dll4, are able to induce Notch signaling into HPCs, supporting T lymphopoiesis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Deficiency of both Dll1 and Dll4 in mice is, however, embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), and these mice do not provide information of any potential function of these molecules in T cell development. To overcome this problem, we established mice with a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked allele of <italic>Dll1</italic> and showed that T cell development is intact in the thymus in a Dll1-null situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Collectively, it is suggested that Dll4 or both Dll1 and Dll4 function as proper ligands to provide Notch signaling required for T cell specification in the thymus.</p><p>In this study, we succeeded in establishing mice with a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked allele of <italic>Dll4</italic> (floxed <italic>Dll4</italic>), and induced the gene deletion of <italic>Dll4</italic> that is specific in thymic epithelial cells (TECs). In these mice, the expression of Dll4 on TECs was abrogated and Notch1-mediated signaling was reduced in the thymus, resulting in the disappearance of T cells and aberrant accumulation of B lineage cells.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Abrogation of Dll4 on TECs reduces the Notch1-mediated signal in thymocytes</title><p><italic>Dll4</italic> is the third member of the <italic>Dll</italic> family characteristically expressed in the endothelium and thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis with Dll4-specific antibody revealed that Dll4 was dominantly expressed on the thymic epithelium with cytokeratin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), especially in the cortex (K8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>K5<sup>&#x02212;</sup> region), which is where early T cell development occurs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In contrast, it was found on endothelial cells, but not on the epithelium in gut or salivary gland (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These findings suggested that the distinctive expression of Dll4 on the thymic epithelium contributes to the formation of a thymus-specific environment. To examine the physiological significance of Dll4 on the thymic epithelium for T cell development, Dll4-targeting mice, with the <italic>Dll4</italic> gene flanked by a <italic>loxP</italic> sequence (designated Dll4-floxed), were established (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The floxed allele of <italic>Dll4</italic> gene was removed by Cre recombinase, resulting in the loss of the translational initiation site. These mice were bred with FoxN1-Cre mice, where the <italic>Cre</italic> gene is driven by the regulatory element of <italic>FoxN1</italic> gene (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080134/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080134/DC1</ext-link>). The specific activity of Cre recombinase in FoxN1-Cre mice was observed as the ectopic expression of GFP in the thymic epithelium by crossing with the reporter transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) at the embryonic or adult stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In mice homozygous for floxed <italic>Dll4</italic> with <italic>FoxN1-Cre</italic> transgene (FoxN1Cre:Dll4-floxed), the expression of Dll4 was completely abrogated on TECs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, bottom middle), but was still intact on endothelial cells bearing CD31 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, bottom right). These results indicated that the gene deletion was specifically induced in epithelial cells in the thymus. Moreover, this deletion of the <italic>Dll4</italic> gene did not affect the expression of Dll1 in the thymus (Fig. S2). Interestingly, cortical and medullary regions were almost indistinguishable in the thymus of mutant mice (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Dll4 was expressed on thymic epithelium.</bold> The expression of Dll4 on the epithelium was detected in thymus (A and B, Thymus), but not gut (C, Gut) or salivary gland (C, Sal.

Flow-cytometric analysis of 4-wk-old mouse thymus revealed that almost all cells were composed of CD4 and CD8 DN cells expressing neither Thy1, TCR &#x003b1;&#x003b2;, nor &#x003b3;&#x003b4; with CD3 in FoxN1Cre:Dll4-floxed mice, in comparison to the substantial presence of DP or CD4 and CD8 single-positive T cells expressing Thy1 and TCR&#x02013;CD3 complex in Dll4-floxed mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). These DN cells were mainly immature B cells expressing CD19 and, partially, surface IgM, and showed identical phenotype to that seen in BM, but not in the periphery (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). If DN cells are subdivided into four fractions based on CD44 and CD25 expression, the DN2 and DN3 stages are defined as being CD25 highly positive with <italic>TCR</italic> gene recombinations. Although more than half of the DN cells belonged to DN2/3 in the control thymus, no CD25-positive cells were detected in FoxN1Cre:Dll4-floxed mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, middle). It was recently reported that the DN1 stage was further distinguished into DN1a, b, and c by the expression of CD24 and c-kit (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, right), showing that the DN1a&#x0002b;b fraction contained the earliest T cell progenitors (ETPs) and that DN1c possessed differentiation potential for B cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).

In peripheral lymphoid tissues such as spleen and lymph node of the mutant mice, only a few mature T cells were detected (Fig. S4). These findings first indicated that the Notch signaling induced by Dll4 on the thymic epithelium is essential for the intrathymic immigrant cells to differentiate into T lineage cells, and that the immigrants tend to differentiate into B lineage cells without the Dll4-mediated Notch signaling. They also indicated that the maintenance of DN1a&#x0002b;b immediately after HPCs have migrated, and further differentiation in the thymus, require the Notch signaling provided by Dll4.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>No T cells, but substantial B cells, appear in the thymus with Dll4-null epithelium.</bold> (A) Thymic cellularity (mean &#x000b1; SD) of fetus (E15.5; left, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3; right, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5), neonate (N.B.; left, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5; right, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3), 4-wk-old (4W, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4), or 8-wk-old (8W, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3) <italic>Dll4</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>FoxN1-Cre (FoxN1Cre:Dll4-floxed, shaded columns) mice compared with <italic>Dll4</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> (Dll4-floxed, open columns) mice.

In contrast, other NotchLs, Dll1 and Dll4, were shown to retain the potential to induce T lymphopoiesis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Therefore, it has been strongly suggested that Dll1 and Dll4 are candidates for critical NotchLs in the thymus. However, T cell development was intact when Dll1-floxed mice were crossed with FoxN1Cre mice (unpublished data), as previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The difference in the contribution of Dll1 and Dll4 for T cell development may be explained by a quantitative or qualitative mechanism. Although the expression of Dll1 was detected in the thymus, there was less of it than of Dll4 (Fig. S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), suggesting that Dll4 dominantly functions as a Notch1 ligand in the thymus. Alternatively, there may be a preferential combination between Notch receptors and ligands in the physiological condition. A recent study suggested an advantage of the interaction between Notch1 and Dll4, compared with that between Notch1 and Dll1, for promoting T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). This would be consistent with the results of this study.</p><p>Without the expression of Dll4 on the thymic epithelium, aberrant accumulation of B cells during thymic ontogeny was observed. In <italic>TCR-&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>&#x003b4;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, in which no T cells appear, a few B cells occurred in the thymus, but the cell number was lower than that in normal thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). A small accumulation of B cells was found in <italic>hCD3&#x003b5;</italic> transgenic mice that do not develop T cells, but that cell number was much lower (&#x0003c;1/10) than that in Dll4-deficient thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Substantial B cell accumulation was also detected in the mice receiving some modifications of Notch signaling after the thymus has normally developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Combining the in vitro observation that Notch signaling blocked B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), it is suggested that B cell accumulation in Dll4-deficient thymus is not simply a reflection of the complete impairment of T cell development, but is caused by the reduced Notch signaling.</p><p>Hematopoietic progenitors without Notch signaling give rise to B lineage cells and lose the potential to differentiate into T lineage cells in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). There were reports showing the presence of multi- or bipotent stem cells for T or B cell lineages in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Collectively, it was suggested that all thymic lymphocytes originate from such multipotent stem cells that can migrate into the thymus. On the other hand, some reports indicated that only lineage-committed precursors, and not the stem cells, were detected in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). These possibilities may be acceptable in this study showing that Notch signaling provided by Dll4 in the thymus induces the development of T cells, but blocks B cell development, from the committed precursors or the stem cells, and that aberrant accumulation of B lineage cells instead of T lineage cells can occur without Dll4-mediated Notch signaling. This is consistent with a recent study showing that transcriptional repressor, LRF, contributes to the determination of B cell fate by repressing Notch signaling, and suggests that abundant Notch signaling induced in the thymus overcomes this repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Another study indicated that continuous Notch signaling is necessary to determine the fate to T cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Collectively, it is likely that the necessity of the thymus in T cell development is dependent on the expression of Dll4 in the thymic epithelium, which can provide abundant and continuous Notch signaling sufficient for the specification to T cell lineage from immigrant cells.</p><p>During embryonic development, Notch&#x02013;NotchL interaction between two equipotent progenitors gives rise to Notch signaling to adopt a distinct developmental fate according to the lateral inhibition theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). In intrathymic T cell development, however, NotchL is expressed on the mature epithelium of the thymic environment and induces Notch signaling into immature immigrant cells expressing Notch derived from HPCs. Thus, our findings clearly indicate that Notch&#x02013;NotchL interaction by direct contact between cells with distinct origin and development contributes to the determination of cell fate, and this should benefit our understanding of organogenesis through Notch&#x02013;NotchL interaction in mature individuals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Generation of mice with floxed <italic>Dll4</italic>.</title><p>For construction of a targeting vector containing sequences corresponding to a floxed <italic>Dll4</italic> allele, the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked <italic>neomycin phosphotransferase</italic> (<italic>NeoR</italic>) gene was inserted after exon 3, and a third <italic>loxP</italic> site was also placed before the translational initiation site in exon 1.
