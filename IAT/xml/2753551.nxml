Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed GATA3 to be able to bind the promoter of 4 genes responding to a 1 cGy exposure. To go further into the role of GATA3 after ionizing radiation exposure, we studied the cellular and molecular consequences of radiation in GATA3 knock-down cells. Knock-down was obtained by lentiviral-mediated expression of an shRNA targeting the GATA3 transcript in differentiated keratinocytes. First, radiosensitivity was assessed: the toxicity, in terms of immediate survival (with XTT test), associated with 1 cGy radiation was found to be increased in GATA3 knock-down cells. The impact of GATA3 knock-down on the transcriptome of X-ray irradiated cells was also investigated, using oligonucleotide microarrays to assess changes between 3 h and 72 h post-irradiation in normal vs GATA3 knock-down backgrounds; transcriptome response was found to be completely altered in GATA3 knock-down cells, with a strong induction/repression peak 48 h after irradiation.

For example, diagnostic X-ray procedures are the main man-made source of radiation exposure, accounting for 14% of total exposure worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. There is considerable public and scientific interest in characterizing the biological effects of ionizing radiation (IR) in the dose range occurring in the more routine X-ray procedures, with a specific focus on elucidating the underlying molecular and biochemical mechanisms.</p><p>Organs are not equally sensitive to ionizing radiation, and skin, which is the most exposed organ, is among the most sensitive. Skin is composed of three primary layers: epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. The interfollicular epidermis is a multilayered epithelium that covers the human skin. Its primary function is to serve as a barrier against the organism's environment. Keratinocytes, the main cells composing this epithelium, play a key role in the barrier function of the skin. The effects of moderate and high doses of ionizing radiation on human keratinocytes have been extensively investigated, using large scale genomic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; the effects of low-dose radiation on normal keratinocytes, on the other hand, remain largely unknown. We previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] detected a significant transcriptional response in human keratinocytes exposed to a low dose of 1 cGy, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this response remain to be clarified. Transcription regulation is a key level of control of the cellular response to genotoxic stress. To date, little is known about the transcription factors involved in this response, especially to very low doses of ionizing radiation. To further study this question, we used a bioinformatic strategy to identify candidate transcription factors involved in the regulation of low IR dose responding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Validating these putative regulators required a dedicated functional genomics approach, which was the goal of the present study.</p><p>The study shows for the first time that the transcription factor GATA3 binds to the promoter regions of genes responding to low IR doses, and that silencing this protein in irradiated human keratinocytes leads to generalised transcriptional deregulation after 1 cGy X-irradiation. Taken together, these data indicate that GATA3 plays a key role in the transcriptional response of epidermal cells to very low doses of radiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>GATA proteins bind to the promoters of 4 genes responding to low-dose radiation</title><p>We have previously shown that low-dose IR induces a specific gene response in normal human differentiated keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A significant number of low-dose specific genes were identified, most modulated at 48 h. We focused on a cluster of 17 genes sharing a common temporal profile specific to the low dose. Bioinformatic analysis of these genes' promoter sequences revealed enrichment in GATA consensus sequences corresponding to GATA1 and GATA3 binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To validate the potential involvement of these transcription factors in the co-regulation of the 17 genes, we immunoprecipitated the chromatin of 1 cGy and mock irradiated keratinocytes with anti-GATA1 and anti-GATA3 antibodies. Promoter sequence enrichment was analysed in 10 of the 17 genes. PCR amplification revealed GATA3 ChIP enrichment in 3 genes of the cluster after 1 cGy irradiation (GRCA, NRCAM, PPIL2) (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Some of them (GRCA, MGC11349) were also found to be enriched in GATA1 ChIP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). For MGC11349, an opposite change was observed, with loss of GATA3 binding after irradiation. Taken together, these results indicate that irradiation induces changes in GATA3 binding on the promoter sequences of these 1 cGy responding genes. GATA3 has been shown to be expressed in differentiated keratinocytes and to play a key role in skin morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], whereas GATA1's function appears to be restricted to the hematopoietic system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Based on these data, we decided to further investigate the role of GATA3 in controlling response to low-dose radiation in human keratinocytes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>GATA proteins bind to promoter of IR-responding genes after 1 cGy irradiation</bold>.

Three individual shRNAs targeting different portions of GATA3 mRNA were tested in cultured keratinocytes. The knock-down efficiency of each individual shRNA was measured by RT-PCR at various times after infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). All three shRNAs caused significant repression of GATA3 mRNA, but sh299 was the most efficient, with a 20-fold decrease 72 hours after infection. At protein level, in cells expressing sh299, a marked decrease in GATA3 protein levels was observed at 48 h and 72 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This shRNA clone was therefore selected for a large-scale production of lentiviral particles that were used to establish stable GATA3 knock-down after puromycin selection of infected keratinocytes. A lentiviral vector expressing an shRNA without any target in the human genome (shSCR) served as control.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Silencing GATA3 expression in human keratinocytes transduced with the various GATA3 shRNA vectors</bold>.

Cell viability was monitored 72 h after irradiation, since it is known that cell death may take at least two days to occur in irradiated keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. ShGATA3 cells were found to be more sensitive than shSCR cells at 1 cGy, whereas no significant difference was observed after a dose of 2 Gy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This result highlights a specific role of GATA3 transcription factor in the early response to the lower dose. To evaluate long-term radiosensitivity, colony formation assay was used. Cells were seeded at low density, then irradiated the next day at either 2 Gy or 1 cGy and cultured for 2 weeks. The number of colonies was then determined by manual counting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). More colonies were found for shGATA3 cells, whatever the radiation dose. This could reflect the overall positive effect of GATA3 knock-down on cell proliferation, previously described in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This effect is similar in both 0 Gy and 1 cGy irradiated cells, indicating that long-term radiosensitivity is unchanged in shGATA3 cells after 1 cGy irradiation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Radiosensitivity of shGATA3 keratinocytes</bold>.

The experimental strategy is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. In brief, primary human keratinocytes were cultured in a semi-defined medium and then infected with either sh299 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) or shSCR lentiviral particles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Cells were then cultured for 5 days up to confluence and then further incubated for 3 additional days before being subjected to a 1 cGy dose of X-rays. Total RNA was extracted 4, 24, 48 or 72 hours after irradiation. After RNA amplification and labelling, gene profiling was performed using oligonucleotide microarrays (26,068 probes) to compare 1 cGy irradiated to sham-irradiated cells at individual times. Two similar analyses were performed: one in cells where GATA3 was knocked down after expression of the sh299 sequence (shGATA3 background; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and one in control cells expressing the shSCR sequence (shSCR background; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The silencing of GATA3 in the shGATA3 background was checked by qRT-PCR (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Experimental strategy of the transcriptome analysis</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-10-417-4"/></fig><p>For data analysis, Lowess normalization was applied; genes were selected on a p-value of p &#x0003c; 0.01 and the induction/repression cut-off values were 1.2 and 0.8, respectively.</p><p>Firstly, the number of genes induced or repressed by the 1 cGy radiation was compared between the shGATA3 and shSCR backgrounds. In the shSCR background, the number of genes significantly induced or repressed after 1 cGy X-irradiation was relatively small (&#x0003c; 30) at all time points, and most transcripts appeared to be modulated less than 2-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In the shGATA3 background, a burst of radiation-responding genes was observed, with 266 genes (174 induced, 92 repressed) transcriptionally regulated 48 h after irradiation. Moreover, the magnitude of the change was completely modified, with abundance more than doubled for 50 of the 266 genes. At the other shGATA3 analysis time points, the number of regulated genes was comparable to that in the shSCR analysis.

Total gene lists responding to 1 cGy IR were compared to all analysable genes in the array, using the categorical over-representation function of DAVID. Owing to the small number of IR-responding genes in most of the conditions, only genes up-regulated at 48 h in shGATA3 cells gave highly significant enriched functional categories (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The key up-regulated biological processes in shGATA3 cells were found to be chaperone activity, TGFbeta signalling, stress response, RNA metabolic process and phosphatase activity.

To determine whether these genes might be direct targets of GATA3, a bioinformatic analysis of their promoter sequences was performed. The goal was to assess their putative enrichment in GATA3 binding sequences. The promoter sequences (-750, +250 with respect to the Transcription Start Site) of the 30 most induced and most repressed genes in shGATA3 cells at 48 h were studied using the MatInspector promoter analysis tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Genes repressed at 48 h in shGATA3 cells exhibited two-fold enrichment in GATA3 consensus sequences compared to induced genes and the random control sample (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). These results indicate that the list of genes repressed in shGATA3 cells might be enriched in direct GATA3 targets, whereas induced genes are probably indirectly regulated by GATA3.

GATA3 has been recently shown to be involved in the development of hair follicles and in the determination of skin cell lineage in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In human skin, GATA3 is expressed in suprabasal layers of the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and is also regulated during the differentiation of cultured keratinocytes: GATA3 accumulates during keratinocyte differentiation induced by addition of calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. GATA3 is therefore strongly expressed in differentiated cultured keratinocytes, which were the cell models used in our previous transcription study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. GATA3 plays a key role in the transition between proliferation and differentiation in human epidermal cells through the p63/IKK&#x003b1;/SMAD pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but its function in the control of the cellular response to genotoxic stress has never been explored.</p><p>To monitor the function of GATA3 in the low-dose IR response, we set up a cell model of primary keratinocytes with stable knock-down of GATA3. We decided to study cultured keratinocytes in a differentiated state mimicking the suprabasal layer of human epidermis, since these cells are the first to be exposed in therapeutic or accidental irradiation. GATA3 was knocked down by a lentiviral-mediated shRNA expression. As previously reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], lentiviral vectors appear to be the most suitable for long-term transgene expression, especially in quiescent cells such as stem cells or confluent keratinocytes, whereas chemical methods or electroporation are completely inefficient. We were able to infect more than 70% of our cultured cells and obtained a marked decrease in GATA3 protein level, which became almost undetectable on western-blot, in infected cells. What are the biological consequences of this knock-down? In a normal context, keratinocytes infected by the shGATA3 vector exhibit a higher rate of proliferation (J. Lamartine. In preparation). This effect was clearly visible in our colony-forming assay, where shGATA3 cells were found to be more clonogenic than shSCR cells, whatever the radiation dose. It can therefore be postulated that this long-term effect on proliferation conceals shGATA3 cell hyper-sensitivity to certain doses of radiation. Indeed, the XTT assay, performed 72 h after exposure, revealed specific shGATA3 cell radiosensitivity to the 1 cGy dose, with a 16% decrease in cell viability compared to shSCR cells. After the 2 Gy dose, both cell lines exhibited the same viability. These results indicate that silencing GATA3 modifies the cellular response of irradiated cells, specifically to the low 1 cGy dose, during the first hours following irradiation. Specific radiosensitivity to low IR doses has been previously described for human keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) is an effect in which cells die from excessive sensitivity to low doses (&#x0003c; 0.5 Gy) while becoming resistant to higher doses. The suggested mechanism for HRS is related to the absence at low doses of the inducible DNA repair mechanism observed at higher doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our data indicate that GATA3 knock-down caused increased cell death after 1 cGy IR compared to shSCR cells, highlighting the important role of this protein in the 1 cGy response during the first 72 hours following irradiation. To more closely delineate the relative role of low-dose HRS in this increased cell death, additional studies using a larger range of dose between 1 cGy and 0.5 Gy will be useful.</p><p>To further test the role of GATA3, we compared the transcriptional response of shGATA3 and shSCR cells after 1 cGy IR exposure: a modified gene response profile was observed, with a burst of IR-responding genes in shGATA3 cells at 48 h. This time-point of 48 h seems to be a key moment in the transcriptional response. Our previous microarray studies found that the response to 1 cGy, contrary to the classical bimodal response after higher doses, was characterized by almost complete absence of transcriptional changes at early time points, followed by a large modulation at 48 h post-irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It can be postulated than GATA3 is involved in the control of this 48 h gene response.</p><p>Many of the 266 genes responding at 48 h in shGATA3 cells were involved in fundamental mechanisms known to participate in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Such is the case of EGR1, the gene showing the strongest induction ratio (&#x0003e; 4-fold). EGR1 is a transcription factor strongly activated by a broad spectrum of radiation, and promoting apoptosis and growth arrest through its targets, especially some members of the p53 families and via activation of the EGFR/ERK1/2 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The DUSP1 gene, encoding a dual-specific threonine and tyrosine phosphatase, is also strongly induced in shGATA3 cells. DUSP1 is controlled by p53 during the cellular response to genotoxic stress and is a potent inhibitor of MAPK activity through dephosphorylation of MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The functional annotation of IR-responding genes in shGATA3 cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) revealed several biological processes known to participate in the cellular response to stress: this is the case with TGF&#x003b2; signalling, which concerns 7 of the 174 genes induced at 48 h in shGATA3 cells (TGIF, TSC22D1, TGFBR1, INHBE, SMAD4, ID1, E2F5). TGF&#x003b2;1 is involved in the initiation of keratinocyte differentiation, by blocking their proliferation. This cytokine is also involved in wound healing, by inducing cell migration and keratinocyte matrix secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Moreover, TGF&#x003b2;1 is induced in skin within hours following acute irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and plays a complex role in regulating the canonical cellular DNA damage response through ATM activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A possible link between TGF&#x003b2;1 expression and regulation by GATA proteins has been proposed in hematopoietic cell systems, but the involvement of GATA3 in the regulation of the TGF&#x003b2; pathways has never been described in keratinocytes. Our functional annotation of IR-regulated genes in shGATA3 cells also revealed enrichment in genes involved in chaperone activity and protein folding. Molecular chaperones prevent protein aggregation and keep proteins in a state suitable for either refolding or degradation after a proteolytic stress such as ionizing radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The present study showed that GATA3 knock-down led to excessive sensitivity to low IR doses. It is possible that, in these cells, the fraction of proteins in an unfolded state is increased after irradiation, inducing the chaperone response.</p><p>The central question raised by our study is the link between GATA3 and the genes that are deregulated in shGATA3 cells. To answer this question, we looked for GATA consensus sites in the promoter region of genes that are induced or repressed after irradiation in shGATA3 cells, as compared with a random sample of non-responding genes. We did not observe any enrichment in the fraction of genes that are up-regulated: these genes are probably not direct targets of GATA3. Their up-regulation appears to be secondary to knock-down, or a specific response of cells sensitized to low-dose radiation. On the other hand, the frequency of GATA3 binding sites increased in the fraction of down-regulated genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Some of these genes, such as PPIL2 and GRCA, which we have shown to be bound in vivo by GATA3 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), might be direct targets of GATA3. Nevertheless, further exploration of the GATA3 targets in the low-dose IR response will be necessary to clarify this point. The recent development of methods allowing genome-wide identification of transcription factor targets, such as ChIP chip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or ChIP seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], will offer the possibility of achieving this goal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Over the last few years, numerous large-scale transcription studies have been set up in various cell types to identify radiation-responsive genes that could serve as biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Even though hundreds of differentially expressed transcripts have thus been listed, the molecular mechanisms controlling the transcriptional regulation of these genes remain unknown. We demonstrate here for the first time the involvement of a transcription factor in the response of human cells to very low doses of X-radiation, and we show that various pathways and cellular functions are directly or indirectly dependent on this regulator. These findings open the door to better understanding of the biological effects of extremely low-dose ionizing radiation on human cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskin after routine circumcisions.

The cells dishes were positioned on this phantom with 2 cm of a water-equivalent phantom above.
