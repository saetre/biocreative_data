In most patients, the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene is cytosine-methylated and transcriptionally inactive. NRF-1 and Sp1 are known to bind and stimulate the active, but not the methylated/silenced, <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter. Prior analysis has implicated a CRE site in regulation of <italic>FMR1</italic> in neural cells but the role of this site is controversial. We now show that a phospho-CREB/ATF family member is bound to this site <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also find that the histone acetyltransferases CBP and p300 are associated with active <italic>FMR1</italic> but are lost at the hypoacetylated fragile X allele. Surprisingly, <italic>FMR1</italic> is not cAMP-inducible and resides in a newly recognized subclass of CREB-regulated genes. We have also elucidated a role for NRF-2 as a regulator of <italic>FMR1 in vivo</italic> through a previously unrecognized and highly conserved recognition site in <italic>FMR1</italic>. NRF-1 and NRF-2 act additively while NRF-2 synergizes with CREB/ATF at <italic>FMR1's</italic> promoter. These data add <italic>FMR1</italic> to the collection of genes controlled by both NRF-1 and NRF-2 and disfavor its membership in the immediate early response group of genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Fragile X syndrome results from the loss of functional <italic>FMR1</italic> gene product. This protein, FMRP, binds brain mRNA and therefore is important in nucleic acid metabolism [for a review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>)]. In almost all fragile X patients, disease is due to transcriptional silencing of <italic>FMR1</italic> which occurs after expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) of <italic>FMR1</italic>. Expansion triggers aberrant and permanent DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation and yields an <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter that lacks its activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Demethylation of <italic>FMR1</italic> can be achieved in fragile X cell lines by treatment with 5-azadeoxycytidine which restores transcription factor function and an active state of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>In designing strategies to reactivate <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription, not only it is important to understand the functions of the silencing factors, but also it is crucial to know the identities and contributions of the transcription factors and co-activators normally controlling <italic>FMR1</italic>. Silenced <italic>FMR1</italic> in fragile X syndrome is marked by a loss of histone acetylation, compared with the active <italic>FMR1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). However, it is not known which proteins are responsible for normally maintaining histone acetylation at active <italic>FMR1</italic>. In addition, significant questions regarding the exact identities and functions of the transcription factors controlling <italic>FMR1</italic> are still unanswered.</p><p>Four <italic>in vivo</italic> footprints were initially identified in the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter in primary and transformed cells of fibroblast and lymphoblast origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Several proteins can bind the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter <italic>in vitro</italic>, including CREB, AP-2, Sp1, nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2 (henceforth referred to collectively as USF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). However, these initial studies have left unanswered questions regarding <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have previously shown that Sp1, NRF-1, USF and Max are bound specifically to the active <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and that Sp1 and NRF-1 were strong synergistic activators of <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Recent work by others has shown that AP-2&#x003b1; may serve as a positive regulator of <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Not all transcription factors bound at <italic>FMR1 in vivo</italic> are positively acting. In addition to Max-mediated repression of <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription, we found that USF was unable to activate an <italic>FMR1</italic>-driven reporter in <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cells, and indeed, strongly repressed Sp1 and NRF-1 mediated activation of <italic>FMR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In addition, repression was not dependent on the E-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). This result was surprising, since mutation of the E-box has been shown to lower <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription by &#x0223c;75% in PC12 cells and it has been speculated that USF operates through this site <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, it is still unclear which proteins are actually acting through the initially identified footprint over the E-box, which lies nearest to the transcription start site. It has been especially confusing since early experiments showed that a potential cAMP-responsive element (CRE) overlaps this E-box, suggesting that CREB may transduce neuronal stimuli and thereby impact <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Despite early evidence, most subsequent reports have either not addressed this issue or obtained data that does not support this finding. For example, two <italic>in vivo</italic> footprinting reports showed data suggestive of proteins binding the E-box; however, both reports indicated that the partly overlapping CRE site was not occupied albeit neither study examined neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). In addition, EMSA analyses with an <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter fragment and nuclear extract failed to show that CREB could bind this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Instead, USF bound <italic>in vitro</italic> to an <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter fragment and it was suggested that the E-box could be occupied by this factor <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Furthermore, there is no evidence that CREB occupies the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter in normal cells nor has a functional histone acetyltransferase been identified for this highly acetylated portion of chromatin.</p><p>Since our experiments with USF <italic>in vivo</italic> contradicted the proposed function that USF transactivates <italic>FMR1</italic>, we have now examined both CREB and USF at <italic>FMR1</italic> in human cells. USF represses <italic>FMR1</italic> reporter activity in HeLa cells suggesting that USF does not naturally regulate <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription through the E-box. Instead, we show occupancy of the active, but not inactive promoter, by the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as the histone acetyltransferases CBP and p300. Surprisingly, we find that the endogenous <italic>FMR1</italic> gene in PC12 neuronal-like cells is not cAMP-inducible. We also learned that nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) is bound to <italic>FMR1</italic> in normal but not patient cells and can transactivate the promoter. This is the first implication of this site or transcription factor at <italic>FMR1</italic> and is congruent with earlier evidence that NRF-1 is known to operate with NRF-2 to coordinately control the transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). These data strongly suggest that CREB/ATF family members and not USF regulate <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription through the E-box/CRE, and together with NRF-2, positively contribute to <italic>FMR1</italic> expression. These findings lend new insight into the regulatory network to which the important RNA-binding protein, FMRP, belongs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Construction of pFMR1-luc, which contains a human <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter fragment (&#x02212;272 to +291) driving firefly luciferase expression and mutation of the E-box/CRE in the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).

This result was unexpected, as mutation of the site through which it has been proposed to operate, the E-box/CRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), lowers expression to about 20% of normal in HeLa cells indicating it operates in a positive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is similar to prior observations in rat PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), and led us to explore the role of USF at <italic>FMR1</italic> in human cells. We found that overexpression of USF1, USF2 or a combination of both, repressed <italic>FMR1</italic> reporter activity in HeLa cells between 45 and 60% and repression was largely independent of the E-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To rule out the trivial possibility that this repression was due to overexpression of USF, we employed a dominant negative USF (A-USF) that binds the endogenous USF proteins and prevents them from interacting with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Overexpression of A-USF in HeLa cells did not change <italic>FMR1</italic>-luc expression although the HO-1 promoter, previously shown to be controlled by USF, was repressed in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). These results suggest that USF does not normally contribute in a positive way to <italic>FMR1</italic> core promoter activity in HeLa cells.</p></sec><sec><title>FMR1 is bound <italic>in vivo</italic> by a phosphorylated CREB/ATF family member, as well as CBP/p300, but is not cAMP-inducible</title><p>Since our results suggested that USF is not responsible for the previously described footprint over the E-box, we turned our attention to a potential CRE in the human <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) which overlaps the E-box and is well conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).

Indeed, we found that a phosphorylated CREB/ATF family member was bound at the active human <italic>FMR1</italic> and <italic>c-fos</italic> promoters in lymphoblastoid cells, but not at silenced <italic>FMR1</italic> in fragile X cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This was specific for <italic>FMR1</italic>, since P-CREB occupied the <italic>c-fos</italic> promoter in fragile X cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Since a P-CREB family member was bound at <italic>FMR1</italic>, we also tested if the histone acetyltransferases CBP and p300 that bind P-CREB were associated with active <italic>FMR1</italic>, which shows robust histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Indeed, both histone acetyltransferases reside at <italic>FMR1</italic> and their presence was largely reduced at the fragile X allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>We then used undifferentiated PC12 cells to test if the endogenous <italic>FMR1</italic> gene is cAMP-inducible.

Even after 24 h, <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA levels remained constant (data not shown) revealing that in contrast to previous suggestions, the endogenous <italic>FMR1</italic> gene is not cAMP-inducible in this cell type. We also obtained similar results after KCl/CaCl<sub>2</sub> treatment of PC12 cells (data not shown).</p><p>Since it has been shown that at <italic>c-fos</italic>, the phosphorylation of CREB increases in response to forskolin treatment, and this is followed by induction of transcription, we tested if phosphorylation of CREB/ATF at <italic>FMR1</italic> changed after forskolin treatment. We found that the CRE-binding proteins at <italic>FMR1</italic> and <italic>c-fos</italic> were phosphorylated in undifferentiated PC12 cells without forskolin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, upper panel). We performed quantitative analyses of P-CREB binding at <italic>c-fos</italic> and <italic>FMR1</italic> and found that in response to forskolin treatment, the increase in occupancy of the phosphorylated CRE-binding protein on <italic>FMR1</italic> was &#x0223c;2.2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lower left panel), while that on <italic>c-fos</italic> was &#x0223c;4.6-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lower right panel).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of a conserved consensus NRF-2 binding site in the FMR1 5&#x02032;-UTR</title><p>Previous <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter analysis identified several protein binding sites conserved among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Using homology alignment, we found another evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding site that had not been previously identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The conservation of the GTTT sequences 5&#x02032; to the boxed NRF-2 site suggests these bases are also important NRF-2 contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since recent work has shown that expression patterns of <italic>FMR1-</italic>encoded proteins in zebrafish, as well as <italic>Xenopus</italic>, are conserved compared to humans, we looked to see if the promoter sequences for <italic>FMR1</italic> may also be conserved in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). We have now extended the alignment of the <italic>FMR1</italic> 5&#x02032; region to include sequences from <italic>Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis</italic> as well as <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). A TATA-like motif and the NRF-2 site are conserved among all species tested, despite variations in the intervening sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, recently available genomic sequence of the zebrafish <italic>FMR1</italic> gene shows that, in addition to the TATA-like and NRF-2 elements, sites representing the four <italic>in vivo</italic> footprints in the human <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter are also conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The NRF-2 site is positively acting and NRF-2 stimulates the FMR1 promoter</title><p>We tested the function of the putative NRF-2 site in the human <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter. Mutating four bases in the binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) reduced <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter activity to 40% of wild-type in HeLa cells showing the importance of this site for <italic>FMR1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To test if <italic>FMR1</italic> was a bona fide NRF-2 target, we asked if NRF-2 was bound to active <italic>FMR1</italic> in human cells. Using ChIP and an antibody against its DNA-binding (alpha) subunit, we found that NRF-2 is bound to <italic>FMR1 in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As expected for an activator of transcription, NRF-2 was not bound at the silenced, expanded <italic>FMR1</italic> allele in patient cells, although it occupies the active Tfam promoter in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown the importance of NRF-1 in <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). NRF-1 often works at promoters with NRF-2; this is especially well documented for numerous nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). To test NRF-2's transcriptional activity at <italic>FMR1</italic>, we asked whether NRF-2 could activate the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter in SL2 cells which have previously proven successful in assessing the function of this transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). As expected, transfection of either NRF-2-alpha or NRF-2-beta alone had no effect on <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription (data not shown). However, co-transfection of both subunits activated the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter between 1.7- and 3.1-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). We then tested if NRF-1 and NRF-2 could work together at <italic>FMR1</italic> and found that they activated transcription additively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Since members of the CREB/ATF family have been shown to work with NRF-2 to synergistically activate transcription, we wanted to test if this occurred at <italic>FMR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Indeed, we found that ATF-1 activates <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription synergistically with NRF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This result is similar to that obtained with CREB and NRF-2 (data not shown). Importantly, mutation of either the E-box/CRE or the NRF-2 binding site abolished activation by ATF-1 and NRF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The precise roles and relative importance of the many transcription factors implicated in <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter function is controversial. Early reports suggested that <italic>FMR1</italic> is regulated by cAMP signaling, perhaps through CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Here we show that CRE-binding proteins play a role in <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription, however the endogenous gene is not induced in a manner such as that observed for the immediate early <italic>c-fos</italic> gene. These data are consistent with our findings that USF does not appear to operate through this region of the promoter resolving the paradox that a protein resides at this site but that USF does not activate this promoter. It is also worth noting that <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cells accurately predicted how USF proteins would act at the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter in a human cell line, showing that this is a useful cell line for studying these human transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Due to the overlapping nature of the E-box and the CRE, it is unlikely that both could be occupied at the same time by different transcription factors. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this overlapping site could be differentially used by E-box binding factors and CRE-binding proteins in different cell types. To date, there is no direct <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that USF is positively acting through the E-box/CRE site at <italic>FMR1</italic> in any cell type and c-Myc is not present at <italic>FMR1 in vivo</italic> though other E-box binding proteins could play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, USF can bind to an <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter fragment and induce bending of an <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Curiously, our previous <italic>in vivo</italic> ChIP results indicate that USF resides on the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter in lymphoblastoid cells however it does not regulate the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter through the E-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). USF has also been shown to work through initiator (<italic>Inr</italic>) elements that surround the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). However, mutation of an <italic>Inr</italic> element in <italic>FMR1</italic> did not affect promoter activity in reporter assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The recognition site for USF and its function at <italic>FMR1</italic> remain to be elucidated. Our data suggest that USF is not acting in the &#x0223c;300 bp upstream of the transcription start site and no incriminating <italic>in vivo</italic> footprints were identified up to &#x0223c;600 bp upstream of the start site, although there is a perfect consensus E-box at &#x0223c;&#x02212;800 bp from the transcription start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). If bound by USF, perhaps this site plays a role in maintaining chromatin structure of <italic>FMR1</italic> on the endogenous locus and hence, its role, as determined using a minimal promoter fragment on reporter plasmids and through <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, has not been appreciated. Consistent with this idea, USF has recently been implicated in recruiting histone acetyltransferase activity at genomic regions suggesting that these proteins could play a similar role at <italic>FMR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p><p>In addition to clarifying which protein is working through the E-box/CRE, we have found a new transcription factor binding site on <italic>FMR1</italic> that binds NRF-2/GA-binding protein (GABP) <italic>in vivo</italic>. This site has remained unidentified as previous footprinting analyses either did not cover this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) or did not find evidence of a footprint in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Perhaps the binding of NRF-2 to this site is not stable enough to be detected reliably without the use of crosslinking agents. It has been previously shown that NRF-2 binding is affected by methylation of its recognition site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Indeed, our results show that NRF-2 does not occupy the promoter in patient cells, thereby reinforcing the view that a global repression mechanism shuts this gene off in patients. A role for NRF-2 at <italic>FMR1</italic> follows from our previous evidence showing the importance of NRF-1 in <italic>FMR1</italic> expression. In addition to its role at <italic>FMR1</italic>, potential NRF-1 sites have been reported in the promoters of multiple other genes involved in translation and mRNA metabolism, e.g. <italic>eIF2-alpha</italic>, <italic>eIF2-beta</italic> and <italic>hnRNP-A2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>), and we have discovered putative NRF-2 binding sites in all of these promoters as well (data not shown). Thus, FMRP could fit into a &#x02018;RNA metabolism&#x02019; regulon of genes controlled by both NRF-1 and NRF-2, since it is an RNA-binding protein associated with translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p><p>The best studied functions for NRF-1 and NRF-2, however, are in controlling transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial-related genes, notably the major transcription factor <italic>Tfam</italic>, as well as mitochondrial transcription specificity factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). It is not clear what separates or potentially links NRF-1 and NRF-2 mediated regulation of mitochondrial-related genes and those involved in RNA metabolism, or other functions.</p><p>An important question is the inducibility of <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter function. Despite the suggestion made several years ago that <italic>FMR1</italic> may be cAMP-inducible, we are not aware of any reports that have tested this hypothesis on the endogenous <italic>FMR1</italic> gene. Phosphorylation of CREB was originally thought to be specific and sufficient for the cAMP-induction of genes. Recent work, however, shows that genes can be bound by P-CREB regardless of cAMP-inducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Indeed, we have shown that even though <italic>FMR1</italic> is bound by P-CREB/ATF as well as by CBP/p300, it is not cAMP-inducible. An important step in CREB/ATF function is the recruitment of CBP/p300 to P-CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Sp1, NRF-1 and NRF-2, may also play a role in recruiting CBP/p300 suggesting that these HATs may be recruited to <italic>FMR1</italic> through their interactions with multiple transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the overlapping E-box and CRE elements in the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter are almost identical to the E-box/CRE site in the human <italic>c-fos</italic> promoter with a one base pair difference in the E-box: C<underline>C</underline>CGTGACGT versus <italic>FMR1</italic>'s: C<underline>A</underline>CGTGACGT. However, we have shown that there are many differences between the two genes and their regulation by CRE-binding proteins. The co-existence of a TATA box and a CRE within a promoter has been shown to correlate with cAMP-responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). The absence of a canonical TATA box from the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter may partly explain its non-responsiveness to cAMP. In this regard, <italic>FMR1</italic> has many characteristics of a housekeeping gene, including the lack of a TATA box, a high GC content and its regulation by factors such as NRF-1, NRF-2 and Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). The prior observation that an <italic>FMR1</italic>-driven reporter construct was cAMP-inducible, may have resulted from the inclusion of only a small fragment of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter, which contained the CRE but lacked the other <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>FMRP has been implicated in synaptic plasticity suggesting that, at some level, <italic>FMR1</italic> expression may be responsive to neuronal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). However, <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription was not responsive to cAMP, or to depolarization which is known to activate NRF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Perhaps <italic>FMR1</italic> does not need to be induced at the transcriptional level in adult neurons since post-translational changes modulate FMRP in response to certain stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). For example, <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA and FMRP rapidly localize in dendrites in response to treatment with KCl and FMRP is quickly translated within 5 min of mGluR stimulation of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Even though these stimuli activate CREB, it would take longer to make FMRP through a transcriptional induction pathway than to directly increase FMRP levels by post-transcriptional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). Hence, mobilization of pre-existing <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA and protein, along with rapid local translation may be more important for the neuronal functions of FMRP than new mRNA synthesis. In support of this model, FMRP levels increase in cortical neurons following stimulation by light exposure, but mRNA levels do not change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). A complete description of the regulatory landscape of the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter will facilitate the examination of the intrinsic developmental and external neuronal signaling mechanisms by which regulation of <italic>FMR1</italic> is achieved.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Jonathan Lochamy and Dr Jerry Boss for the gift of phospho-CREB antiserum, CREB expression vectors, and helpful advice.
