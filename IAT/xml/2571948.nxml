The activated enzyme was purified by a three-step procedure that included a size-exclusion Agarose A1.5 m chromatography, non-denaturing preparative gel-electrophoresis, and size-exclusion HPLC. The purified proteinase was characterized for the proteinase type, proteolysis of bovine recombinant &#x003b3;B-, &#x003b3;C-, and &#x003b3;D-crystallins, and its presence in three different protein fractions of human lenses (i.e., &#x003b1;-crystallin, &#x003b2;<sub>H</sub>-crystallin, and membrane fractions).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>An inactive, Arg-bond hydrolyzing proteinase present in the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction showed activity on treatment with detergents such as sodium deoxycholate, Triton X-100, octyl &#x003b2;-D-glucopyranoside, and CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamido propyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate). The sodium deoxycholate-activated enzyme was released from the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction since it eluted at a lower molecular weight species than &#x003b1;-crystallin during size-exclusion Agarose A1.5 m chromatography. Following a three-step purification procedure, the enzyme showed three species between 22 kDa and 25&#x000a0;kDa during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#x02013;PAGE) analysis. The three protein bands were identified as &#x003b2;A3-, &#x003b2;B1-, and &#x003b2;B2-crystallin by the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and tandem mass spectrometric (ES-MS/MS) methods.

Additionally, the existence of ubiquitin-proteasome activity has been described in the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. In spite of the existence of so many proteinases, the lens exhibits a low protein turnover rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], which is further suggested by the limited degradation of &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;-crystallins in mammalian lenses. However, truncation of the crystallins increases with aging and cataractogenesis in human lenses for reasons yet unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].</p><p>Our previous studies have shown that the human lens 25 kDa proteinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] and a membrane proteinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] hydrolyzed the Arg-bond-containing substrates. More recently, we presented evidence that the Arg-bond hydrolyzing proteinase activity was associated with &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. The properties of the enzyme were apparently similar to a previously studied 25&#x000a0;kDa proteinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] and a membrane proteinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], both of which needed activation and were a serine-type. The results suggested that the &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallin proteinase might be present in water soluble fractions and associated with the membranes in human lenses.</p><p>Our previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] have also shown that the Arg-bond hydrolyzing lens proteinase existed in an inactive state and was activated by either metal ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] or by a detergent such as sodium deoxycholate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Although the proteinase existed in an inactive state possibly due to its inhibition by &#x003b1;-crystallin as suggested in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>] and in the reports that show inhibition of trypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] and elastase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] by &#x003b1;-crystallin, the presence of the enzyme in an inactive state in the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction has not been investigated.</p><p>With the exception of our report of &#x003b2;A3-crystallin as the proteinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] and the observation that recombinant &#x003b2;A3-crystallin readily degrade to 20&#x02013;25&#x000a0;kDa major species during purification and on storage, no other report has suggested such an association between enzyme activity and the crystallin. Nevertheless, suggestive evidence exists in one report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], which showed that &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallin, upon ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, exhibited degradation and multimer formation in species higher than 27&#x000a0;kDa. Although the report attributed the disappearance of the crystallin to increasing doses of irradiation, the observed pattern was similar to what we have observed during sodium deoxycholate-induced activation of proteinase activity in &#x003b2;A3-crystallin. Presently, the molecular events that lead to the activation of proteinase activity in the crystallin is not fully understood, except that the truncation in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal extension and altered conformation of the crystallin are required. The age-related NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal truncation in &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallin has been demonstrated in fetal and adult bovine lenses with the absence of NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 11 and 22 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Similarly, NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal truncations of &#x003b2;B1- and &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallins in three-year-old human lenses was also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>], and we showed that age-related progressive NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal truncations in human &#x003b2;A3-crystallin produce 4-18&#x000a0;kDa species with a major cleavage at the E<sub>39</sub>-N<sub>40</sub> bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. The potential effects of these in vivo NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal truncations on crystallin structure and proteinase function have not been studied.</p><p>Based on our previous results as described above, we hypothesized that because &#x003b1;-crystallin acts as an inhibitor of &#x003b2;A3-crystallin proteinase, a proteinase/&#x003b1;-crystallin complex might exist in the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction of human lenses. To test this hypothesis, we used the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction to activate and purify the proteinase and examined whether the enzyme activity was associated with &#x003b2;A3-crystallin. In addition, we have also examined whether this enzyme exists in the &#x003b1;-crystallin, &#x003b2;<sub>H</sub>-crystallin, and membrane fractions of human lenses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Normal human lenses with no apparent opacity were obtained from Dr. Robert Church (Emory University, Atlanta, GA).

Briefly, each lens was thawed on ice, decapsulated, suspended (2&#x000a0;ml/lens) in buffer A (50&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 1&#x000a0;mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 1&#x000a0;mM iodoacetamide, 1&#x000a0;mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized using a tissue grinder. The lens homogenate was centrifuged at 25,000x g for 15 min. The supernatant was recovered and the pellet was homogenized and centrifuged twice as described above. The supernatants recovered after each centrifugation were pooled and designated as the WS protein fraction, and the pellet was designated as the water insoluble (WI) protein fraction. The WS protein fraction was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using an Agarose A5 m column (2.5&#x000d7;40 cm) to recover the high molecular weight (HMW) protein fraction as well as &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;<sub>H</sub>-, &#x003b2;<sub>L</sub>-, and &#x003b3;-crystallin fractions. The individual column fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#x02013;PAGE) to identify the presence of specific crystallins, and each of the fractions were individually pooled, dialyzed against a desired buffer, and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C before use.</p></sec><sec><title>Proteinase activity in &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction</title><p>The Arg-bond hydrolyzing proteinase activity was measured by the hydrolysis of either N-benzoyl DL-Arg p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) or CBZ-L-Arg 7-amino 4-methyl coumarin as a substrate (see below the method for enzyme assay) in the &#x003b1;-crystallin and in other desired protein preparations. The proteinase activity in the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction was determined by the following three methods: (1) The &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction was treated with 2% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), and the activity was determined in the detergent-treated and untreated fractions following size-exclusion Agarose A 1.5 m chromatography; (2) the &#x003b1;-crystallin was treated with individual detergents (sodium deoxycholate, sodium dodecyl sulfate [anionic], Triton X-100, octyl &#x003b2;-D-glucopyranoside [non-ionic], or 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate [CHAPS; a zwitterion]), and the proteinase activity was determined; or (3) the sodium deoxycholate-treated and untreated &#x003b1;-crystallin fractions were incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10 h and then subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].

All the purification steps were performed at 5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C unless indicated otherwise. In the first step, the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction was prepared as described above from the WS protein fraction by a size-exclusion Agarose A 1.5 m chromatography, treated with sodium deoxycholate (final concentration of 2% [w/v]), and chromatographed through an Agarose A1.5 m column (5&#x000d7;80 cm). The column equilibration and sample elution were performed with buffer A (see above for the composition). In the second step, the proteinase-containing fractions from the Agarose column were pooled, concentrated by lyophilization, and dialyzed against 10X excess of buffer A. The preparation was then subjected to preparative non-denaturing gel (10% polyacrylamide gel) electrophoresis using a Bio-Rad Prep Cell (model 491; Hercules, CA). The fractions were recovered as proteins that were eluted from the preparative gel and analyzed for enzyme activity with BAPNA as a substrate and for protein species by SDS&#x02013;PAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. The enzyme-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated by lyophilization, and dialyzed against 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. In the third step, the proteinase-containing fractions were fractionated by HPLC using a size-exclusion TSK G3000 PW<sub>XL</sub> column (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA). During HPLC, the column equilibration and sample elution were performed with 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5.

MALDI-TOF MS analysis and ES-MS/MS sequencing (Micromass Q-TOF 2; Waters-Micromass, Manchester, UK) were performed at the Comprehensive Cancer Center Mass Spectrometry Shared Facility of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. For mass spectrometric analysis, the individual protein spots/bands were excised from a SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel using pipette microtips. The polyacrylamide pieces containing individual bands were destained with three consecutive washes with a 50:50 mixture of 25&#x000a0;mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile for 30 min. Next, the samples were washed for 10 min with 25&#x000a0;mM ammonium bicarbonate before digestion with trypsin (12 ng/&#x003bc;l; sequencing grade from from Roche, Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN) for 16 h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Peptide solutions were then extracted using 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of a 50:50 mixture of 5% formic acid and acetonitrile for 30 min. Supernatants were collected and evaporated to dryness in a Savant SpeedVac (Marietta, OH). Samples were resuspended in 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 0.1% formic acid. C-18 ZipTips (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were used to desalt peptide mixtures before applying samples to the MALDI-TOF 96 well spot, gold-coated target plates. Bound peptides were eluted from the ZipTips with 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. They were mixed (1/10 dilution) with a saturated solution of &#x003b1;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix in 50% aqueous acetonitrile. Samples were allowed to dry before performing MALDI-TOF MS using a Voyager DE-Pro (ABI, Foster City, CA) with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) operating in positive mode. Spectra were the sum of 100 laser shots &#x02013; they were then de-isotoped and analyzed using Voyager Explorer Software (Applied Biosystems, Forest City, CA), and peptide masses were submitted to the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">MASCOT</ext-link> search engine for protein identification. The potential identity of the proteins was determined by using the NCBInr database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). Tandem mass spectral analyses were performed with the Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization to verify the identity of the proteins. The tryptic peptides used for the MALDI-TOF MS analysis were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Liquid chromatography was performed using a LC Packings Ultimate LC-Switchos microcolumn switching unit and Famos autosampler (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA). The samples were concentrated on a 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m i.d. C<sub>8</sub> reverse-phase precolumn at a flow rate of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/min with 0.1% formic acid and then flushed onto a 10 cm&#x000d7;75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m i.d.

The nanoelectrospray ionization interface was used to transfer the LC eluent into the mass spectrometer. The Q-TOF was operated in the automatic switching mode where multiple-charged ions were subjected to MS/MS if their intensities rose above six counts. Protein identification was performed by either ProteinLynx Global Server software (Waters, Milford, MA) or by manual interpretation.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional studies</title><sec><title>Nature of the &#x003b1;-crystallin-associated proteinase</title><p>A variety of inhibitors were used to determine the nature of the proteinase.

The column fractions containing proteinase activity were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. The fractions representing the highest proteinase activity peak and a detergent-untreated &#x003b2;A3-crystallin preparation were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. The partial NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal sequence of the major bands in the two fractions was determined at the Iowa State University Protein Core Facility (Ames, IA). The detergent-untreated and detergent-treated &#x003b2;A3-crystallin preparations with proteinase activity were used for the determination of structural changes as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. The analyses included surface hydrophobicity changes by ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfate, a hydrophobic probe)-binding, Trp microenvironmental changes by intrinsic Trp fluorescence spectra recording, and secondary structural changes by circular dichroism (CD) spectral determination. The fluorescence spectra were recorded in corrected spectrum mode using a spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD) with excitation and emission band passes set at 5 nm and 3 nm, respectively. The binding of a hydrophobic probe, ANS, to &#x003b2;A3-crystallin preparations was determined by recording fluorescence spectra after excitation at 390 nm and emission between 400 and 600 nm. In these experiments, 15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 0.8&#x000a0;mM ANS (dissolved in methanol) was added to a protein preparation (0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml, dissolved in 10&#x000a0;mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). The samples were incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 15 min before the fluorescence measurements. The intrinsic Trp fluorescence intensities of the &#x003b2;A3-crystallin preparations (0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml of each) were recorded with an excitation at 295 nm and emission between 300 and 400 nm. The secondary structural changes in the &#x003b2;A3-crystallin preparations were determined by recording their far-UV CD spectra at room temperature using an AVIV Spectropolarimeter (Model62DS; AVIV, Lakewood, NJ). The &#x003b2;A3-crystallin preparations of 0.1&#x02013;0.2&#x000a0;mg/ml (dissolved in 50&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) were used for recording the far-UV CD spectra. The path length was 0.1 cm during the far-UV CD spectra determination. The spectra reported are the average of five scans, corrected for buffer blank and smoothed.

In the first experiment, no proteinase activity was observed in the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction of human lenses of 60 to 70-year-old donors until the preparation was treated with sodium deoxycholate and fractionated by a size-exclusion Agarose A1.5 m column. Following chromatography, the proteinase eluted later than &#x003b1;-crystallin, which suggests its dissociation and a lower molecular weight than the crystallin. On examination of the fractions that contained proteinase activity by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, three protein bands, two of about 22&#x02013;25&#x000a0;kDa and one of about 38&#x000a0;kDa, were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction isolated from lenses of 20-year-old donors, suggesting that the association of the enzyme with the crystallin occurred early during aging (results not shown). In the second experiment, the dissociation of the proteinase activity from the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction following treatment with sodium deoxycholate (anionic, 0.1% final concentration), Triton X-100 (non-ionic, 0.1%), octyl &#x003b2;-D-glucopyranoside (non-ionic, 0.2%), and CHAPS (zwitterionic, 0.1%) was also observed.

After withdrawing the aliquots at 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h during proteolysis and analysis by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, the &#x003b3;B-crystallin exhibited resistance to proteolysis by the enzyme, but both &#x003b3;C- and &#x003b3;D-crystallins were proteolyzed producing three and six major fragments, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Figure 10</xref>, lanes 7 and 10).The partial NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal sequence analysis of &#x003b3;D-crystallin fragments showed that the following peptide bonds were cleaved: M<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>2</sub> in fragment #1 (~19-kDa), Q<sub>54</sub>-Y<sub>55</sub> in fragment #2 (~14-kDa), M<sub>70</sub>-G<sub>71</sub> in fragment #3 (~12-kDa), and Q<sub>103</sub>-M<sub>104</sub> in fragment #4 (~10&#x000a0;kDa).

(2) The recombinant &#x003b2;A3-crystallin when activated with sodium deoxycholate and size-exclusion HPLC exhibited proteinase activity, which was accompanied by cleavage at K<sub>17</sub>-M<sub>18</sub> bond in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal extension arm. The appearance of proteinase activity was accompanied by secondary and tertiary structural changes. (3) The enzyme was present in three separate fractions (&#x003b1;-crystallin, &#x003b2;<sub>H</sub>-crystallin, and membrane fractions) of human lenses. (4) The proteinase exhibited in vitro proteolysis of human &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallins and bovine &#x003b3;C- and &#x003b3;D-crystallins. The first finding suggests the potential role of &#x003b1;-crystallin as a proteinase inhibitor as evident from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. The second finding suggests that the activation of the proteinase activity in the recombinant &#x003b2;A3-crystallin was accompanied by cleavage in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal arm and secondary structural changes, which support our previous finding that truncation in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal arm was needed for the activation of proteinase activity in the human lens &#x003b2;A3-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. The third finding of the presence of the same enzyme in the &#x003b1;-crystallin and membrane fractions in addition to the &#x003b2;<sub>H</sub>-crystallin fraction suggests an age-related aggregation of &#x003b2;A3-crystallin with &#x003b1;-crystallin and later the localization of the aggregate with the membrane. The fourth finding suggests that the enzyme, although remaining in an inactive state in the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction, is capable of proteolyzing &#x003b1;A-, &#x003b1;B-, and &#x003b3;-crystallins. These findings are significant in view of our present limited knowledge about in vivo physiologic and biochemical relevance of &#x003b2;A3-crystallin proteinase activity.</p><p>Our studies have shown that &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallins form aggregates with &#x003b2;A3-crystallin, which occurs due to hydrophobic interaction (unpublished results). We hypothesize that with deoxycholate treatment, the enzyme dissociated from &#x003b1;-crystallin because of its greater solubility in the detergent compared to &#x003b1;-crystallin. Once released from the &#x003b1;-crystallin fraction upon detergent treatment, the enzyme elutes as a lower molecular weight species (in the &#x003b2;<sub>H</sub>-crystallin region) compared to the &#x003b1;-crystallin. A previous report has shown that sodium deoxycholate treatment disrupted the native oligomeric structures of both &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallins and resulted in their tetrameric state without significant changes in their secondary structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. However, we did not observe the tetrameric state of &#x003b1;-crystallin. Instead, the crystallin eluted in the void volume during size-exclusion Agarose A1.5 m chromatography. This could be due to the removal of the detergent from &#x003b1;-crystallin following chromatography that might have led to the reorganization of the &#x003b1;-crystallin oligomer back to the original state. Indeed, the excess of detergent was recovered as a separate peak after the elution of the proteinase during Agarose A1.5 m chromatography. Previous reports have suggested potential binding of proteins via hydrophobic interactions with &#x003b1;-crystallin. The labeling of an intrinsic membrane protein with the probe, trifluoromethyl-3-(~z-[' I] iodophenyl) diazirine, showed that &#x003b1;-crystallin contains hydrophobic regions on its surface, which might enable it to make contact with the lipid bilayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. The interactions between &#x003b1;-crystallin and the membrane is not membrane lipid-specific but rather &#x003b1;-crystallin aggregate-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>], and the binding of &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallins to the lens membrane is via hydrophobic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Carver et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>] have suggested that &#x003b1;-crystallin acts as an anionic surfactant during interaction with proteins to prevent precipitation of the partially unfolded form of proteins. Furthermore, the binding of &#x003b1;-crystallin to form a complex with a proteolytic enzyme has also been shown, i.e., a complex formation with prochymosin during refolding but not with active chymosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. Prochymosin is a zymogen of chymosin, which is a milk-clotting enzyme with low proteolytic activity. Previously, our results showed that deoxycholate treatment leads to a redistribution of different species of the human lens &#x003b2;-crystallin as represented by the generation of new aggregates, and these species were originally not present in detergent-untreated &#x003b2;-crystallins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Taken together, the association of proteinase with &#x003b1;-crystallin seems to be through hydrophobic interactions, which resulted in the release of the proteinase when disrupted by a detergent. Although proteolysis of both &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallins was seen through in vitro incubation, whether the enzyme activity was acquired before or after dissociation from &#x003b1;-crystallin is presently unclear.</p><p>The proteinase was purified about 500 fold with a 1,094 fold increase in specific activity following the three-step purification method. SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis on the highly purified proteinase preparation showed three protein bands, which were identified as &#x003b2;B1-, &#x003b2;B2-, and &#x003b2;A3-crystallins by the ES-MS/MS mass spectrometric method. Among these crystallins, only recombinant &#x003b2;A3-crystallin showed proteinase activity. The recombinant human &#x003b2;A3-crystallin used in this study was purified to almost homogeneity by a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity column and showed only a single band of 32&#x000a0;kDa during SDS&#x02013;PAGE and a single spot on a two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis (results not shown). Detergent treatment and the activation of the enzyme activity in the crystallin resulted not only in its degradation but also the presence of several yet to be identified species. These species could be degradation products of the crystallin and their multimers.</p><p>It was surprising that the purified proteinase showed a complex of &#x003b2;B1-, &#x003b2;B2-, and &#x003b2;A3-crystallins, and the complex of the three crystallins remained together during the three purification steps. Our attempts to dissociate the three crystallins from the complex by an ion-exchange column chromatographic method were unsuccessful. However, such complexes with &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallins in the HMW proteins of both young and old human lenses were shown in our recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>].</p><p>As stated above, &#x003b1;-crystallin showed inhibition of both trypsin and elastase during in vitro experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Our recent studies about the interaction of human &#x003b1;A- or &#x003b1;B-crystallins with &#x003b2;A3-crystallin through the two-hybrid system and in vivo FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) have also suggested interactions among the crystallins (unpublished results). Therefore, we speculate that the inhibition of the enzyme by &#x003b1;-crystallin might be an in vivo mechanism to prevent unwanted proteolysis of &#x003b1;A- and &#x003b1;B-crystallins and to preserve their chaperone activity. Such speculation is strengthened by the fact that the same proteinase was present in an inactive state in &#x003b1;-crystallin, &#x003b2;<sub>H</sub>-crystallin, and membrane fractions of human lenses. This could be due to age-related distributional changes in a complex with &#x003b1;-crystallin and &#x003b2;A3-crystallin. This is also consistent with our results showing that &#x003b2;A3-crystallin exists in both urea soluble and urea insoluble fractions of the WI protein fraction of human lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Although the membrane fraction was prepared by the extensive urea washing method as described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], a need for activation of the proteinase by a detergent from this fraction suggests the existence of an inactive enzyme.</p><p>Human &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallin undergoes several posttranslational modifications that include S-methylation, glutathiolation, and truncation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. A loss 4 and 18 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal residues in &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallin at an early stage of life (i.e., three years of age) has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. This truncation of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal extension at a very early developmental stage does not significantly alter the structural properties. Further, three of the five NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal truncations in the crystallin were found to be adjacent to a proline residue (i.e., N<sub>4</sub>-P<sub>5</sub>, P<sub>7</sub>-G<sub>8</sub>, and G<sub>10</sub>-P<sub>11</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. A comparison of nuclear and cortical &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallins from 11-year-old and 19-year-old human lenses showed more truncation among nuclear than cortical &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallins in both ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. Our results also showed that the majority of age-related degradation in human &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallins occurred at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region with a major cleavage site at the E<sub>39</sub>-N<sub>40</sub> bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Recently, we identified several truncated species of &#x003b2;A3/A1- and &#x003b2;B1-crystallins in human cataractous lenses that were absent in normal lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Because our recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>] showed that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain is relatively more stable than the COOH-terminal domain in human &#x003b2;A3-crystallin, the truncation of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal regions might impair its stability to form complexes with other &#x003b2;-crystallins and might lead to aggregation with &#x003b1;-crystallin. As stated above, the Arg-bond hydrolyzing activity is associated with a truncated &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], and therefore, the regulation of the enzyme activity in vivo might involve the prevention of truncation of &#x003b2;A3/A1-crystallin and the inhibition of the enzyme activity of the truncated crystallin.</p><p>Several important questions emerge from this study. The activation mechanism of the crystallin proteinase and its association with different crystallins including the lens membrane remain to be studied. Further, an understanding of the molecular mechanism of the proteinase inhibition by &#x003b1;-crystallin in relation to the chaperone function of the latter is needed. In future studies, we will utilize &#x003b1;-crystallin-associated proteinase as the model system to answer these questions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study is supported by a National Eye Institute grant, EY 06400; partly by NIH grants, P50AT00477 and P30EY0339; the Faculty Development Grant-University of Alabama at Birmingham; and the EyeSight Foundation of Alabama grant.
