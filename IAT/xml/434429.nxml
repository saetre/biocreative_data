The paired amphipathic helices of Sin3A were identified and studied as protein&#x02013;protein interacting domains. Previously we have shown the interaction of Sin3A with the CoR Alien <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here, we show that Alien and Sin3A reside together <italic>in vivo</italic> with the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> receptor on the human 24-hydroxylase (CYP24) promoter containing vitamin D<sub>3</sub> response elements by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We delineated and characterized the interaction domains of Sin3A with Alien. Interestingly, the highly conserved region (HCR) of Sin3A, which has not yet been functionally characterized, interacts with Alien. The HCR encompasses only 134 amino acids, shares more than 80&#x00025; identity with Sin3B and binds to the N-terminus of Alien, which harbours a transferable silencing function. Functionally, co-expression of Sin3A enhances Alien-mediated gene repression and overexpression of the HCR alone leads to the inhibition of Alien-mediated repression and to the induction of the endogenous CYP24 promoter. Our results therefore indicate a novel functional role of the Sin3 HCR and give novel insights into Alien-mediated gene repression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gene silencing is mediated in part through the recruitment of conserved co-repressors (CoRs) to DNA-bound transcriptional silencers (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c3">3</xref>). CoRs mediate gene repression by binding to basal transcription factors and/or by recruitment of an enzymatic activity that alters chromatin structure. Sin3 was shown to recruit histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and histone methyltransferase activity, which is thought to lead to a more compact chromatin structure. This in turn leads to lower accessibility of transcriptional activators and basal promoter factors to their target sites and, ultimately, to a reduced transcription rate at that particular gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c6">6</xref>).</p><p>Sin3A and Sin3B exhibit in part strong sequence similarities and both proteins are evolutionarily conserved, having homologues in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and yeast. Sin3 proteins harbour four paired amphipathic helices (PAH) motifs and were shown to inhibit expression of the yeast HO gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c7">7</xref>). Yeast Sin3 was originally also found to repress the human progesterone receptor heterologously expressed in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c8">8</xref>). In mammalian cells Sin3A and Sin3B were originally found to be involved in Mad/Max-mediated repression and cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c12">12</xref>). Subsequently, an increasing number of transcription factors were identified that interact with Sin3A or Sin3B. Mapping the interaction domains (IDs) of Sin3 with various transcription factors, the PAH2 of Sin3A has been predominantly identified as mediating binding, while other regions of Sin3A have only been sporadically characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian Sin3A is a large protein capable of multiple protein&#x02013;protein interactions. It is thought that the Sin3 proteins serve as a scaffold on which CoR complexes assemble and recruit HDAC activity. In line with that, several Sin3A CoR protein complexes have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Another highly conserved protein, Alien, has been shown to have characteristics of a CoR for selected members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Alien was found to be ubiquitously expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> and in all cell lines tested. Interestingly, expression of Alien is induced by thyroid hormone <italic>in vivo</italic> and in neuronal cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c25">25</xref>), suggesting that the receptor controls expression of its CoR and thus regulates its own transcriptional silencing. Alien mediates transcriptional silencing in part by recruiting HDAC activity that is sensitive to trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDAC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c26">26</xref>). In addition, by using co-immunoprecipitation and the yeast two-hybrid system, Alien was shown to interact with Sin3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c26">26</xref>).</p><p>Alien interacts in a hormone-sensitive manner with the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> receptor (VDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c27">27</xref>). The VDR is a transcription factor that regulates target gene expression via recruitment of co-activators and CoRs to specific DNA response elements. 1&#x003b1;,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D<sub><bold>3</bold></sub> &#x0005b;1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>&#x0005d; is a natural agonist of the VDR, but in the absence of ligand the receptor can also act as a transcriptional silencer. Both the TR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c28">28</xref>) and VDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c29">29</xref>) also influence the cell cycle. The VDR is known to inhibit cell proliferation of commonly occurring hormone-regulated cancers and is therefore considered to be a potentially important drug target for breast and prostate cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c32">32</xref>).</p><p>The VDR binds to a variety of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> response elements (VDREs) with DNA sequence half-sites of specific geometry, such as direct hexameric repeats spaced by three nt (DR3) and everted repeats spaced by 9 nt (ER9). We have shown previously that Alien is a CoR for the VDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c27">27</xref>). Alien was shown to enhance VDR-mediated gene repression in the absence of ligand. Interestingly, in contrast to other CoRs, such as NCoR and SMRT, Alien displays VDRE subtype selectivity, by enhancing VDR-mediated gene repression on DR3-type but not on ER9-type VDREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c27">27</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of Alien-mediated silencing and the role of the Alien&#x02013;Sin3A interaction in this phenomenon. Therefore, we analysed whether VDR, Alien and Sin3A are co-recruited in a chromatin context and mapped the IDs of Alien and Sin3A. Interestingly, we found that the highly conserved region (HCR) of Sin3A binds to Alien. This region is located outside the four PAHs. Notably, the HCR in isolation acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of Alien-mediated repression, while a longer Sin3A fragment that includes the HCR and two silencing domains enhances Alien-mediated repression. By mapping the silencing domain of Alien we found that the N-terminal region of Alien harbours a transferable silencing domain, which interacts with the HCR, indicating a correlation between silencing and interaction with Sin3A. Furthermore, expression of the HCR alone increases expression of the endogenous, VDR-regulated CYP24 gene. These results provide novel insights into the role of the HCR and the trimeric complex of VDR, Alien and Sin3A in VDR-mediated silencing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays</title><p>Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were used for ChIP assays of endogenous factors recruited to the human CYP24 gene promoter, which is known to be a primary VDR target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c33">33</xref>).

The VDRE cluster of the human CYP24 promoter consists of two DR3-type response elements, which mediate both VDR-dependent repression and hormone-induced activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c42">42</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f1">1</xref>A). Using antibodies against VDR and RXR for ChIP and subsequent PCR analyses, the proximal CYP24 promoter region was co-precipitated and detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f1">1</xref>B). A distal control region of the CYP24 promoter without VDREs was not co-precipitated with these antibodies. This suggests a recruitment of both VDR and RXR to the VDREs <italic>in vivo</italic> in unstimulated cells. This agrees with the view that VDR&#x02013;RXR heterodimers are involved in regulation of the CYP24 gene promoter when 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> is absent. For an assessment of Alien and Sin3A binding to these regions the respective antibodies were used. In the absence of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> both Alien and Sin3A co-precipitated with the proximal CYP24 promoter region in the absence of ligand, suggesting that both CoR proteins associate with this region of the CYP24 promoter. No PCR amplification was observed using the antibodies for either Alien or Sin3A when the cells were treated with 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> for 60 min prior to ChIP. This indicates that both Sin3A and Alien dissociate from this promoter region in the presence of a ligand. This implies that Sin3A and Alien may be involved in VDR-mediated gene repression. The distally located region of the CYP24 promoter used as a control in PCR did not amplify in ChIP assays performed with VDR, RXR, Alien or Sin3A antibodies. Taken together, these data indicate that both Alien and Sin3A associate <italic>in vivo</italic> with a promoter region that harbours functional VDREs and this interaction is ligand-dependent.</p></sec><sec><title>The HCR of Sin3A interacts with the N-terminus of Alien</title><p>To characterize the Alien&#x02013;Sin3 interaction the binding domains of Sin3A with Alien were first mapped using a GST pull-down assay with bacterially expressed and purified GST or GST&#x02013;Alien (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c26">26</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated, <sup>35</sup>S-labelled Sin3 proteins. As a controlled starting point we observed that <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Sin3A and Sin3B proteins bound to GST&#x02013;Alien but not to GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f2">2</xref>). We usually obtained a band doublet of <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Sin3A, which may derive from either an internal translation start site or protein degradation.

As a loading control, the Coomassie stained gel with the bacterially expressed GST or GST&#x02013;Alien is shown. These data show that Alien binds to Sin3A <italic>in vitro</italic>, an interaction previously characterized by ourselves in co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid interaction assay experiments.</p><p>For fine mapping, several Sin3A deletions were created and tested for interaction with Alien (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f3">3</xref>A). The N-terminal 678 amino acids of Sin3A interacts, while the N-terminal 479 amino acids of the CoR lack interaction with Alien. As a specificity control we co-translated both full-length Sin3A and Sin3A<sub>1&#x02013;479</sub> and incubated the mixture with either GST or GST&#x02013;Alien. Only the full-length Sin3A protein was retained, but not the first 479 amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f3">3</xref>A, second panel). This suggested that the ID for Alien is located between amino acids 479 and 678. This was confirmed using this portion of Sin3A in GST pull-down experiments. Further fine mapping of this region revealed that Alien specifically interacts with Sin3A<sub>545&#x02013;678</sub>, termed ID1, but not with Sin3A<sub>404&#x02013;545</sub>. An additional Alien ID of Sin3A was mapped to amino acids 1001&#x02013;1137 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f3">3</xref>A) and was termed ID2. To confirm the Sin3A Alien IDs, we reversed the interaction partners by using bacterially expressed GST&#x02013;Sin3A deletions and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Alien (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f3">3</xref>B). Both Sin3A<sub>545&#x02013;678</sub> (ID1) and Sin3A<sub>1001&#x02013;1137</sub> (ID2) exhibited strong binding to Alien, whereas Sin3A<sub>1&#x02013;545</sub> harbouring PAH1&#x02013;PAH3 did not show binding to Alien.</p><p>Sequence comparisons between mouse Sin3A and Sin3B revealed that, in addition to the PAH domains, an additional HCR exists. This is located C-terminal to PAH3 and has 81&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity between Sin3A and Sin3B. This HCR exhibits the highest regional homology between Sin3A and Sin3B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f3">3</xref>C) and overlaps the region identified as ID1. Therefore, henceforth ID1 will be termed the HCR.</p><p>Although the HCR is part of the previously identified domain HDAC interaction domain (HID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c43">43</xref>) and of the sites on Sin3A that mediate the interactions with SAP45 (mSDS3), SAP130 and SAP180 (RBP1), the isolated HCR, even when combined with PAH3, does not interact with these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c43">43</xref>). This indicates that the interaction of Alien with the HCR is distinct from that of these factors.</p><p>Based on our findings, the HCR of Sin3A was selected for further interaction analysis with Alien. To verify the identified IDs the yeast two-hybrid assay was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f3">3</xref>). Full-length Alien (Alien<sub>1&#x02013;305</sub>) as the activator (B42 fusion) exhibited strong interaction with the Sin3A<sub>56&#x02013;724</sub> harbouring the HCR used as bait (lexA fusion). The deletion fragment, Alien<sub>1&#x02013;128</sub>, also interacted with Sin3A, although more weakly than Alien<sub>1&#x02013;305</sub>. Interestingly, this N-terminal portion of Alien does not interact with TR or another member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, DAX1, in the same assay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c40">40</xref>), indicating a specific interaction with Sin3A. Other deletions, including Alien<sub>1&#x02013;32</sub> and those that interact with TR, such as Alien<sub>128&#x02013;305</sub>, did not show significant interaction with Sin3A<sub>56&#x02013;724</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f4">4</xref>). The units yielded were similar to those obtained with both the empty bait vector and the empty activator vector. These findings suggest that the first 128 amino acids of Alien participate in the interaction of this protein with Sin3A. To verify that the isolated HCR is sufficient to mediate the Sin3A&#x02013;Alien interaction, we used Sin3A<sub>545&#x02013;678</sub> as bait. Alien<sub>1&#x02013;305</sub> and Alien<sub>1&#x02013;128</sub> showed an interaction of similar strength with Sin3A<sub>545&#x02013;678</sub>, which was in accordance with our GST pull-down experiments. As negative controls we used the empty bait vector or the empty activator vector. Since, within the range of standard deviation, comparable units were obtained with Alien<sub>128&#x02013;305</sub> with or without Sin3A as bait it may indicate that the C-terminal part of Alien does not bind significantly to the HCR of Sin3A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f4">4</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that the HCR of Sin3 interacts with Alien in yeast. More specifically, the HCR of Sin3A interacts with the N-terminus of Alien (Alien<sub>1&#x02013;128</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Alien<sub>1&#x02013;128</sub> harbours a transferable silencing function</title><p>Since Alien and Sin3A have been previously shown to be involved in repression of gene expression, we wondered whether the interaction of Alien with Sin3A correlates with Alien-mediated silencing. Using Gal&#x02013;Alien deletions in transient reporter assays a strong repression capability of full-length Alien was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f5">5</xref>). Several cell lines were tested, the erythroid cell line HD3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f5">5</xref>) and HEK 293 cells (not shown) with strong Alien-mediated gene repression and the CV1 cell line with weak Alien-mediated silencing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f5">5</xref>). Alien<sub>1&#x02013;32</sub> showed no significant repression function, while Alien<sub>1&#x02013;128</sub> efficiently repressed reporter gene activity in CV1 cells. This suggests that the ID of Alien in the presence of Sin3A exhibits silencing function. In addition, Alien<sub>128&#x02013;305</sub> (the C-terminus) repressed promoter activity, suggesting that the C-terminus also harbours a transferable silencing function. Since this domain does not overlap with the Alien N-terminus, it suggests that Alien possesses two silencing domains. Further delineation using additional Alien deletions indicated that the second silencing domain resides in the amino acids 266&#x02013;305 region of Alien. Similar results were obtained using the HD3 cell line. Thus, Alien harbours two transferable silencing domains: one located in the N-terminus (amino acids 1&#x02013;128), which coincides with the Sin3A ID, and a second in the C-terminus (amino acids 266&#x02013;305).</p></sec><sec><title>Sin3A enhances Alien-mediated silencing</title><p>To investigate the functional role of Sin3A on Alien-mediated repression, Sin3A<sub>56&#x02013;724</sub>, which harbours the HCR and two silencing domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c37">37</xref>), was overexpressed together with Gal&#x02013;Alien fusions in reporter assays. Conditions were chosen from preceding titration experiments (not shown) under which Alien exhibits weak transcriptional repression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f6">6</xref>A) by using low amounts of Gal&#x02013;Alien expression vector and CV1 cells. Expression of Sin3A amino acids 56&#x02013;724 together with Gal&#x02013;Alien resulted in a significant repression of reporter gene activity. Using the expression vector encoding the Gal DBD as a control only a slight activation, if at all, was observed by overexpression of Sin3A<sub>56&#x02013;724</sub>. The transcriptional activity of the Gal&#x02013;Alien<sub>1&#x02013;32</sub> deletion, which lacks both interaction with Sin3A and silencing function, was not changed by Sin3A<sub>56&#x02013;724</sub>, while Gal&#x02013;Alien<sub>1&#x02013;128</sub>, which interacts with Sin3A, exhibited increased silencing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f6">6</xref>A). Similar results were obtained using HeLa cells (not shown). This indicates that Sin3A acts as a functional enhancing partner for Alien. Thus, in line with the interaction data the co-expression of Sin3A increases Alien-mediated silencing.</p><p>Interestingly, comparing Sin3A levels of CV1 cells with weak Alien-mediated silencing with that of HEK 293 cells with strong Alien-mediated silencing revealed that CV1 cells express much lower levels of mSin3 (Supplementary Material). This difference in the Sin3 protein levels of the two cell lines might indicate that mSin3 is a limiting factor for Alien-mediated silencing.</p></sec><sec><title>The HCR of Sin3A inhibits Alien-mediated repression <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Previous results suggest that the combination of the silencing domains of Sin3A plus the Alien interaction domain HCR functionally enhances Alien-mediated silencing by recruiting silencing function to Alien. Conversely, we wondered whether the HCR alone, lacking the N-terminal silencing domain of Sin3A, might inhibit Alien-mediated repression. For that purpose a cell line in which Alien is a potent repressor (and for which low amounts of Alien expression plasmid can be used) is required as a prerequisite and as a suitable basis for the inhibition of Alien-mediated silencing by overexpression of the HCR, which might act as a competitor for endogenous Sin3A. We used HEK 293 cells in which Alien exhibits strong silencing function as compared to CV1 cells. Interestingly, this correlates with the endogenous levels of Sin3A protein as shown by western analysis, revealing low levels of endogenous mSin3 in CV1 cells and much higher levels in HEK 293 cells (Supplementary Material). This indicates that CV1 cells are useful to introduce Sin3A as a gain of function and HEK 293 cells are useful for competition for endogenous Sin3A. Thus, to analyse the potential role of the isolated HCR domain we overexpressed Sin3A<sub>545&#x02013;678</sub> together with Gal&#x02013;Alien or Gal alone as control. Interestingly, the HCR domain repressed Alien-mediated silencing, which was virtually abolished under the conditions used (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f6">6</xref>B). Using Sin3A<sub>1001&#x02013;1137</sub> (ID2), a similar but less pronounced inhibition of Alien-mediated gene silencing was obtained. Based on the strong inhibitory effect on Alien-mediated silencing this indicates that the HCR acts in a dominant negative manner.</p><p>As a further proof of this phenomenon we overexpressed the HCR (Sin3A<sub>545&#x02013;678</sub>) in MCF-7 cells and observed the effects on endogenous CYP24 basal expression by real-time PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f7">7</xref>). ARP0 gene expression, which is unaffected by VDR, was used as an internal control. As a further negative control expression of ribosomal protein L13, known to be a reliable standard for gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c44">44</xref>), was monitored. Expression of the HCR did not significantly change expression of L13A, neither in the absence nor in the presence of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. In agreement with the previous data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f6">6</xref>B), we observed an increase in basal mRNA expression of the endogenous CYP24 gene when Sin3A<sub>545&#x02013;678</sub> was expressed in the absence of hormone. The level of expression of the CYP24 gene was unaffected (3-fold) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f7">7</xref>) after 60 min of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> treatment. This indicates that the Alien&#x02013;Sin3A HCR interaction is involved in repression of this gene. Thus, it suggests that the Alien&#x02013;Sin3A interaction via the HCR is involved in VDR-mediated gene regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Alien has characteristics of a CoR for selected members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as TR and VDR, and mediates their transcriptional repression function. This suppression of gene activity is in part HDAC-dependent. A portion of this HDAC dependency may be mediated by the recruitment of Sin3A by Alien (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c26">26</xref>). The aim of this study was to obtain mechanistic insights into the role of Sin3a in Alien-mediated silencing. The interaction of endogenous Sin3A with Alien was previously shown by co-immunoprecipitation and confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c26">26</xref>). Furthermore, TSA in part relieved Alien-mediated silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c26">26</xref>), which is in agreement with the findings that Sin3A exists in complexes with HDAC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c16">16</xref>). Here, we show for the first time that Alien is recruited to chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>. The recruitment of Alien to the unstimulated endogenous human CYP24 proximal promoter, which harbours functional DR3-type VDREs. The presence of Alien on this promoter is regulated by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. Accordingly, the acetylation of histone H4 on the human CYP24 promoter is increased within 1 h by addition of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c34">34</xref>). These facts taken together strongly indicate that Alien is a bona fide CoR for VDR. This is in line with our previous findings of a hormone-sensitive interaction of Alien with the VDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c27">27</xref>). Similarly, Sin3A is recruited to the same promoter region as Alien and this recruitment is also regulated by 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. This suggests the possible existence of a CoR complex composed of at least the Alien, Sin3A and VDR proteins. In agreement with this, Sin3A and VDR were found to be complexed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c45">45</xref>). Thus, these results are in agreement with our previous findings and strongly suggest that both endogenous Alien and Sin3A are co-recruited <italic>in vivo</italic> in the context of native chromatin.</p><p>To gain mechanistic insights we identified the IDs of Sin3A with Alien <italic>in vitro</italic> and analysed the functional significance of this interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, a HCR between Sin3A and Sin3B of 134 amino acids in length mediates the interaction with Alien and functionally inhibits Alien-mediated silencing in a dominant negative manner both in transient transfection assays and at the level of the CYP24 endogenous promoter. Protein database searches with the Sin3A HCR sequence revealed that the HCR is highly conserved in the Sin3A orthologues from different species. <italic>Xenopus</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> HCRs share 95&#x00025; and 67&#x00025; identity to the human, rat and mouse HCRs, respectively. Such a high homology is indicative of important biological functions. Notably, we did not find additional proteins in the database with sequences resembling the Sin3A HCR.</p><p>The N-terminus of Alien interacts with the HCR. In line with that we identified a silencing domain in the N-terminus of Alien, while the Alien C-terminus was shown to interact with nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c40">40</xref>). This may suggest that Alien may serve as a bridge between Sin3A and DNA-bound transcriptional silencers. The N-terminus of Sin3A harbours two potent silencing domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c37">37</xref>). It is likely that these silencing domains combined with the HCR are responsible for the enhancement of Alien-mediated silencing. Expressing the HCR of Sin3A alone we observed a dominant negative effect on Alien-mediated silencing at a native promoter and in reporter gene assays. This suggests that the HCR in isolation competes for available Alien protein in living cells. Combined with a silencing domain, the HCR may act as a CoR.</p><p>Most studies analysing the interaction using a wide variety of different transcriptional repressors revealed that the PAH domains of Sin3A participated in it. For example, PAH3 alone is sufficient to bind to SAP30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c46">46</xref>). The IDs of the CoRs SMRT and NCoR with Sin3A have been mapped and were shown to involve PAH1 or PAH2 and PAH3 of Sin3A, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c37">37</xref>). Interestingly, the PAH domains were indispensable for the interaction with Alien (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh621f3">3</xref>). Thus, the SMRT and NCoR interactions with Sin3A is distinct from that of Alien. This indicates that interactions of different nuclear receptor CoRs with Sin3A involve distinct domains in this protein. Furthermore, for SAP45, SAP130 and SAP180 the entire sequences between PAH3 and PAH4, which are identical to the HID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c43">43</xref>), were required for binding to Sin3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh621c16">16</xref>). However, Sin3A deletions matching the regions of the HCR and PAH3 were insufficient to bind to these factors. Therefore, the dominant negative effects of the HCR in both inhibition of Alien-mediated silencing and an increase in endogenous CYP24 gene expression may be specifically attributed to the Alien&#x02013;Sin3A HCR interaction.</p><p>We propose a model of Alien-mediated silencing through recruitment of Sin3 to its N-terminus and interaction with DNA-bound transcriptional silencers at the C-terminus. Taken together, our observations show that Sin3A is able to interact with other factors outside its PAH domains and reveal a novel role for the evolutionarily HCR of Sin3A. In addition, the hormone-regulated recruitment of Alien to an endogenous VDR target gene emphasizes its role in nuclear receptor function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_10_2995__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_10_2995__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh621f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Alien and Sin3A are co-recruited to the CYP24 promoter <italic>in vivo.</italic> ChIP assays were performed on the 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-inducible human CYP24 promoter in MCF-7 cells.
