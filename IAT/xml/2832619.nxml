To gain insights into evolutionary forces shaping the CEA gene family we have analysed this gene family in 27 mammalian species including monotreme and marsupial lineages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Phylogenetic analysis provided convincing evidence that the primordial CEA gene family in mammals consisted of five genes, including the immune inhibitory receptor-encoding <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>(CEA-related cell adhesion molecule) ancestor. Our analysis of the substitution rates within the nucleotide sequence which codes for the ligand binding domain of CEACAM1 indicates that the selection for diversification is, perhaps, a consequence of the exploitation of CEACAM1 by a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens as their cellular receptor. Depending on the extent of the amplification of an ancestral <italic>CEACAM1</italic>, the number of <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes varies considerably between mammalian species from less than five in lagomorphs to more than 100 in bats. In most analysed species, ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) or ITAM-like motif-containing proteins exist which contain Ig-V-like, ligand binding domains closely related to that of CEACAM1. Human CEACAM3 is one such protein which can function as a CEACAM1 decoy receptor in granulocytes by mediating the uptake and destruction of specific bacterial pathogens via its ITAM-like motif. The close relationship between <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>and its ITAM-encoding relatives appears to be maintained by gene conversion and reciprocal recombination. Surprisingly, secreted CEACAMs resembling immunomodulatory CEACAM1-related trophoblast-specific pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) found in humans and rodents evolved only in a limited set of mammals. The appearance of <italic>PSG</italic>-like genes correlates with invasive trophoblast growth in these species.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These phylogenetic studies provide evidence that pathogen/host coevolution and a possible participation in fetal-maternal conflict processes led to a highly species-specific diversity of mammalian CEA gene families.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>One of the major goals of evolutionary biology is to identify the genetic changes underlying phenotypic differences between organisms. Recent analyses of mammalian genomes revealed that the expansion and contraction of gene families contribute much more than expected to the genomic differences of mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The shaping of gene families is a potent and safe mechanism which enables adaptation to environmental cues, since gene duplications provide new raw genetic material that natural selection can subsequently modify, without losing the function of the original gene. In addition, the repetitive sequences within gene families enhance the probability of recombination which can change the function of a gene dramatically within a short period of time through, for example, the exchange of cytoplasmic signalling motif-coding regions of transmembrane protein genes. Gene duplication, followed by such recombination and gene conversion events can lead to genes encoding pairs of proteins with very similar extracellular ligand interacting regions and opposite signalling cytoplasmic motifs, as recently described for the natural killer (NK) cell inhibitory receptor Ly49I. This inhibitory receptor is engaged by the murine cytomegalovirus-encoded major histocompatibility class I-related protein which is expressed on infected cells thereby suppressing a NK-mediated antiviral response. Subsequently, a paralog of Ly49I, Ly49H, has evolved which associates with an adaptor (DAP12) containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in the cytoplasmic tail and, thereby, activates immune cells that encounter virus infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Such rapid modification of genes is of particular relevance for gene families that function in immune recognition and reproduction. Species-specific pathogens, as well as species-specific differences, in reproduction (for example, diverse types of placentation) may require fundamentally different properties of such gene families, even in otherwise closely related species.</p><p>The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family may represent a paradigm for such gene families since it is highly divergent in humans, mice and dogs, and its members have functions in both immune regulation and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The CEA family is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), consists of the CEA-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) and the pregnancy specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroups. In humans and mice the CEA family comprises 23 and 31 members, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. They are basically composed of a leader, one N-terminal immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like domain (N domain), followed by a variable number of two different types of Ig constant (IgC)-like domains (named A and B) with a few notable exceptions which confuse the original nomenclature: for example, rodent PSGs contain 2-9 consecutive N domains and CEACAM16 one N- and one C-terminal N domain with one A and one B domain in between. Homotypic and heterotypic adhesion is the most prominent function of these extracellular domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, several pathogens in humans and mice exploit these domains to adhere to and infect their target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The physiological functions of CEA family members are very diverse. They are mediated by the different modes of membrane anchorage and the various types of signalling motifs within their cytoplasmic tails. Members of the CEA family can be secreted, glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored or transmembrane proteins with either a very short or a long cytoplasmic tail which can harbour immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs), immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) or ITAMs. The GPI-anchored CEACAMs, which have been identified so far only within primate CEA families, were generated by mutational modification of a transmembrane domain exon in a <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-like ancestor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The human GPI-linked CEACAM5/CEA and CEACAM6 are involved in the maintenance of the gastrointestinal tissue architecture and have been shown to contribute, when overexpressed, to tumour formation in the colon by the inhibition of differentiation and anoikis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These functions are critically dependent on the presence of the GPI anchor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>CEACAM1 </italic>is the most widely expressed member of the CEA gene family, exhibiting extensive differential splicing which leads to multiple isoforms, some of which contain ITIM/ITSM. CEACAM1 was found in epithelial, endothelial and in a variety of immune cells including B cells, T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and granulocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Due to its homophilic adhesion function, CEACAM1 seems to be one of the central receptors facilitating the communication of immune cells. Therefore, CEACAM1 seems to be an attractive receptor for pathogens to infect cells and simultaneously disrupt well coordinated immune responses. Indeed, it was previously shown that <italic>neisserial </italic>pathogens can use CEACAM1 to inhibit adaptive immune responses by ITIM signalling in CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells and, thereby, effectively suppressing B cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. More recently, it was found that pathogens can also utilize CEACAM1 on bronchial epithelial cells to suppress TLR2 signalling, resulting in the downregulation of the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, CEA family members with N domains closely related to the corresponding CEACAM1 N domains, but with differently signalling cytoplasmic motifs, are found on granulocytes of humans (CEACAM3) and dogs (CEACAM28) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. CEACAM3 mediates the opsonin-independent recognition of a restricted set of human-specific Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, including <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae </italic>and <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>, and supports their engulfment and elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This property of CEACAM3 is critically dependant on the presence of the ITAM-related motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Since these bacteria use CEACAM1 as their cellular receptor, it is likely that the formation of such molecules with ITAM-like motifs is an adaptation to bacterial attacks. In mice, CEACAM1 is a cellular receptor for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Two distinct <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>alleles exist (<italic>CEACAM1</italic><sup><italic>a </italic></sup>and <italic>CEACAM1</italic><sup><italic>b</italic></sup>). Only CEACAM1<sup><italic>a </italic></sup>represents a high affinity receptor for MHV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The trophoblast-specific PSGs are essential for a successful pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. They represent secreted proteins which are thought to regulate the maternal immune response to fetal trophoblast invasion which enables the fetus to access maternal resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. They have been found in humans, mice and rats - species with haemochorial placentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Surprisingly, no <italic>PSG </italic>genes have been identified in dogs or cattle which have endotheliochorial and epitheliochorial placentae, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Analysis of <italic>PSGs </italic>in additional species and comparison with their type of placentation may strengthen the PSG/placentation type correlation.</p><p>In addition, more distantly related <italic>CEACAMs </italic>(<italic>CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20</italic>) of unknown function exist for which orthologs could be assigned in rodents and primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The function of CEACAM/PSG family members as pathogens receptors, as well as their support of a successful outcome of pregnancy, suggests that pathogen-mediated and fetal-maternal conflict-induced selection are potential key drivers of CEA family evolution. Comprehensive analyses of mammalian <italic>CEA </italic>gene families may enable us to evaluate this hypothesis. Here we describe analyses of the <italic>CEA </italic>gene family in different mammals, including all five eutherian superclades, marsupial and monotreme clades. We discovered an unexpected diversity of the CEA family with respect to secreted PSG-like proteins between different clades, as well as within individual clades, and evidence for the coevolution of CEACAMs with ITIM and ITAM-like signalling motifs. Our results provide further evidence that the <italic>CEA </italic>gene family is shaped by pathogen-host interaction and species-specific reproductive requirements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The few <italic>CEA </italic>gene families that have been studied in detail revealed a perplexing diversity, the reason for which is still unknown. In order to elucidate the forces which shaped the <italic>CEA </italic>gene families in mammals, we analysed all publicly available whole mammalian genomes with high (5-12X) as well as with low coverage (~2X) for the presence of <italic>CEA </italic>gene family members (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We used the sequences from known members of the <italic>CEA </italic>gene family of humans, mice and dogs to search for <italic>CEACAM </italic>genes in other species, assuming that the <italic>CEACAM </italic>genes of all mammals are composed of the principle exons found in these species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Our exon predictions were validated by a comparison with EST information when available. With the possible exception of exons encoding cytoplasmic domains with ITAM in marsupials (see below), we did not find any new exons that had not been seen before in humans, mice, rats and dogs, indicating that the variability of the <italic>CEA </italic>gene families in eutherians is due to the different arrangement of these basic exons.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table

This notion is supported by similar analyses using IgC-like A and B domain exons. Results are shown to be exemplarily for the latter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Again, <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-like B domain exons are clearly separated from that of <italic>CEACAM16, CEACAM18 </italic>and <italic>CEACAM20 </italic>which form their own clusters with representatives from each species. However, no species-specific clustering is observed for <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-like B domain exons as is seen for the N domain exons. This could be due to the lack of strong selection pressure to conserve sequences such as those found for the N domain exons (see below). In all high coverage species one or two <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>genes can be identified by the presence of ITSM and/or ITIM in the cytoplasmic domain encoded by a conserved set of three exons. We consider, therefore, the ancestors of the conserved (orthologous) members of the <italic>CEA </italic>gene family, namely <italic>CEACAM1, CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 </italic>and <italic>CEACAM20 </italic>to be the primordial <italic>CEA </italic>gene family. Since they are found in all therian species (marsupials and placental mammals) with high coverage genomic sequencing, ancestral versions of these conserved genes must have been present in the most recent common ancestor of these mammals. In the primordial <italic>CEA </italic>gene family, except for <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes, only very rarely have gene duplications/deletions taken place. A second <italic>CEACAM16</italic>-related gene exists in the platypus (<italic>CEACAM16L</italic>, L stands for like) which consists of four N domain exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Determination of ratios of nonsynonymous mutation rates and synonymous mutation rates (dN/dS) to normalize for variable evolutionary distances revealed that the exon sequences from the various <italic>CEACAMs </italic>are under different selective pressure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

The mean dN/dS ratios were calculated and displayed as red (N domain exons) or blue columns (Ig constant-like domain exons); standard deviations are shown as bars. dN/dS values significantly greater than 1 (above the red line) indicate selective pressure for variability, a ratio less than 1 indicates pressures to conserve the protein sequence.

Among the conserved amino acids is an arginine which forms in most IgV-like N domains of the CEA family, a salt bridge with an aspartic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and an asparagine which is part of a highly conserved N-glycosylation consensus sequence. Most amino acid positions, which are important for interactions between CEACAMs and their viral and bacterial ligands, are located in the CFG face where no conservation is observed at all (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

Catarrhinian apes, including humans, contain a second ITIM instead of the ITSM while, in more distantly related primates (strepsirrhini), the ITSM is still present. Two ITIM are also present in platypus and two copies of CEACAM1, one containing ITIM/ITSM, and the other two ITIM were found in the opossum. A second prominent motif (TEHKxS) is encoded by the cytoplasmic domain exon 1.

We determined the size of the CEACAM1-related groups and the domain organization of their members in selected species of all four clades of placental mammals (euarchontoglires, laurasiatheria, afrotheria, xenarthra), as well as one member each from the marsupial infraclass and the monotreme order. In most species only a single gene encoding the CEACAM1 typical ITIM/ITIM or ITIM/ITSM signalling motifs was found. In a few species, such as mice (<italic>CEACAM1, CEACAM2</italic>), horses (<italic>CEACAM1, CEACAM43</italic>), bats (<italic>CEACAM1, CEACAMa</italic>) and opossum (<italic>CEACAM1, CEACAM114</italic>), two such genes were detected. In humans, the <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related members of the <italic>CEA </italic>gene family including <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>consist of 18 genes and 11 pseudogenes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Similar numbers of genes were found in other great apes (orangutans, chimpanzee) and in the rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>). In more distantly related primates (<italic>Otolemur garnettii, Microcebus murinus, Tupaia belangeri</italic>) with low shotgun sequencing coverage (1.5-2X) only four to six <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes could be detected. In mice, also members of the euarchontoglires clade, 27 <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes and one pseudogene had been previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, the canine <italic>CEA </italic>gene family contains only nine <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes, two of which seem to represent pseudogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In cattle, the <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>subgroup of the <italic>CEA </italic>gene family is extremely small consisting of only six <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes.

However, the genome of the small brown bat (<italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic>), another member of this clade, contains about 100 <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes, most of which are apparently coding for secreted proteins (see below). The <italic>CEA </italic>gene families of two members of the afrotherian clade have also been studied. The African elephant (<italic>Loxodonta africana</italic>) and the Lesser Hedgehog Tenrec (<italic>Echinops telfairi</italic>) contain just eight and four <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes, respectively. For both species, however, only low coverage genome sequence data are available (2X), which might have led to an underestimation of the size of the <italic>CEA </italic>gene families. In the armadillo (<italic>Dasypus novemcinctus</italic>), the only member of the fourth clade of placental mammals (xenarthra), we identified 10 putative <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes. In the genome of the opossum (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>), a representative of the marsupial lineage, we could identify 21 <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes located on two chromosomes (chromosome 2 and 4). Monotremata represent the most divergent mammals and exhibit both reptilian and mammalian features. Analyses of the genome sequence in the platypus, the only member of this group for which sequence data are publicly available, revealed the presence of at least five <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Human and rodent genomes comprise a cluster of genes (human: <italic>PSG1-PSG10</italic>; mouse: <italic>Psg16-Psg32, Ceacam9, Ceacam11-Ceacam15</italic>; rat: <italic>Psg36-Psg45, Ceacam9, Ceacam11-Ceacam12; Ceacam15</italic>) which encode secreted proteins specifically expressed in trophoblast cells (shown as red arrowheads in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and data not shown). No such genes could be identified in the dog. Structure alone, however, is not sufficient to place a CEACAM1-like protein into the PSG group, since secreted CEACAM1-related proteins, like CEACAM10, exist in the mouse which is not expressed in trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Bearing this uncertainty in mind, we searched the genomes for genes encoding secreted CEACAM. We were able to detect PSG-related genes in the human, chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus macaque, African green monkey (<italic>Chlorocebus aethiops</italic>) and the baboon (<italic>Papio hamadryas</italic>). Surprisingly, no PSG-related genes could be found in more distantly related primates such as the small-eared galago (<italic>Otolemur garnettii</italic>) and the grey mouse lemur (<italic>Microcebus murinus</italic>). However, at least five equine <italic>CEACAM</italic>-related genes might represent <italic>PSG </italic>genes since they encode most probably secreted placentally expressed proteins consisting of a single N domain (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, part A). Evidence for placental expression is based on the identification of two EST sequences in horse trophoblast cDNA libraries. The extreme expansion of the small brown bat <italic>CEA </italic>gene family is mostly due to the amplification of genes, probably encoding small secreted proteins composed of one N and one IgC-like A domain. The latter domains are encoded by A exons with homologous defective splice donor sites directly followed by two in-frame stop codons (<underline>A</underline>T<bold><underline>T</underline>AGTGA</bold>; G to A and G to T mutations are underlined; stop codons in bold letters) (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, part B).

Presently it is thought that the independent introduction of stop codons (and further mutations) into transmembrane exons associated with ITIM-encoding exons of old world (catarrhini) and new world monkeys (platyrrhini), led to the formation of exons coding for hydrophobic membrane signal sequences for GPI anchorage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In humans and great apes, as well as in more distantly related primates (such as the small-eared galago), such signal peptide sequences are present in various CEACAMs (for example, in human CEACAM5-CEACAM8) but have not been detected in rodents, dogs, horses or cattle. Surprisingly, there is evidence that a GPI-linked CEACAM exists in swine. Three different EST sequences, derived from intestinal cDNA libraries, indicate that three nucleotides were deleted from an ancestral C<italic>EACAM1 </italic>transmembrane domain exon and a stop codon six nucleotides downstream was introduced by mutations exactly as found in the New World monkeys <italic>Ateles geoffroyi </italic>and <italic>Callicebus molloch </italic>(Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). This contrasts with the formation of GPI signal peptide-encoding exons in Old World monkeys where a single nucleotide deletion (followed directly by a stop codon) occurred. This indicates repetitive independent formation of signal sequences for GPI anchorage.</p></sec><sec><title>Coevolution of CEACAM1-like members with ITIM and ITAM-like signaling motifs</title><p>We have recently discovered potential paired receptors in the canine CEA family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Such extracellularly very similar receptors contain oppositely signalling (inhibitory versus activating) motifs in their cytoplasmic domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. They can be part of defense mechanisms against bacterial pathogens as has been found for the human CEA family members CEACAM1 and CEACAM3. In order to find out whether potential paired CEACAM receptor systems also exist in other species, we analysed the phylogeny of N domain amino acid sequences of CEACAM proteins from opossum and cattle and determined the presence of ITIM and ITAM/ITAM-like motifs in their cytoplasmic domains. As in humans and dogs, CEACAM members with cytoplasmic ITIM and members with ITAM-related motifs are always found in the same group of closely related members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The close similarity between paired receptors during evolution can be maintained by gene conversion which often involves recombination events within, or in the neighborhood of, exons encoding the ligand-binding domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In order to identify regions where such events may have taken place, we calculated cumulative synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions along the N domain exons from pairs of <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related paralogous genes coding for potential paired receptors. Analysis of the cumulative synonymous substitutions along the exons of expressible genes indicated that recombination events between ITIM and ITAM-carrying paralogs leading to very similar N domain amino acid sequences has taken place during evolution for all paired receptor candidates except for the <italic>CEACAM114/CEACAM111/CEACAM115 </italic>or <italic>CEACAM112/CEACAM111/CEACAM115 </italic>set of opossum genes. This is suggested from the stretches of codons with no or minimal accumulation of synonymous substitutions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D-F</xref>). The corresponding N domain amino acid sequences probably contain segments which are important for (bacterial) ligand binding. An almost steady accumulation of synonymous substitutions is observed for <italic>CEACAM114</italic>/<italic>CEACAM112 </italic>(ITIM) and <italic>CEACAM111 </italic>or <italic>CEACAM115 </italic>genes (ITAM) from opossum which indicates a lack of recent recombinations between these genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>; only shown for <italic>CEACAM111</italic>). They might, therefore, represent a second paired receptor gene set created by gene duplication which became defunct or acquired different functions later during evolution. In order to narrow down the gene regions involved in the maintenance of the high similarity between the N domain sequences of putative paired receptors, we compared the nucleotide sequences of ITIM- and ITAM-encoding <italic>CEACAM </italic>genes using the <italic>PipMaker </italic>program. These analyses revealed that the paired receptor genes probably originated from gene duplication of ancestral <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>genes as indicated by long stretches of homologous exon and intron sequences including often transmembrane domain-encoding exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In paired receptor genes of the opossum homology also encompasses the first cytoplasmic domain exon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>). The last two (three in opossum) cytoplasmic domain exons from a <italic>CEACAM </italic>ancestor encoding ITIM/ITSM have been replaced by four (three in opossum) cytoplasmic domain exons from an ITAM-encoding ancestor. Interestingly, in all receptor pairs (with the exception of the opossum <italic>CEACAM114</italic>/<italic>CEACAM111 </italic>genes; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>) the highest similarity is found for the N domain exon region, barely extending into the flanking intron sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A-C</xref>). In the canine <italic>CEACAM1</italic>/<italic>CEACAM28 </italic>receptor gene pair, however, the high similarity region covers the first intron, the leader exons as well as about 1 kb of the upstream sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Evidence for gene conversion/recombination between putative paired carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule <italic>(CEACAM) </italic>receptor genes</bold>.

However, the birth of the <italic>CEA </italic>gene family during evolution is not yet clear. <italic>CEA</italic>-related genes have been identified in various fishes, the most distantly related vertebrate species analysed to date (WZ, unpublished results). Although sequence conservation between fish and mammalian <italic>CEACAM </italic>genes is low, the assignment to the <italic>CEA </italic>gene family is strongly supported by their syntenic location and conservation of intron phasing which is not conserved between Ig superfamilies in general. Since <italic>CEA </italic>family genes which code for proteins with ITIM/ITSM have been found in fishes, a <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-like gene probably represents the ancestor of the family (WZ, unpublished results). Surprisingly, the other conserved members of the <italic>CEA </italic>family (<italic>CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19, CEACAM20</italic>) with identifiable orthologs have not so far been found outside the mammalian class (such as birds, amphibians, fishes; WZ, unpublished results). Therefore, <italic>CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 </italic>probably did not evolve in therians until separation of the monotreme lineage.</p><p>The ancestral <italic>CEA </italic>gene family probably arose from a single locus next to the <italic>BCL3 </italic>gene by successive gene duplication. In marsupials, as exemplified by the opossum, this primordial arrangement has been mostly maintained except for <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>and four other closely linked <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-like genes which were displaced to chromosome 2. In the ancestor of placental mammals, the insertion of Zn finger and other genes separated the orthologous genes from the <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes. The latter genes were split into two loci by non-<italic>CEACAM </italic>genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This arrangement might help to create and maintain closely related paired ITAM- or ITIM-containing receptors (see below).</p><p>The sequence similarity of N domains, which are presumably instrumental for the function of all CEA-related proteins, differs dramatically among the ancestral genes with <italic>CEACAM16 </italic>being the most highly and <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>the least conserved member. This is evident from analyses of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous substitution rates (dN) within the nucleotide sequences of their N domain exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The observed dN/dS ratio of about 0.1 for the <italic>CEACAM16 </italic>N2 domain exons indicates a high selective pressure on the conservation of this domain while the dN/dS ratio of ~1 found for <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>N domain exons suggests no selection at all. However, taking into account the differential sequence conservation observed along the N domain exon sequences for <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), selection for diversification and purifying selection for structurally important regions probably exist side by side in the N domain regions leading to an average dN/dS value of ~1. CEACAM1 N domain regions corresponding to the CFG face (codons 41-72 and 99-111; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) are the least conserved and probably represent regions selected for diversification, which is consistent with the CFG face being responsible for (bacterial and viral) ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Selection for diversification is not observed for all the mammalian species analysed (which is indicated by the high standard deviation of the mean of the dN/dS values), possibly indicating lack of, or only intermittent interaction of, CEACAM1 with pathogens during evolution of these species (data not shown).</p><p>Through purifying selection during evolution only sequence positions which provide the bearer with an adaptive advantage are retained. Multispecies amino acid sequence comparison of the cytoplasmic regions of CEACAMs, therefore, allowed identification of sequence motifs which are indispensable for signalling of CEACAM receptors. In all species analysed, a membrane proximal THEKxS motif has been conserved in the CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain which has been recently shown to serve as an interaction site for &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In this study, mutational analysis revealed that the conserved histidine (H) and, to a lesser degree, the lysine (K) are most instrumental for the specific interaction of CEACAM1 with &#x003b2;-catenin. This possibly links CEACAM1 to the Wnt signalling pathway which could explain CEACAM1's role in differentiation and tumour formation upon downregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, an ITIM/ITSM set is conserved. Interestingly, in catarrhinian apes, including humans, the ITSM of CEACAM1 has been replaced by an ITIM. The ITSM can convey both stimulatory and inhibitory signals, while ITIM predominantly transmit inhibitory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. ITSM signaling is mediated by the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein (SAP) which does not bind to ITIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. More distantly related primates (strepsirrhini) still contain the ancestral ITSM. Therefore, the second ITIM has been acquired by a common ancestor of catarrhinian apes, after the divergence from the strepsirrhinian ancestor. The functional consequences of this modification of CEACAM1 have not yet been systematically addressed. However, in a previous study we noticed that targeting CEACAM1 on human T cells with monoclonal antibodies enhances T cell activation. The molecular mechanisms of the dual function of CEACAM1 in human T cells is still unclear but may be an functional adaption to the acquisition of a second ITIM in its cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Surprisingly, such a switch occurred several times during mammalian evolution, for example, <italic>bona fide </italic>ITIM are also present in platypus and opossum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Most of the genes coding for transmembrane-anchored eutherian CEACAM1-related proteins contain a set of four phylogenetically related cytoplasmic domain exons which encode a non-canonical ITAM (YxxLx<sub>7</sub>YxxI/M). In two members (human CEACAM3 and a swine CEACAM1-related protein, provisionally named CEACAMa) the second part of the ITAM represents an YxxM motif known to mediate Vav binding upon tyrosine phosphorylation. This can be induced by the binding of neisserial pathogens to the granulocyte-specific CEACAM3 followed by rapid stimulation of the GTPase Rac, eventually leading to phagocytosis and killing of the bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Whether the ITAM-like motifs with an isoleucine instead of the methionine found in the CEACAM1-like proteins of other species are functionally equivalent and also mediate phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens is presently unclear. Another prerequisite for such a function would be expression in granulocytes. This has at least been demonstrated for most of the canine CEACAM1-related proteins with ITAM-like motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the marsupial lineage (opossum, wallaby) <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes could be identified which also contain four cytoplasmic domain exons with identical intron phasing found in eutherian CEACAM1-related proteins with ITAM-like motifs. Interestingly, these exons encode conventional ITAM (ExxYxxLx<sub>7</sub>YxxI) and, since they differ in size, sequence and orthology, they appear to have been independently acquired from a different ancestral gene. This is underscored by the presence of a conserved GRB2-like SH2 domain-binding motif (YxN) which is not present in the eutherian CEACAM1-related proteins with ITAM-like motifs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Interestingly, a similar YxN motif is encoded by the same sized cytoplasmic domain exon 2 of <italic>CEACAM20 </italic>which suggests common ancestry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Therefore, marsupials have probably evolved or maintained additional signalling capabilities in their CEACAM1-like proteins.</p><p>The most obvious difference between mammalian <italic>CEA </italic>gene families is their extreme size variation of the <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related members with gene numbers ranging from less than five in pika rabbit to more than 100 in bat (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Identification of low numbers of <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes is probably not due to low coverage of the genome sequencing in some species, since high and low gene numbers can be found in species with both low and high coverage sequencing. Most of the size variation is due to the variable number of <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes with ITAM-like motifs and <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related genes encoding secreted PSG-related proteins (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Murine and human PSGs have been shown to have immunoregulatory functions due to their ability to modulate cytokine secretion of macrophage and monocytic cells. In mice, CD9 serves as a receptor for PSG17 and PSG19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Murine PSG23, on the other hand, induces the proangiogenic factors transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 (TGF&#x003b2;1) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in cell types involved in vascular remodelling in pregnancy independent of CD9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This supports the notion that PSGs play a diverse role in the protection of allotypic fetus from maternal immune system, as well as in the promotion of invasive growth of cytotrophoblast, and in the remodelling of the maternal vasculature in order to gain optimal access to maternal resources. Indeed, <italic>PSG </italic>genes have so far been found only in species with haemochorial placentation (primates and rodents), a type of placentation with the most intimate contact of fetal trophoblast cells with maternal (immune) cells. As reported here, the only other species with candidate <italic>PSG </italic>genes is the bat (<italic>M. lucifugus</italic>) and the horse comprising at least 18 and five potential PSGs, respectively (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Interestingly, the microbat <italic>M. lucifugus </italic>also exhibits highly invasive haemochorial placentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Although the horse has an epitheliochorial placenta without the direct contact of the fetal trophoblast cells with maternal immune cells, a specialized highly invasive trophoblast cell population exists that forms so-called endometrial cups responsible for the secretion of chorionic gonadotrophin in the maternal decidua. These fetal trophoblast cells have to survive there, despite being immunogenic and recognized by the maternal immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that PSG secreted by these cells suppress the maternal immune system locally. Indeed, we could identify two partial cDNAs from invasive and non-invasive trophoblast cells of an equine candidate PSG in EST data bases. Both, the need for diversification of functions as seen in the mouse and a possible maternal-fetal conflict scenario would favour the expansion of <italic>PSG </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Highly sophisticated regulatory circuits have been developed during evolution to enable the host to cope efficiently with pathogenic insults and, at the same time, to avoid overreactions of the immune system. Inhibitory (ITIM) as well stimulatory sequence modules (ITAM) in immune regulatory proteins are instrumental in these processes. The paired receptors within the CEA family could be part of this regulatory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Indeed, the ITIM-containing isoform of CEACAM1 has been shown to downregulate innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. This might apply to humans and dogs where ITAM-like motif-bearing members (human - CEACAM3 and probably CEACAM4; dog - CEACAM25, CEACAM28, CEACAM30) are coexpressed with CEACAM1 in granulocytes.</p><p>Pathogens exploit this system in order to interfere with efficient immune responses. Expression of ligands in virus-infected cells, which downregulate the immune response via inhibitory receptors, has been identified as immune evasion mechanisms. For example, binding of the MHC class I-related proteins UL18 encoded by human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and m157 from murine CMV to the inhibitory leukocyte Ig-like receptor (LILR) B1 or LILRB4 and Ly49I, respectively, inhibit NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This counteracts the recognition of virus-infected cells in which the MHC class I antigen presentation machinery is often suppressed upon virus infection since the MHC class I-related protein m157 is not able to present (viral) peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In this respect, CEACAM1, from a pathogen point of view, represents an ideal receptor since it allows both easy entry into the host due to its wide-spread expression in epithelia and, at the same time, suppression of the adaptive and innate immune system. Upon engagement with pathogenic bacteria, CEACAM1 acts as inhibitory receptor and down-regulates T cell receptor and TLR2-mediated signalling in CD4-positive T cells and pulmonary epithelial cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, various counter strategies have been developed by the hosts to fend off CEACAM1-binding pathogens. To date, two strategies have been well characterized: allelic variation of CEACAM1 or formation of a paired internalization receptor. An allelic variant of CEACAM1 with lowered pathogen ligand affinity has been identified for mouse hepatitis virus (see Introduction). This pathogen-host 'arms race' might be more wide-spread since <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>alleles which encode highly divergent N domains have also been identified in rats and cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Indeed, recently, a candidate viral pathogen has been found to use bovine CEACAM1 as a receptor (K Holmes, personal communication). On the other hand, CEACAM3 has been found to represent an opsonin-independent granulocyte receptor for internalization of neisserial pathogens. The trapping of pathogens by human GPI-anchored CEACAM1-related proteins on microvili of colonic enterocytes, such as CEA and CEACAM6, which also bind neisserial pathogens, followed by the shedding of vesicles from the CEACAM-positive microvili or hydrolysis of the GPI linker has been suggested by Hammarstr&#x000f6;m and Baranov as an additional defense mechanism involving CEACAM1-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. A countermeasure against downregulation of immune responses by pathogens via inhibitory receptors has been observed with other receptor systems: the formation of paired activating receptors. A well studied example of such a mechanism is the generation of the NK receptor Ly49H from its inhibitory killer cell receptor which renders carrier strains resistant to murine CMV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Paired receptors are common in killer Ig-like receptor (KIR), LILR and sialic acid Ig-like lectins (Siglec) gene families in the human extended LRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Most of the positive signalling receptors from these receptor families associate via a characteristic positively charged amino acid in their transmembrane domain with the ITAM-containing adaptor DAP12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. CD33r Siglec-14/Siglec-5 and Siglec-16/Siglec-11 represent such paired receptors, which contain very similar extracellular domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. It is postulated that binding to pathogen-derived sialic acid might be the driving force behind the formation of these paired receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Our studies indicate, that paired receptors also exist in the CEA family, which might share endogenous or pathogen ligands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). At present it is not clear whether the ITAM-like motifs found in the paired CEACAM receptors represent internalization or activation signals as found in KIR, LILR and Siglec paired receptors. Pathogen uptake experiments involving domain swapping of the CEACAM3 cytoplasmic domain with those of other ITAM-like motif containing members have to be performed to clarify this issue. On the other hand, opossum ITAM-containing CEACAMs together with their inhibitory receptors (CEACAM1 and CEACAM114) could represent <italic>bona fide </italic>paired receptors. Although a number of bacterial pathogens have been demonstrated to gain access to epithelial cells of their host through binding to CEACAM1, phagocytosis by neutrophilic granulocytes via CEACAM3 has been evaluated only for one bacterial strain (<italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Analysis of internalization through CEACAM3 of a wider selection of CEACAM1-binding bacterial pathogens would strengthen the proposed hypothesis.</p><p>Ligand binding domains of decoy receptors and corresponding receptors have to be kept similar enough during evolution to allow efficient interaction with pathogens. This can be achieved among others by gene conversion, recombination and gene duplication. Inversion of all non-<italic>CEACAM </italic>genes between the <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related gene loci which occurred independently in species from different clades indicates that a recombination between closely related members of the different <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related gene subclusters with inverted orientation has occurred, possibly leading to the formation of paired receptor genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This observation strongly supports the notion that continuous selective pressure exists to maintain close similarity between the immune regulatory CEACAM1 with its ITAM-like motif-containing counterpart(s) or secreted proteins (CEACAM10 in rodents) which might serve as soluble decoy receptors. However, the formation of paired receptor genes might also occur by an illegitimate recombination between sister chromatids. Such a mechanism possibly has been at work in the dog where the ITAM-like motif-containing <italic>CEACAM28 </italic>which encodes an N domain nearly identical with that of <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>lies next to the canine <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>gene in the same subcluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The target gene was possibly created by gene duplication of the closely related neighbour gene (<italic>CEACAM29</italic>) which then exchanged a 2.2 kb DNA fragment comprising the leader and the N domain exons with <italic>CEACAM1 </italic>to form <italic>CEACAM28 </italic>(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Siglec </italic>and <italic>LILR </italic>genes are also arranged in two inverted clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. <italic>LILR </italic>subclusters too are interrupted by non-<italic>LILR </italic>genes like the <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-like genes in eutherian mammals. It is assumed that this arrangement might facilitate intrachromosomal gene conversion events thus avoiding or minimizing the 'concertino effect' of expansion and contraction of tandemly repeated gene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>In summary, abuse of the inhibitory receptor CEACAM1 by viral and bacterial pathogens to gain access to host cells as well as the paternal/maternal conflict in which PSGs possibly are involved have probably strongly contributed to the divergent evolution of the CEA family.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The <italic>CEACAM </italic>gene family which appears to be restricted to vertebrates exhibits an extreme diversity between different species and varies widely in the number (from five in lagomorphs to &#x0003e; 100 in bats) and type of members even among species from the same clade. Phylogenetic analyses of the <italic>CEA </italic>families from over 20 mammalian species revealed two mechanisms which could be responsible for the evolutionary diversity: pressure exerted by pathogens binding to CEA members and the possible involvement in fetal-maternal conflict processes of members expressed in the fetal trophoblast. CEACAM1 which acts as receptor for viral and bacterial pathogens in several species and mediates both pathogen access to host cells and inhibition of anti-pathogen immune response seems to be central for the diversification process. This is apparent from the selection for the diversification of the CEACAM1 pathogen binding domain, as well as from the formation of paired receptors with closely related pathogen binding domains by gene conversion and intrachromosomal recombination and ITAM-like or GPI anchorage motifs which allow internalization and destruction or shedding of bound pathogens, respectively. Birth and death of such genes contribute to diversity of the <italic>CEA </italic>gene family. Haemochorial placentation which involves invasive trophoblast growth correlated with the presence of <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-related often numerous <italic>PSG </italic>genes in the species investigated. The trophoblast-specific PSG have been shown to have an immunomodulatory function, thus involvement in maternal-fetal conflict processes can be envisaged. Expansions of <italic>PSG </italic>gene families could counteract a possible reduction of the affinity of maternal receptors by mutation. Taken together, our findings should aid identification of CEACAM pathogen receptors in other species and possibly lead to the identification of additional gene families with immunoregulatory members the evolution of which is driven by host/pathogen coevolution or fetal-maternal conflict processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Datasets and nomenclature of genes</title><p>Sequence similarity searches were performed using the NCBI BLAST tools <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST</ext-link> and Ensembl BLAST/SSAHA search programs <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Multi/blastview">http://www.ensembl.org/Multi/blastview</ext-link>.

For estimation of the number of <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-like genes present in a given species, distinct <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-like N domain exons with a sequence divergence &#x0003e; 1% were counted. No evidence was found that genes with multiple N domain exons as found in rodents exist in any of the newly analysed species. Genes that contained stop codons within their N domain exons or lacked appropriate splice acceptor and donor sites were considered to represent pseudogenes. For opossum, <italic>CEACAM </italic>genes with a corrupted leader peptide exon were also registered as pseudogenes. Genes were assigned to their respective groups based on phylogenetic analyses. Their assignment was confirmed by synteny and gene structure. Due to their non-orthologous relationship the new <italic>CEACAM1</italic>-like genes were numbered as follows: cattle, <italic>CEACAM32</italic>-<italic>CEACAM35</italic>; horses, <italic>CEACAM41</italic>-<italic>CEACAM51 </italic>and opossum, <italic>CEACAM100</italic>-<italic>CEACAM122</italic>.
