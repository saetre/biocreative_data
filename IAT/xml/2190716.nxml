We demonstrate here that Ebs1p is involved in NMD and behaves similarly to human Smg proteins. Indeed, both loss and overexpression of Ebs1p results in stabilization of NMD targets. However, Ebs1-loss in yeast or Smg7-depletion in human cells only partially disrupts NMD and in the latter, Smg7-depletion is partially compensated for by Smg6. Ebs1p physically interacts with the NMD helicase Upf1p and overexpressed Ebs1p leads to recruitment of Upf1p into cytoplasmic P-bodies. Furthermore, Ebs1p localizes to P-bodies upon glucose starvation along with Upf1p. Overall our findings suggest that NMD is more conserved in evolution than previously thought, and that at least one of the Smg5-7 proteins is conserved in budding yeast.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The cellular production of RNA is kept under surveillance through elaborate quality control machineries able to cope with errors that may occur during synthesis. Mutations that give rise to premature termination codons in mRNAs either due to mutations in DNA or to errors that occur during transcription or pre-mRNA splicing are handled at least in part by an intricate RNA surveillance system named nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). NMD detects and targets &#x02018;nonsense&#x02019; mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) for degradation, thereby preventing their translation. Loss of functional NMD seems to have different consequences in different organisms. Yeast and worm NMD mutants as well as human cells siRNA-depleted for the NMD factor Upf2 accumulate PTC-containing mRNAs without apparent loss in viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5 B6">2&#x02013;6</xref>); on the contrary, impairment of NMD in flies leads to cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In any case, one can speculate that translation of PTC-containing transcripts could lead to the production of truncated proteins with potential deleterious effects for the cell. It has been estimated that approximately one-third of all human genetic syndromes and many types of cancer arise from mRNAs containing a PTC derived from mutations occurring in the template gene. NMD might alleviate the severity of a number of genetic disorders by decreasing the abundance of disease-associated nonsense transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Upf1, Upf2 and Upf3 (for UP-Frameshift; also named Smg2, Smg3 and Smg4, respectively for Suppressor with Morphogenetic effects on Genitalia) proteins play a central role in NMD. They were first discovered in yeast as the result of a genetic screen looking for mutations that suppressed an auxotrophic marker containing a PTC stemming from a frameshift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Successively, homologs of these three genes were also found in other organisms including worms, flies and humans. Upf1 is a phosphoprotein with ATPase and 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; helicase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12">9&#x02013;12</xref>). It is envisioned that the helicase activity of Upf1 somehow allows the NMD surveillance complex to scan RNA molecules. Consistently, ectopically expressed helicase-dead variants of Upf1 exert a dominant negative effect on NMD in different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Upf2 and Upf3 proteins seem to interact with Upf1 on the nonsense mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Once the Upf complex has recognized an mRNA as nonsense, this mRNA is degraded via contributions from both the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; decapping-dependent exonuclease pathway, and the deadenylation dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exosome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). NMD most likely takes place in cytoplasmic foci referred to as processing bodies (P-bodies) as many of the proteins that are involved in decapping and general RNA decay reside in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18&#x02013;20</xref>). Further supporting this hypothesis, yeast PTC-containing mRNAs are targeted to P-bodies in an Upf1p-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>In higher eukaryotes including worms and mammals, the core of the NMD machinery also comprises four factors named Smg1, Smg5, Smg6 and Smg7. All these factors influence the phosphorylation state of Upf1. Smg1 belongs to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family and directly phosphorylates Upf1 at S/T-Q residues during NMD cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Although <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Upf1 has been recently demonstrated to be a phosphoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), no obvious Smg1 ortholog has yet been identified in yeast. In contrary to Smg1, the other Smg proteins (herein referred to as Smg5-7) promote Upf1 dephosphorylation, which is likely carried out by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Consistently, Smg5-7 interact with PP2A and at the same time directly bind to Upf1 through highly conserved residues within their 14-3-3 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). As is the case for Smg1, no obvious Smg5-7 ortholog has been found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, leading to the assumption that these factors do not exist in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>The S. cerevisiae Ebs1 protein was first characterized based on its sequence similarity with yeast Est1p, a subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme, which adds newly synthesized TG-rich repeats to the termini of yeast chromosomes, the telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Deletion of the EST1 gene leads to a continuous shortening of telomeres, which ultimately causes loss of the telomeric cap and cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). <italic>ebs1</italic>&#x00394; cells also have short telomeres compared to wild-type cells, however the length of the telomeric tract is stable and cells do not experience senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These observations suggest that the telomere shortening phenotypes detected in <italic>est1</italic>&#x00394; and in <italic>ebs1</italic>&#x00394; cells stem from different mechanisms. More recently, it has been reported that Ebs1p functions as a &#x02018;global inhibitor of translation&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>We and others have previously demonstrated that the human genome contains three genes encoding for polypeptides with sequence similarity to yeast Est1p and Ebs1p. The three putative orthologs were named EST1A, EST1B and EST1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Similarly to yeast Est1p, EST1A and EST1B interact with human telomerase. Furthermore, overexpression of EST1A causes telomeric dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Strikingly EST1A, EST1B and EST1C are identical to Smg6, Smg5 and Smg7, respectively, raising the attractive possibility that Est1p and/or Ebs1p might also function in NMD.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that EBS1 (but not EST1) deletion leads to a slight but highly reproducible stabilization of NMD targets. Moreover, Ebs1p possesses several features typical of the Smg5-7 proteins: (i) Ebs1p, as well as Upf1p, localizes to P-bodies upon glucose starvation and (ii) overexpression of Ebs1p leads to accumulation Upf1p in P-bodies. Altogether, we provide evidence that Ebs1p is a new component of the yeast NMD machinery and we propose that at least one of the Smg5-7 proteins is conserved throughout evolution from yeast to man. We also demonstrate that ebs1&#x00394; mutants and all the other tested NMD mutants are resistant to the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, implicating the NMD machinery in cell growth control pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Rabbit anti-human Smg7 polyclonal antibody was generated using a synthetic 40-amino acid long peptide corresponding to a sequence close to the C-terminus of Smg7 (N-PAMGGFGIDYLSATSSSESSWHQASTPSG TWTGHGPSMED-C).

Whereas Ebs1p has been implicated in both telomere length regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), the only proposed role of Est1p is to promote the recruitment of telomerase to chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Interestingly, the N-terminal regions of both Ebs1p and Est1p comprise a 14-3-3 domain that is highly similar to that found in the higher eukaryotic NMD proteins Smg5, Smg6 and Smg7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The putative 14-3-3 domain of the human Smg proteins forms a classic phosphoserine-binding pocket, which was shown to interact with phosphorylated Upf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We generated a multiple sequence alignment of the 14-3-3 domains of the human Smg proteins and the N-terminal region of both Ebs1p and Est1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Careful inspection of the 14-3-3 sequences of Ebs1p and Est1p revealed differences between the two proteins with respect to key residues implicated in phosphoserine binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), suggesting different binding specificities. The human 14-3-3 zeta isoform (HZI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) residue Tyr128 is conserved in both Est1p and Ebs1p. HZI Asn173 is not conserved in either of the two yeast proteins while conservation is maintained in the human Smg proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, HZI Lys49, Arg56 and Arg127 are conserved in Ebs1p and the other Smg proteins but not in Est1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Pairwise alignments of Ebs1p with each of the three human Smg5-7 proteins revealed that yeast Ebs1p and human Smg7 have two highly conserved regions that do not exist in either Smg5 or Smg6. We have named these regions conserved region 1 (CR1) and conserved region 2 (CR2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, see insets). Furthermore, while both Smg5 and Smg6 have C-terminal PilT-amino-terminal (PIN) domains, a domain often associated with nuclease activity, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), Smg7 does not contain a PIN domain, as is the case for both Est1p and Ebs1p. This sequence analysis suggests that Ebs1p has a domain organization similar to human Smg7 and further predicts that Ebs1p and/or Est1p may play a role in NMD as do the Smg proteins. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The Smg5-7 14-3-3 phosphoserine-binding residues are conserved in Ebs1p.

In our experimental settings, the half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) of the CYH2 pre-mRNA was &#x0223c;2.7 min in <italic>ebs1</italic>&#x00394; cells, while it was 1.2 min in wild-type cells (Supplementary Figure S1). Similarly, the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of RP51B pre mRNA was &#x0223c;6.5 min in <italic>ebs1</italic>&#x00394; cells, while it was 3.3 min in wild-type cells.

These observations suggest that <italic>EBS1</italic> deletion specifically impairs with the degradation of NMD targets. We then generated <italic>ebs1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>upf1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants and found that there was not a synergistic or an obvious additive effect with regards to CYH2 pre-mRNA stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), suggesting that <italic>EBS1</italic> lies in the same genetic pathway as the rest of the canonical genes involved in NMD.</p><p>Similar to the conservative effects on NMD, we noticed that the short telomere phenotype of <italic>ebs1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) is also less severe than that seen in <italic>upf1</italic>&#x00394; cells (Supplementary Figure S2). This is consistent with the proposed model that the short telomere defect in <italic>upf</italic> mutants is an indirect effect of incomplete NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Nonetheless, we have recently shown that mammalian SMG proteins localize to telomeres and promote dissociation of telomeric repeat containing RNA (TERRA) from telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). It is possible that TERRA is also conserved in yeast and that the telomere shortening observed in yeast NMD mutants could derive at least in part from loss of proper TERRA regulation at chromosome ends.</p><p>To analyze the consequences of depletion of Ebs1-related human factors, we generated shRNAs directed against human Smg6 or Smg7. ShRNAs were validated by western blots, which confirmed that the levels of targeted proteins were strongly decreased (Supplementary Figure S3). As previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), shRNA-mediated depletion of Smg6 and Smg7 induced stabilization of a PTC containing &#x003b2;-globin mRNA (&#x003b2;GL<sup>NS39</sup>) when compared to empty vector transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Remarkably, as is the case for yeast <italic>ebs1</italic>&#x00394; mutants, knockdown of Smg7 did not stabilize &#x003b2;GL<sup>NS39</sup> mRNA to the extent achieved using shRNA against human Upf1. However, simultaneous shRNA-mediated depletion of Smg6 and Smg7 resulted in a dramatic increase in &#x003b2;GL<sup>NS39</sup> transcript that was comparable to the one observed in cells depleted for Upf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Similar results were obtained using different shRNA-directed against Smg7, Smg6 and Upf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and data not shown). This suggests that the human Smg6 and Smg7 proteins can substitute for each other and raises the possibility that there may be another Smg-like protein in yeast (which is not Est1p), that can partially substitute for Ebs1p. We searched the yeast database for PIN domain containing proteins, which could be potential orthologs of either Smg5 or Smg6, and identified NMD4, YKR096w and YOR166c. Analysis of NMD targets in the three single mutant strains as well as in the double mutants with <italic>ebs1&#x00394;</italic> did not reveal any increase in NMD impairment as compared to single <italic>EBS1</italic> mutants (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that these PIN-domain-containing proteins could substitute for Ebs1p.</p><p>We then tested if overexpressing either human Smg7 or yeast Ebs1 proteins could affect NMD. Indeed, overexpression of Smg7 in human cells resulted in stabilization of &#x003b2;GL<sup>NS39</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, compare last two lanes). Similarly, overexpression of both Ebs1 and Smg7 in yeast resulted in slight stabilization of the CYH2 pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Because Smg7 participates in the dephosphorylation of Upf1, it is possible that the impairment of NMD function observed in human cells depleted for or overexpressing Smg7 derives from a compromised balance between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Upf1. Although yeast Upf1p has recently been demonstrated to be a phosphoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), we were unsuccessful in our attempts to detect phosphorylated Upf1p. Furthermore, there is no evidence that phosphorylation of yeast Upf1p plays a role in NMD and the human PI3-like Upf1 kinase, Smg1, has no apparent functional homolog in yeast. Indeed, deletion of the known yeast PI3-like kinases <italic>tor1</italic>, <italic>tel1</italic> or <italic>mec1</italic> does not impair with NMD function (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>ebs1</italic><italic>&#x00394;</italic> cells are competent to inhibit global translation upon rapamycin treatment</title><p>Slightly increased steady-state levels of NMD targets in <italic>EBS1&#x00394;</italic> cells were already reported by Ford and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The same study also demonstrates that <italic>ebs1</italic> deletion leads to increased translation of a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene, while overexpression of Ebs1p leads to decreased translation of the same reporter. Furthermore, yeast strains deleted for <italic>EBS1</italic> display resistance to the immunosuppressive drug and inhibitor of the TOR kinase, rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). These observations led the authors to propose that Ebs1p might work as a global translation inhibitor and that the NMD defects as well as the rapamycin resistance observed in <italic>ebs1</italic>&#x00394; cells are due to a failure in proper translation regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>To verify the involvement of Ebs1p in processes of translation inhibition, we performed pulse-labeling experiments with <sup>35</sup>S-labeled methionine following rapamycin addition, which is known to result in down-regulation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). We found that <sup>35</sup>S incorporation was inhibited to similar extents in wild-type and <italic>ebs1&#x00394;</italic> cells following rapamycin treatment (Supplementary Figure S4). We also analyzed polysome profiles of wild-type and <italic>ebs1&#x00394;</italic> cells following either rapamycin addition or glucose starvation and consistently we noticed the accumulation of an 80S monosome peak in both samples (Supplementary Figure S4). On the contrary, the rapamycin insensitive <italic>fpr1&#x00394;</italic> cells showed no noticeable profile difference from the untreated control culture following the addition of rapamycin (Supplementary Figure S4). Similarly, polysome profiles from cells overexpressing Ebs1p did not show any substantial difference as compared to cells transformed with empty vector controls (Supplementary Figure S4). We then asked if Ebs1p level alterations could affect the cellular sensitivity to different translational inhibitors, including cycloheximide, paramomycin and hygromycin B. Neither the deletion nor the overexpression of <italic>Ebs1</italic> affected the sensitivity of the cells to the tested inhibitors (Supplementary Figure S5). We thus conclude that the NMD defect and the rapamycin resistance observed in <italic>ebs1&#x00394;</italic> cells are not a consequence of a general lack of translation inhibition. The apparent discrepancy between the data reported here and the ones shown by Ford <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) might be due to the different experimental settings used to monitor translation efficiency.</p><p>We also noticed that all tested deletion mutants involved in NMD (<italic>upf1&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>upf2&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>upf3&#x00394; and xrn1&#x00394;</italic>) were highly resistant to rapamycin (Supplementary Figure S5). Furthermore, <italic>upf1&#x00394; ebs1&#x00394;</italic> double mutant cells had a rapamycin resistance that was similar to the respective single mutants, suggesting that both factors may function in the same genetic pathway that determines rapamycin sensitivity (Supplementary Figure S5). The rapamycin resistance of <italic>upf1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>ebs1&#x00394;</italic> cells does not exactly recapitulate the defects of the respective mutants in NMD, which are much more pronounced upon <italic>UPF1</italic> deletion. The even more pronounced rapamycin resistance of <italic>upf2&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>upf3&#x00394;</italic> cells, which behave identical to <italic>upf1&#x00394;</italic> with regard to NMD-dysfunction, combined with the fact that <italic>ebs1&#x00394; xrn1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>upf1&#x00394; xrn1&#x00394;</italic> double mutants are additive in terms of rapamycin resistance may suggest additional NMD-independent regulatory roles for these proteins (Supplementary Figure S5). In this regard, it is interesting to note that yeast Upf1p has been implicated in the trafficking of normal mRNAs in and possibly out of P-bodies while Upf2 and Upf3 work further downstream, and only on PTC-containing RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). It will be interesting to examine if Ebs1p and Upf1p collaborate in trafficking of normal mRNAs or yet another regulatory circuit that may explain the different extent of rapamycin resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Ebs1p localizes to P-bodies and interacts with Upf1p</title><p>Processing bodies or P-bodies house all of the decapping proteins, such as Dcp1p, Dcp2p and the Lsm proteins, as well as the main 5' exonuclease, Xrn1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). It is predicated that the majority of RNA degradation occurs within P-bodies and it has been demonstrated that yeast NMD substrates are also targeted in an Upf1p-dependent manner to the P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In yeast, Upf1p itself has been detected within P-bodies upon depletion of the decapping enzymes or <italic>XRN1</italic>, which results in RNA accumulation within P-bodies and hence increased P-body size due to the accumulation of incompletely processed RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Yeast Upf1p can also be seen in P-bodies in <italic>upf2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>upf3&#x00394;</italic> mutants where Upf2p and Upf3p also trigger nonsense mRNA decapping in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Glucose starvation has also been shown to increase P-body size as judged by scoring the size of Dcp2p-GFP-containing foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><p>We constructed a dsRED-tagged version of Ebs1p and noticed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining in log phase cells grown in rich medium. Upon glucose starvation, Ebs1p-dsRED formed discrete cytoplasmic foci that co-localize with Dcp2p-GFP, indicating that like Upf1p, Ebs1p can localize to P-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, we found that Upf1p-GFP also co-localizes with Ebs1p-dsRED upon glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). While both Dcp2-GFP and Upf1-GFP protein levels were diminished upon glucose starvation (Supplementary Figure S6), we noticed that Ebs1p levels were not strongly affected (Supplementary Figure S6, see below). In contrary to Upf1p, only a fraction of Ebs1p-dsRED is recruited to P-bodies upon glucose starvation, with a substantial fraction remaining diffuse in the cytoplasm. This observation suggests that the P-body-associated function of Ebs1p does not require the entire cellular reservoir of Ebs1p. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Ebs1p and Upf1p co-localize in P-bodies in glucose-starved cells.

Therefore, we overexpressed Ebs1p under the control of the ADH promoter and found that analogous to human Smg5 and 7, this also resulted in the recruitment of Upf1p-GFP into cytoplasmic foci containing an RFP-tagged version of Dcp2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, overexpression of Ebs1p induces accumulation of UPF1-GFP protein as measured by western blotting experiments (Supplementary Figure S3). Because overexpression of Upf1p can increase the levels of Upf1p itself in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), we cannot exclude that the Upf1-containing P-bodies that we observe in cells overexpressing Ebs1p may at least in part derive from the higher intracellular levels of Upf1p. Nevertheless, co-immunoprecipitation experiments of endogenously expressed proteins show that Ebs1p-13myc (but not Est1p-18myc; data not shown) co-immunoprecipitates together with Upf1p-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), suggesting that Ebs1p might directly interact with Upf1p in P-bodies. The amount of Upf1p that co-immunoprecipitated with Ebs1p did not increase following glucose withdrawal (Supplementary Figure 6), suggesting that glucose starvation leads to the recruitment of pre-associated Ebs1p-Upf1p molecules into P-bodies. Interestingly, the interaction between Upf1p and Ebs1p was maintained when extracts were treated with RNase prior to performing the immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). This is in partial contrast to what we observed in human cells, whereby endogenous Upf1 co-immunoprecipitates Smg7 in a partially RNA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). We speculate that the interaction between Upf1p/Upf1 and Ebs1p/Smg7 may occur through direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions and in human cells also through RNA molecules simultaneously bound to both factors. The interaction of human Upf1 with human Upf2 and Upf3 is also partially lost when extracts are treated with RNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), suggesting that RNA molecules stabilize the entire human NMD core complex. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Overexpression of Ebs1 recruits Upf1p into P-bodies. Upf1p-GFP and Dcp2p-RFP cells were transformed with either empty vector (EV) or with a plasmid, which overexpressed Ebs1p under the ADH promoter (ADH-Ebs1) and subjected to confocal microscopy. Arrowheads indicate examples of cytoplasmic foci where a co-localization between Upf1p-GFP and Dcp2p-RFP occurred. At the time of imaging, 74% of the cells transformed with ADH-Ebs1 displayed 2&#x02013;6 Upf1p-GFP foci and 6% of the cells transformed with empty vectors displayed 1 to 2 Upf1p-GFP foci. Scale bar represents 2.5 &#x003bc;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm912f4"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Smg7/Ebs1p physically interacts with Upf1 proteins in a partially RNA-dependent manner. (<bold>A</bold>) Myc tagged Ebs1p was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates prepared from strains expressing Upf1p-GFP. Lysates were treated with RNase or left untreated. Western blots were performed using anti-myc and anti-GFP antibodies. (<bold>B</bold>) Protein extracts were prepared form HeLa cells and treated with RNase or left untreated. Human Upf1 was immunoprecipitated using goat polyclonal antibodies and western blot analysis was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against human Smg7, Upf2 and Upf3 and goat polyclonal antibodies raised against Upf1. As a control for IP specificity, &#x003b1;-Tubulin does not co-immunoprecipitate with Upf1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm912f5"/></fig></p><p>The above-described results suggest that Ebs1p could potentially be involved in either promoting Upf1p delivery or Upf1p retention in P-bodies, drawing another parallel between the Smg5-7 proteins and Ebs1p. In fact, the C-terminal region of the human Smg7 polypeptide is sufficient for recruiting Upf1 into P-bodies when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). The CR2 present in the C-terminus of both Smg7 and Ebs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) might represent a structural domain essential for the Ebs1-induced localization of Upf1p into P-bodies. However, Upf1p-GFP is still efficiently recruited into cytoplasmic foci upon glucose starvation in <italic>ebs1</italic>&#x00394; cells (data not shown), indicating that Ebs1p alone is not required for the Upf1p recruitment into P-bodies but possibly for downstream regulatory events, which may include Upf1p retention or release. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that there is another protein substituting for Ebs1p in its absence, which would allow Upf1p recruitment. This second hypothesis is consistent with the fact that NMD target accumulation is incomplete in single deletion of <italic>EBS1</italic> as well as in single knockdowns of Smg6 and Smg7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our data indicate that Ebs1p is a novel member of the NMD machinery in yeast and a putative ortholog of human Smg7. Thus, although it has been assumed previously that Smg proteins do not exist in yeast, our data suggest that careful screening of the yeast genome may allow identification of additional Smg-like proteins, which would further corroborate conservation of NMD throughout eukaryotes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm912_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm912_nar-00659-w-2007-File007.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm912_nar-00659-w-2007-File008.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm912_nar-00659-w-2007-File009.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm912_nar-00659-w-2007-File010.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm912_nar-00659-w-2007-File011.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="nar_gkm912_nar-00659-w-2007-File012.tif"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank V.
