Each monomer of the UvrA dimer contains two ATPase sites. Using single-molecule analysis we show that dimerization of UvrA in the presence of ATP is significantly higher than with ADP or nonhydrolyzable ATP&#x003b3;S, suggesting that the active UvrA dimer contains a mixture of ADP and ATP. We also show that the UvrA dimer has a high preference of binding the end of a linear DNA fragment, independent on the presence or type of cofactor. Apparently ATP binding or hydrolysis is not needed to discriminate between DNA ends and internal sites. A significant number of complexes could be detected where one UvrA dimer bridges two DNA ends implying the presence of two separate DNA-binding domains, most likely present in each monomer. On DNA containing a site-specific lesion the damage-specific binding is much higher than DNA-end binding, but only in the absence of cofactor or with ATP. With ATP&#x003b3;S no discrimination between a DNA end and a DNA damage could be observed. We present a model where damage recognition of UvrA depends on the ability of both UvrA monomers to interact with the DNA flanking the lesion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a universal DNA-repair mechanism that it is capable of repairing various chemically and structurally unrelated lesions. In bacteria, the proteins UvrA, UvrB and UvrC initiate NER by recognizing DNA lesions and catalyzing incisions on both sides of the damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The current model for the mechanism of bacterial NER consists of the following steps: first, two UvrA proteins and two UvrB proteins associate to form the UvrA<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> complex, which searches the DNA for potential damages. Initially UvrA will probe the DNA for presence of a damaged site and after detection of such a site it hands off the DNA to UvrB which then will verify if a lesion is present. After detection of a DNA lesion by UvrB, UvrA dissociates leaving the so-called pre-incision complex which has one UvrB subunit tightly bound to the lesion and the second subunit more loosely associated. UvrC subsequently displaces the second UvrB subunit from the pre-incision complex and incises the DNA, first at the 3&#x02032; side and then at the 5&#x02032; side of the damage.</p><p>In recent years structural and biochemical analysis of (mutant) UvrB proteins has shed considerable light on the process of damage recognition by UvrB. The protein uses a &#x003b2;-hairpin motif that inserts between the two DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). It has been postulated that nucleotides are flipped behind this hairpin until a lesion is detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). Much less is known, however, about the role of UvrA in damage detection. Very recently, the crystal structure of the ADP-bound form of the <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> UvrA dimer has been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Each monomer contains two ATP-binding sites belonging to the superfamily of ABC ATPases. In classical ABC ATPases, the ATP is bound at the interface of the dimer bridging the ATP-binding domain of one subunit with the signature domain of the other subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In UvrA, however, the ATP-binding sites are formed in an intramolecular fashion by the Walker A and Walker B motifs in the N-terminal part of the protein and the signature motif in the C-terminal part and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Still ATP has been shown to stimulate dimerization and it has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis results in monomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). UvrA (in absence of UvrB) binds DNA with a preference for single-stranded or damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This DNA binding is influenced by the presence of ATP, ADP and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). It has been proposed that the ATPase activity of UvrA results in dissociation of the protein from undamaged sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>In this paper we analyze the UvrA protein at the single-molecule level using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We show that, in contrast to what was concluded from bulk measurements, dimerization of UvrA is stimulated by ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that the active UvrA dimer contains a mixture of ADP and ATP. AFM analysis of UvrA bound to a DNA substrate containing a defined lesion revealed that ATP is not required for damage detection. We also present evidence that each monomer of the UvrA dimer has a separate DNA-binding domain and discuss a model where simultaneous binding of the two monomers provides damage discrimination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Proteins and chemicals</title><p>UvrA and UvrB were purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).

We therefore have used AFM to analyze the dimerization of the UvrA protein. AFM images, taken from depositions of 20 nM UvrA in the absence of a nucleotide cofactor, revealed complexes with two different sizes. An example of such an AFM image is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. A histogram of all the obtained complex volumes shows two separate populations with distinctly different volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A).

The thus obtained molecular weights of the UvrA populations were 111.2 kDa and 223.2 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), which correlate very well with the theoretical molecular weight of the UvrA monomer (110 kDa) and UvrA dimer (220 kDa), respectively.

Addition of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATP&#x003b3;S, however, did not alter the dimerization of UvrA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Also in the presence of another nonhydrolyzable analog, AMP-PNP, the dimerization levels of UvrA remained unaltered (data not shown). UvrA has been shown to bind these nonhydrolyzable cofactors since they are potent competitive inhibitors of the ATPase activity of UvrA (ref. 11 and our lab, data not shown). This strongly suggests that it is not the binding of ATP that stimulates formation of UvrA dimers, but the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. To test this model further, dimerization levels of UvrA were studied using conditions where UvrA is able to bind, but not hydrolyze ATP. For this purpose UvrA was incubated at 4&#x000b0;C after which the protein mixture was deposited on freshly cleaved mica, which was precooled at 4&#x000b0;C. At 4&#x000b0;C, no ATPase activity of UvrA was detected in an ATPase assay (data not shown), but at this temperature UvrA has been shown to bind ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Indeed under this nonhydrolyzing condition, addition of ATP does no longer stimulate UvrA dimerization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), confirming that dimerization of UvrA is stimulated by hydrolysis of ATP.</p><p>Addition of ADP also led to an increase in dimerization of UvrA, but not to the levels observed in the presence of ATP. One explanation for this difference might be that upon hydrolysis of ATP the generated free phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&#x02013;</sup>) remains bound to the protein and that the repulsion between ADP and this phosphate induces the specific conformation that stabilizes the dimer interface. We therefore also measured the percentage of dimers in the presence of ADP and 100-mM phosphate, but no difference in dimerization levels could be observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). A more likely explanation for the observed difference between ADP and ATP therefore is that not all four ATP molecules are hydrolyzed in the UvrA dimer and that the most stable dimer is generated when the four ATP-binding sites are partly occupied with ADP and partly with ATP. To confirm this, we analyzed the dimerization level upon addition of a mixture of ADP and ATP&#x003b3;S. In the presence of this mixture, a higher amount of UvrA dimers was found than with either ADP or ATP&#x003b3;S alone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), showing that indeed the UvrA dimer is most stable when the ATPase sites are partly occupied with ADP and partly with ATP. The dimerization level of UvrA in the presence of ADP and ATP&#x003b3;S, however, was lower than with ATP. This can be explained by random occupation of the ATPase sites by ADP and/or ATP&#x003b3;S, resulting in a mixture of UvrA dimers with varying stabilities, whereas ATP hydrolysis in the UvrA dimer will lead to a defined cofactor occupation.</p><p>Since we used UvrB monomers and dimers in our equilibration curve we could also determine the dimerization of this protein. In the absence of cofactor, a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 83 nM was found for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> UvrB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp071/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>).

The volumes of UvrA&#x02013;DNA complexes (located on a 678-bp DNA fragment) were determined and compared with the volumes of simultaneously deposited Ku70/80&#x02013;DNA complexes (located on a 1020-bp DNA fragment). The volumes of the UvrA complexes on DNA appeared to be larger than that of the free UvrA monomer and dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), due to the contribution of the DNA. Therefore, the volume of the Ku70/80&#x02013;DNA complex was used as a reference. Simultaneous deposition of UvrA bound to a 678-bp fragment with the 1020-bp fragment without added Ku70/80 revealed that &#x0223c;10% of the UvrA complexes were detected on the longer fragment. Less than 10% of the Ku70/80 complexes were detected on the other DNA fragment after simultaneous deposition of the Ku70/80-bound 1020-bp fragment and the free 678-bp DNA, as was also demonstrated by Verhoeven <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Histograms obtained from the volume distributions of both complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) reveal that the UvrA&#x02013;DNA complex has a size corresponding to the molecular weight of 200&#x02013;224 kDa (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Under all cofactor conditions we never detected a complex corresponding to the size of a UvrA monomer, which would be smaller than the Ku70/80&#x02013;DNA complex. This unambiguously shows that UvrA only binds DNA as a dimer, even in the absence of cofactor where 70% of the protein was shown to be in the monomeric form. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Volume distribution histograms for UvrA&#x02013;DNA complexes (gray bars) incubated in absence of cofactor (<bold>A</bold>) and in presence of ATP (<bold>B</bold>), ATP&#x003b3;S (<bold>C</bold>) or ADP (<bold>D</bold>) and simultaneously deposited Ku70/80&#x02013;DNA complexes (white bars).

This was observed in absence and presence of the different cofactors and in all cases the volume of the bridging protein corresponded to one UvrA dimer. Apparently, the same UvrA dimer is capable of binding to two different targets, most likely using the DNA-binding domain of one subunit to interact with one DNA end. This could mean that also in the other UvrA dimers bound to DNA ends without forming a bridge only one of the monomers contacts the DNA. With a much lower frequency (around 1%) also complexes could be found with a UvrA dimer bound to both a DNA end and an internal DNA binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, panel 6). The lower affinity for internal sites compared to DNA ends can explain the lower occurrence, but their presence suggests that also when bound to internal sites the UvrA dimer uses only one subunit to contact the DNA. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Examples of UvrA complexes simultaneously binding to two separate DNA-binding sites on undamaged DNA (<bold>A</bold>) and on damaged DNA (<bold>B</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp071f7"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Preference for damaged site is dependent on the type of cofactor</title><p>To test the specific binding of UvrA to a DNA damage we constructed the same 678-bp DNA fragment as used for the binding of undamaged DNA, but now having a Menthol adduct attached to the N3 position of a thymine in the center of the DNA fragment (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section). An example of an AFM image of UvrA bound to this substrate is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B. As for the UvrA bound to undamaged DNA all complexes formed on the damaged DNA substrate corresponded to the size of the UvrA dimer irrespective of the type of cofactor or location of the protein on the DNA. In the absence of cofactor or with ATP a very high preference of UvrA for the damaged site is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B) with 75&#x02013;78% of the DNA molecules having the protein bound at the center of the fragment and only 7&#x02013;8% at the DNA end (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). From these distributions a preference for binding the Menthol damage versus a nondamaged site was calculated to be &#x0223c;3500. With ADP there is also a preference to bind the damaged site, but this frequency is significantly lower (53.1 &#x000b1; 5.8%) and a substantial amount (24.9 &#x000b1; 1.1%) is still found at the DNA ends (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>).

However, as each DNA fragment contains two ends this means that the binding affinities for a DNA damage or a DNA end are similar in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S. <table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Site-specific binding of UvrA on damaged DNA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cofactor</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">On damage (%)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">On end (%)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">On nonspecific site (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">78.5 &#x000b1; 2.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.9 &#x000b1; 1.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.6 &#x000b1; 1.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATP</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.9 &#x000b1; 1.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.0 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.1 &#x000b1; 2.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATP&#x003b3;S</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.4 &#x000b1; 3.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.2 &#x000b1; 6.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.4 &#x000b1; 10.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ADP</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.1 &#x000b1; 5.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.9 &#x000b1; 1.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.0 &#x000b1; 5.9</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Percentages were calculated using complex distribution histograms as described in &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section.</p><p>Data were obtained from at least two independent experiments.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>In all the depositions, regardless of the type of cofactor we again observed complexes in which two DNA ends are bridged by one UvrA dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, panels 1&#x02013;4) or where UvrA bridges an end and an internal site (panels 5 and 6). Occasionally, these internal sites were located in the center of the fragment (panel 6), but the occurrence of these complexes was too low to determine whether in these complexes UvrA is indeed bound to the damaged site. In none of the depositions, however, we could find complexes with UvrA simultaneously bound to two damaged sites, not even under conditions where damage-specific binding is much higher than end-binding (i.e. in the absence of cofactor or with ATP). Apparently, when bound to a damaged site the UvrA dimer is much less capable of making DNA bridges, suggesting that when bound to a damage both monomers are engaged in making contact with the DNA around the damaged site. When, on the other hand, the UvrA dimer has bound a DNA end, only one monomer interacts with the DNA, leaving the second subunit in a mobile state allowing it to bind another DNA target.</p><p>Our model also explains why DNA-end binding involving only one monomer is not dependent on the cofactor whereas damage-specific binding is. Most likely the type of cofactor influences the orientation of the two monomers in the dimer. Only in the absence of cofactor or in the presence of ATP (i.e. in the ATP/ADP mixed form) the orientation of the two monomers is optimal for simultaneous interaction with DNA at a damaged site.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In classical dimeric ABC ATPases, the dimerization of the protein is stimulated by binding of ATP at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In the UvrA dimer, however, the nucleotides are not located at the dimer interface and it has been proposed that ATP binding and hydrolysis regulate dimerization indirectly via rearrangement of the ATPase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In this paper we show, using single-molecule analysis that that the most stable dimer of UvrA contains a mixture of ADP and ATP, which is formed upon ATP hydrolysis. This is in contrast to previously presented data that suggested that ATP hydrolysis by UvrA would lead to monomerization of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In these experiments, however, the oligomerization of UvrA was investigated using sedimentation and gel filtration analysis, which did not allow quantitative analysis of individual UvrA molecules. Moreover, the separation of monomers and dimers in these batch experiments is likely to influence the monomer-dimer equilibrium, whereas the rapid and irreversible deposition of protein onto mica for AFM analysis traps the oligomeric state of the protein in solution. The percentage of dimers that we find upon ATP hydrolysis is significantly higher than with UvrA fully occupied with ADP, indicating that the dimer is stabilized by the presence of a mixture of ADP and ATP in the protein. Most likely it is this ATP/ADP mixed form that will subsequently search the DNA for presence of damage. This mixed form could either be a symmetrical dimer with each monomer containing one ADP and one ATP or an asymmetrical dimer with one subunit containing two ADP and the other two ATP molecules.</p><p>AFM analysis of UvrA complexes on undamaged DNA revealed that UvrA binds DNA as a dimer with a strong preference for DNA ends. Most likely UvrA recognizes a DNA end as a potential damage because of partial strand separation at the end of a fragment, since the protein has been shown to have a high affinity for single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The ability to preferentially bind to DNA ends was also demonstrated for <italic>B. caldotenax</italic> UvrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), but the authors restricted their analysis to UvrA in the presence of ATP. Remarkably, we found that the percentage of complexes that bound to the ends of the undamaged DNA substrate was independent of the cofactor used. Since &#x02018;finding&#x02019; these DNA ends is expected to require multiple rounds of association and dissociation from nonspecific sites, this means that ATP binding or hydrolysis is not required for dissociation from nondamaged DNA. It has been suggested that dissociation of UvrA from undamaged sites is accompanied by monomerization of the protein dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The rapid fixation of protein&#x02013;DNA complexes for AFM analysis would allow detection of UvrA-monomers associated with DNA. However, all complexes on the DNA visualized by AFM, irrespective of their location and irrespective of the cofactor, have the size of a UvrA dimer. This suggests that UvrA dissociates from DNA as a dimer and not via a monomeric intermediate state.</p><p>In contrast to the recognition of a DNA end, the recognition of the internal located Menthol-lesion by UvrA did show cofactor dependency. Without cofactor or with ATP more than 75% of the complexes were located at the site of the damage. With ADP damage-specific binding was somewhat reduced, but still significantly higher than end binding. With ATP&#x003b3;S, however, the protein was no longer capable of discriminating between a DNA end and a damaged site, although both were still preferred over a nondamaged site. The binding specificity for the Menthol-lesion, calculated for UvrA with ATP or without cofactor is &#x0223c;3500, which is in the same order of magnitude as the binding specificity of UvrA that was calculated using bulk methods. Both with DNAse footprinting on a psoralen adduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and with nitrocellulose filter binding on UV damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), the preference for the damage versus a nondamaged site was determined to be around a factor of 1000. The observed preferential binding of UvrA to a Menthol damage in the presence of ADP and ATP&#x003b3;S (albeit with different specificity) is consistent with data obtained with a psoralen adducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The binding specificities for UvrA in the presence of these cofactors was however not determined in these studies.</p><p>The difference in cofactor requirement for specific binding to DNA damages and to DNA ends suggests a difference in the mode in which UvrA binds to these sites. The AFM images with undamaged DNA revealed that frequently complexes could be detected where one UvrA dimer has simultaneously bound to two DNA ends, irrespective of cofactor. Very likely, in these complexes each DNA end is contacted by one of the monomers, suggesting that also in the complexes where UvrA is bound to one DNA end, only one of the monomers is recognizing this DNA end. Bridging UvrA dimers could also be detected between a DNA end and an internal site, indicating that transient interaction with a nondamaged site can also occur with one monomer. In none of the images, however, simultaneous binding of UvrA to two damaged sites was observed, not even under conditions where the majority of UvrA complexes were located on the site of the lesion. We therefore propose that on an internally located lesion UvrA binds the DNA with both subunits, each monomer making contact with DNA on either side of the lesion where base pairing is reduced. The function of the cofactor in this damage specific binding would then be to position the two DNA-binding domains within the UvrA dimer. In the cofactor-free form of UvrA the contacts at the dimer interface are clearly reduced compared to the ATP/ADP mixed form, resulting in lower dimer stability. In both protein forms, however, the orientation of the two DNA-binding domains is such that they can simultaneously contact the DNA flanking a lesion. As a result the affinity for the Menthol lesion (where both subunits contact the DNA) is higher than the affinity for a DNA end (where one subunit contacts the DNA). In the ATP&#x003b3;S-bound dimer the DNA-binding domains of each subunit are not properly positioned to allow simultaneous binding within a short stretch of constrained DNA (i.e. two closely located DNA regions flanking the lesion). As a result, the ATP&#x003b3;S-containing UvrA dimer contacts the DNA at a lesion site with one subunit only, similar as on a DNA end. The conformation of the ATP&#x003b3;S-bound UvrA dimer does allow simultaneous contact of the monomers with two DNA ends, as these end-to-end bridges were also observed when this nonhydrolyzable ATP analog was present. This shows that in the ATP&#x003b3;S form the two DNA-binding regions are exposed, but since the two DNA-binding targets are not directly connected, a proper positioning of these binding regions is not needed to contact both targets simultaneously. Our model predicts that with ATP&#x003b3;S simultaneous binding to two damaged sites should be possible as well. The occurrence of damage-specific complexes with ATP&#x003b3;S, however, is too low for detection of such bridged molecules.</p><p>The fully ADP-bound form of UvrA shows an intermediate activity: both the dimer stability and damage-specific binding are reduced compared to the ATP/ADP mixed form, but still higher compared to the ATP&#x003b3;S-bound form. Most likely, the positioning of the monomers in the ADP-bound dimer is intermediate between those of the ATP&#x003b3;S- and the ATP/ADP mixed form.</p><p>The structure of the ADP-bound dimer of <italic>B. stearothermophilus</italic> UvrA has recently been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In this dimer structure, two highly conserved regions could be indicated, one in each monomer, that are rich in positively charged amino acids. Base substitutions of these amino acids resulted in mutant proteins that were disturbed in DNA binding, indicating that the positively charged regions form an important DNA-binding surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The mutant proteins were not only disturbed in damage-specific binding, but also in the binding to undamaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), which as we show in this paper mainly represents binding to DNA ends. Apparently, UvrA uses the same motif for binding to a damage or a DNA end. In the structure of the ADP-bound UvrA dimer the two DNA-binding regions are separated by about 70 &#x000c5;. This means that they are sufficiently spaced to allow binding to two DNA targets located on different DNA molecules. Until now, no structures of UvrA complexed with other cofactors are available, but it is conceivable that depending on the cofactor the two DNA-binding regions will take up different positions in the dimer thereby influencing the capacity to simultaneously interact with the DNA flanking a damage.</p><p>In summary, our data show that both the ATP/ADP mixed dimer and the cofactor free dimer can equally discriminate a lesion from an undamaged site, suggesting that the mixed cofactor composition of UvrA is not primarily associated with recognition of DNA damages. Most likely, the mixed cofactor composition is important for the subsequent step in DNA repair: loading of the UvrB protein. Analysis of UvrAB complexes containing UvrB-GFP and UvrB-YFP have shown that FRET between the UvrB proteins can only occur in the presence of ATP and not when this cofactor is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). This indicates that the cofactors in UvrA (most likely in the ATP/ADP mixed form) not only orient the two DNA-binding motifs in the UvrA dimer but also the UvrB-binding domains thereby properly positioning the two UvrB subunits with respect to each other.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp071/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO; grant number 700.52.706).
