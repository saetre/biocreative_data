All known cpn10 molecules are heptamers of seven identical subunits that are linked together by &#x003b2;-strand interactions at a large and flexible interface. Unfolding of human mitochondrial cpn10 in urea results in an unfolded heptameric state whereas GuHCl additions result in unfolded monomers. To address the role of specific interface residues in the assembly of cpn10 we prepared two point-mutated variants, in each case removing a hydrophobic residue positioned at the subunit-subunit interface.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Replacing valine-100 with a glycine (Val100Gly cpn10) results in a wild-type-like protein with seven-fold symmetry although the thermodynamic stability is decreased and the unfolding processes in urea and GuHCl both result in unfolded monomers. In sharp contrast, replacing phenylalanine-8 with a glycine (Phe8Gly cpn10) results in a protein that has lost the ability to assemble. Instead, this protein exists mostly as unfolded monomers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that valine-100 is a residue important to adopt an oligomeric unfolded state but it does not affect the ability to assemble in the folded state. In contrast, phenylalanine-8 is required for both heptamer assembly and monomer folding and therefore this mutation results in unfolded monomers at physiological conditions. Despite the plasticity and large size of the cpn10 interface, our observations show that isolated interface residues can be crucial for both the retention of a heptameric unfolded structure and for subunit folding.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Protein-protein interactions are of fundamental importance to molecular biology because they determine a wide array of protein structures and functions. In addition to heterogeneous protein-protein complexes, many proteins are oligomeric due to the association of identical subunits. In fact, the majority, 70&#x02013;80 %, of all enzymes are oligomeric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The function of quaternary structure, i.e. the arrangement of multiple subunits into an oligomer, may be to allow for cooperative effects, formation of novel active sites, provide additional stability, increase solubility or decrease osmotic pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The folding pathways of only a few oligomeric proteins (mostly dimers and tetramers) have been reported, revealing a variety of mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Some proteins display monomeric or dimeric intermediates (e.g. <italic>E. coli </italic>Trp repressor and the ATPase SecA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]) whereas other fold in apparent two-state reactions in which folding and oligomerization are coupled (e.g. P22 Arc repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). It remains a challenge to understand the way in which the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide controls both the folding of individual subunits and their assembly to higher-order quaternary structures.</p><p>The heptameric co-chaperonin protein 10 (cpn10) is an attractive model for studies of the interplay between polypeptide folding and protein-protein assembly. The primary function of the cpn10 heptamer is to assist cpn60 in folding of nonnative proteins. Upon binding to cpn60, cpn10 forms a cap covering the central cavity of cpn60, and folding of substrates (nonnative proteins) is achieved through cycles of ATP-dependent binding and dissociation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The quaternary structures of the cpn10 and cpn60 proteins appear conserved in all organisms. In addition to the well-established co-chaperonin activity, several cpn10 proteins are potent stimulators of the immune system. Despite that their structural homology, there are dramatic immunogenic differences between cpn10 proteins from different species: for instance, human and <italic>E. coli </italic>cpn10 are very poor immunogens whereas <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>and <italic>Mycobacterium leprae </italic>are strong immunogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Co-chaperonin proteins can also stimulate T lymphocyte proliferation, induce cytokine secretion, trigger apoptosis, and affect cell growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is not known what oligomeric or structural states of the cpn10 proteins are used to promote these additional, non-chaperonin functions.</p><p>Cpn10 from <italic>E. coli</italic>, GroES, is the most thoroughly studied co-chaperonin protein and a crystal structure has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Crystal structures for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>and <italic>Mycobacterium leprae </italic>cpn10 and bacteriophage T4 Gp31 proteins have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Each <italic>E. coli </italic>cpn10 subunit adopts an irregular &#x003b2;-barrel topology. The dominant interaction between the subunits in the native doughnut-like structure is an anti-parallel pairing of the first &#x003b2;-strand in one subunit and the final &#x003b2;-strand in the other subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The core residues of these strands are conserved among cpn10 proteins. According to the crystal structure of <italic>E. coli </italic>cpn10, there are also many additional, complementary interactions that stretch across the interface. The flexibility of the involved side chains, and of the backbone in these regions, contributes to the plasticity of the interface. Human mitochondrial cpn10 is 37 % identical to GroES in terms of primary structure. X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy studies have revealed human cpn10 to have a fold, with similar flexible regions, that is identical to the fold of <italic>E. coli </italic>GroES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We recently showed that human cpn10 dissociates into monomers below a concentration of approximately 3 &#x003bc;M (monomer concentration), corresponding to a &#x00394;G<sub>diss </sub>of 195 kJ/mol, heptamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This modest affinity might be linked to a significant loss of configurational entropy upon oligomerization, which would be the case if folding and assembly processes are coupled. In accord, we have found that monomeric cpn10 adopts a folded structure in solution, but that it exhibits only marginal thermodynamic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Chemically-induced unfolding using GuHCl leads to a monomeric unfolded state whereas, interestingly, non-native heptamers form when using urea as the denaturant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thermally- and chemically-induced unfolding reactions of cpn10 are fully reversible: during the equilibrium unfolding processes no other oligomeric species, except for heptamers and monomers, have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. From a biophysical point of view, it is remarkable that the cpn10 polypeptides adopt the unique heptameric structure without any misfolding, misassembly, or aggregation side reactions.</p><p>To begin to identify the role of interfacing residues for adopting the oligomeric structure, we designed two point-mutated variants of human mitochondrial cpn10. In one variant, a valine in the final &#x003b2;-strand has been replaced by glycine (Val100Gly cpn10), in the other, a phenylalanine in the N-terminal &#x003b2;-strand has been replaced by a glycine (Phe8Gly cpn10) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The biophysical behaviors of the two cpn10 variants are dramatically different. The folded state of Val100Gly cpn10 remains heptameric although it exhibits somewhat lower thermodynamic stability as compared to wild-type cpn10. This mutation, however, disrupts the unfolded oligomeric state found for wild-type cpn10 in urea. In the case of Phe8Gly cpn10, this mutation both unfolds the protein and dissociates the heptamer into mostly monomers. We conclude that despite the large and plastic subunit-subunit interface, a specific residue, like the highly conserved phenylalanine-8, can have a crucial role for both assembly of cpn10 in the unfolded state and for the folding and assembly of each subunit in the native state. Other interfacial residues, such as the non-conserved valine-100, have only modest effects on the folding of the subunits and the native oligomeric state, but still significant effects on the unfolded quaternary structure of cpn10.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structure of heptameric human mitochondrial cpn10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] with Phe8 (blue) and Val100 (red) highlighted in all subunits.

Thermal unfolding of wild-type and Val100Gly cpn10 can be monitored by changes in far-UV CD and tyrosine emission, as well as by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Regardless of the probing method, the thermal midpoint is the same for a particular protein concentration, suggesting that thermal denaturation is an apparent two-state mechanism with only folded heptamers and unfolded monomers involved (data not shown). The T<sub>m </sub>values are lower for the Val100Gly mutant as compared to those for wild-type cpn10 (for identical total protein concentrations), in accord with a decrease in monomer stability and/or subunit-subunit binding affinity in Val100Gly cpn10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Each mutant was mixed with wild-type cpn10 in various mixing ratios and thermal transitions were monitored by both tyrosine fluorescence and DSC. In all cases, the first thermal scans resulted in two transitions, corresponding to each protein's individual thermal transition, suggesting that at room temperature the cpn10 heptamers do not exchange subunits with other heptamers (or other oligomers in the case of mixing with Phe8Gly cpn10).</p><p>When Val100Gly cpn10 was mixed with wild-type cpn10, the second scans (i.e. after one cycle of heating and cooling) revealed single thermal transitions with midpoints in between the two individual T<sub>m </sub>values (examples in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The second-scan T<sub>m </sub>values depended linearly on the mixing ratio of Val100Gly to wild-type cpn10 (data not shown), as would be the case if the two cpn10 monomers mix and form new hybrid heptamers upon cooling according to the stoichiometry of monomers in solution. This finding strongly support that Val100Gly cpn10 forms native-like oligomers.</p><p>In stark contrast, second scans of Phe8Gly cpn10 mixed with wild-type cpn10 did not differ from the first thermal scans (data not shown). Second scans, again, showed a broad low T<sub>m </sub>of Phe8Gly cpn10 (at ~40&#x000b0;C) and a higher more cooperative T<sub>m </sub>for wild-type cpn10. Thus, even upon dissociation and unfolding, wild-type cpn10 subunits do not interact with Phe8Gly cpn10 subunits. One would expect a native-like Phe8Gly cpn10 monomer to have the ability to pair with at least one wild-type cpn10 monomer (C-terminus side of Phe8Gly cpn10 is not altered). Since no interactions are observed at all, this further supports that Phe8Gly cpn10 is mostly unfolded.</p></sec><sec><title>Ability of cpn10 variants to assist in substrate refolding</title><p>The functional consequence of the two cpn10 mutations was tested in a GroEL-dependent citrate synthase refolding assay <italic>in vitro</italic>. In our set up (see Methods), the presence of wild-type cpn10 results in GroEL-assisted refolding of citrate synthase to 52 &#x000b1; 4 %. This amount is similar to GroEL-assisted refolding of citrate synthase in the presence of GroES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Presence of the Val100Gly cpn10 variant resulted in substrate refolding as efficient, or slightly better, than wild-type cpn10 (62 &#x000b1; 4 % citrate synthase refolding). The Phe8Gly cpn10 variant, however, failed to assist GroEL in substrate refolding (&#x0003c; 3 % citrate synthase refolding).</p></sec><sec><title>GuHCl and urea-induced denaturation of Val100Gly cpn10</title><p>Previously we have shown (surprisingly) that the denatured state at room temperature of wild-type cpn10 strongly depends on the chaotropic agent used, urea or GuHCl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In equilibrium-unfolding experiments using GuHCl, wild-type heptameric cpn10 dissociates and unfolds in a coupled, apparent two-state (folded heptamers to unfolded monomers), process, while urea promotes unfolding but not dissociation of the cpn10 structure (folded heptamers to unfolded, or non-native, heptamers). We find that also with Val100Gly cpn10, the nature of the chemical denaturant affects the unfolding/dissociation mechanism although the final state reached is always that of unfolded monomers. Upon additions of GuHCl, far-UV CD and tyrosine emission signals of Val100Gly cpn10 change simultaneously in a two-state like reaction. Independent of Val100Gly cpn10 concentration, the equilibrium-unfolding transition midpoint occurs at ~0.7 M GuHCl (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Correlating cross-linking experiments of identical Val100Gly/GuHCl samples reveal that this cpn10 variant is heptameric during the far-UV CD and fluorescence transition, and that the monomeric species is not detected until after around 1 M GuHCl has been added (data not shown). Thus, Val100Gly cpn10 denaturation induced by GuHCl is a three-state process: polypeptide unfolding occurs at low GuHCl concentrations (detected by fluorescence and far-UV CD) and is followed by oligomer disassembly (as observed by cross-linking) at higher GuHCl concentrations. From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, we derive the free energy of heptamer unfolding without dissociation (i.e. two-state analysis of the first step: from folded to non-native heptamer) to around 12 kJ per mol of heptamer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This corresponds to a predicted &#x00394;G<sub>U</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O) of ~1.7 kJ per mol of monomer.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>A.

A protein-concentration dependence is observed in the urea-induced data as monitored by spectroscopy: the more protein present, the more stable appears the heptamer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This can be explained by an apparent two-state mechanism in which only folded heptamers and unfolded monomers are populated.

In context of such plasticity, how can heptamer specificity be achieved? To begin to address this question, we used the crystal structure of human mitochondrial cpn10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] to design two point-mutated variants. Valine-100 is situated at the end of the C-terminal &#x003b2;-strand (residues 92&#x02013;100) that pairs with the N-terminal &#x003b2;-strand (residues 7&#x02013;13) at the subunit-subunit interface in human cpn10. According to the crystal structure, this residue makes close contact with Lys-7 and Leu-9 in the neighboring subunit. The other selected residue, phenylalanine-8, interacts with residues leucine-9 and proline-10 intra-molecularly, and leucine-96 to tyrosine-99 inter-molecularly.</p><p>Our biophysical characterization shows that replacing valine-100 with glycine (Val100Gly cpn10) results in a wild-type-like heptameric protein with wild-type-like function, although the overall thermodynamic stability of the heptamer is decreased. Like wild-type cpn10, the unfolding/dissociation mechanism for Val100Gly cpn10 depends on the chemical denaturant; however the mechanisms in urea and GuHCl differ from those determined for wild-type cpn10: importantly, an unfolded heptameric state is never stable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In urea, wild-type cpn10 unfolds to a non-native heptamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Val100Gly cpn10, on the other hand, unfolds in an apparent two-state reaction from folded heptamers to unfolded monomers in urea. This can be explained by a crucial destabilization of the interface interactions in the unfolded mutant. In GuHCl, which is a stronger denaturant, wild-type cpn10 unfolds by an apparent two-state mechanism with only folded heptamers and unfolded monomers populated. GuHCl additions to Val100Gly cpn10 also result in unfolded monomers, although here a non-native heptamer is detected as an intermediate along the path. This implies that the mutation must have an effect on monomer stability as well as on the interface stability; in fact, the destabilization of the folded monomer must be larger than any destabilization of the interface in the folded state. This is supported by the thermodynamic parameters presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Comparing the K<sub>diss </sub>for heptamer dissociation of wild-type and Val100Gly cpn10 shows that the folded interface in Val100Gly cpn10 is destabilized by only ~5 %, whereas the stability of the folded monomer is destabilized by ~45 % as compared to wild-type cpn10. It is clear that valine-100, although situated on the interface, plays a role for the stability of the folded monomeric unit. In accord, valine-100 packs with Tyr-99 on the surface of the &#x003b2;-barrel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and upon its removal a destabilizing solvent channel towards the hydrophobic core may be created.</p><p>In sharp contrast to the findings on Val100Gly cpn10, upon eliminating phenylalanine-8, the heptamer never assembles and the monomers are mostly unfolded (and do not function in substrate refolding together with GroES). The phenylalanine-8 mutation thus disrupts the ability of cpn10 to fold and assemble, and it also abolishes the ability to adopt an unfolded oligomeric state. Our Phe8Gly cpn10 observations imply that either correct assembly is a prerequisite for folding of each monomer or the monomers must adopt some initial (correct) structure before correct assembly will occur. The "negative" mixing experiments between Phe8Gly cpn10 and wild-type cpn10 support the latter conclusion since, apparently, wild-type cpn10 cannot act as a template inducing structure in Phe8Gly cpn10.</p><p>The amino-acid sequences of the N- and C-terminal &#x003b2;-strands involved in subunit-subunit interactions in selected cpn10 proteins from various species have been aligned in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> (residues 7 to 13 and 92 to 100 of the human cpn10 sequence). According to the SwissPROT database, there are 86 full-length sequences that show homology to cpn10. It is clear from the comparison of all these sequences that most of the subunit-subunit interface is conserved, at least with respect to the nature of each residue at each position. The interface in human cpn10 consists of mostly hydrophobic residues (of the 16 residues shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>; 11 are non-charged, mostly hydrophobic residues). Phenylalanine-8 in human cpn10 is conserved in 25 % of the compared species, but 100 % of the 86 sequences have an aliphatic, bulky residue (either Phe, Ile, Leu, or Val) at that position. The conservation of a large, hydrophobic residue at the position of phenylalanine-8 in all cpn10 species known suggests that it plays an important structural role in all cpn10 heptamers. In contrast, valine-100 is only conserved to 5 % in the 86 compared sequences. The presence of valine-100 at the interface in human cpn10 may therefore be to tune the interface plasticity so that cpn10 interactions with cpn60 and substrates are facilitated. Such interactions will be species specific, in accord with the variability of residues found at this position across the cpn10 family members.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p><bold>A. </bold>Protein sequence alignment of cpn10 N- and C-terminal strands involved in subunit-subunit interactions.

However, mutations that disrupt oligomeric unfolded states, like the two mutants characterized here, are unprecedented. Despite the large surface area and plasticity of the cpn10 monomer-monomer interface, our findings show that isolated residues can have crucial effects on the ability to assemble. Elimination of valine-100 does not affect the assembly in the folded state, but abolishes it in the unfolded state. However, elimination of phenylalanine-8 not only disrupts assembly in the unfolded state, but also the ability of the monomers to fold. Together with data on other interface mutants, these results may shed light on the unexpected observation of a heptameric unfolded state for wild-type cpn10 and the interplay between folding and assembly in a heptameric protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of human mitochondrial cpn10</title><p>Preparation of human cpn10 from recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].
