The amino acid sequence of latherin, determined from cDNA analysis, is highly conserved across four geographically dispersed equid species (horse, zebra, onager, ass), and is similar to a family of proteins only found previously in the oral cavity and associated tissues of mammals. Latherin produces a significant reduction in water surface tension at low concentrations (&#x02264;1 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and therefore probably acts as a wetting agent to facilitate evaporative cooling through a waterproofed pelt. Neutron reflection experiments indicate that this detergent-like activity is associated with the formation of a dense protein layer, about 10 &#x000c5; thick, at the air-water interface. However, biophysical characterization (circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry) in solution shows that latherin behaves like a typical globular protein, although with unusual intrinsic fluorescence characteristics, suggesting that significant conformational change or unfolding of the protein is required for assembly of the air-water interfacial layer. RT-PCR screening revealed latherin transcripts in horse skin and salivary gland but in no other tissues. Recombinant latherin produced in bacteria was also found to be the target of IgE antibody from horse-allergic subjects. Equids therefore may have adapted an oral/salivary mucosal protein for two purposes peculiar to their lifestyle, namely their need for rapid and efficient heat dissipation and their specialisation for masticating and processing large quantities of dry food material.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Horses are flight animals that have a particular problem in dissipating heat efficiently during periods of sustained exercise. To do this they thermoregulate by producing copious amounts of sweat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Jenkinson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, a mechanism also used by humans but otherwise rare in mammals. Horses, however, have a thick, waterproofed, hairy pelt that would normally impede the rapid translocation of sweat water from the skin to the surface of the hair necessary for evaporative cooling. To solve this, horses appear to have evolved a surface-active, detergent-like protein that they release at unusually high concentrations in their sweat (human sweat is instead high in salt but low in protein). This protein, latherin, presumably acts by wetting the hairs to facilitate water flow for evaporation, the side effect of which is the lathering that is often observed on the pelts of sweating horses, especially where rubbing occurs. The best known surfactant proteins are those of the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Possmayer1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Wright1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, which also occur in other organs (ear, gut, reproductive tissues, synovium) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-McGuire1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Kankavi2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. About 90&#x00025; of lung surfactant is lipid, the remainder comprising proteins of four kinds, ranging in activity from host defence via lipopolysaccharide and carbohydrate binding to reduction in surface tension to allow expansion of lung alveoli. Surface activity is mainly attributable to SP-B, which is a small, hydrophobic protein that interacts with phospholipids to produce a surface film <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Wright1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Latherin, however, is non-glycosylated and there is no evidence that it is associated with lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Beeley1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Latherin's biophysical activity must therefore be an intrinsic property of the protein itself. This is also a notable feature of the hydrophobins of fungi, where detailed structural studies have shown that surfactant activity and wetting ability is related to significant amphiphilicity of the native protein structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Hakanpaa1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Hakanpaa3">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Many proteins can have surfactant effects, but this is usually confined to preparations of denatured protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Clarkson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, which, as we show, is not true of latherin.</p><p>Interest in biological surfactants has been steadily increasing since the 1960s when they first attracted attention as hydrocarbon dispersal agents with low toxicity and high biodegradability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Singh1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies have shown further potential for biological surfactants as antimicrobial activity or anti-adhesive agents against pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Cameotra1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Such a dual function would make sense for latherin given that the pelt of a horse could be readily colonised by microorganisms potentially harmful to both skin and the hair itself, particularly following saturation sweating that would provide ample resources for the proliferation of microorganisms.</p><p>We report here on biophysical and molecular characterization of surfactant-related properties of recombinant latherin, including the cloning of cDNAs encoding latherin from several species of equid, and show that the recombinant protein possesses strong surfactant activity associated with self-assembly of an interfacial surface layer. We further show that latherin is also produced in horse salivary glands, which is consistent with their specialisation as animals needing to masticate and process large quantities of dry food material. So, equids may have adapted an oral/salivary protein for two purposes peculiar to their lifestyle, and it may be key to their ability to sustain high levels of exercise for long periods of time. Latherin, therefore, provides insight into an unusual specialisation of a large mammal and also how proteins on their own can act as surfactants in their native folded state.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>cDNA encoding the complete precursor protein of horse (<italic>Equus caballus</italic>) latherin was obtained by RT-PCR and 5&#x02032;- and 3-RACE procedures using oligonucleotide primers based on the amino acid sequences of tryptic fragments derived by Edman degradation of latherin obtained directly from sweat-derived protein, purified as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Beeley1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and mRNA obtained from skin samples.

Most of the PLUNC/BASE family do not have the high content of leucines noted above for latherin, with a few exceptions (e.g. human PLUNC Swiss-Prot Q9NP55; Leu 23&#x00025;). Further confirmation of latherin's membership of the larger PLUNC family comes from the conserved position of its cysteines in amino acid sequence alignments with all members of that family. Moreover, an analysis of horse genomic DNA by PCR, using oligonucleotide primers flanking introns predicted from the positions of those in PLUNC genes, revealed that all the intron positions known in the latter are preserved in the latherin gene (not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-LeClair1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Mulero1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is therefore likely that Trp107 is exposed to solvent water.</p><p>This degree of exposure is unusual for tryptophan side chains, but is commonly found in membrane-inserted proteins, and has been found as so-called &#x02018;sticky fingers&#x02019; in a number of soluble proteins (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Kennedy1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>). In the latter case, such unusually positioned side chains could be involved in protein&#x02236;protein or protein&#x02236;membrane interactions. In the case of latherin, an exposed Trp side chain might be involved in protein surface hydrophobicity related to surfactant activity. Apolar surface patches in hydrophobins are considered to be key to their surface activity and also their self-assembly into higher order complexes that enhance surface activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Hakanpaa2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Hakanpaa3">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, though in rlatherin we find no evidence of hydrophobic patches detectable by ANS binding (see above).</p><p>However, an alternative explanation of the unusual intrinsic fluorescence could be that the Trp side chain of latherin is located away from bulk water, but in an unusually polar environment within the protein structure. We have attempted to clarify this using standard fluorescence quenching probes (iodide, acrylamide, succinimide), but with somewhat ambiguous results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005726-t001">Table 1</xref>). Intrinsic Trp fluorescence was reduced in the presence of quenchers, and all three probes gave linear Stern-Volmer plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005726-g002">Figure 2C</xref> inset) symptomatic of collisional quenching for a single Trp-containing protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Eftink1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Eftink3">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>; quenching parameters (K<sub>SV</sub>) are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005726-t001">Table 1</xref>. Paradoxically for a putatively exposed tryptophan side-chain, quenching was lowest with iodide &#x02013; normally considered to be most effective in quenching exposed groups, but likely to be strongly influenced by local electrostatic effects (refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Eftink1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Eftink3">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and refs therein). Neutral quenchers (acrylamide, succinimide) were much more effective, with relatively high K<sub>SV</sub> values comparable to those previously observed for proteins with relatively exposed Trp residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Eftink1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Eftink3">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, these quenching parameters were not significantly affected by either thermal or chemical denaturation of the protein (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005726-t001">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that the latherin Trp may well be in an exposed, polar environment, but protected from collisional iodide quenching by surrounding negative charges or other local sequence-specific effects. It has recently been shown that tryptophan fluorescence and its quenching can be significantly affected by local amino acids, even in small model peptides in strongly denaturing environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Alston1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Alston2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Significantly, and in contrast to previous assumptions, this work has shown that quenching by both acrylamide and iodide is highly variable and sequence dependent, with iodide quenching in particular being significantly reduced in the presence of nearby negatively-charged residues. Latherin is an acidic protein (estimated pI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4.11) and will carry a net negative charge of around &#x02212;14 at neutral pH, and this is likely to inhibit collision with I<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions by electrostatic repulsion. Moreover, Trp-107 is adjacent in sequence to an aspartate residue (Asp-105), a juxtaposition that has been shown to inhibit iodide quenching in model peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Alston2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

The 10 &#x000c5; layer thickness for latherin is similar to that observed for the adsorption of &#x003b2;-hairpin peptides on the surface of water, using the same neutron reflection methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Lu1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that, despite its apparent stability in bulk solution, latherin must undergo significant conformational change and/or partial unfolding during incorporation into the interfacial layer. This makes sense in functional terms. Soluble surfactant proteins need to reconcile surfactant activity at the site of operation with the requirement for solubility and lack of aggregation during synthesis, storage, and transport stages. Conventional (small molecule) detergents are amphiphilic and can form soluble aggregates (micelles) in solution that can readily dissociate to form surface monolayers when required. This would be a difficult strategy for protein surfactants, since the large exposed hydrophobic surfaces required at interfaces would lead to significant solubility and aggregation problems in bulk solution. Latherin may overcome this by folding as a normal globular protein in solution, with a predominantly polar outer surface giving aqueous solubility, yet with the ability to unfold at a hydrophobic/air-water interfaces to expose previously buried non-polar residues to the surface. Note that this does not necessarily require complete denaturation of the protein but simply partial unfolding and/or domain rearrangement, as observed elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Mackenzie1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.The unusually high leucine content of latherin, atypical of soluble globular proteins, may be related to this proposed surfactant mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Locations of latherin gene transcription and protein</title><p>A range of tissues was sampled from a horse, with mRNA prepared for detection of latherin transcripts by RT-PCR, and protein extracted for immunodetection using a rabbit antibody to recombinant latherin (rlatherin).

Its presence in equine sweat is consistent with a role in wetting hair and skin to allow rapid translocation and spreading of sweat water at the surface of the oily pelt for evaporative cooling. Interestingly, human skin secretions are also thought to have a surfactant-like role in enhancing the spreading of sweat water for cooling, though by a mechanism suited to an effectively hairless surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Porter1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Folk1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>). The deposition of large quantities of protein through and over the pelt of horses would seem to present the risk of providing a nutrient resource for microorganisms. It could therefore be that latherin's surface activity may also directly affect the surfaces of microbes or impede their adhesion and establishment on hair and skin. Latherin is distantly related to proteins that are directly anti-microbial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Bingle3">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, but we have been unable to detect any interaction between latherin and archetypical bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide (not shown). A function for latherin in horse saliva is less obvious, but the presence of a surfactant protein there may assist mastication and processing of large quantities of relatively dry vegetable matter, a diet for which the equids as a group are specialised, unlike ruminants (cows, sheep, etc.).</p><p>The possibility that latherin's surface-activity presents a danger to mammalian cells, however, needs to be addressed, as does the mechanism by which the intracellular membrane systems involved in synthesis, processing and export of the protein are protected from damage. A simple small molecule detergent would normally be extremely damaging to cellular membranes, but it is possible that proteins can be designed to perform detergent-like functions without endangering cell membranes. An example of this could be the strong surface activity of the proteinaceous foams in which certain tropical frogs lay their eggs, which may also have anti-microbial propensities, but are nonetheless compatible with naked eggs and spermatozoa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Cooper1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Fleming1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that latherin is specially packaged by the synthesising cells before release, and our immunohistological observations on horse skin using anti-latherin antibody indicate that the protein is localised to the protein granules of the cells in the fundus region of the sweat gland, which are known to be exocytosed directly upon sweating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Montgomery1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. At a more fundamental level, the mechanism by which small-molecule detergents solubilise lipid bilayer membranes is likely to be inapplicable to larger, surfactant proteins. Conventional (synthetic) detergents such as SDS, Triton, etc., exert their effects by formation of micelles in aqueous solution (into which lipids can be extracted) as well as by monolayer formation at the air-water interface (to reduce surface tension). In contrast, although specific surfactant proteins do partition into the air-water interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005726-Cooper1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, their size and (presumably) structure precludes any equivalent of micelle formation in the bulk solution, therefore minimizing disruption of lipid bilayers.</p><p>There are now several different classes of protein that exhibit biologically relevant, intrinsic surface-activity, including latherin, the hydrophobins and frog foam nest foam proteins (ranaspumins). It would be valuable to know what structural characteristics separate or unify these proteins so as to extend our understanding of how proteins can do what they do. In the case of latherin, we are fortunate that it can be produced in soluble recombinant form in bacteria, and we have already obtained high quality protein NMR spectra as a preliminary to solving its solution structure (R.E. MacDonald, A. Cooper, B.O. Smith and M.W. Kennedy, unpublished). A structure for latherin may also improve our understanding of the PLUNC and BASE proteins, some of which may also possess intrinsic surface activity in order to operate in mucosal surfaces. Meanwhile, in the absence of indications that PLUNC family members are produced in mammalian skin, latherin may represent a remarkable adaptation of a salivary protein for heat dissipation from skin by horses and their ilk, and a readily available protein with which to study intrinsic surface activity of a naturally folded protein from a mammal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>All tissue samples used in the study were collected from animals that died from, or were euthanised for, clinical causes entirely unconnected to the investigation, and with permission from the owners, and for which no formal ethical permission is required under UK Home Office regulations.

The choice of the number of sublayers in the model depended upon the extent of inhomogeneity across the interface, but a single-layer model was sufficient to fit the data adequately here.

Method: Small droplets (10, 20, 50 &#x000b5;l) of recombinant latherin solution, together with similar droplets of water and a non-surfactant control protein (hen egg white lysozyme, 1 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in water), were placed on the surface of strip of Nescofilm&#x000ae; sheet. After a few minutes, each drop was carefully blotted off using a tip of absorbent paper towel. The film was then stained for adsorbed protein by brief immersion in Coomassie Blue staining solution (BioRad), followed by rinsing with water. Each stage was photographed by digital camera. The scale is indicated by the centimetre rule. Result: Neither water nor control protein solution showed any evidence of residual surface wetting. However, as illustrated in Figure S2, after blotting, the latherin droplets left clear wet patches on the Nescofilm surface that subsequently stained positive for adsorbed protein. Separate experiments (not shown) confirmed that these surface layers were not permanent, but could be rinsed off easily with water prior to staining.
