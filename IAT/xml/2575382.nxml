In comparison, 2-nt mutations outside the seed region have modest effects on <italic>mir-181a-1</italic> activity. The M4, M5, M7, M10, and M11 mutants show a slight reduction in activity.

In this study, we have examined the activities of miRNA genes, which may be contributed by one or more of the RNAs (mature miRNAs and their precursors) made from these miRNA genes, not the activities of mature miRNAs alone. Although siRNA duplexes have been shown to function as miRNA surrogates to target gene repression when transfected into mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Doench1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, mature miRNAs delivered into cultured cells by transfection are diluted quickly during cell expansion, prohibiting their use in long-term T cell development culture assays. Thus, we were unable to quantitatively measure whether transfected mature miRNAs might be functionally equivalent to RNAs produced from miRNA genes. Furthermore, given the complex small RNA sorting pathways in animal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Steiner1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Forstemann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, we have not attempted to determine the efficiency of transfected miRNAs being incorporating into the pathways used by corresponding miRNA genes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>It is also important to emphasize that limited conclusions can be drawn by correlating the changes in mature miRNA levels to the activities of corresponding mutant miRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003592-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003592-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003592-g006">6</xref>). We believe that such analyses can only establish correlations, but not causal relationships, between the levels of mature miRNA expression and the activity of miRNA genes. However, strong and positive correlations would support that pre-miRNA loop nucleotides control the activity of miRNA genes by influencing mature miRNA levels, whereas negative or inconsistent correlations would disfavor such idea. Most importantly, miRNA genes make at least three RNA species, including pri-miRNA, pre-miRNA, or mature miRNA, prohibiting us from definitively attributing miRNA gene functions to one of these RNAs in the T cell assays. Moreover, the complex regulatory steps in the miRNA biogenesis pathways and during early T cell development may also compromise the robustness of such correlation analyses. Finally, we cannot determine whether alterations in pre-miRNA loop sequences affect all or only selected cognate targets. Since multi-target regulation is required for the <italic>mir-181a-1</italic> function in T cells and the ectopic expression of a single miR-181a insensitive target is sufficient to block the function of the <italic>mir-181a-1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Li1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that pre-miRNA loop nucleotides only contribute to the regulation of one or a few targets among those that are regulated by the <italic>mir-181a/c</italic> or their mutants.</p><p>Nevertheless, based on the functional importance of various nucleotides in <italic>mir-181a-1</italic> genes, we may postulate some mechanisms by which pre-miRNA loop nucleotides control the activities of miRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003592-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Pre-miRNA loops might influence miRNA function by controlling the processing of pri-miRNAs into pre-miRNAs, the transport and sub-cellular localization of pre-miRNAs, the processing of pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs, or the loading of mature miRNAs into RISCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Steiner1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Kawahara1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, animal cells are thought to have multiple RISCs with distinct Argonatue proteins (AGO1&#x02013;4). If pre-miRNA loops play a role in guiding small RNAs into various RISCs, which might have different efficiencies in gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Steiner1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Forstemann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, then mature miRNA levels would not necessarily correlate with the function of the miRNA genes.

Finally, recent studies have shown that LIN-28 may recognize the pre-let-7 loop nucleotides and block the processing of human pri-let-7 RNAs into mature miRNAs in embryonic stem cells, suggesting that pre-miRNA loops may be recognized by LIN-28 or LIN-28-like RNA binding factors that control mature miRNA biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Viswanathan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Newman1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Definitively addressing this question is vital to understanding of the mechanisms by which miRNA genes control gene expression. One possibility is that pri-miRNAs and/or pre-miRNAs may have functional roles in target gene regulation before they are further processed. Supporting this idea, our findings demonstrate that pri-miRNAs and pre-miRNAs contain not only the mature miRNA sequences that can pair with cognate target sites, but also the loop nucleotides that are important for the activity and functional specificity of miRNA genes. Moreover, pre-miRNA-like stem-loop structures have been shown to be a common module for intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Tomizawa1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003592-Eguchi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

All mice were maintained at the Stanford University School of Medicine animal facility and treated in accordance with the Stanford University Laboratory Animal Care guidelines.
