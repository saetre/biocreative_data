One possibility is that they possess self-specific activation receptors that result in hyporesponsiveness unless modulated by self&#x02013;major histocompatability complex (MHC)&#x02013;specific inhibitory receptors. As putative self-specific activation receptors have not been well characterized, we studied a transgenic C57BL/6 mouse that ubiquitously expresses m157 (m157-Tg), which is the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)&#x02013;encoded ligand for the Ly49H NK cell activation receptor. The transgenic mice were more susceptible to MCMV infection and were unable to reject m157-Tg bone marrow, suggesting defects in Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells. There was a reversible hyporesponsiveness of Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells that extended to Ly49H-independent stimuli. Continuous Ly49H&#x02013;m157 interaction was necessary for the functional defects. Interestingly, functional defects occurred when mature wild-type NK cells were adoptively transferred to m157-Tg mice, suggesting that mature NK cells may acquire hyporesponsiveness. Importantly, NK cell tolerance caused by Ly49H&#x02013;m157 interaction was similar in NK cells regardless of expression of Ly49C, an inhibitory receptor specific for a self-MHC allele in C57BL/6 mice. Thus, engagement of self-specific activation receptors in vivo induces an NK cell tolerance effect that is not affected by self-MHC&#x02013;specific inhibitory receptors.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: LAK, lymphokine-activated killer; m157-Tg, m157 transgenic; MCMV, murine cytomegalovirus; poly I:C, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>NK cell activation receptors play important roles in both viral infection and tumor surveillance. One such activation receptor, Ly49H, accounts for genetic resistance to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Coupled to the DAP12 signaling chain, Ly49H is expressed on a subset of NK cells in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) and recognizes the MCMV-encoded m157 molecule, a glycophosphatidylinositol-linked protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). To date, m157 is the only known ligand for the Ly49H receptor, and in C57BL/6 mice only Ly49H interacts with m157.</p><p>Activated NK cells release proinflammatory cytokines and cytolytic granules that can ultimately destroy the susceptible target cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). These potent effector responses must be controlled, as NK cells must recognize and distinguish the abnormal cells that they destroy from normal self-tissues that are spared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). One mechanism to prevent aberrant NK cell activation involves inhibitory receptors specific for MHC class I molecules on target cells. Engagement of these inhibitory receptors delivers negative signals, explaining the &#x0201c;missing self&#x0201d; hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). In general, the integration of both positive and negative stimuli determines if an NK cell becomes activated during effector responses.</p><p>The MHC class I&#x02013;specific inhibitory receptors also appear to have another function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Engagement of inhibitory Ly49 receptors by their cognate MHC class I ligands, expressed as self-MHC, allows NK cells to acquire functional competence to be triggered through their activation receptors. In this process, termed licensing, the self-MHC class I&#x02013;specific inhibitory receptors appear to signal the licensing event because their cytoplasmic domains, specifically the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Though further understanding of its mechanism is required, most groups now agree that the engagement of inhibitory receptors by self-MHC class I plays an important role in acquisition of NK cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><p>At least two major models have been proposed to account for the role of the self-MHC class I&#x02013;specific receptors in licensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). One model (&#x0201c;arming&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;stimulatory&#x0201d; model) suggests that the inhibitory receptor directly signals the licensing event. Another model (&#x0201c;disarming&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;inhibitory&#x0201d; model) suggests that, when unimpeded, a self-specific activation receptor results in a &#x0201c;hyporesponsive&#x0201d; state, akin to peripheral T cell anergy. The self-MHC class I&#x02013;specific inhibitory receptor is postulated to modulate the function of the activation receptor and thereby allows licensing to occur. Current data do not allow conclusive discrimination between these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). To more fully understand the potential contribution of self-specific NK cell activation receptors to NK cell tolerance and to begin testing the disarming (inhibitory receptor) model for licensing, we borrowed a strategy that was critical for detailed characterization of B and T cell tolerance, i.e., the generation of transgenic mice expressing ligands for the BCR and TCR, respectively. For example, a foreign antigen (hen egg lysozyme) expressed in this context is perceived by the immune system as &#x0201c;self,&#x0201d; allowing further elucidation of B cell self-tolerance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). This transgenic strategy was required because there are few other NK cell activation receptors where the ligands are unequivocally defined and are not present in normal mice. Herein, we generated mice on the C57BL/6 background that ubiquitously expresses m157. These mice displayed a defect in NK cell function that is manifested in vivo by increased susceptibility to MCMV infection, as well as an inability to reject m157-transgenic (m157-Tg) BM cell transplants. The data indicate that the persistent engagement of self-activation receptors influences the functional status of the mature NK cell.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Production of m157 transgenic mice</title><p>We generated a transgenic construct for expression of m157 under the control of the human &#x003b2;-actin promoter (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072446/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072446/DC1</ext-link>). The construct was directly injected into C57BL/6-derived fertilized ova. Transgenic founders were identified by PCR genotyping, as was the cell surface expression of m157 on peripheral blood lymphocytes and BM cells. The m157-Tg mice were phenotypically normal and healthy. Their growth and development were similar to their nontransgenic (WT) littermates. As compared with WT mice, they had similar numbers of splenocytes and there were no significant differences in the percentages of B or T cells (Fig. S2 and not depicted). Thus, even though the m157-Tg mice expressed the ligand for the Ly49H activation receptor, they did not display any overt signs of autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec><title>m157-Tg mice are defective in MCMV control and BM rejection</title><p>Because the Ly49H receptor plays a vital role in susceptibility to MCMV infection, we assessed responses to MCMV infection in vivo. After injection of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV, &#x0003c;50% of the m157-Tg mice survived, with deaths beginning around the time of onset of lethality in genetically susceptible BALB/c mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast, all of the WT C57BL/6 littermates survived. In addition, infected m157-Tg mice displayed significantly higher splenic MCMV titers at 3 d after infection compared with WT littermates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The m157-Tg mice had splenic viral titers comparable to susceptible BALB/c mice. To determine if mature m157-Tg splenocytes were defective in controlling MCMV outside the context of an m157-Tg mouse, we performed adoptive transfer experiments in neonatal mice whereby transferred splenocytes provide NK cell&#x02013;dependent resistance to MCMV infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). However, neonatal mice were not protected by adoptively transferred m157-Tg splenocytes, similar to PBS-treated controls, whereas WT splenocytes provided a significant increase in survival (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that m157-Tg mice behave similarly to BALB/c mice lacking <italic>Ly49h</italic>, and m157-Tg splenocytes are less efficient than their WT counterparts in controlling MCMV infection, suggesting a defect in m157-Tg Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Increased mortality and splenic titers in m157-Tg mice infected with MCMV.</bold> (A) Survival curve after MCMV infection.

The spleens were harvested on day three after infection, and viral titers were determined with a standard viral plaque assay. The results are presented as Log PFU/spleen (mean &#x000b1; SEM).

The percentage of mice surviving within each group was determined daily. These data are a combination of two separate experiments, each of which showed similar results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051829f01"></graphic></fig><p>The presence of normal hematopoiesis in the m157-Tg mice suggested that the m157-Tg BM either did not express m157 or the Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells were tolerized in the m157-Tg mice. The observation that m157 was detected on the surface of BM cells derived from m157-Tg mice (Fig. S1) suggests that Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells in m157-Tg mice were tolerized. To further evaluate this possibility, we performed BM transplantation experiments. It has been previously demonstrated that irradiation-resistant NK cells can reject MHC-deficient BM grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) or BM-expressing ligands for an activation receptor such as NKG2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Similar to these results, we found that the engraftment of m157-Tg BM was lower than WT BM in WT mice, at every BM dose (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Although engraftment of m157-Tg BM was never as low as &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BM, rejection by WT mice was prevented by depletion of NK cells with the anti-NK1.1 mAb or administration of the nondepleting anti-Ly49H mAb (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Therefore, these experiments demonstrate that WT Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells recognize m157 on m157-Tg BM cells, and that WT rejection of m157-Tg BM was NK cell dependent, and more specifically, Ly49H dependent.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>WT, but not m157-Tg, mice reject m157-Tg BM transplants.</bold> (A) WT C57BL/6 recipient mice were lethally irradiated, and then injected i.v. with the indicated number of donor WT (&#x025a1;), m157-Tg (&#x025cb;), or &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (&#x025b5;) donor BM cells. <sup>125</sup>I-deoxyuridine uptake was measured in the spleen as an index of engraftment.

To study this further, lethally irradiated m157-Tg mice were injected with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> BM cells from m157-Tg mice. The m157-Tg mice, unlike WT mice, failed to reject BM cells from m157-Tg donors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Of note, the m157-Tg mice were still able to reject &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BM (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072446/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072446/DC1</ext-link>). This is likely explained by a role for Ly49H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells (which do not interact with m157) that probably participate in the rejection of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>m<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BM. Taken together with the MCMV experiments, these data indicate a defect in the response of m157-Tg Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells to m157-expressing targets (either on MCMV-infected cells or on m157-Tg BM).</p></sec><sec><title>Down-regulation of Ly49H in vivo</title><p>There are many potential explanations for the apparent dysfunction of the Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells in the m157-Tg mice. To investigate these defects further, we analyzed the expression of Ly49H on the surface of peripheral blood and splenic NK cells in numerous founders. In all m157-Tg mice examined, there was a slight decrease in the measured percentage and number of Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and Fig. S2). This was specific to the Ly49H receptor because the expression of other Ly49 receptors (Ly49D, Ly49A, Ly49C, Ly49G, and Ly49I) and NKG2D were unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> and not depicted). As the total number of NK cells was only modestly changed, these data suggest that the majority of Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells were not deleted (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072446/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072446/DC1</ext-link>). Comparable effects on Ly49H expression were seen in the BM (Fig. S5).

Moreover, they did not express the CD69 activation marker (not depicted). Thus, even though decreased cell surface expression of Ly49H implied engagement with m157, the NK cells appeared to be mature and did not appear to be activated, which is consistent with an &#x0201c;anergic&#x0201d; or hyporesponsive phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional defects of Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells from m157-Tg mice</title><p>To further explore the hyporesponsive phenotype, we studied the function of Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells from m157-Tg mice in vitro.

Generally, WT Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells were somewhat better responders to anti-NK1.1 than WT Ly49H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells, an observation that was not previously reported in WT mice, but may be related to the propensity of NK cells that express one NK cell activation receptor to express another simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). To explore this further in terms of the m157-Tg mice, we compared the ratio of IFN-&#x003b3; production by Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells versus Ly49H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). When splenocytes were stimulated with cells stably transfected with m157 (RMAs-m157) or by anti-NK1.1, the ratio was significantly lower for m157-Tg NK cells than for WT cells. Moreover, similar results were seen with Chinese hamster ovary and YAC targets. Though the defect was not as severe, Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells from m157-Tg mice also produced less IFN-&#x003b3; than Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from WT mice upon stimulation with IL-12 and -18 (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072446/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072446/DC1</ext-link>).

In WT mice, regardless of whether the freshly isolated NK cells were Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or Ly49H<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, anti-NK1.1 induced a higher percentage of the Ly49C<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population to produce IFN-&#x003b3; than the Ly49C<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>), which is consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).

Similar results were observed by Sun and Lanier using retroviral-transduced expression of m157 in BM stem cells (see Sun and Lanier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>] on p. <related-article related-article-type="article-reference" vol="205" page="1819" id="N0x1a39e40N0x1d87bd0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="18606858" ext-link-type="pubmed">1819</related-article> of this issue). Any differences between our results and theirs could be related to the means by which m157 was expressed. In the studies described here, the defect in Ly49H function was reversible and independent of the level of Ly49H expressed and the percentage of Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells in the m157-Tg mice.</p><p>The hyporesponsiveness in Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cell function was of two types, with one specifically involving only the Ly49H pathway. The second extended beyond stimulation through the Ly49H receptor because we also observed global defects in signaling by other activation receptors that do not signal through Ly49H and DAP12, and use other signaling chains, as well as responses to cytokines, such as IL-12 and -18. Moreover, stimuli that bypass proximal activation signals could equally stimulate normal and hyporesponsive cells, suggesting that the signaling defect is distal to the signaling chains, but upstream of signals mimicked by PMA and ionomycin. It is possible that continuous engagement of Ly49H with m157 results in negative feedback that leads to the down-regulation of not only Ly49H but also downstream signaling molecules (e.g., protein tyrosine kinases) that are shared by multiple activation pathways. Alternatively, continuous engagement of Ly49H with m157 could result in the sequestration of downstream signaling molecules that are shared by multiple activation receptor pathways. In this manner, NK cells could be rendered hyporesponsive to multiple activation pathways. Clearly, future studies will need to be performed to identify the mechanisms of global hyporesponsiveness. Regardless of the mechanism, these data, taken together with data from Sun and Lanier and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), lend strong support to the hypothesis that an activation receptor with specificity for a self-ligand can confer a generalized state of hyporesponsiveness to the NK cell, as previously hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, our data suggest that hyporesponsiveness can occur when mature Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells are exposed to m157. Even when they developed in a ligandless environment, WT Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells became hyporesponsive when transferred into the m157-Tg mice. We examined NK cells 9 d after transfer when the cells had down-regulated Ly49H expression, but were no longer making IFN-&#x003b3; at baseline, suggesting that they specifically became hyporesponsive by engagement of Ly49H, and that maturation in the m157-Tg environment was not necessary to demonstrate the hyporesponsive phenotype. This surprising result requires additional examination because it also suggests that WT NK cells may show a state of hyporesponsiveness after activation receptor triggering during a normal innate immune response.</p><p>In the m157-Tg NK cells, the global functional hyporesponsiveness had in vivo consequences because MCMV control and m157-Tg BM rejection were affected. Although it is possible that responses of m157-Tg mice after MCMV infection are partially a result of the decreased Ly49H expression on NK cells, hyporesponsiveness of the Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells likely also plays a major role. Our in vitro data corroborate our in vivo findings, indicating an NK cell functional impairment, as we demonstrate a defect in the Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells to produce IFN-&#x003b3; in response to Ly49H-mediated as well as non-Ly49H&#x02013;mediated stimuli. Furthermore, LAK cells from m157-Tg mice were defective in killing m157-expressing targets, even when normalized for the number of Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells.</p><p>Of note, the global effects of Ly49H engagement could be overcome by cytokines in certain situations (high levels of IL-2 in vitro), but not in others, such as poly I:C administration. The inability to reverse the global hyporesponsiveness of Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells with poly I:C is relevant to MCMV infections because poly I:C induces Toll-like receptor stimulation of dendritic cells, resulting in type I IFN release and concomitant NK cell stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). A similar pathway is activated in MCMV infections and is required for NK cell control of MCMV, even when Ly49H is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Thus, hyporesponsiveness through an activation receptor may not be overcome by certain proinflammatory cytokines, accounting for the persistent defect in MCMV clearance in the m157-Tg mice despite host production of cytokines during infection.</p><p>Functional hyporesponsiveness appeared to require continued receptor&#x02013;ligand interaction. Persistent in vivo interaction in trans was sufficient for global Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cell hyporesponsiveness, as revealed by our BM chimeric mouse experiments and adoptive transfer of mature WT NK cells. Interestingly, hyporesponsiveness caused by trans effects was reversed during in vitro culture with IL-2. For example, if the NK cells did not express m157, such as NK cells from WT&#x02192;m157-Tg BM chimeric mice, then in vitro culture in IL-2 reversed hyporesponsiveness. On the other hand, selective hyporesponsiveness of the Ly49H pathway persisted even in the presence of high doses of IL-2 if we used m157-Tg NK cells in which receptor&#x02013;ligand interactions likely continued via cis effects or trans interactions with neighboring cells. The putative cis effects may be another example by which such interactions could affect NK cell receptor function as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) and reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). In either case, these persistent effects on Ly49H function did not appear to be caused by lowered levels of Ly49H expression because nearly equal levels of Ly49H were seen when WT and m157-Tg NK cells were cultured in vitro. Collectively, these data indicate that the NK cell hyporesponsive state can be manifested by the presence of the ligand in trans and potentially in cis, and may be affected by the cytokine milieu, but persistent interactions between activation receptor and its ligand may result in permanent hyporesponsiveness of the given activation receptor pathway.</p><p>There are some similarities, but also notable differences between our current study and previous investigations of mice with transgenic expression of ligands for another NK cell activation receptor, NKG2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In transgenic mice constitutively expressing Rae-1&#x003b5; or MICA, down-regulation of NKG2D and generalized defects in NK cell function were observed. Moreover, trans effects on NKG2D were noted through examination of mice with tissue-specific expression of Rae-1&#x003b5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). These results are similar to the Ly49H down-regulation and the defects in the Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells in m157-Tg mice that were observed both by us and by Sun and Lanier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). However, in the Rae-1&#x003b5; and MICA-Tg models, all NK cells were altered with potential contributions from soluble NKG2D ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In contrast, in the m157-Tg mice, only the Ly49H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subset of NK cells was altered, indicating a specific effect caused by receptor engagement. In addition, there was no evidence for soluble m157 (unpublished data). Furthermore, it is possible that other immune cells expressing NKG2D may have contributed to the NKG2D functional effects noted in vivo in the Rae-1&#x003b5; or MICA-Tg mice. For example, there was increased susceptibility to squamous cell cancers in the Rae-1&#x003b5;-Tg mice and increased susceptibility of MICA-Tg mice to MICA-expressing tumors, but tumor resistance in these models can also be mediated by &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T cells and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells that express NKG2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Similarly, there was increased susceptibility of the MICA-Tg mice to <italic>Listeria</italic> infection, but dysfunction of other cell types, such as NKG2D-expressing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, may contribute to the phenotype observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).</p><p>NKG2D and its ligands have additional layers of complexity. Mouse NKG2D is expressed on all NK cells in two different isoforms, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>) and two different signaling molecules (DAP12 and DAP10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Also, mouse NKG2D has multiple endogenous ligands, including those that are constitutively expressed as well as being up-regulated on &#x0201c;stressed&#x0201d; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). In addition, NKG2D ligands can be expressed as soluble forms that modulate NKG2D function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Finally, NKG2D itself is expressed on non-NK cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). Thus, although prior studies of NKG2D ligand-Tg mice demonstrate NKG2D-induced hyporesponsiveness, our current studies demonstrate that the in vivo functional effects of persistent activation receptor interactions, specifically on NK cell functions (because Ly49H is expressed only on NK cells), has no known endogenous ligands, and that m157 does not display any detectable binding to other cells in C57BL/6 mice.</p><p>Previous work has also demonstrated that Ly49D<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells appear to be defective in mice expressing H2D<sup>d</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), a putative ligand for Ly49D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). However, physical interaction between Ly49D and H2D<sup>d</sup> has been difficult to detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>), suggesting that H2D<sup>d</sup> may not be a Ly49D ligand or that other, as yet undefined, parameters affect H2D<sup>d</sup> binding to Ly49D. In addition, H2D<sup>d</sup> is recognized by other Ly49 inhibitory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>), suggesting that its effect on Ly49D<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells could be caused by other receptor&#x02013;ligand interactions. On the other hand, the Ly49H-m157 interaction exploited for the studies reported here does not appear to be subject to these concerns.</p><p>Our studies also provide additional insight into the issue of NK cell tolerance with respect to MHC class I because we provide a test of the &#x0201c;disarming&#x0201d; model. Herein, we demonstrated that licensing (engagement of inhibitory Ly49 receptor with self-MHC class I molecules) could not overcome the hyporesponsiveness caused by engagement of the activation receptor Ly49H with its ligand (m157) expressed as self. However, it is theoretically possible that licensing could overcome the activation receptor-induced hyporesponsive state if the interactions between the activation receptor and its ligand, or between the relevant inhibitory receptor and MHC class I, were either decreased or increased, respectively. For example, affinity differences could modulate the resultant functional competence of the NK cell, although recent biophysical studies indicate that the affinity of Ly49H for m157 approximates that of Ly49 receptors for MHC class I ligands (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003d; &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Similarly, it is possible that the expression levels of the relevant receptors and ligands could affect avidity, or the simultaneous participation of several different receptors on an individual NK cell may be relevant. However, the current data suggest that hyporesponsiveness induced by a self-specific activation receptor may be difficult to overcome by licensing through a self-MHC class I&#x02013;specific inhibitory receptor, i.e., the data currently do not support the disarming model.</p><p>Nevertheless, the interactions of activation receptors with their self-specific ligands do result in NK cell tolerance. Perhaps this represents another mechanism for self-tolerance, distinct from licensing by self-MHC via the &#x0201c;arming&#x0201d; model. NK cell tolerance would therefore be achieved by multiple mechanisms, somewhat analogous to central versus peripheral tolerance for T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>), for example. Clearly, further studies are warranted because NK cell tolerance for self appears to be more complex than originally conceptualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>C56BL/6 mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD).
