Unlike many other silencing factors, depletion of MOM1 evokes transcription at selected loci without major changes in DNA methylation or histone modification. These loci retain unusual, bivalent chromatin properties, intermediate to both euchromatin and heterochromatin. The structure of MOM1 previously suggested an integral nuclear membrane protein with chromatin-remodeling and actin-binding activities. Unexpected results presented here challenge these presumed MOM1 activities and demonstrate that less than 13&#x00025; of MOM1 sequence is necessary and sufficient for TGS maintenance. This active sequence encompasses a novel <underline>C</underline>onserved <underline>M</underline>OM1 <underline>M</underline>otif <underline>2</underline> (CMM2). The high conservation suggests that CMM2 has been the subject of strong evolutionary pressure. The replacement of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CMM2 by a poplar motif reveals its functional conservation. Interspecies comparison suggests that MOM1 proteins emerged at the origin of vascular plants through neo-functionalization of the ubiquitous eukaryotic CHD3 chromatin remodeling factors. Interestingly, despite the divergent evolution of CHD3 and MOM1, we observed functional cooperation in epigenetic control involving unrelated protein motifs and thus probably diverse mechanisms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Epigenetic regulation of transcription usually involves changes in histone modifications, as well as DNA methylation changes in plants and mammals. Previously, we found an exceptional epigenetic regulator in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, MOM1, acting independently of these epigenetic marks. Interestingly, MOM1 controls loci associated with bivalent chromatin marks, intermediate to active euchromatin and silent heterochromatin. Such bivalent marks are often associated with newly inserted and/or potentially active transposons, silent transgenes, and certain chromosomal loci. Notably, bivalent chromatin seems to be characteristic for embryonic stem cells, where such loci change their activity and determination of epigenetic marks during cell differentiation. Here, we provide evidence that in vascular plants, the MOM1-like proteins evolved from the ubiquitous eukaryotic chromatin remodeling factor CHD3. The domains necessary for CHD3 function degenerated in MOM1, became dispensable for its gene silencing activity, and were replaced by a novel, unrelated domain providing silencing function. Therefore, MOM1-like proteins use a different silencing mechanism compared to the ancestral CHD3s. In spite of this divergent evolution, CHD3 and MOM1 seem to retain a functional cooperation in control of transcriptionally silent loci. Our results provide an unprecedented example of an evolutionary path for epigenetic components resulting in increased complexity of an epigenetic regulatory network characteristic for multicellular eukaryotes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>TGS heritably suppresses transcription of repetitive elements, transgenes and chromosomal genes and is generally associated with repressive histone marks and hypermethylation of DNA.

The protein lacks all features previously considered important, except the NLS. MOM1-related proteins containing this new motif are present in the genomes of vascular plants but not in the mosses. Closer comparison of MOM1 orthologs suggests that MOM1 diverged, during the evolution of vascular plants, from the CHD3 chromatin remodeling factors common to many eukaryotes. We provide evidence that the two proteins are still able to cooperate in the control of TGS, despite the divergent evolution associated with the creation of a novel, MOM1-specific gene silencing domain and the degeneration of domains essential for CHD3 function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MOM1 Has Three Novel, Conserved Motifs</title><p>Earlier homology searches with MOM1 identified no other conserved sequences than the SNF2 domain and an actin-binding region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000165-Amedeo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

For this and the subsequent assays we used transgenic complementation tests of two <italic>mom1</italic> mutant alleles: <italic>mom1-1</italic> (MOM1<sup>&#x00394;1633&#x02013;2001</sup>) discussed above and <italic>mom1-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000165-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000165-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

We have also demonstrated that a &#x0201c;miniMOM1&#x0201d;, comprising 22 N-terminal amino acids, an NLS and 197 amino acids including CMM2, retains silencing activity, as reflected by drastically reduced levels of TSI expression and almost complete transcriptional suppression at a transgenic GUS locus. Therefore, minor contribution of the N-terminal part of MOM1 to its silencing activity seems to be apparent. In addition, a drastic reduction in protein size leading to alterations in physical properties (e.g. a predicted isoelectric point of 5.2 for MOM1 and 8.8 for &#x0201c;miniMOM1&#x0201d; and a change in net charge from &#x02212;62 to &#x0002b;4.3) can also contribute to the incomplete silencing mediated by &#x0201c;miniMOM&#x0201d;. Nevertheless, the results of MOM1 deletion analysis and the successful replacement of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CMM2 by the CMM2 of poplar provide strong evidence that CMM2 is the most critical element of the MOM1 protein for its silencing function, not only in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> but also in other plants. Obviously other domains, also these clearly dispensable for TSI and transgene silencing, may still be required for epigenetic regulation at other, as yet unidentified, target loci.</p><p>Although, MOM1 proteins are CHD3 derivatives, the domains shared with CHD3 chromatin remodeling factors apparently became obsolete after the acquisition of CMM2. This is also evident for <italic>Pt</italic>MOM1, which has a structure largely similar to CHD3 proteins. For example, the SNF2 domain of <italic>Pt</italic>MOM1, shown to be critical for the function of CHD3 proteins, acquired mutations of conserved amino acids essential for CHD3 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000165-Ogas1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000165-Khattak1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000165-Sugiyama1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000165.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Several indispensable amino acids are replaced in MOM1 homologs from different plant species and, remarkably, these replacements are identical in MOM1 proteins from different plant species. It is difficult to provide a simple explanation for this unusual sequence drift since the loss of remodeling functions of SNF2 should not be under a direct, strong selection pressure for particular types of mutations. In any case, the pattern of these mutations provides specific signatures to MOM1 SNF2 domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000165.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000165.s006">S6</xref>) and suggests that acquisition of CMM2 and degeneration of SNF2 occurred in species ancestral to vascular plants. The SNF2 domain of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MOM1 underwent the most drastic alterations due to an internal deletion. This relatively recent event seems to be accompanied by the formation of the RS1 sequence duplication. Alignment of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and poplar sequences flanking RS1 suggests that extensive deletion and the formation of RS1 removed not only part of the SNF2 domain but also a PHD finger and chromodomains. Clearly, this event provides the best illustration of the dispensability also of the PHD finger, and chromodomain for the MOM1 silencing function.</p><p>CHD3 proteins of human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, known as Mi-2, act as components of a multi-subunit chromatin repression complex NuRD (<underline>Nu</underline>cleosome <underline>R</underline>emodelling and <underline>D</underline>eacetylating), which combines nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylation activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000165-Tong1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000165-Bouazoune1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, there is little evidence at present for the involvement of chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylation in PKL-mediated gene repression.</p><p>The exact mechanism of MOM1-mediated silencing is not known, but MOM1 and PKL both seem to contribute to transcriptional suppression or restriction of levels of ectopic reactivation of TSI transcription. The multilayer nature of epigenetic regulation and the necessity for backup mechanisms have been documented recently for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene silencing associated with DNA methylation changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000165-Mathieu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in this case, interaction between the major and evolutionary highly conserved gene silencing mechanisms, such as DNA and histone methylation, was investigated and the backup deficiencies were found to have very drastic developmental consequences indicative of the destabilization of central epigenetic functions. The effects of <italic>pkl</italic> or <italic>mom1</italic> and the combination of these mutations have much more subtle effects. This can be explained by the characteristics of MOM1 targets and their association with bivalent epigenetic marks. The number of such loci is low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000165-Habu1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and their reactivation is likely controlled at multiple levels, as illustrated here by the cooperative activities of MOM1 and PKL. It is remarkable that despite the clearly divergent evolution of MOM1 in terms of protein properties, it has retained its functional relationship to the CHD3 proteins. The CHD3 origin of MOM1 and the silencing in cooperation with PKL suggest that MOM1 function is also linked to histone acetylation changes. Although global changes in histone acetylation properties were not observed in <italic>mom1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000165-Probst1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, more subtle target-specific acetylation changes cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Whatever the precise molecular mechanism(s) of heritable transcriptional repression mediated by MOM1 might be, it is remarkable that increasing complexity of epigenetic gene regulation has resulted from the emergence of supplementary and cooperating levels and/or mechanisms of epigenetic control. Genomic or cDNA sequences encoding CMM2 are present in many species of vascular plants, even as distant as club-moss <italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic>, pine <italic>Pinus taeda</italic> and various monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. Remarkably, we failed to detect CMM2 in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> or in green algae <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, although the sequences of both genomes are complete (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/</ext-link>). Therefore, it appears that the emergence of CMM2, and thus MOM1 proteins, coincided with the appearance of vascular plants. Since MOM1-related proteins are not present outside of the plant kingdom, it can be envisaged that novel, highly specialized epigenetic factors and functions can appear only in a narrow subset of organisms through diversification of the general, evolutionary conserved epigenetic regulators. So far the biological role of the CHD3/MOM1 sub-diversification remains unclear but it is intriguing that it seems to have assisted the major evolutionary step in the emergence of land plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>RNA Analysis</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using the TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
