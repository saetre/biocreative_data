In this report we have extended the 5' sequence to 1263 b.p. before the start site of transcription and have compared the entire sequence of the IL-2 gene and its 5' flanking region with that of Adult T-cell leukemia virus (ATLV). Four regions of limited homology were noted. Three areas of homology to the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) were seen in the 5' sequence flanking IL-2. A fourth region of homology to the viral LTR was located within the second intron of the IL-2 gene. While the significance of these homologies is not known, it is possible that they are involved in regulating the expression of ATLV and IL-2, both of which are generally restricted to T cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5005"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5006"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5007"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5008"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5009"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5010"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5011"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5012"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5013"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
