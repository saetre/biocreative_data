To further examine the role and signaling mechanism of activin in regulating placental function, the steady-state level of activin type I receptor (ActRI) mRNA in immortalized extravillous trophoblasts (IEVT) cells was measured using competitive PCR (cPCR). An internal standard of ActRI cDNA for cPCR was constructed for the quantification of ActRI mRNA levels in IEVT cells. ActRI mRNA levels were increased in a dose-dependent manner by activin-A with the maximal effect observed at the dose of 10 ng/ml. Time course studies revealed that activin-A had maximal effects on ActRI mRNA levels at 6 hours after treatment. The effects of activin-A on ActRI mRNA levels was blocked by follistatin, an activin binding protein, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, inhibin-A inhibited basal, as well as activin-A-induced ActRI mRNA levels. These findings provide evidence, for the first time, that activin-A modulates ActRI mRNA levels in human trophoblast cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Activin</kwd><kwd>Follistatin</kwd><kwd>Activin Receptor</kwd><kwd>Immortalized Extravillous Trophoblast Cells</kwd><kwd>Competitive PCR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Although activins and inhibins were originally isolated from follicular fluids and identified as stimulators and inhibitors, respectively, of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), the identification of inhibins and activins in a wide variety of tissues suggest that these factors play much greater roles than the control of FSH secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Also, it has become evident that these factors exert their effects mostly in autocrine/paracrine manners.</p><p>Similar to other members of the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) family, activins exert their actions by interacting with both type I and type II membrane serine/threonine kinase receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Two type I (ActRI and ActRIB) and two type II (ActRII and ActRIIB) receptors have been shown to interact with activins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and their mRNAs have been detected in human placental trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], as well as in choriocarcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Many studies have demonstrated that activin-A plays important regulatory roles in human placenta, including stimulation of cytotrophoblast differentiation into invasive extravillous cytotrophoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; stimulation of progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and oxytocin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] secretion. However, regulation of activin signaling at the receptor level has not been examined.</p><p>The human placenta provides specialized functions during gestation that is critical for the development of the embryo and fetus. Among these important functions are the production of hormones, cytokines and growth factors that contribute to the gestational coordination of maternal, extraembryonic, and embryonic tissues. Development of the human placenta depends on proliferation and differentiation of certain trophoblast cells as well as invasion to the endometrium and its vasculature by a highly proliferative, migratory and invasive subpopulation of extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>To further study activin signaling in human placenta, we have developed a competitive quantitative PCR to measure ActRI mRNA levels in an immortalized EVT cell line, HTR8/SVneo. We report here the first evidence that activin-A regulates its own receptor mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner and this effect can be blocked by its binding protein, follistatin, or its antagonist, inhibin-A in human placenta.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell line</title><p>The use of placental tissue samples and cell lines was approved by the Clinical Screening Committee for Research and Other Studies Involving Human Subjects, University of British Columbia.

The upstream primer (ActRI-1), 5'-GATGAGAAGTCATGGTTCAGG-3', and downstream primer (ActRI-2), 5'-TATGTTTGGCCTTTGTTGATC-3' were designed such that the predicted sizes of PCR products are 700 bp for native ActRI cDNA. Primers are chosen to flank introns so that the amplified ActRI cDNA is readily distinguished from a possible contaminating genomic DNA. Another pair of primers, ActRI-3 (5'-GATGAGAAGTCATGGTTCAG G-3') and ActRI-4 (5'-TATGTTTGGCCTTTGTTGATC-3") were synthesized and used as nested primers to validate the internal standard and measuring the regulation of ActRI mRNA levels in HTR8/SVneo cells. The human &#x003b2;-actin primers, used as another internal control to normalize cDNA amount in different samples, are AC1 upstream and AC2 downstream primers of which sequence are 5'-GGACCTGACTGACTACCTCATGAA-3' and 5'-GGTGGAAGGTGGTCAACACCTAG-3', respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Hormonal treatment</title><p>Human recombinant activin-A, inhibin-A and follistatin-288 were kindly provided by Dr. Parlow at the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. The HTR8/SVneo cells were plated in 24-well culture plates in FBS supplemented RPMI medium. Two days after plating when cells reach about 70% confluence, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free RPMI 1640. For dose-response studies, cells were treated with various doses (0.1 to 30 ng/ml) of activin-A for 12 hours. For time-course experiments, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml activin-A for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 hours. To determine the interaction between activin and follistatin, cells were treated with activin-A (10 ng/ml) alone, or activin-A with different concentrations of follistatin-288 (10, 20, 50, or 100 ng/ml) for 6 h. Similarly, to examine the effect of inhibin on basal and activin-A-stimulated ActRI mRNA levels, cells were treated with Activin-A, inhibin-A, either alone or in combination for 6 h. There are four wells in each treatment group and each experiment was conducted three times.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of an internal standard for comparative PCR</title><p>Cloning of native ActRI PCR product using primers ActRI-1 and ActRI-2 was performed by ligating the PCR product into a pDirect (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), followed by sequencing analysis to confirm the identity.

However, the purity of cytotrophoblasts was not consistent. The IEVT cells used in the study exhibit similar cellular function to normal EVT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and they provide a promising model to study the function of EVT cells. Using these cells, we have demonstrated that activin-A stimulates, while inhibin-A inhibits, ActRI mRNA levels.</p><p>Our results showed that ActRI mRNA accumulation at 12 hours after treatment was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by activin-A. The time course of the activin-A effect on ActRI mRNA showed responses at 3 to 12 hours after treatment, with a maximal increase occurring at 6 hours. This response pattern of activin-A on ActRI mRNA suggests that activin-A exerts a positive feedback effect on its own receptor and that the action of activin-A on ActRI mRNA level is transient. The transient effect of activin-A is likely due to the termination of activin signaling. Activin signaling has been shown to be terminated by negative feedback mechanisms involving the activation of Smad7 by activin, and in turn, Smad7 inhibits further activin signaling by blocking the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by activin type I receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In addition, activin signaling can also be terminated by the degradation of Smad proteins through the ubiquitination pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The changes in ActRI mRNA levels as determined by cPCR in this study could have resulted from changes in the transcriptional rate of ActRI gene and/or the stability of the ActRI mRNA. Activin is known to regulate gene expression at the level of transcription via the Smad signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and expression of Smads in trophoblast cells including the HTR8/SVsno have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], it is therefore possible that activin-A may regulate its receptor expression at the level of gene transcription. Future studies are also needed to confirm that there is a correlated change at the protein level.</p><p>Although this is the first study demonstrating that activin-A regulates its own receptor expression in human placenta, several studies in other tissues have also observed modulation of activin signaling by activin itself. In the rat pituitary, activin-A stimulated ActRI and ActRIIB mRNA levels without altering ActRII mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. On the other hand, activin-A downregulated ActRIB, ActRII and ActRIIB mRNA levels in a cell line derived from a p53(-/-)inhibin-&#x003b1; (-/-) mouse testicular tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Follistatin is widely distributed and produced by many activin-responsive tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and may, therefore, serve to anatomically and temporally limit the local activities of activin. Follistatin mRNA transcripts and immunoreactivities have been detected in placental trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] Similar to many other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], follistatin also neutralizes activin actions in human placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the present study, we also found that the stimulatory effect of activin-A on ActRI mRNA levels could be completely blocked by follistatin. Since it is known that follistatin inhibits activin actions by binding to activin and thus preventing the interaction between activin and its type II receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] the neutralization of activin-A action on ActRI mRNA levels by follistatin suggests that the action of activin is a receptor-mediated event.</p><p>Inhibin and activin possess opposing activities in several biological systems including pituitary FSH secretion, erythroid differentiation, and gonadal sex-steroid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the present study, we found that inhibin-A caused a 60 % reduction in basal ActRI mRNA levels and completely inhibited activin-A-induced ActRI mRNA expression. This finding is in agreement with the observation that inhibin counteracts the effects of activin on cultured first trimester trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that in activin-A upregulates mRNA levels of it own receptor ActRI in human extravillous trophoblast cells. Since activin-A has been shown to stimulate the differentiation of extravillous trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the up-regulation of ActRI by activin-A suggests a positive feedback regulatory mechanism by which activin-A modulates its own signaling in these cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to PCKL and CP.
