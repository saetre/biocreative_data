Previous studies suggest that p27<sup>kip1</sup>, a kind of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, play an important role in the smooth muscle cell proliferation. However, the mechanism of hypoxia and the subcellular interactions between p27<sup>kip1 </sup>and prostacyclin analogues in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (HPASMC) are not fully understood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We investigated the role of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>in the ability of Beraprost sodium (BPS; a stable prostacyclin analogue) to inhibit the proliferation of HPASMC during hypoxia. To clarify the biological effects of hypoxic air exposure and BPS on HPASMC, the cells were cultured in a hypoxic chamber under various oxygen concentrations (0.1&#x02013;21%). Thereafter, DNA synthesis was measured as bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. The p27<sup>kip1 </sup>mRNA and protein expression and it's stability was measured by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting.

The 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), a cAMP analogue, had similar action as BPS in the regulation of p27<sup>kip1</sup>. Moderate hypoxia did not affect the stability of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>protein expression, but PDGF, known as major hypoxia-induced growth factors, significantly decreased p27<sup>kip1 </sup>protein stability. We also demonstrated that BPS and 8-Br-cAMP suppressed HPASMC proliferation under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions by blocking p27<sup>kip1 </sup>mRNA degradation.

Many pulmonary disorders are associated with chronic hypoxia, accompanied by pulmonary hypertension and fatal right heart failure resulting from pulmonary vascular remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Prolonged exposure to hypoxia is associated with cellular and histological changes in vascular remodeling, and the key pathological findings of pulmonary vascular remodeling are increased wall thickening of pulmonary vessels and the muscularization of small arteries. Decreased ambient oxygen concentrations in laboratory animals cause similar pathological changes, including pulmonary smooth muscle hypertrophy and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, several studies <italic>in vitro </italic>have also shown that exposure to hypoxia stimulates pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation, which might be a key component of pulmonary vascular remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) is thought to improve exercise tolerance and survival in patients with either primary or secondary PH through its ability to inhibit the growth of PASMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. TORAY Industries Inc. developed Beraprost sodium (BPS), which was the first chemically stable and orally active PGI<sub>2 </sub>analogue to increase intracellular cAMP levels via adenylate cyclase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Since 1995, BPS has been used to treat PH and obstructive peripheral arterial disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The drug mimics the biological properties of PGI<sub>2</sub>, such as activating adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cAMP levels, through activation of the PGI<sub>2 </sub>receptor. Owing to its chemical characteristics, BPS is more stable and persistent than natural PGI<sub>2 </sub>and has higher affinity for the PGI<sub>2 </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The proliferation of PASMC, which causes pulmonary vascular remodeling, requires the cells to enter the cell cycle. The most important molecular process for cell cycle progression is retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-cyclin complexes, and CDK activities are mainly regulated by CDK inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] such as p27<sup>kip1</sup>. Other studies have found that the CDK inhibitor, p27<sup>kip1</sup>, plays an important role in the inhibition of CDK activity and in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. On the other hand, Li et al. found that BPS suppresses systemic vascular smooth muscle proliferation through cAMP signaling via p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. On the contrary, cell cycle arrest at late G<sub>1 </sub>is caused by p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression under severe hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These results support the notion that the oxygen-dependent checkpoint of the cell cycle is controlled by p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression, and that cAMP signaling also interferes with the cell cycle and p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression. However, the precise mechanisms and interactions between the pathways activated by hypoxia, as well as the antiproliferative effects of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>during exposure to BPS in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells remain uncertain. We aimed to clarify the inhibitory effect of BPS in cultured human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (HPASMC), as well as interactions of the CDK inhibitor p27<sup>kip1</sup>. We assessed the effects of BPS and 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), a cAMP analogue, on cell proliferation and p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression, and examined the role of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>in HPASMC proliferation using p27<sup>kip1 </sup>gene silencing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>We obtained reagents and materials from various sources as follows: Humedia SG medium, recombinant human EGF and FGF, gentamycin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B (Kurabo Ltd., Osaka, Japan); bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation assay kits (Oncogene&#x02122;, Cambridge, MA); low-pH cAMP ELISA kits (R&#x00026;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN); ECL detection system (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK); Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Toyobo Co.

In addition, we confirmed using p27<sup>kip1 </sup>gene silencing that p27<sup>kip1 </sup>regulation in fact reflects HPASMC proliferation.</p><p>Increased levels of growth factors derived from the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) are thought to regulate PASMC proliferation under hypoxic conditions since a partial HIF-1&#x003b1; deficiency decreases muscularizartion of pulmonary arterioles in animals exposed to chronic hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although HIF-1&#x003b1; regulates various transcriptional genes for angiogenic factors, severe hypoxia and iron depletion induce cell growth arrest. Our finding that severe hypoxia (0.1% oxygen) suppressed nucleotide synthesis is in line with those of others who incubated several tumor cell lines under hypoxic conditions or with iron chelators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In contrast to severe hypoxia, other studies have indicated that moderate hypoxia (1 &#x02013; 5% oxygen) enhances the proliferation of rat and bovine PASMC, airway-smooth muscle cells, lung fibroblasts and mesangial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our findings that DNA synthesis was increased during moderate hypoxia, and that the HPASMC cell cycle progresses more quickly under hypoxic than normoxic conditions were also compatible with previous findings.</p><p>The suppressive effect of hypoxia on p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression has been demonstrated in mice with pulmonary hypertension induced by hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the expression of p27<sup>kip1</sup>, which blocks the cell cycle at the G<sub>0/1 </sub>phase, is regulated <italic>via </italic>several mechanisms including transcription, protein degradation and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The data presented here indicated that hypoxia minimally promoted p27<sup>kip1 </sup>mRNA degradation. Our data also suggested that the hypoxia-induced down-regulation of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>was not apparently mediated by hypoxia <italic>per se</italic>, but rather mitogenic factors such as PDGF derived via hypoxia enhanced p27<sup>kip1 </sup>protein degradation. We demonstrated that the decrease of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression during hypoxia was post-transcriptional regulation from the results of RT-PCR and western blot analysis. We hypothesized that the discrepancy between the results of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>protein expression and protein stability during hypoxia may be explained by the effect of CHX which could suppress the protein expression of the hypoxic signal transduction including hypoxia-induced growth factors, such as PDGF. Our results that PDGF decreased the stability of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>is consistent with our hypothesis, and we believe that these results are consistent with conclusion that p27<sup>kip1 </sup>down-regulation mediates hypoxia-induced HPASMC proliferation. The suppressive effect of PDGF on p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression has been demonstrated using rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and in human saphenous vein smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and oncogenic Ras induces cell cycle progression and shortens the half-life of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Since both Ras and PDGF activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), we believe that MAPK activated through growth factors derived from hypoxia and HIF-1&#x003b1; enhanced the degradation induced by hypoxia.</p><p>Our results showed that HPASMC incubated with BPS were arrested at the G<sub>0/1 </sub>phase even under hypoxia, with p27<sup>kip1 </sup>elevation being associated with increased intracellular cAMP expression, which was not affected by the oxygen concentration. These results indicated that the BPS-cAMP pathway functioned even under hypoxic conditions and that p27<sup>kip1 </sup>elevation might be a consequence of BPS-induced intracellular cAMP elevation. To confirm this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of the cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP on p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression and of BPS on DNA synthesis in p27<sup>kip1 </sup>gene knockdown HPASMC. The effects of 8-Br-cAMP and BPS on p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression were similar and p27<sup>kip1</sup>-dependent regulation of proliferation was confirmed in the p27<sup>kip1 </sup>knockdown cells. Overexpression of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>in rat PASMC decreased thymidine uptake and cellular proliferation while p27<sup>kip1 </sup>knock-out PASMC from mouse had increased cellular proliferation compared with p27<sup>kip1 </sup>wild-type PASMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As well, Yu et al. demonstrated that hypoxia decreased p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression in the lung and the anti-proliferative effects of heparin during hypoxia were absent in p27<sup>kip1 </sup>knock-out mouse compared with p27<sup>kip1 </sup>wild-type mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Using p27<sup>kip1 </sup>siRNA, we demonstrated that the anti-proliferative effects of BPS during hypoxia were lessened in the decrease of p27<sup>kip1</sup>. Therefore, we consider that our results from 27<sup>kip1 </sup>siRNA experiments are consistent with the published results, and we believe that our results demonstrate the importance of p27<sup>kip1 </sup>in the hypoxic regulation of PASMC proliferation and hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and remodeling, which would add an important additional advancement in this field.</p><p>We also found that BPS and 8-Br-cAMP suppressed p27<sup>kip1 </sup>mRNA degradation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Although cAMP regulates the expression of several genes, and the control of the mRNA degradation rate by cAMP is also an important regulatory mechanism of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], the mechanisms responsible for cAMP-regulated mRNA stability are not as well understood as those of transcriptional regulation. Recent findings have suggested that p27<sup>kip1 </sup>mRNA stability is controlled by interactions between MAPK-dependent regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and Rho-dependent translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In addition, cAMP induces cell relaxation through Rho GTPase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], which might be an important target of hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. These reports imply that the Rho and MAPK interaction contributes to p27<sup>kip1 </sup>mRNA stability during exposure to agents that elevate cAMP and hypoxia. Therefore, to clarify the detailed mechanisms of hypoxia and cAMP with respect to p27<sup>kip1 </sup>expression, additional studies are required to explain the relationship between cAMP and Rho.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we found that BPS and hypoxia play critical roles in HPASMC growth through p27<sup>kip1</sup>-cAMP and hypoxia-induced pathways. We believe that clarification of the precise mechanisms of pulmonary smooth muscle proliferation will lead to improved therapeutic strategies that targets hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and remodelling of the pulmonary circulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors'
