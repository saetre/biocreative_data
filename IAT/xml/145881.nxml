This requires the DNA binding octamer factors Oct-1 and/or Oct-2, as well as an additional B cell-restricted non-DNA binding cofactor. We recently cloned such a coactivator specific for Oct-1 or Oct-2 from human B cells and called it OBF-1. Here we report the isolation and characterization of the murine homologue. Full-length cDNA clones as well as genomic clones were isolated and the gene structure was determined. The deduced protein sequence shows that the mouse protein has an identical length, is likewise proline rich and shows 89% overall identity to the human protein. The OBF-1 gene is expressed in a very highly B cell-specific manner and is transcribed in cells representative of all stages of B cell differentiation, including the earliest ones. We show that OBF-1 interacts in the absence of DNA with the POU domain of Oct-1 or Oct-2 and also with the general transcription factors TBP and TFIIB. Furthermore, we demonstrate that although OBF-1 efficiently activates promoter octamer sites, it does not activate enhancer octamer sites.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
