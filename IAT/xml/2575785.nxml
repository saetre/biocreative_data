In this study, we find that expression of Bik/Blk/Nbk is increased in human airway epithelial cells (AECs [HAECs]) in response to IFN&#x003b3;. Expression of Bik but not mutant BikL61G induces and loss of Bik suppresses IFN&#x003b3;-induced cell death in HAECs. IFN&#x003b3; treatment and Bik expression increase cathepsin B and D messenger RNA levels and reduce levels of phospho&#x02013;extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the nuclei of <italic>bik<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> compared with <italic>bik<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> murine AECs.

Unraveling the role of IFN&#x003b3; in apoptosis remains a challenge because IFN&#x003b3; may prime cells to apoptosis and through induction of many genes can concomitantly elicit an antiproliferative and a proliferative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiang et al., 2008</xref>). The decision between life and death may depend on possible costimuli or the cell type. Enhanced expression and translocation of Diablo into the cytosol play a critical role in the promotion of IFN&#x003b3;-induced apoptosis of IFN&#x003b3;-sensitive B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoshikawa et al., 2001</xref>). Th1 cells that secrete high levels of IFN&#x003b3; are more susceptible to activation-induced cell death than Th2 cells because Th2 cells express Fas-associated phosphatase, FAP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>). In keratinocytes, IFN&#x003b3; induces apoptosis via increasing expression of Fas receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trautmann et al., 2000</xref>), whereas the Fas ligand&#x02013;Fas receptor pathway is not involved in the IFN&#x003b3;-induced death of primary human airway epithelial cells (AECs [HAECs]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trautmann et al., 2002</xref>).

Disruption of the IFN&#x003b3;-induced elimination of hyperplastic epithelial cells can be the source for chronic mucous secretions in asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pierce et al., 2006</xref>) or for neoplastic growth over prolonged periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Youn et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The Bcl-2 family of proteins consists of members with three to four Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions such as the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindsten et al., 2000</xref>) and the antiapoptotic members such as Bcl-2, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, and MCL-1. The interactions of these proteins are an essential gateway required for cell death in response to diverse stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wei et al., 2001</xref>) and under a wide variety of circumstances, suggesting that they act at a central control (CT) point in the pathway to apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Cory, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cryns and Yuan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thornberry and Lazebnik, 1998</xref>). Another group of Bcl-2 family members contains only the BH3 motif and displays some selectivity for multiple domain Bcl-2 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Letai et al., 2002</xref>) and provides a link between various cell death initiators and the execution machinery of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coultas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Opferman and Korsmeyer, 2003</xref>). BH3-only proteins inactivate the antiapoptotic proteins and allow activation of the multidomain proapoptotic members Bax and Bak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Naik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimazu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Willis et al., 2007</xref>). The proapoptotic activity of BH3-only molecules is kept in check by either p53-dependent transcriptional CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Villunger et al., 2003</xref>), posttranslational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lei and Davis, 2003</xref>), or by binding to the dynein light chain in myosin V filamentous actin and thereby being sequestered from binding to Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Puthalakath et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Day et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our goal for this study was to further characterize the IFN&#x003b3;-induced cell death in AECs by identifying the BH3-only proteins involved in this pathway. Bik/Blk/Nbk was consistently induced by IFN&#x003b3;, and its expression induced cell death. Loss of Bik but not p53, Bim, or Bax conferred resistance to IFN&#x003b3; but not to thapsigargin-induced cell death. Primary mouse AECs (MAECs) from <italic>p53</italic>- but not <italic>bik</italic>-deficient mice were protected from DNA damage&#x02013;induced cell death. We demonstrate that the conserved Leu residue within the BH3 domain of Bik is crucial for its cell death&#x02013;inducing activity by interacting with and suppressing the nuclear localization of phospho&#x02013;extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in MAECs and HAECs. Furthermore, loss of Bik was accompanied by increased nuclear phospho-ERK1/2 and sustained epithelial cell hyperplasia in mouse airways, and blocking activated ERK1/2 with U0126 suppressed cell death in response to IFN&#x003b3; treatment and Bik expression. Therefore, these experiments show that Bik is central in mediating IFN&#x003b3;-induced cell death by retaining activated ERK1/2 in the cytosol in cultured AECs and during resolution of hyperplastic epithelial cells in mouse airways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>IFN&#x003b3; induces Bik expression to elicit cell death in AECs</title><p>We have previously shown that proliferating but not resting HAECs undergo apoptosis in response to IFN&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 2002</xref>) and that Bax plays a role in this cell death pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tesfaigzi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stout et al., 2007</xref>). To identify which of the BH3-only proteins initiate IFN&#x003b3;-induced cell death upstream of Bax, primary HAECs and AALEB cells, a cell line derived from HAECs, were treated with IFN&#x003b3; for 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, and the changed expression of all the BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins was screened using quantitative RT-PCR. Significant induction was consistently observed for Bik, but Puma, Hrk, Bid, and Bad remained unchanged. Bik mRNA levels were induced at 24&#x02013;96 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), and Bik protein levels were increased at 24 h after IFN&#x003b3; treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and remained elevated over 96 h (not depicted).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>IFN&#x003b3; treatment induces Bik by activating STAT1 to cause cell death in AECs.</bold> (A and B) HAECs were treated with IFN&#x003b3; for the indicated times, and Bik expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (A) and Western blotting (B).

Similarly, compared with Flag-expressing HBEC-2 cells, a significant reduction in Bik expression was observed in cells expressing a Flag-tagged dominant-negative construct for STAT1 that was previously shown to suppress IFN&#x003b3;-induced cell death (unpublished data). However, p53, which has been shown to be important for inducing Bik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mathai et al., 2002</xref>), was not perceptibly affected in these cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The BH3 domain of Bik is crucial for inducing death in proliferating epithelial cells</title><p>To investigate the role of Bik and the importance of the BH3 domain in inducing cell death, we expressed Bik adenoviral expression vector for Bik (Ad-Bik), mutant Bik (Ad-Bik<sup>L61G</sup>), or adenoviral expression vector for GFP (Ad-GFP) in the immortalized AEC line, HBEC-2, and HAECs using an adenoviral expression system at an MOI of 100 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Ad-Bik expression reduced the number of HBEC-2 cells significantly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>) compared with Ad-Bik<sup>L61G</sup>&#x02013; or Ad-GFP&#x02013;infected cells with an equal amount of MOI. As was previously observed for IFN&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 2002</xref>), the ability of Bik to induce cell death was sensitive to cell growth conditions because confluent cultures of HBEC-2 cells or HAECs were unaffected by Ad-Bik infection, even though Bik expression was evident by Western blot analysis (unpublished data). To further investigate the role of Bik in IFN&#x003b3;-induced cell death, IFN&#x003b3;-induced Bik expression was suppressed in HAECs by infecting with a retroviral expression vector for Bik short hairpin RNA (shRNA), whereas CTs were infected with empty vector (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Suppression of IFN&#x003b3;-induced Bik expression resulted in a significantly increased number of cells compared with cells infected with CT retrovirus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these studies showed that IFN&#x003b3; induces cell death in AECs through Bik, although a previous study using <italic>bik<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice had shown that Bik has no role in hematopoietic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coultas et al., 2004</xref>).

Not only IFN&#x003b3;- but also starvation-induced phospho-ERK1/2 was inhibited from translocating to the nucleus when Bik was present. The conserved Leu residue in the BH3 domain that was crucial for Bik-induced cell death was also crucial for interacting and inhibiting phospho-ERK1/2 translocation. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK1/2 using U0126 suppressed IFN&#x003b3;- and Bik-induced cell death, suggesting that cytosolic ERK1/2 is proapoptotic, whereas nuclear ERK1/2 promotes growth in AECs. The biological consequence of ERK activation in a given cell may be determined by the cell-specific cytosolic or nuclear substrates. ERK is generally considered to be antiapoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolch, 2005</xref>) but can function as a stimulator of apoptosis in cells expressing death-associated protein (DAP) kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), a kinase that promotes the cytoplasmic retention of ERK1/2.

DAP-kinase is constitutively expressed in human HAECs and MAECs (unpublished data). Therefore, IFN&#x003b3;-induced ERK1/2 activation and Bik expression may initiate a feedback loop that initiates DAP-kinase&#x02013;mediated cytoplasmic retention of ERK1/2 to promote the amplification of proapoptotic signals.

The present studies show a role of human and murine Bik as the main mediator for IFN&#x003b3;-induced cell death and, therefore, suggest that they are functionally homologous.</p><p>Although Bik is expressed in the liver, lung, heart, and kidneys and in granulocytes, macrophages, and developing as well as mature T and B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coultas et al., 2004</xref>), the <italic>bik<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice develop and age normally, suggesting that IFN&#x003b3;-induced cell killing is not required during normal development under injury- and pathogen-free conditions. Loss of Bik conferred no protection to mature T and B cells from spontaneous death in culture, from treatment with dexamethasone or etoposide, or from cytokine starvation of mitogen-activated B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coultas et al., 2004</xref>). Bik inducing death in AECs rather than hematopoietic cells may result from airway cells expressing other genes such as DAP-kinase to facilitate Bik-mediated suppression of nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK1/2. The cell type&#x02013;specific effect of BH3-only domain proteins is further supported by our previous studies showing that Bim, an essential initiator of apoptosis in negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouillet et al., 2002</xref>), and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enders et al., 2003</xref>), are not involved in the resolution of airway epithelial hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pierce et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The present studies show that loss of Bik or IFN&#x003b3; leads to sustained epithelial cell hyperplasia after allergen-induced inflammation in mouse airways. In addition, proliferating rather than nonproliferating, resting AECs are prone to undergo cell death in response to IFN&#x003b3; treatment or Bik overexpression. Therefore, Bik is ineffective in inducing cell death in confluent airway epithelial cultures (unpublished data). Primarily the mucus-containing cells showed nuclear phospho-ERK1/2 in lung tissues of mice exposed to allergen. Several studies have shown that after injury to the airway epithelium, a large proportion of the hyperplastic and cycling cells are secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keenan et al., 1982a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">b</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">c</xref>). Because mucous cells are the hyperplastic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tesfaigzi et al., 2004</xref>), they may be by default susceptible to cell death and elimination in vivo during resolution. Susceptibility of proliferating cells to IFN&#x003b3; or Bik-induced cell death may be a mechanism to selectively target hyperplastic epithelial cells that in airways usually represent mucus-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lai et al., 2002</xref>). This selective elimination of only hyperplastic cells may ensure that resting AECs maintain the barrier function of the airway epithelium, may allow the CT of mucus production, and may prevent the development of cancerous lesions. Therefore, restoring Bik expression may be useful for eliminating hyperplastic airway cells. Bik was first identified as a protein that interacts with the adenoviral protein E1B 19K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mathai et al., 2002</xref>). The reason for E1B 19K or the viral homologue encoded by Epstein-Barr virus, BHRF1, singling out Bik for inhibition may be to sustain the viability of the host cells and promote replication and release of virus particles.</p><p>In summary, our analyses of HAECs and MAECs in culture and in airways of intact mice identify Bik as the central mediator of IFN&#x003b3;-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Bik induces cell death by inhibiting nuclear translocation of activated ERK1/2 in a pathway that is independent of p53.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male-specific pathogen-free wild-type C57BL/6J and <italic>p53<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
