While transplantation of cadaveric islets remains promising, additional sources of islets or &#x003b2;-cells are required to make this treatment more widely available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). Diabetic patients would also benefit from in vivo manipulation of their &#x003b2;-cell population. &#x003b2;-Cells proliferate slowly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>), but increased proliferation can be stimulated under various conditions, including obesity, pregnancy, and growth factor overexpression (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). In the adult mouse, &#x003b2;-cell replication is the primary mechanism by which new &#x003b2;-cells are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). However, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>) in mice has conclusively shown that new &#x003b2;-cells are generated from facultative adult progenitor cells (neogenesis) in response to pancreatic injury, in a manner reminiscent of embryonic endocrine cell differentiation. Furthermore, patients with type 1 diabetes exhibit evidence for continued &#x003b2;-cell production in the face of immune destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), providing support for the ability of human &#x003b2;-cells to regenerate.</p><p>We previously showed that the forkhead box transcription factor FoxM1 regulates postnatal &#x003b2;-cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). In other tissues, FoxM1 transactivates genes that coordinate the G<sub>1</sub>/S and G<sub>2</sub>/M transitions, karyokinesis, and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). For example, the FoxM1 targets Cdc25A and Cdc25B (cell division cycle 25 homolog A and B, respectively) dephosphorylate and activate cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and Cdk1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Cdk1 activity also depends on its binding to CcnB1 (cyclin B1), another FoxM1 target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Additional targets include S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) and Cdk subunit 1 (Cks1), components of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F box) ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates degradation of the Cdk inhibitors p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, and p57<sup>Kip2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). FoxM1 also directly activates transcription of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>), aurora B kinase, centromere protein A (Cenp-A), Cenp-B, and survivin (Birc5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Plk1 is necessary for centrosome duplication and, with aurora B kinase, mediates attachment of the microtubule spindles to kinetochores. Survivin regulates aurora B kinase centromere localization, while Cenp-A and -B are involved in kinetochore assembly.</p><p>Although all proliferating cells express FoxM1, certain cell types are more profoundly affected than others by <italic>Foxm1</italic> deletion. <italic>Foxm1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice die during late embryogenesis due to hepatic and cardiac defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). Additionally, pancreas-wide <italic>Foxm1</italic> deletion (<italic>Foxm1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>;<italic>Pdx1</italic><sup>5.5kb</sup>-<italic>Cre</italic> &#x0005b;FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup>&#x0005d;) does not affect embryonic pancreas or &#x003b2;-cell development but does impair postnatal &#x003b2;-cell mass expansion via reduced &#x003b2;-cell proliferation, resulting in progressive diabetes in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). These outcomes mirror those reported for widespread deletion of other cell cycle regulators (Cdk4 and cyclin D), with endocrine cell&#x02013;specific effects causing diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). Female FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice remain glucose tolerant despite significantly reduced &#x003b2;-cell mass and thus are the focus of this study, allowing for analysis of &#x003b2;-cell proliferation and regeneration without the confounding effects of hyperglycemia.</p><p>To determine whether FoxM1 is required for &#x003b2;-cell regeneration, we performed 60&#x00025; partial pancreatectomy (PPx) on adult female FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> and control (<italic>Foxm1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>) littermates. Here, we show that <italic>Foxm1</italic> and some of its transcriptional targets were upregulated within islets following PPx during the period of peak regeneration and that endocrine cell proliferation and regeneration of &#x003b2;-cell mass following PPx were specifically impaired in FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice. Furthermore, we present evidence that loss of FoxM1 did not impair islet neogenesis but did impair islet growth after PPx.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p><italic>Foxm1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice on a mixed background (129SvJ, C57BL/6) were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>).

A midline abdominal incision allowed exteriorization of the splenic lobe of the pancreas (between the gastroduodenal junction and the spleen). Sixty percent PPx was performed by gently denuding the pancreatic tissue from the splenic lobe using cotton-tipped swabs soaked in 0.9&#x00025; saline, leaving the main pancreatic duct and splenic artery intact. For sham operations, the splenic lobe was isolated using cotton-tipped swabs and gently rubbed with a moistened gloved finger for 1 min. Abdominal muscles were sutured using 5-0 vicryl (Ethicon), and the skin was stapled using 9.0-mm staples (Reflex Skin Closure Systems). A total of 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine-HCl in normal saline was injected subcutaneously for analgesia, and 0.8 mg/ml bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered in drinking water in a light-safe bottle and was replaced on the 4th day. Mice were killed 1 week postoperation by cervical dislocation, and the splenic and duodenal lobes of the pancreas were harvested and analyzed separately. One day before and 7 days after the operation, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs) were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>) (see <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> for experimental timeline).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and real-time quantitative RT-PCR.</title><p>RNA from whole pancreas or freshly isolated islets was extracted and DNase treated using the RNAqueous and Turbo DNA-free kits (Ambion).

Because there was no significant impairment in &#x003b2;-cell proliferation in small endocrine cell clusters in FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice, we hypothesized that these clusters represented newly formed &#x003b2;-cells that did not require FoxM1 for proliferation. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that embryonic &#x003b2;-cell proliferation did not require FoxM1 (online appendix Fig. S2<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). Additionally, proliferation of &#x003b2;-cells within small endocrine cell clusters after PPx was specifically stimulated in the regenerating splenic (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>G</italic></xref>), but not duodenal (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>H</italic></xref>), lobe. We hypothesize that just as perinatal &#x003b2;-cells can proliferate in the absence of FoxM1, newly differentiated &#x003b2;-cells in the adult can undergo several rounds of FoxM1-independent replication before switching to FoxM1-dependent proliferation.</p><p>PPx stimulated &#x003b2;-cell proliferation within definitive islets of control mice to the same extent (sevenfold) in both the splenic and duodenal lobes versus sham (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>I</italic> and <italic>J</italic></xref>). Proliferation in the splenic lobe of FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice increased only fivefold, while the increase within the duodenal lobe did not reach significance, suggesting that proliferation of preexisting &#x003b2;-cells was impaired in the absence of FoxM1. The increased BrdU incorporation observed within definitive islets in the splenic lobe of FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice 7 days after PPx versus sham (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>I</italic></xref>) may represent proliferation that occurred at an earlier stage of new islet development.

However, hypertrophy also contributed, likely as a compensatory measure due to reduced &#x003b2;-cell number. PPx did not alter &#x003b2;-cell size in control mice.

However, FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> islets were significantly smaller 7 days after PPx compared with sham.

These data suggest that <italic>Foxm1</italic> deletion impairs islet growth after PPx. Of note, islets within the splenic lobe of control mice after sham operation averaged two times larger than islets within the duodenal lobe (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), which may be due to a greater proportion of small endocrine cell clusters versus definitive islets normally found in the duodenal versus splenic lobe (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>).

No differences were observed in the proportion of small endocrine cell clusters between control and FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice after sham operation or within the duodenal lobe under any condition (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;-Cell neogenesis following 60&#x00025; PPx was not impaired in FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice.</title><p>The average number of insulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell groupings in the splenic lobe of both FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> and control mice trended toward an increase 7 days after PPx versus day 0 (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>E</italic></xref>), while no differences were observed in the duodenal lobes of either genotype (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>F</italic></xref>).

We previously showed that mice with <italic>Foxm1</italic> deleted throughout the pancreatic epithelium (FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup>) exhibit impaired growth and maintenance of postnatal &#x003b2;-cell mass secondary to reduced postnatal &#x003b2;-cell proliferation, associated with increased nuclear-localized p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and premature cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). Several of FoxM1's direct transcriptional targets inhibit p27<sup>Kip1</sup> by promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Skp2, Cks1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>) or its nuclear export (kinase-interacting stathmim) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). Here, we show that FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice have impaired &#x003b2;-cell mass regeneration following PPx due to reduced &#x003b2;-cell proliferation but that neogenesis proceeds normally.</p><p>Sixty percent PPx is a normoglycemic pancreatic injury model that stimulates regeneration by differentiation and proliferation and hyperplasia of preexisting tissue. We found that <italic>Foxm1</italic> and some of its targets were upregulated within islets following PPx during a period of enhanced &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-cell proliferation, and we hypothesized that FoxM1 was required for injury-stimulated endocrine cell proliferation. Indeed, we found that FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice exhibited impaired &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-cell proliferation and impaired &#x003b2;-cell mass regeneration following PPx. PPx stimulated &#x003b2;-cell proliferation in both the splenic (regenerating) and duodenal (expanding) lobes of control mice but not in the duodenal lobe of FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice. Thus, hyperplasia of preexisting &#x003b2;-cells after injury requires FoxM1.</p><p>Interestingly, PPx-stimulated &#x003b2;-cell proliferation was blunted, but not completely inhibited within the splenic lobe of FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice, due at least in part to impaired proliferation in definitive islets, but not small endocrine cell clusters, in the absence of FoxM1. These data suggest that another pathway(s), which may mimic that utilized during embryonic pancreas development, compensates for loss of FoxM1 during regeneration, as FoxM1 was also not required for embryonic &#x003b2;-cell proliferation. Thus, preexisting &#x003b2;-cells seemingly exhibit a stronger requirement for FoxM1 than new &#x003b2;-cells formed by neogenesis. Although it is currently unclear which factors are required for &#x003b2;-cell proliferation during embryogenesis and following islet neogenesis, our studies support the hypothesis that neogenesis in the adult is similar to embryonic &#x003b2;-cell development, both with regard to reexpression of Ngn3 and initial FoxM1-independent proliferation.</p><p>Because BrdU was administered over 7 days, we may have underestimated the effects of <italic>Foxm1</italic> deletion on endocrine cell proliferation. Previous studies have shown that <italic>Foxm1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells can undergo multiple rounds of DNA synthesis without karyo- or cytokinesis (endoreduplication), resulting in polyploid nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). We found evidence of polyploid &#x003b2;-cells and exocrine cells in FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice. These cells would have been counted as proliferating cells in our analyses but would not have actually resulted in increased cell number. This phenomenon could partially explain the increased BrdU incorporation in &#x003b2;-cells without significant &#x003b2;-cell mass regeneration within the splenic lobe of FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice after PPx compared with sham, although it most likely would not be restricted to one lobe.</p><p>Additionally, incomplete <italic>Foxm1</italic> recombination could have resulted in mosaic expression, allowing some &#x003b2;-cells to continue proliferating. However, we think that this is unlikely because we previously showed that <italic>Pdx1</italic><sup>5.5kb</sup>-<italic>Cre</italic> recombined the <italic>Rosa26-LacZ</italic> reporter allele within all endodermally derived pancreatic cells and yielded a significant reduction in FoxM1 protein by e15.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). We also found that <italic>Foxm1</italic> transcripts were significantly reduced in FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> neonatal pancreas (online appendix Fig. S5<italic>A</italic>) and even more dramatically in adult islets (online appendix Fig. S5<italic>B</italic>). These tissues contain nonendodermally derived mesenchymal, endothelial, and neuronal cells, which would not undergo <italic>Foxm1</italic> recombination and thus likely account for remaining transcript expression.</p><p>Proliferation of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-cells, but not acinar or ductal cells, was reduced in FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice versus control littermates following PPx, suggesting that FoxM1 is required specifically within endocrine cells. These data concur with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>) showing that endocrine cells are particularly susceptible to perturbations in cell cycle regulation. The current study utilized quantitative RT-PCR on islet RNA to assess changes in <italic>Foxm1</italic> expression following PPx. Unfortunately, antibodies to detect FoxM1 protein in mouse tissue do not currently exist, precluding precise identification of the cell population(s) in which FoxM1 expression or localization changes with time and after PPx. Such studies will allow for better understanding of cell type&#x02013;specific requirements for FoxM1 and may help to explain the differing effects of FoxM1 absence that we observe between endocrine and exocrine cells following PPx. However, our expression analyses identified several potentially important regulators of pancreatic endocrine cell proliferation and regeneration that are themselves regulated by FoxM1 (<italic>Plk1</italic>, <italic>Cenp-a</italic>, <italic>Birc5/survivin</italic>, and <italic>Ccnb1</italic>).</p><p>We also presented evidence of &#x003b2;-cell neogenesis following 60&#x00025; PPx, including Ngn3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> duct cells, insulin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells within regenerating tissue, and increased islet density. These findings were equivalent between control and FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice, revealing that &#x003b2;-cell neogenesis does not require FoxM1. Peshavaria et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>) showed increased small endocrine cell clusters by 2 days post-PPx, which normalized by 7 days. Our data are consistent with this finding, as control mice at 7 days post-PPx exhibited a normal proportion of small endocrine cell clusters. However, FoxM1<sup>&#x00394;panc</sup> mice had an increased proportion of small endocrine cell clusters at 7 days post-PPx, indicating that formation of these clusters is not impaired in the absence of FoxM1, but significant growth is. These data support our hypothesis that initial proliferation of newly differentiated &#x003b2;-cells does not require FoxM1, but these cells later switch to a FoxM1-dependent state. Unfortunately, current technology precludes real-time monitoring of &#x003b2;-cell proliferation and islet growth. However, this study highlights the importance of &#x003b2;-cell proliferation as a mechanism of &#x003b2;-cell mass regeneration, as our data show that neogenesis, without adequate proliferation, is not sufficient to regenerate a significant amount of &#x003b2;-cell mass after 60&#x00025; PPx.</p><p>As &#x003b2;-cell regeneration after partial duct ligation mimics embryonic &#x003b2;-cell differentiation with Ngn3 reexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>), it is not surprising that similar processes occur following 60&#x00025; PPx, although perhaps to a lesser extent. Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>) asserting the lack of reactivation of the embryonic program, and thus neogenesis, following PPx were performed in a manner that likely precluded true regeneration, with surgical excision of the splenic lobe and pancreatic duct, while other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>) did not analyze the splenic lobe specifically, possibly missing the contribution of neogenesis and regeneration to new &#x003b2;-cell formation. The current study removed tissue from the splenic lobe, leaving the main pancreatic duct intact. This lobe was analyzed separately, and only specific foci of regeneration exhibited evidence of neogenesis. Thus, this study does not contradict but adds to the current knowledge regarding the potential for pancreas regeneration and &#x003b2;-cell neogenesis.</p><p>FOXM1 overexpression did not affect &#x003b2;-cell regeneration following PPx, suggesting that FoxM1 is not sufficient to induce &#x003b2;-cell proliferation, emphasizing that the &#x003b2;-cell cell cycle is under tight negative regulatory control, even after injury. As reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>), &#x003b2;-cells express all of the cell cycle &#x0201c;brakes&#x0201d; studied thus far but only some &#x0201c;accelerators.&#x0201d; Thus, it may be more difficult than initially anticipated to stimulate &#x003b2;-cell proliferation in vivo or in vitro as a therapeutic option for diabetic patients. Because FoxM1 positively regulates cell cycle accelerators and negatively regulates cell cycle brakes, it is of particular interest. However, better understanding of posttranslational and inhibitory regulators is necessary to successfully manipulate FoxM1 activity in &#x003b2;-cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db08-0878_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db08-0878_db08-0878[1].suppl.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Islets were isolated by Zhongyi Chen and Anastasia Golovin of the Vanderbilt Islet Procurement and Analysis Core, supported by the Diabetes Research and Training Center (P60 DK20593).
