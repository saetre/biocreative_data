The RNase P holoenzyme from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> consists of a large RNA subunit of 377 nt (140 kDa) and a small protein subunit of 119&#x000a0;amino acids (14 kDa). The RNA is the catalytic component of the holoenzyme and can produce mature tRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> under high salt conditions, in the absence of protein. However, the protein subunit is required for catalytic activity <italic>in vitro</italic> under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c2">2</xref>) and is essential <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c4">4</xref>). The protein subunit increases the catalytic efficiency of the reaction by specifically enhancing affinity for substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c5">5</xref>) and by speeding up the rate-limiting step of product release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c6">6</xref>). The protein subunit also increases the affinity of RNase P RNA for substrates other than pre-tRNA, such as 4.5S RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c2">2</xref>).</p><p> In recent years, structural data on the RNase P protein subunit has become available. The crystal structure of the protein from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c7">7</xref>) revealed a mixed &#x003b1;&#x02013;&#x003b2; protein with an unusual left-handed &#x003b2;&#x02013;&#x003b1;&#x02013;&#x003b2; turn, similar to two other RNA binding protein&#x02019;s domains, domain II of ribosomal protein S5 and domain IV of elongation factor EF-G. A three-dimensional NMR structure of the RNase P protein from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> revealed architecture similar to the RNase P protein from <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c8">8</xref>). The RNase P RNA subunit has eluded crystallization, but has proven amenable to crosslinking; three-dimensional models of the RNA subunit from both <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> were created based on the phylogenetically derived secondary structure. Intramolecular and intermolecular crosslinking between the RNA subunit and the pre-tRNA substrate provided distance constraints for modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c11">11</xref>).</p><p> Even with the structure of the protein subunit known and a working model of the RNA subunit constructed, the specific binding surface between subunits remains ill defined. Hydroxyl radical and nuclease footprinting experiments using the holoenzyme from <italic>B.subtilis</italic> showed three regions of the P&#x000a0;RNA sequence protected in the presence of the protein subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c12">12</xref>). Footprinting studies have also been conducted on the <italic>E.coli</italic> holoenzyme using enzymatic probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c14">14</xref>). More recently, the protein-binding site on the RNA has been probed by tethering a Fe&#x02013;EDTA cleavage compound to the protein subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c15">15</xref>). However, there is no clear consensus among these studies. The nature of the interaction between the RNase P protein and the substrate pre-tRNA has been investigated by crosslinking as well. Site-directed crosslinks from the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> protein subunit to pre-tRNAs with varying 5&#x02032; leader lengths showed that the precursor sequence lies across the central cleft of the RNase P protein &#x003b2;-sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c16">16</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f1">1</xref>).</p><p> The purpose of the present study was to determine the protein interaction sites on the RNA subunit. To address this question, a thiol-specific, photoactive crosslinking reagent, azidophenacyl bromide (APB), was conjugated to a cysteine residue introduced at specific sites within the RNase P protein. The modified protein could then be incubated with RNase P RNA and crosslinked by UV irradiation. The sites of crosslinking on the RNA were mapped by primer extension to reveal regions of the RNA that interact with the protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mutagenesis</title><p>Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the QuickChange protocol, using <italic>Pfu</italic> DNA polymerase (Stratagene).

Specific crosslinks were detected between F18C&#x0002f;C113A and both 3 and 4 nt leader pre-tRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f2">2</xref>, lanes 11 and 15, respectively, compare with lane 6, pre-tRNA with leader of 2&#x000a0;bases). The bands are protein&#x02013;RNA crosslinks as evidenced by sensitivity to protease K treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f2">2</xref>, compare lanes 11 and 12, 15 and 16). F18C&#x0002f;C113A crosslinked to a pre-tRNA with either 3 or 4 base leader with an efficiency of 0.5&#x00025;, crosslinking to the 2 base leader tRNA was only 0.1&#x00025;. The specificity of the reaction agrees well with previous results, although the efficiency of crosslinking differs greatly. The <italic>B.subtilis</italic> F16C protein crosslinked to pre-tRNA at 15&#x00025; efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c16">16</xref>). H78C&#x0002f;C113A did not crosslink to any of the pre-tRNAs tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f2">2</xref>, lanes 9, 13 and 17). This agrees with the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> system, as H78 lies outside the proposed substrate-binding cleft.</p></sec><sec><title>Analytical crosslinking to RNase P RNA</title><p>The ability of the P protein variants to crosslink to P RNA and their relative crosslinking efficiencies were tested. Crosslink reactions were carried out in 400 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl reaction buffer, the optimal monovalent salt concentration for protein-binding specificity to P RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c27">27</xref>). RNA (20 nM) was incubated with 40 or 80 nM modified protein and irradiated at 302 nm for 15&#x000a0;min. Protein&#x02013;P RNA crosslinks run as a smear just below the well in the 4&#x00025; acrylamide&#x0002f;8 M urea&#x0002f;TBE gel system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f3">3</xref>). The protein&#x02013;RNA crosslink bands were confirmed by sensitivity to protease K treatment (compare lanes 3 and 4 for F18C&#x0002f;C113A, lanes 7 and 8 for H78C&#x0002f;C113A, lanes 11 and 12 for R99C&#x0002f;C113A), and UV dependence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f3">3</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 3, 6 and 7, or 10 and 11). Crosslinking efficiency was dependent upon protein concentration. When reactions were performed using 20 nM each of protein and RNA, crosslinking efficiencies were 2.9&#x00025; for F18C&#x0002f;C113A, and 1.0&#x00025; each for H78C&#x0002f;C113A and R99C&#x0002f;C113A (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke512tb1">1</xref>). The native RNase P protein, C113, was also modified and crosslinked, but the efficiency was &#x0003c;0.1&#x00025;, even using 4-fold excess protein (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke512tb1">1</xref> and data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Primer extension analysis of P protein to native P RNA crosslinks</title><p>Preparative crosslinking reactions contained 400 nM P RNA and 400 or 800 nM protein. Reconstituted holoenzyme was irradiated with 302 nm UV light to activate the aryl azide, causing a crosslink to nucleotides of the RNA subunit that are in close proximity. Protein&#x02013;P RNA crosslinked species were then isolated by gel purification, eluted and subjected to primer extension analysis. The two primers used for primer extensions were KS, which is complementary to the extended 3&#x02032; end of pecKS P RNA, and Ec225r, which is complementary to bases 242&#x02013;225 of P RNA. The primers chosen allowed analysis of the entire sequence of P RNA. Reverse transcriptase extends the labeled primer up to the nucleotide 3&#x02032; to the crosslink site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c28">28</xref>). Examples of crosslinks seen for the three mutants are illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f4">4</xref>A and B. Crosslinks can be seen as stops in the primer extensions not seen in the control lanes (C). Primer extension stop sites were screened by several criteria: (i) the relative intensity of the crosslink stop compared with stops seen for control uncrosslinked RNA from the same crosslink reaction in the adjacent lane. This control distinguishes crosslinks from reverse transcriptase pause sites, which are presumed to be caused by secondary structure. (ii)&#x000a0;Crosslinks were also evaluated for dependence on protein concentration. Sites of crosslinking detected at equimolar protein:RNA ratios are more likely to represent a high-affinity binding site compared to those that require excess protein for maximal detection. (iii) Crosslinks were also assessed for reproducibility; those sites noted were detected in at least three separate experiments. Consequently, the sites noted are a conservatively chosen set of strong crosslink sites. Weaker crosslinks, such as those requiring excess protein for maximal detection, are also apparent. The weaker sites may also represent valid crosslinks, but we are most confident of the strongest sites. The position of the crosslinks in RNase P RNA was determined by the sequencing ladder in adjacent lanes. All three modified protein mutants crosslinked to bases C228 in helix P11 and U231 in J14&#x0002f;11. &#x0005b;In <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase P RNA, base-paired helices are numbered P1&#x02013;P18 in 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; order.

The sites of crosslinking for each of the three protein mutants, F18C, H78C and R99C, are compiled in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke512tb1">1</xref>.

The results of our analytical crosslink studies of holoenzyme containing modified F18C&#x0002f;C113A protein to pre-tRNA substrate are in general agreement with similar studies performed with the homologous residue of <italic>B.subtilis</italic> P&#x000a0;protein, F16C. The <italic>B.subtilis</italic> F16C crosslinked to substrate tRNAs with 5&#x02032; precursor sequences &#x02265;4 nt, but not to 2 or 3 nt precursors. Crosslinkers outside the central binding cleft determined in <italic>B.subtilis</italic> did not crosslink to pre-tRNA. We&#x000a0;saw similar results for <italic>E.coli</italic> F18C&#x0002f;C113A, although crosslinking was detected to both 3 and 4 nt precursors. In addition, <italic>E.coli</italic> H78C&#x0002f;C113A, which is predicted to be located outside the corresponding binding cleft in <italic>E.coli</italic>, did not crosslink to pre-tRNA as expected. The most striking difference between the two systems is a difference in crosslink efficiency. The differences in efficiency between the two systems are likely due to inherent differences in reactivity or solubility of the protein from the two species.</p><p> Given that the protein&#x02013;tRNA crosslinks agreed well with&#x000a0;&#x000a0;those seen in <italic>B.subtilis</italic>, the relative efficiency of the protein&#x02013;P RNA reactions compared with the specific reaction seen for F18C&#x0002f;C113A with pre-tRNA suggests that the protein&#x02013;P RNA crosslinks also represent specific P RNA&#x02013;protein interactions. Most of the crosslinks that we observed from the P protein mutants to P RNA were in or adjacent to highly conserved regions and near the active site of RNase P RNA. The crosslinks are mapped onto the secondary structure consensus of Type A RNase P RNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f5">5</xref>B). We observed that F18C, H78C and R99C crosslinked to bases C228 and U231, which are conserved positions in J14&#x0002f;11 and P11 of all bacterial P RNAs. H78C also crosslinked to positions C131, U167, C168, G246 and C247 of the P RNA. The G246 crosslink site observed for H78C in P5 is 100&#x00025; conserved in all Type A bacterial RNase P RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c31">31</xref>) and is believed to be near the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c32">32</xref>). C131 is &#x0003e;98&#x00025; conserved in all Type A bacterial RNase P RNAs; nucleotide 231 is conserved as a pyrimidine in 98&#x00025; of Type A RNAs. Nucleotides 167 and 168 are part of a highly variable region of P12 directly adjacent to the more conserved base of the highly conserved P12 helix.</p><p> The bacterial RNase P protein is predicted to lie near the active site of the RNA subunit, based upon the ability of the protein to crosslink to precursor sequences of the substrate near the cleavage site. In the model of pre-tRNA binding to P&#x000a0;protein, conserved residues near H78 are closest to the site of cleavage of the pre-tRNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c16">16</xref>). Our data are consistent with this model and the large body of tRNA&#x02013;P RNA crosslink data that identify residues at or near the active site of the ribozyme. Specifically, an aryl azide attached to the 5&#x02032; end of mat-tRNA, the site of action of RNase P, crosslinked to nucleotides 231 and 248 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c32">32</xref>). Our crosslinks to nucleotides 228, 231, 246 and 247 are in close agreement with these sites. These regions have also been shown to interact with tRNA in nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c33">33</xref>) and chemical cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c34">34</xref>) protection assays.</p><p> The degree of overlap in our RNA crosslinks among the different protein mutants was somewhat surprising. However, distances between the different sites on the protein to which the aryl azide was attached are relatively small: the C&#x003b1; of F18C is 23 &#x000c5; from H78 and 27 &#x000c5; from R99. H78C is 18 &#x000c5; from R99. These distances are less than twice the distance between the C&#x003b1; of cysteine and the reactive nitrene (14 &#x000c5;), thus the crosslinker attached at any chosen residue could attack the same point in space. Our results illustrate the relatively small size of the P protein compared with RNase P RNA. The conserved regions of the protein likely to interact with RNase P RNA are clustered in a small region of this already small protein (&#x003b2; strand 3 and helix 2, see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f1">1</xref>). The natural cysteine, C113 failed to crosslink to P RNA and lies on the opposite side of the protein with fewer conserved residues.</p><p> The RNA target for the crosslink is likely to have contributed to the clustering of crosslinks sites observed. All of the crosslinked nucleotides are unpaired or adjacent to unpaired residues in the secondary structure. None are in the middle of helices. A similar trend can be seen in the wealth of RNA&#x02013;RNA crosslink data available using APB. Of the RNA&#x02013;RNA crosslinks characterized, &#x0003c;10&#x00025; are in helices, compared with the expected 35&#x00025; (compiled from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c36">36</xref>). Thus, APB may not efficiently crosslink to A-form helical regions in close proximity, but instead reacts with adjacent unpaired residues. The size of the nucleotide target may also lead to clustering of crosslinks. Nucleotides range in size from 10 to 14 &#x000c5; so modified proteins crosslinking to the same nucleotide need not react with the same atom at a particular point in space. The protein&#x02013;RNA crosslink sites detected do not appear to be intrinsically reactive nucleotides, as excess APB-cysteine in solution did not have enhanced reactivity to the RNA crosslink sites (data not shown).</p><p> One test of the validity of detected crosslinks is to demonstrate that the crosslinked species are active. This is a technical challenge, as current gel systems do not allow us to resolve different protein&#x02013;RNA crosslinks from each other. However, we were able to detect active crosslinks using a self-cleaving P&#x000a0;RNA&#x02013;tRNA chimera, TPT118. This RNA consists of a pre-tRNA mini helix tethered to a circularly permuted P RNA at nucleotide 118 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c37">37</xref>). TPT118 is able to self-cleave the 5&#x02032;&#x000a0;precursor sequence, but activity is stimulated 30-fold in the presence of protein (J.M.Nolan, unpublished data). Modified protein was incubated with TPT118 in the presence of calcium to allow interaction of subunits with minimal cleavage of the RNAs, the protein was crosslinked to RNA with UV light, and uncrosslinked protein was removed by extensive washing with buffer lacking calcium. Addition of magnesium allowed RNA self-cleavage. The self-cleaved, crosslinked RNAs were purified by gel electrophoresis and mapped by primer extension. Crosslinks to residues 246 and 247 by F18C and H78C were confirmed in this manner (data not shown).</p><p> Our results are in partial agreement with previous observations of regions of the P RNA, which interact with the protein. Chemical cleavage footprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c12">12</xref>) of the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> holoenzyme showed that the P protein protected three main regions on the RNA subunit. The corresponding regions in <italic>E.coli</italic> P&#x000a0;RNA are shown shaded in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f5">5</xref>B. The previous results and ours indicate P12 as part of the protein-binding site, although we were not able to confirm other regions protected in the previous study, such as P2 and P8&#x02013;P9. More recently, the site of <italic>E.coli</italic> P RNA that interacts with the protein subunit was investigated by tethering an Fe&#x02013;EDTA cleavage compound to specific sites on the P protein. Again, our results are in partial agreement with this study. Crosslinks we detected for H78C to nucleotides 246 and 247 are directly adjacent in the secondary structure to sites in helix P4, which were cleaved by Fe&#x02013;EDTA attached to residue 54. Residue K54 is predicted to lie between H78 and F18 in the three-dimensional structure of the P&#x000a0;protein. However, none of our other crosslink sites coincide with Fe&#x02013;EDTA cleavage sites from the previous study.</p><p> The <italic>B.subtilis</italic> RNase P holoenzyme has recently been shown to form a (protein)<sub>2</sub>(RNA)<sub>2</sub> tetramer <italic>in vitro</italic>, while the RNA subunit alone exists as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c38">38</xref>). The <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA did not form a heterotetramer with the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> protein, but instead formed a higher order aggregate. The <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA was able to compete efficiently with the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> RNA for binding to the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> protein, inhibiting formation of the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c38">38</xref>). It is possible that the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase P RNA can form a similar tetramer in the presence of the <italic>E.coli</italic> protein. Alternatively, the difference in the behavior of the <italic>E.coli</italic> versus <italic>B.subtilis</italic> RNAs could result from differences in the secondary structure of the RNAs, which in turn could affect their ability to form a stable, symmetrical tetramer. It is thus unclear how our results should be interpreted with respect to the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> tetramer.</p><p> There are presently two different models of the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase P RNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c11">11</xref>). Many of the crosslink sites detected in the present study were not modeled by Chen<italic> et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c9">9</xref>), due to lack of sufficient structural constraints. In the Massire model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke512c11">11</xref>), our crosslink sites cluster in two to three areas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f6">6</xref>). This may be due to uncertain placement of poorly constrained regions such as P12, or may in fact reflect two distinct binding sites necessary for tetramer formation. Our results suggest that several regions of the RNA subunit, previously not well defined by crosslinking to a specific region, need to be reoriented. The arrow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke512f6">6</xref> shows the proposed reorientation of helix P12. While the loop of P12 is likely peripheral, given its variable length, the base of this helix is well conserved and should be placed nearer the core of the enzyme. Similarly, P11 appears to interact with both protein and substrate and should be positioned near the core. The RNA&#x02013;protein crosslink sites detected here will provide additional constraints for further modeling of the structure of RNase P RNA and help to determine the protein-binding site on the RNA.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke512f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> A homology model of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase P protein created using SwissPdbViewer and the crystal structure of the RNase P protein from <italic>B.subtilis</italic>. &#x003b2;&#x000a0;strands are colored yellow, &#x003b1; helices are red.
