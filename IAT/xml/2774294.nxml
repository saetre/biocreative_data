The active enhancers and expression of immunoglobulin is generally considered to be restricted to B lymphocytes. However, accumulating evidence indicated that epithelial cancer cells, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines, express immunoglobulins. The mechanisms underlying the expression of Igs in nonlymphoid cells remain unknown.

In our previous work, we have also demonstrated that nonlymphoid NPC cells express immunoglobulin kappa light chain. In addition, we have found that EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) can upregulate the expression of kappa light chain in NPC cells and both NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 signaling pathways are involved in LMP1-augmented kappa light chain expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These results promote us using of NPC cell lines as model to further explore the mechanisms underlying the expression of Ig kappa in nonlymphoid cells.</p><p>Expression of kappa light chain gene is under the control of distinct cis-regulatory elements, including the kappa intron enhancer (iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>) and the kappa 3' enhancer (3'E<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which are located within the J<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>-C<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>region and downstream of C<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>region, respectively. Both enhancers are inactive at the pro-B and pre-B cell stages and active at the Ig&#x003ba;-expressing mature B cell and plasma cell stages. The activity of these enhancers in other non-kappa-producing cell lineages, such as T-lymphoid cells, epithelial cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts, is generally silent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Base on these, it is generally believed that the activation of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>and 3'E<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>is required for immunoglobulin kappa gene expression and is B cell lineage-restricted events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. An interesting feature of kappa gene transcription is its inducibility. Certain agents, such as cycloheximide (CYC), phorbol esters and bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce the activation of kappa enhancers and result in kappa gene expression at the pre-B cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Nucleation of transcription factors PU.1, PIP, c-Fos and c-Jun on the kappa 3' enhancer core can cause a very dramatic induction in 3'E<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, a cell in which the enhancer is normally silent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These findings reinforce the possibility of nonlymphoid cells expressing Ig kappa by certain unidentified mechanisms and suggest that other extracellular factors, such as gene products encoded by viruses, are also likely to induce kappa enhancers' activation, finally result in kappa gene transcription and expression.</p><p>One viral protein, latent membrane protein 1, is considered as a major oncogenic protein encoded by EBV for its transform and tumorigenic activities and is found to be able to transform cell lines and alter the phenotype of cells due to its oncogenic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Biologically, LMP1 is an integral membrane protein with six transmembrane segments that facilitate self-aggregation in the plasma membrane and transduces ligand-independent signals, including NF-&#x003ba;B, c-Jun-NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK), p38/MAPK, Ras/MEK/ERK/MAPK, PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways are the most important, since their activation results in the overexpression of most LMP1 target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. LMP1 can mimic CD40 signaling to induce B cell activation and differentiation in vivo. They share some molecules such as TRAF1, 2, 3, and 5 as signal transducers as well as some pathways such as NF-&#x003ba;B, JNK, p38/MAPK, PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In normal B cells, an important mechanism of Ig production is CD40 ligation-triggered cellular signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In addition, it has been found that CD40 signaling can increase IgH 3' enhancer activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These studies, in combination with our previous finding that kappa light chain is significantly higher in LMP1-positive than in LMP1-negative NPC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], we thus speculate that upregulation the expression of kappa light chain by LMP1 may be the result of LMP1-induced kappa enhancer's activation in NPC cells.</p><p>The function of enhancers is mediated by DNA binding proteins that recruit to the enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Multiple protein binding sites have been identified and characterized in each of the kappa enhancers. A &#x003ba;B binding site within the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>and the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>is mainly dependent on the nuclear factor NF-&#x003ba;B binding to &#x003ba;B element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Deletion or mutation of the &#x003ba;B site abolishes the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>, suggesting it might as a crucial enhancer element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, the human kappa gene J<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>-C<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>region also contains a perfect consensus AP-1 site, which located ~320 bases downstream of the &#x003ba;B site. The &#x003ba;AP-l site in the context of the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>can positively regulate the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity and kappa expression in B cells, suggests that it plays a role in kappa gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, in Ig&#x003ba;-expressing nonlymphoid cells, whether these two binding sites play roles in functional activation of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>is still unknown.</p><p>Since kappa enhancers' activation is required for Ig kappa gene expression and their activations are generally considered as B cell lineage-restricted events, and since NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 binding sites exist within and downstream the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>enhancer, and on the basis of our previous findings that both NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 pathways are involved in LMP1-augmented Ig kappa expression in human NPC cells, we therefore focus on the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>enhancer and attempt to study further whether it is active in Ig&#x003ba;-expressing NPC cells and whether LMP1-upregulated kappa expression is correlated with the activation of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>via NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 pathways. In this study, luciferase reporter analysis demonstrate that the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>whose activation is required for immunoglobulin kappa gene expression indeed activates in Ig&#x003ba;-expressing NPC cells and stable or transient LMP1 expression can upregulate the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>in NPC cells. Moreover, mutation analysis of &#x003ba;B or AP-1 binding site within or downstream the iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>, inhibition of LMP1-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 signaling pathways by using specific chemical inhibitors and dominant inhibitory molecules indicate that both sites are functional and LMP1-enhanced iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity is regulated, to some extent, through these two sites. Gel shift assays show that LMP1 promotes NF-&#x003ba;B subunits p52 and p65 as well as AP-1 family members c-Jun and c-Fos binding to the &#x003ba;NF-&#x003ba;B and the &#x003ba;AP-1 motifs <italic>in vitro</italic>, respectively. Both chemical inhibitors and dominant negative mutants targeting for NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 pathways can attenuate theLMP1-enhanced bindings. Co-IP assays using nuclear extracts from HNE2-LMP1 cells reveal that p52 and p65, c-Jun and c-Fos proteins interact with each other at endogenous levels. ChIP assays further demonstrate p52 and p65 binding to the &#x003ba;B motif as well as c-Jun and c-Fos binding to the AP-1 motif of Ig kappa gene <italic>in vivo</italic>. Based on the findings reported here, we conclude that the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>enhancer is active in NPC cells and is further activated by LMP1 via NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 pathways, which contributes to the upregulation of Ig kappa by LMP1 in NPC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Activation of the human immunoglobulin kappa intron enhancer in Ig&#x003ba;-expressing nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells</title><p>Immunoglobulin kappa gene expression is under the control of distinct cis-regulatory elements, including the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>and the 3'E<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The activity of these enhancers is believed to contribute to Ig kappa expression in B cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In order to investigate if the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>enhancer could be functionally activated in NPC cells, we linked the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>to the I&#x003b1;-promoter driving the transcription of the luciferase reporter gene and analyzed this reporter construct in transient transfection of NPC cell lines. A schematic diagram of the Ig kappa intron enhancer regions that were cloned was shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, and the wild-type reporter construct was illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, a 575 bp genomic fragment containing the intact iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>was subcloned into the enhancerless pGL3-&#x003b1; plasmid. This construct, which containing wild-type &#x003ba;B site within the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>and wild-type AP-1 site downstream the 3' flank of the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>(designated as p&#x003b1;-iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>wt), was introduced into HNE2 and HNE2-LMP1 cells to test the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>. The human I&#x003b1; promoter we used was identical to that used previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and we found it to be minimally affected by LMP1 in our experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Transfection of p&#x003b1;-iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>wt generated higher luciferase activities than that of the pGL3-&#x003b1; construct whether in LMP1-negative (P &#x0003c; 0.01) or in LMP1-positive (P &#x0003c; 0.01) NPC cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Notably, the luciferase activity of pGL3-&#x003b1; in both HNE2 and HNE2-LMP1 cells was essentially equivalent, which suggested that the functional specificities of the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>enhancer in NPC cells were due to the enhancer itself rather than the promoter sequences. These results indicate that the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>is active in NPC cells which express immunoglobulin kappa light chain.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Activation of the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>enhancer and enhancement of the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity by LMP1 in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells</bold>.

In order to investigate whether the upregulation effect was due to LMP1-enhannced iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity, luciferase reporter assays were performed to compare the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity in LMP1-positive and -negative NPC cells.

Similar results were obtained with transient transfection of LMP1 into HNE2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These results indicate that LMP1 can enhance the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity. We thus infer that LMP1 can increase the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>and the upregulation of kappa light chain by LMP1 is likely due to increase the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>by LMP1.</p></sec><sec><title>Involvement of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 signaling pathways in LMP1-increased human kappa intron enhancer activity</title><p>Based on the previous finding that both NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 signaling pathways are involved in LMP1-augmented kappa light chain expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], to determine whether either the NF-&#x003ba;B or the AP-1 sequence was required for LMP1-enhanced iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity, site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension PCR was used to introduce mutations into each of these sequences. From the p&#x003b1;-iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>wt construct, we created constructs termed p&#x003b1;-iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>-mt&#x003ba;B and p&#x003b1;-iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>-mtAP-1, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, mutation of the NF-&#x003ba;B or the AP-1 motif significantly decreased LMP1-increased iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity (p &#x0003c; 0.01 and p &#x0003c; 0.05, respectively). In addition, the magnitude of the reduction for p&#x003b1;-iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>-mtAP-1 was less than that for p&#x003b1;-iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>-mt&#x003ba;B, implying that of two signaling pathways, NF-&#x003ba;B pathway might play a leading role in LMP1-augmented iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity in NPC cells. The activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>in HNE2 cells was moderately decreased by these genetic manipulations. Combination this with the results that mutation of either the NF-&#x003ba;B or the AP-1 motif could not completely abolish the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity in NPC cells as well as previous reports that several additional functional motifs are located within the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], suggested that the variety of nuclear factors that can bind to the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>may result in complex regulatory pathways.

As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, LMP1-induced iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity was significantly inhibited by 20 &#x003bc;M Bay11-7082 (p &#x0003c; 0.01) or 20 &#x003bc;M SP600125 (p &#x0003c; 0.05) but not by the DMSO vehicle control. These two compounds also decreased the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity in HNE2 cells to a certain extent but did not have statistical difference (P &#x0003e; 0.05), which was consistent with the previous immunoblot results that both compounds have no obvious inhibitory effects on kappa expression in HNE2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It was reported Bay11-7082 reduces only the constitutive but not the inducible activity of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We speculated SP600125 might reduce only the constitutive but not the inducible activity of JNK as did Bay11-7082, which might explain why both of them were not capable of decreasing the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity and kappa expression in HNE2 cells. Moreover, 20 &#x003bc;M Bay11-7082 showed more inhibitory effect on the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>than 20 &#x003bc;M SP600125. We have found that the amount of kappa light chain in HNE2-LMP1-DNMI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and HNE2-LMP1-TAM67 cell lines is significantly lower than that in their parental cell line HNE2-LMP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether the downregulation of kappa chain was correlated with the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity in the same cell lines. The results showed that the augmenting effect of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity by LMP1 was obviously attenuated when DNMI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and TAM67 were stably tranfected into HNE2-LMP1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

Biotin-labeled double-stranded &#x003ba;NF-&#x003ba;B and &#x003ba;AP-1 oligonucleotide probes as well as equal amounts of nuclear extracts from HNE2, HNE2-LMP1, HNE2-LMP1-DNMI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, HNE2-LMP1-TAM67, Bay11-7082-treated HNE2-LMP1 and SP600125-treated HNE2-LMP1 cells were used. As Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> shown, LMP1 caused a much stronger NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity in HNE2-LMP1 cells than that in HNE2 cells (lane 2 <italic>vs. </italic>lane 3). The nuclear lysates isolated from HNE2-LMP1-DNMI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; cells induced a weaker electromobility shift band than that from their parental cells HNE2-LMP1 (lane 3 <italic>vs. </italic>lane 4). We also found that the induction of NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity by LMP1 was clearly inhibited by 20 &#x003bc;M Bay11-7082 (lane 3 <italic>vs. </italic>lane 5). To demonstrate the specificity of these interactions, competitive binding assays were performed. Excess unlabeled double-stranded &#x003ba;NF-&#x003ba;B oligonucleotide was included in the binding assay mixtures. A 200-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide could completely compete for the protein binding seen with the HNE2-LMP1 cell extracts (lane 6). However, the same excess of the unlabeled mutant &#x003ba;NF-&#x003ba;B oligonucleotide (lane 7) or oligonucleotide containing the &#x003ba;AP-1 binding motif (lane 8) did not compete for the complex. In addition, the nuclear lysates isolated from these cell lines did not induce an electromobility shift when biotin-labeled &#x003ba;NF-&#x003ba;B mutant-type oligonucleotide was introduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These implied that the complex formed with extracts was specific to the sequence of the &#x003ba;NF-&#x003ba;B oligonucleotide. To characterize the composition of the DNA-bound NF-&#x003ba;B complex, we performed super-EMSA with antibodies specific for NF-&#x003ba;B family members p50, p52, p65, c-Rel and RelB to analyze the nuclear extracts of HNE2-LMP1 cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, the addition of p50, c-Rel and RelB antibody did not influence the mobility or intensity of the NF-&#x003ba;B binding complex (lanes 4, 7 and 8), whereas the addition of antibodies for p52 and p65 resulted in a significant diminishment or supershift of the specific complex (lanes 5 and 6). A control IgG antibody failed to attenuate the shift or elicit a supershift (lane 9). The results indicate the presence of p52 and p65 proteins in the complex with the kappa NF-&#x003ba;B binding site. We further tested the effect of LMP1 on p65 and p52 expression. Though no obvious difference of p65 level in HNE2 and HNE2-LMP1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), by separating cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, we found LMP1 led to p65 nuclear translocation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). We also found LMP1 induced the processing of p100 to p52 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>) and the nuclear translocation of p52 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). Efficient separation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was demonstrated by western blotting for cytoplasmic (&#x003b1;-tubulin) and nuclear (nucleolin) markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We next examined whether the interaction of p65 and p52 could be observed at endogenous levels. For this purpose, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed with non-denatured nuclear extracts from human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HNE2-LMP1. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, the p65 antibody could specifically coprecipitate endogenous p52 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <italic>upper panel</italic>, compare lane 2 using p65 with lane 3 using control IgG antibody). Endogenous p65 could also be detected in a reverse co-IP experiment using p52 antibody in the IP step (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <italic>lower panel</italic>, lane 5). IgG was used as a negative control in the IP reaction. The protein input was shown as indicated. These results reveal a heterodimerization between p65 and p52, which is likely relevant to kappa light chain expression upregulated by LMP1 in NPC cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>LMP1 increased the binding ability of p52 and p65 transcription factors to &#x003ba;NF-&#x003ba;B motif <italic>in vitro</italic></bold>.

Protein binding to the &#x003ba;AP-1 probe was completely abrogated by a 200-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type &#x003ba;AP-1 probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, lane 6), but not by the same excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide probe containing mutation in the &#x003ba;AP-1 sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, lane 7) and unlabeled &#x003ba;NF-&#x003ba;B probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, lane 8). On the other hand, the nuclear lysates isolated from these cells did not induce an electromobility shift when biotin-labeled &#x003ba;AP-1 mutant-type oligonucleotide was introduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). These implied that the complex formed with extracts was specific to the sequence of the &#x003ba;AP-1 oligonucleotide. To gain more insight into the composition of the protein complex bound to the human &#x003ba;AP-1 motif, we performed supershift analysis using nuclear extracts from HNE2-LMP1 cells. The addition of c-Jun antibody into the nuclear extracts of HNE2-LMP1 cells supershifted the complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, lane 3). Exposure of nuclear extracts from HNE2-LMP1 cells to c-Fos antibody and subsequent precipitation of the formed immune complex reduced the intensity of protein-DNA interaction by approximately 50% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, lane 4). The super-EMSA results suggest that c-Jun and c-Fos are components of the complex bound to the human kappa AP-1 motif. Moreover, we found LMP1 could significantly upregulate JNK phosphorylation ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>) and simultaneously upregulate the phosphorylation level of c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). However, expression of c-Jun and c-Fos were essentially equal in HNE2 and HNE2-LMP1 cells ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). These results implied that LMP1-increased JNK activation led to the increased phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73, which might promote the JNK substrate c-Jun heterodimerize with c-Fos to form the AP-1 complex. To examine if c-Jun endogenously interacts with c-Fos, we performed co-IP experiments. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, co-IP performed with anti-c-Jun antibody showed the co-precipitation with c-Fos from non-denatured nuclear extracts of HNE2-LMP1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <italic>upper panel</italic>, lane 2).

The HNE2-LMP1 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link proteins to chromatin and the cross-linked chromatin was then sheared to fragments of ~500 bp in length via sonication (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). The sheared cross-linked chromatin was subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation reactions using antibodies specific for the NF-&#x003ba;B family members p50, p52, p65, c-Rel and RelB as well as AP-1 family members c-Jun and c-Fos. An anti-IgG antibody was used as a nonspecific control. The precipitated chromatin DNA was then purified and amplified by PCR using primers specific for the NF-&#x003ba;B or the AP-1 binding site of Ig kappa gene. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>, the primers for the human iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>region containing the NF-&#x003ba;B binding site produced 159-bp amplicons that could be observed with the positive control (input chromatin) and when the chromatin was precipitated with antibodies specific for p52 and p65.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression of Igs is widespread in epithelial cancers from many organs and includes basically all kinds of isotypes. Among heavy chains, &#x003b1; chain for IgA and &#x003b3; chain for IgG are the mostly identified; but in light chain, only &#x003ba; chain but not &#x003bb; chain is confirmed. Moreover, several studies indicated that tumor-derived Igs have certain biological functions. Qiu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] found induction of cancer cell apoptosis and inhibition of cancer growth by blocking tumor-derived IgG, whose light chain is kappa, using either antisense oligodeoxynucleotide or anti-human IgG, thus confirming that IgG secreted by epithelial cancers has some unidentified capacity to promote the growth and survival of tumor cells. We also found that blockade of cancer-derived Ig alpha suppresses the growth and viability of cancer cells. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that cancer-derived Ig alpha promotes the malignant proliferation ability of cancer cells and increases the access percentage of S phase from the early mitosis of synchronized cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These findings support the important role of cancer-derived Ig as a growth factor of cancer cells. In addition, By <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization to analyze kappa constant region mRNA in different stages of cervical tissue samples, we found that the expression of kappa constant region mRNA is markedly increased in uterine cervical epithelia with dysplasia and carcinoma, as compared with cervicitis, thus suggesting a closely associated of kappa light chain expression with cell malignancy and is associated with increasing tumor grades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recently, we analyzed the ADCC immuno-activity of Ig derived from cancer cells and found that cancer-derived Ig is capable of reacting with FcR of monocytes and NK cells by its Fc region as does normal Ig, and to accomplish ADCC with effector cells (unpublished data). Based on these findings, it may be hypothesized that cancer-derived Ig could compete with B cell-derived Ig for the FcR on effector cells, thus inhibits ADCC and favors tumor immune escape. The potential biological functions of the tumor-derived Igs and the finding that nonlymphoid cells expressing Igs reported by different research groups revealed that this phenomenon is not a happenchance. However, the mechanisms underlying the expression of Igs in nonlymphoid cells are still unknown. In present study, we focus mainly on exploring the possible mechanisms by which nonlymphoid cells expressed Ig kappa and found that in Ig&#x003ba;-expressing NPC cells, kappa intron enhancer is activated. The activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>can be further activated by LMP1-stimulated NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 aberrant activation. It could be concluded that LMP1 stimulates transcription factors NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 binding to the corresponding site in kappa gene via NF-&#x003ba;B, JNK/MAPK signal pathways and finally upregulates kappa light chain induction. Such mechanisms would explain, at least in part, LMP1-positive human epithelial cancer cells produce immunoglobulins.</p><p>The activation of kappa enhancers, whose function is mediated by proteins binding to the enhancers, is required for Ig kappa gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We found the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>is active in both LMP1-negative and LMP1-positive NPC cells. In LMP1-negative HNE2 cells, the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity is relatively low and is in accord with low kappa expression level. LMP1 can further activate the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>and contributes to the upregulation of Ig kappa in NPC cells. Our results indicated that mutant of either NF-&#x003ba;B or AP-1 biding site did not completely abolish the basal and LMP1-induced iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In addition to NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 motifs to modulate the enhancer's activity, other positive regulatory elements have been identified within the iE<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>, including &#x003ba;A and E-box motifs, these sequences could potentially regulate the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, other transcription factors bind to kappa gene through various signaling pathways to regulate kappa expression in NPC cells can not be excluded at this time.</p><p>In B cells, functional analyses of motifs within iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>performed using isolated enhancers to activate reporter genes in transfection assays have shown that B cell-specific activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>depends substantially on the &#x003ba;B element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Moreover, mutations of E-box motifs have variable and weaker effects on transcription compared to mutation of the &#x003ba;B site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These observations indicated NF-&#x003ba;B acts as the master and commander of kappa gene expression via the &#x003ba;B motif in iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>in B cells. Similarly, our result indicated mutation of the NF-&#x003ba;B motif displayed a more inhibitory effect on LMP1-increased iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity compared to mutation of the AP-1 site, suggested that of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 pathways, NF-&#x003ba;B pathway may play a leading role in LMP1-augmented iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity in NPC cells.</p><p>Transcripition factor NF-&#x003ba;B comprised of homo- and heterodimers of the p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 (NF-&#x003ba;B1) and p52/p100 (NF-&#x003ba;B2) polypeptides can both induce and repress gene expression by binding to discrete &#x003ba;B elements in promoters and enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B is found in the cytoplasm of pre-B cell lines as an inactive complexes associated with an I&#x003ba;B inhibitor, whereas in mature and transformed B cells, NF-&#x003ba;B is active and localized in the nucleus. NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity and nuclear relocalization can be activated by a variety of stimuli. In our previous study, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation accompanying by I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation has been found in NPC cells and LMP1 can further induced I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Our results presented here indicated LMP1 increased the released-NF-&#x003ba;B translocating freely to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>) and binding to the &#x003ba;B motif of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 3). We characterized the NF-&#x003ba;B/DNA complex containing p52 and p65 subunits by Gel Super-shift assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). We also found LMP1 induced the processing of p100 to p52 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>) and the nuclear translocation of p52 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). Generally, p50/p65 is considered as a 'classical' heterodimers. p52 forms heterodimers with other NF-&#x003ba;B subunits, such as p65 and RelB, or as a homodimer has also been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, in our experiments, we failed to detect p50, c-Rel and RelB subunits in NF-&#x003ba;B/DNA complex. We also confirmed the interaction of p52 and p65 at endogenous levels by co-IP assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Moreover, both p52 and p65 could directly bind to the NF-&#x003ba;B binding region within the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>enhancer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Perkins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] found that p52/p65 preferentially activates HIV-1 gene expression relative to the p50/p65 heterodimers, which is similar to our results. The results suggest that a heterodimer of p65 with p52 subunit binding to &#x003ba;B site within the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>may play an important role in upregulating the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>and kappa light chain production in HNE2-LMP1 NPC cells.</p><p>We reported earlier that NPC cells express activated forms of JNK (pJNK) whether LMP1-negative or LMP1-positive and LMP1 can increase the phosphorylation level of JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. JNK is one of the kinases that regulated the activation of AP-1 transcription factor. Upon stimulation, this protein kinase enters the nucleus to induce or phosphorylate subunits of AP-1 and the resultant enhanced AP-1 activity can then participate in the regulation of gene expression. The AP-1 transcription factor is a dimeric complex that comprises a group of structurally and functionally related members of the Jun family (c-Jun, JunB and JunD), Fos family (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2), ATF (ATFa, ATF-2 and ATF-3) and JDP (JDP-1 and JDP-2) subfamilies, which can bind to AP-1 consensus sequence 5'-TGAG/CTCA-3' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Different types of AP-1 complexes are functionally distinct and may activate different target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. By EMSA analysis, we showed that nuclear extracts of both HNE2 and HNE2-LMP1 cells could bind &#x003ba;AP-1 motif and LMP1 was able to increase this binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Super-EMSA further characterized the protein/DNA complex containing c-Jun and c-Fos transcription factors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Moreover, our results demonstrated LMP1-induced JNK phosphorylation level coincided with the phosphorylation level of c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>) and this c-Jun phosphorylation was much closely related to the DNA binding activity of the c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer. Similar results that the phosphorylation level of c-Jun (ser63, ser73) is related to the DNA binding activity of c-Jun/JunB heterodimer was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our results suggest that LMP1 can act through activation of JNK, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase needed for AP-1 activation and induce formation of the c-Jun/c-Fos/DNA complex to upregulate the activity of iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>in NPC cells. We also found stable expression of TAM67 almost completely blocked LMP1-induced AP-1 DNA binding in HNE2-LMP1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, lane 4). Similar results that stable TAM67 expression completely inhibited MKK6-induced AP-1 binding in MCF-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and an inhibition of nickel-induced AP-1 element binding by TAM67 in human bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] were recently reported. Although we have demonstrated the heterodimerization of c-Jun and c-Fos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) and this heterodimer can directly bind to the AP-1 site located near the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>enhancer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>), we have used only c-Jun and c-Fos in this report, therefore, other dimeric forms of AP-1 transcription factor involved in regulating the iE<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>activity in NPC cells can not be excluded at this time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study presented novel experimental proofs on the mechanisms upregulating the expression of kappa light chain by LMP1 in NPC cells. Since other virus-encoded oncoproteins, such as HBX, E6, E7, can also activate many signal pathways including NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 pathways. These oncoproteins might induce immunoglobulin gene expression through the mechanism similar to EBV-LMP1. Our study might offer a new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which nonlymphoid cancer cells expressing immunoglobulin and lay foundations for further studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>HNE2, HNE2-LMP1, HNE2-LMP1-DNMI&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and HNE2-LMP1-TAM67 cell lines used were as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].
