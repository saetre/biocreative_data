Activation by the UAR involves two components: (1) a trans-acting protein, Fis, which binds to three sites in the UAR between -60 and -150, and (2) the UAR sequences themselves which affect RNA polymerase (RNAP) activity independent of other proteins. We refer to the latter as Factor-Independent Activation (FIA). In addition to its interactions with the -10 and -35 hexamers typical of E. coli promoters, RNAP makes contacts to the -53 region of rrnB P1, which may be related to the FIA effect. We constructed a series of insertion mutants containing integral and non-integral numbers of helical turns at position -46, between the Fis binding sites and the -35 region, and the resulting promoter activities were measured in vitro and in vivo. The data suggest that both Fis-dependent and factor-independent activation are face of the helix dependent: the Fis binding site and the sequences responsible for factor-independent activation must be correctly oriented relative to RNA polymerase in order to activate transcription. These results, in conjunction with other evidence, support a model for the involvement of direct Fis-RNAP interactions in upstream activation. We also demonstrate that RNAP interacts with the -53 region of the rrnB P1 UAR even when these sequences are displaced upstream of the RNAP binding site, and that these interactions correlate with factor-independent activation.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0080-a" xlink:role="721"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0081-a" xlink:role="722"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0082-a" xlink:role="723"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0082-b" xlink:role="723"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0083-a" xlink:role="724"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0078.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="719"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="720"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="721"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="722"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="723"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="724"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="725"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00078-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="726"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
