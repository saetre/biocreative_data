We show here that ROP1 activation is required for both the polar accumulation and the exocytosis of vesicles at the plasma membrane apex. The apical accumulation of exocytic vesicles oscillated in phase with, but slightly behind, apical actin assembly and was enhanced by overexpression of RIC4. However, RIC4 overexpression inhibited exocytosis, and this inhibition could be suppressed by latrunculin B treatment or RIC3 overexpression.

Actin dynamics controls many important cellular processes such as animal cell migration, neurite formation, axon guidance, chemotaxis, yeast endocytosis, regulation of gene transcription in developing vertebrate embryos and programmed cell death in the self-incompatibility responses, and the polarization of growth in pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leventhal and Feldman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dent and Gertler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mouneimne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Toshima et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mechanism by which actin dynamics modulate these fundamental processes is largely unclear.</p><p>Pollen tube growth is essential for plant sexual reproduction and provides an attractive model system for the study of polarized cell growth. When a pollen grain lands on the stigma, it produces a long pollen tube to deliver sperm to the ovule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hepler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and Preuss, 2002</xref>). The pollen tube extends by tip growth through highly targeted exocytosis to the tube apex. Growth of the pollen tube is oscillatory and can attain an astonishing rate, up to 1 cm/h, which makes it one of the most rapidly growing cells. All these features are expressed when pollen tubes are cultured in vitro. Therefore, the pollen tube has been widely used as a model system for cell biological, genetic, and molecular analyses of tip growth.</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy revealed massive accumulation of vesicles into an inverted cone pattern in the extreme apex of the pollen tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lancelle and Hepler, 1992</xref>). These vesicles fuse specifically with the apical region of the plasma membrane (PM) to allow rapid polarized tip growth. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this localized exocytosis are poorly understood. The vesicle accumulation pattern suggests that a cytoskeleton-based force is required for the targeting of these vesicles to the tip. Cortical microtubules (MTs) run along the length of pollen tubes but do not extend to the clear zone, and disrupting MTs does not significantly affect tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">&#x000c5;str&#x000f6;m et al., 1995</xref>), which suggests that MTs are unlikely to participate in the vesicle accumulation. Pollen tubes contain extensive axial actin cables and more dynamic F-actin filaments at the tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lovy-Wheeler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Samaj et al., 2006</xref>). The former are excluded from the tip of growing pollen tubes and are proposed to mediate cytoplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vidali et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardenas et al., 2005</xref>). Low levels of latrunculin B (LatB) do not affect streaming and actin cables but inhibit growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vidali et al., 2001</xref>), which is consistent with the notion that the tip-localized dynamic F-actin is important for vesicle targeting. Evidence suggests that the dynamics of the apical F-actin, not just its presence, are critical for polarized pollen tube growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Polarized exocytosis likely requires a signaling network localized to the tip to regulate the cytoskeleton and the targeting, docking, and fusion of vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pellegrin and Mellor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennwald and Rossi, 2007</xref>). Recent studies have revealed a signaling network controlling pollen tube growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moutinho et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prado et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monteiro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoon et al., 2006</xref>). A key component in this network is the ROP1 GTPase, a member of the plant ROP subfamily of conserved Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kost et al., 1999</xref>), which function as key molecular switches controlling a variety of cytoskeleton-dependent cellular processes in diverse eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burridge and Wennerberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sorokina and Chernoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ridley, 2006</xref>). ROP1 is preferentially localized to the apical region of the pollen tube PM and is essential for pollen tube growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). Active ROP1 is distributed as an apical cap in the PM apex with a tip-high gradient, and this distribution determines the PM region where growth takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the active ROP1 cap could allow for formation of the apical dome of pollen tubes. ROP1 controls pollen tube tip growth through its regulation of tip F-actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2001</xref>) and controls actin dynamics by activating at least two pathways regulated by RIC3 and RIC4, respectively. RIC4 promotes F-actin assembly at the tip, whereas RIC3 promotes the formation of tip-focused cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> gradients, which is required for the disassembly of F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>). However, the mechanism by which the ROP1-dependent actin dynamics regulate tip growth is unknown.</p><p>Cortical F-actin is thought to be an important regulator of exocytosis. Several findings suggest that cortical F-actin is associated with vesicle targeting but also acts a barrier of vesicle tethering/docking to the target PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muallem et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manneville et al., 2003</xref>), which implies a need for cortical F-actin to be depolymerized for vesicle tethering/docking. In this paper, we present evidence that ROP1 GTPase activity has an active role in the promotion of polarized exocytosis through its regulation of F-actin dynamics. By visualizing the dynamics of exocytic vesicles and vesicle fusion to the PM, we demonstrate the mode of action for F-actin dynamics in polarized exocytosis: RIC4-mediated F-actin assembly is associated with vesicle accumulation at the tip, whereas RIC3-mediated F-actin depolymerization induces exocytosis to the tip. These observations provide important new insights into the cellular mechanism underlying tip growth, as well as roles of actin dynamics in polarized growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>RabA4d accumulation to the tip is highly dynamic in growing pollen tubes</title><p>To understand how vesicle accumulation to the tip is regulated in growing pollen tubes, we used YFP-RabA4d as an exocytic vesicle marker. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> RabA4d is the pollen-specific homologue of RabA4b, which localizes to the plant TGN compartments and/or recycling endosomal vesicles in root hair tips (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801086/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801086/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Preuss et al., 2004</xref>). NtRab11b, a possible tobacco orthologue of RabA4d, has also been shown to localize to the transport vesicle&#x02013;rich apical clear zone in tobacco pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Graaf et al., 2005</xref>). When YFP-RabA4d was expressed stably expressed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen, it preferentially accumulated at the apical clear zone of pollen tubes in an inverted cone shape (Fig. S1 B). A similar localization pattern was also observed in tobacco pollen tubes transiently expressing this construct (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).<italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen tubes exhibited wiggly growth in vitro cultures and variable growth rates, making it difficult for time-lapse imaging analysis. Therefore, for subsequent analyses, we chose to use tobacco pollen tubes, which exhibit a more uniform shape and constant growth rates. Because the apical clear zone is exclusively occupied by exocytic vesicles, the accumulation of YFP-RabA4d in this area suggests the exocytic vesicle localization of YFP-RabA4d. Moreover, the accumulation of YFP-RabA4d in the apical region was rapidly dissipated by brefeldin A (BFA) treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). BFA inhibits secretory vesicle formation in plant and animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kessels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langhans and Robinson, 2007</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that YFP-RabA4d localizes to exocytic vesicles.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of YFP-RabA4d in growing pollen tubes.</bold> (A and B) Representative confocal images of tobacco pollen tubes transiently expressing YFP-RabA4d (A) or GFP as a control (B).

The apical clear zone stained by YFP-RabA4d cycled from spanning against the tube apex with a long trail then retracting to the extreme apex region.

A time series of YFP-RabA4d accumulation to the tip was analyzed on confocal microscopy and compared with pollen tube elongation rates. The relative amount of accumulated vesicle at the apex was quantified by measuring the mean intensity of YFP within 5 &#x003bc;m from the tip (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Quantitative analysis of fluorescence intensity revealed that the signal intensity of YFP-RabA4d changed in a regular oscillatory fashion with a periodicity similar to that of growth rate oscillation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). The mean growth rate and oscillation period was 29.8 nm/s and 67.8 &#x000b1; 9.2 s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9), respectively. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref> shows that the highest correlation occurs when oscillation of the YFP signal leads the growth oscillation by 10 s. The 10-s lead of YFP signal oscillation corresponds to a 53.1 &#x000b1; 7.3&#x000b0; phase shift ahead of growth rate oscillation. Therefore, tip accumulation of YFP-RabA4d is temporally associated with tip growth and leads to growth bursts.</p></sec><sec><title>ROP1 activation is required and sufficient for vesicle accumulation to the extreme apex</title><p>ROP1 is required for pollen tube growth, and ROP1 activity oscillates ahead of tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>), which suggests that ROP1 signaling may regulate vesicle targeting to the tip. To test this possibility, we coexpressed YFP-RabA4d with wild-type ROP1 in tobacco pollen tubes. Compared with control tubes, pollen tubes overexpressing a low level of wild-type ROP1 showed more rapid tip elongation and oscillation of the apical YFP-RabA4d but no remarkable difference in distribution of YFP-RabA4d (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

Compared with control (157.33 &#x000b1; 8.83, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 15), tip accumulation of YFP-RabA4d in a DN-rop1&#x02013;expressing pollen tube was significantly reduced (102.9 &#x000b1; 5.82, P &#x0003c; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 15; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Conversely, constitutively active rop1 (CA-rop1) expression produced tip-focused localization of YFP-RabA4d (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C, c</xref>). Strong YFP signal was detected in the extreme apical region, and distribution of YFP-RabA4d was less extended to the subapical area (193.25 &#x000b1; 12.91, P &#x0003c; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 15; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>).

ROP1 downstream targets (RIC3 and RIC4) counteract to control F-actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>).

RIC4 overexpression stabilizes the apical cortical F-actin and reduces growth polarity in pollen tubes (Fig. S2 C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>). RIC4 overexpression altered the distribution of YFP-RabA4d from the inverted cone shape to a near cup shape (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B, a</xref>). YFP-RabA4d signal right behind the cortex of the apical region was significantly increased, (202.39 &#x000b1; 10.68, P &#x0003c; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 13; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Furthermore, this subcortical accumulation of YFP-RabA4d became less polarized toward the extreme apex, i.e., it was extended beyond the extreme apex. Similar changes in YFP-RabA4d distribution were induced by treatment with LaCl<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B, b</xref>) or jasplakinolide (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B, c</xref>). Together with the requirement of apical F-actin for targeting vesicles to the tip, these results suggest that the RIC4-dependent cortical F-actin in the tip allows the accumulation of vesicles to the cortical and subcortical region of the extreme apex.</p><p>Because the balanced counteraction between the RIC3 and RIC4 pathways results in apical F-actin dynamics, which are important for polarized tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>), we tested whether these F-actin dynamics are required for the normal pattern of vesicle accumulation in the tip. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> (d), LatB treatment recovered the normal vesicle accumulation in RIC4-overexpressing tubes. Similarly, coexpression of RIC3 and RIC4 also resulted in the recovery of normal vesicle accumulation at the tip (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B, e</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that RIC4-dependent F-actin is required for the accumulation of vesicles to the cortical and subcortical region of the extreme apex, whereas the ROP1-dependent F-actin dynamics (resulting from the checks and balances between the RIC3 and RIC4 pathways) are critical for the dynamic accumulation of vesicles in the tip of pollen tubes.</p></sec><sec><title>Development of a FRAP-based method for monitoring exocytosis in pollen tubes</title><p>To monitor exocytic activity at the tip of pollen tubes, we developed a novel strategy involving FRAP of receptor-like kinase (RLK)-GFP, whose targeting to the PM completely depends on exocytosis. GFP was fused to the C terminus of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen-specific RLK and used as a membrane marker protein (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801086/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801086/DC1</ext-link>).

When transiently expressed in tobacco pollen tubes, RLK-GFP preferentially localized to the apical region of the pollen tube PM, although a weaker signal was also observed at the apical region of the cytoplasm as an inverted cone shape (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). This localization pattern of RLK-GFP was similar to that of other proteins that are targeted to the pollen tube PM through exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Graaf et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, PM localization of RLK-GFP was completely disrupted by BFA treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

We photobleached a section of the apical region and monitored the recovery of RLK-GFP fluorescence in the bleached region of the PM every 5 s. We reasoned that the recovery was caused by exocytic activity at the tip of pollen tubes. An example of the FRAP analysis of an RLK-GFP&#x02013;expressing tube is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>. Prior to photobleaching, RLK-GFP appeared as a bright line associated with the PM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, top left). After photobleaching, the fluorescence signal in the apical PM area was reduced to 10% of its original level (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, top middle). GFP signals started to reappear in the apical dome within 30 s and reached &#x0003e;90% of their original intensity 75 s after bleaching (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref> and Video 2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801086/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200801086/DC1</ext-link>). The half-time of fluorescence recovery in the apical membrane area was &#x0223c;35 s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5). The recovery first occurred in the center of the apical dome and then gradually moved laterally (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Furthermore, different regions of the PM apex exhibited a gradient of FRAP rates, with the fastest recovery being in the center of the apical dome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). When a subapical region was bleached, FRAP was negligible (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>; and Video 3). The rate of RLK-GFP FRAP in different regions of the PM was consistent with the expected exocytic activity in the corresponding region of a growing pollen tube. The lack of recovery in the subapical region suggests that RLK-FRAP could not have resulted from either lateral diffusion of PM-localized RLK-GFP or diffusion from cytosolic RLK-GFP. Finally, the dependence of RLK-FRAP on exocytosis was confirmed by our observation that BFA eliminated FRAP (Fig. S3, B and C). Taken together, these results show that the FRAP in the apical region of the PM truly reflects exocytic activity in the tip and is useful for measuring exocytosis to the tip of pollen tubes.</p></sec><sec><title>ROP1 activity controls exocytosis to the site of growth</title><p>Active ROP1 is distributed to the apical region of the PM as an apical cap with a tip-high gradient; this cap determines the growing region of the pollen tube tip and is required for tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>). The apical cap and the gradient of active ROP1 seem to correspond to the apical region showing RLK-GFP FRAP. From these observations, we hypothesized that active ROP1 controls pollen tip growth by modulating the site and the rate of exocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we performed RLK-GFP FRAP experiments on tubes expressing CA-rop1 or DN-rop1. DN-rop1 significantly decreased the rate of fluorescence recovery (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>).

DN-rop1 inhibition of the FRAP was not the result of reduced cell growth because CA-rop1 expression inhibited cell expansion but not the FRAP. Thus, these results indicate that ROP1 inactivation inhibits exocytosis to the site of cell growth and support the hypothesis that ROP1 is required for pollen tube growth at least in part via its role in regulating exocytosis.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>FRAP analysis of RLK-GFP in pollen tubes expressing CA-rop1 or DN-rop1.</bold> (A and C) RLK-GFP was coexpressed with DN-rop1 (A) or CA-rop1 (C) in tobacco pollen tubes.

Even 3 min after photobleaching, only 10% of the original fluorescence was recovered in the tip membrane. Similar results were observed in LaCl<sub>3</sub>- or jasplakinolide-treated pollen tubes (Fig. S5).

We show that RIC4 activation of F-actin assembly is necessary for vesicle accumulation to the tip, whereas the RIC3-dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signal reduces vesicle accumulation at the tip, though its role in activating F-actin disassembly is required for vesicle exocytosis to the growth site. These results together with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>) provide strong evidence that ROP1-mediated F-actin dynamics play an important role in spatiotemporal coordination of vesicle targeting and exocytosis, leading to polarized cell growth. Actin dynamics have also been shown to be critical for exocytosis in animal cells, and Rho GTPases are well known to control polarized growth in fungi and neuronal cells through their regulation of actin dynamics. The Rho GTPase&#x02013;actin dynamics&#x02013;exocytosis pathway we established might also provide a mechanism for the control of exocytosis and polarized cell growth in these systems.</p><sec><title>Oscillatory apical vesicle accumulation is temporally associated with pollen tip growth</title><p>Our result showed a dynamic localization pattern of YFP-RabA4d in the apical clear zone of pollen tubes. The apical clear zone is exclusively occupied by exocytic vesicles that are accumulated in an inverted cone pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Graaf et al., 2005</xref>), which is identical to the YFP-RabA4d localization we showed in this study. The effect of BFA on the YFP-RabA4d localization pattern strongly suggests a Golgi-derived secretory vesicle localization of this fusion protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). However, these observations do not exclude the possibility that YFP-RabA4d was also present in recycling endocytic vesicles. FM4-64&#x02013;stained endosomal vesicles that are recycled back to the PM by exocytosis also accumulate in an inverted cone shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camacho and Malho, 2003</xref>). YFP-RabA4d could be localized to both TGN-derived secretory vesicles and recycling endosomal vesicles that are targeted to and fused with the apical PM for tip growth in pollen tubes. Regardless of the secretory or endosomal nature of the RabA4d vesicles, their localization pattern suggests that they represent exocytic vesicles accumulated to the apical clear zone. The exocytic nature of these vesicles is also supported by the dynamics of their accumulation to the tip. On visualizing vesicles using YFP-RabA4d, we demonstrated that the RabA4d vesicle accumulation to the tip oscillates in the same periodicity as the tip growth oscillation. Interestingly, the peak of the RabA4d vesicle accumulation precedes the growth burst by &#x0223c;10 s in a 68-s period of oscillation, which is consistent with the notion that their exocytosis results in pollen tube growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Tip-localized ROP1 controls tip growth by modulating tip-targeted exocytosis</title><p>Tip growth requires spatiotemporal coordination of exocytic vesicle targeting, tethering, and fusion to the apical PM region, but the mechanism underlying this coordination is not well understood. Many data indicate that ROP1 and its orthologues control pollen tube tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klahre et al., 2006</xref>). Our evidence suggests that ROP GTPase does so by regulating both tip-targeted vesicle accumulation and exocytosis. First, the apical accumulation of RabA4d vesicles oscillate with the same period as both the oscillation of the apical ROP1 activity and pollen tube elongation rates but in a phase that is between the two (this paper; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>). Second, DN-rop1 impaired vesicle accumulation to the tip, whereas CA-rop1 expression promoted the RabA4d vesicle accumulation to the apical region, causing the movement of more RabA4d vesicles closer to the apical PM region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, the tip-localized active ROP1 promotes the targeting and/or capturing of exocytic vesicles to the cortical region of the pollen tube tip.</p><p>ROP1 activity also plays an important role in the spatiotemporal control of vesicle exocytosis. Using FRAP analysis, we showed that vesicle exocytosis is highly active in the apical cap of the PM, where active ROP is localized. The rate of exocytosis forms a tip-high gradient, which corresponds to the gradient of active ROP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly CA-rop1 expression induced depolarization of exocytosis, which is consistent with its induction of depolarized distribution of active ROP to the PM and growth depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>). Our observations are in the line with the fact that ROP1 activity spatially predicts the site and direction of tip growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, we propose that the tip-localized ROP1 activity spatiotemporally coordinates the targeting and exocytosis of vesicles to the apical PM region, resulting in tip growth.</p><p>Rho GTPase coordination of polar accumulation and exocytosis of vesicles to tip-growing sites may be a common mechanism for the control of tip growth in various systems. ROP GTPase has also been shown to control polarized tip growth in root hairs, a process also known to require ROP downstream signaling events such as tip-focused calcium gradient and tip-localized F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molendijk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2002</xref>). Rho GTPases such as Cdc42 are also known to regulate exocytosis in yeast and filamentous fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo et al., 2001</xref>). In yeast, Cdc42 has been shown to regulate exocytosis by activating exocyst, a protein complex involved in the tethering of exocytic vesicles to the PM. Cdc42 also activates the Arp2/3 complex that nucleates actin to form actin patches, but it is unclear whether actin patches are involved in vesicle accumulation to the growing site. However, Cdc42 signaling appears to indirectly influence the formation of actin cables that are thought to be important for targeting of exocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 2007</xref>). Rho GTPases have also been shown to regulate tip growth in filamentous fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2004</xref>). Although their mode of action is unclear, it would not be surprising that they also regulate vesicle targeting and exocytosis in these fungi.</p></sec><sec><title>ROP1-mediated F-actin dynamics spatiotemporally coordinate vesicle targeting and fusion to the tip</title><p>Our results suggest that tip-localized ROP1 signaling coordinates the accumulation and exocytosis of vesicles to the tip of pollen tubes through ROP1-dependent actin dynamics. Pollen tube tips contain a cortical actin meshwork localized to the extreme tip and a cortical actin fringe behind this network (Fig. S2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbon et al.,1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lovy-Wheeler et al., 2005</xref>). Our previous work shows that ROP1 controls pollen tube tip growth through its regulation of the dynamics of these F-actin structures and their oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>). ROP1 not only activates RIC4 to promote the assembly of the apical F-actin but also activates the RIC3&#x02013;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pathway to promote the disassembly of the apical F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>). By manipulating agents in these two pathways, we show that the RIC4-dependent F-actin is required for the accumulation of exocytic vesicles to the region near the cortex of the pollen tube tip. We propose that RIC4-mediated F-actin generates the force required for vesicles to be targeted to a region near the cortex. Colocalization of RabA4d with the cortical actin meshwork in RIC4-overexpressing tubes suggests that the meshwork is important for vesicle accumulation, but a role for the actin fringe in this process is also possible.</p><p>Our results also suggest that the RIC4-dependent cortical F-actin inhibits the exocytosis of the vesicles targeted by the RIC4-dependent mechanism. RIC4 overexpression almost completely inhibited vesicle fusion to the PM, despite inducing accumulation of exocytic vesicles near the cortex. RIC4-dependent cortical actin meshwork presumably blocks vesicle tethering to the PM. Moreover, our results suggest that the RIC3&#x02013;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent pathway promoting depolymerization of this meshwork is also required for vesicle exocytosis to the apical PM.</p><p>From the results presented here, we propose a model in which ROP GTPase-dependent F-actin dynamics function as a key regulator of polarized tip growth through two counteracting pathways regulating F-actin assembly and disassembly, which spatiotemporally coordinate targeted vesicle accumulation and exocytosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The spatial coordination of these two cellular processes is achieved through the formation of the active ROP1 cap in the tip of pollen tubes, which activates the RIC4-mediated assembly in the apical cortex of pollen tubes as well as the RIC3-mediated formation of a tip-focused Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> gradient that in turn leads to disassembly of the apical F-actin. The temporal coordination of vesicle targeting and exocytosis involves the time delay of the RIC3&#x02013;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pathway so that F-actin&#x02013;dependent vesicle targeting is temporally followed by exocytosis requiring the RIC3&#x02013;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;dependent actin depolymerization. RIC4-mediated F-actin assembly oscillates in a phase slightly behind the apical ROP1 activity but well ahead of the growth burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>). In this paper, we show that the apical accumulation of exocytic vesicles oscillates in a phase also ahead of growth burst. The Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> gradient is known to oscillate in a phase slightly behind the growth burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Messerli et al., 2000</xref>) and thus is clearly behind that of the apical F-actin, though both act downstream of ROP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2005</xref>). The time delay for the RIC3&#x02013;calcium pathway allows for the RIC4-dependent assembly of the apical F-actin, which mediates the apical accumulation of exocytic vesicles. The F-actin blockage of these vesicles from tethering to the apical PM is then released when subsequent activation of the RIC3&#x02013;calcium pathway leads to the disassembly of the apical F-actin, which induces a burst of exocytosis. The RIC3-mediated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> may also play a role in activating vesicle fusion, although this has not been demonstrated in pollen tubes. Thus, this spatiotemporal coordination of vesicle targeting and exocytosis also explains the oscillatory nature of pollen tube tip growth.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>A model for the coordination of vesicle transport and exocytosis by ROP1-dependent actin dynamics during oscillatory pollen tip growth.</bold> (A) Pollen tip growth is controlled by locally distributed ROP1 activity through its effect on actin assembly and disassembly at the tip of pollen tubes. ROP1 is activated at the apical region of the PM, and active ROP1 subsequently activates two distinct pathways. The RIC4 pathway promotes F-actin assembly required for the accumulation of exocytic vesicles to the tip but inhibits vesicle exocytosis to the apical PM (orange). Meanwhile, ROP1 also activates the RIC3&#x02013;calcium pathway. As RIC3-dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels rise, the tip F-actin is depolymerized, and vesicles can then tether on and fuse with the PM. This event is accompanied by reduced vesicle accumulation in the tip (blue). The RIC3 and RIC4 pathways counteract to control F-actin dynamics and consequently coordinate vesicle targeting and exocytosis.

Tip-localized active ROP1 activates both RIC4 and RIC3, respectively, leading to rapid actin assembly and a delayed Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> gradient formation and actin disassembly. We propose that when F-actin is assembled, vesicles are targeted to the tip, but do not dock and fuse to the PM until the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> level is high to disassemble cortical F-actin. The exact timing of vesicle exocytosis has yet to be determined, but is expected to be in phase with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, which slightly lags behind tip expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Messerli et al., 2000</xref>). If so, the PM at the tip may be stretched during the tip expansion, and the compensatory exocytosis should immediately follow the tip expansion, which could explain why Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> slightly lags behind the tip expansion.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1811155f07"></graphic></fig><p>Our findings beg an interesting future question: Is the coordinate regulation of vesicle targeting and exocytosis by the ROP1-dependent actin dynamics coupled to additional ROP1-dependent pathways? One potential pathway is the tethering of exocytic vesicles through exocyst, which is known to tether exocytic vesicles in yeast and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beronja et al., 2005</xref>). Exocyst components have been genetically shown to be essential for tip growth in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cole et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Synek et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly a recent study has implicated a novel ROP effector, ICR1, interacting with the SEC3 homologue of an exocyst component, which suggests that ROPs could be involved in regulating the tethering of exocytic vesicles through exocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lavy et al., 2007</xref>). This potential ROP downstream pathway would be analogous to the yeast Cdc42 interaction with SEC3 to recruit exocyst to the site of polar growth in yeast.</p><p>Our findings may also have a broad implication in understanding the regulation of exocytosis in other eukaryotic cells because the dual role of F-actin dynamics in vesicle targeting and exocytosis may provide a paradigm for the cellular control of exocytosis in eukaryotic cells. Evidence from mammalian cells apparently supports this hypothesis. Actin assembly and disassembly have both been implicated in the regulation of exocytosis in mammalian cells, in which actin was found to both mediate movement of and hinder exocytosis of secretory granules in the subplasmalemmal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lang et al., 2000</xref>). In neuroendocrine cells, treatment with low concentrations of LatB increases secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gasman et al., 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, further studies should determine how common the actin dynamics coordination of vesicle targeting and exocytosis is in eukaryotic cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> plants were grown in growth chambers at 22&#x000b0;C under 12 h of dark/12 h of light.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA manipulation and plasmid construction</title><p>All plasmids used for transient expression in pollen were constructed in a pLAT52 vector as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). cDNA for the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pollen-expressed RLK was amplified by PCR with gene-specific primers (5&#x02032;-GCTCTAGAATGCCTCCCATGCAGGCG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CGGGATCCGGTTAAGCAAGAAGATCAC-3&#x02032;) and subcloned into a pLAT52:GFP vector.</p></sec><sec><title>Particle bombardment&#x02013;mediated transient expression in tobacco pollen</title><p>Mature pollen grains collected from tobacco plants were used for transient expression with a particle bombardment procedure as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2001</xref>). 1 &#x003bc;g YFP-RabA4d or 0.5 &#x003bc;g LAT52:RLK-GFP plasmid DNA was used to coat the 0.5-mg gold particles.
