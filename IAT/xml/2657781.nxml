In epithelial tissues, apoptotic cells loose their apical/basal polarity and are extruded from the epithelium. We used the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo as a system to investigate the regulation of components of the zonula adherens during apoptosis.

Arm is cleaved by caspases in embryo extracts and we provide evidence that the caspase-3 homolog drICE cleaves Arm in vitro and in vivo. Cleavage by drICE creates a stable protein fragment that remains associated with the plasma membrane early in apoptosis. To further understand the role of caspase-mediated cleavage of Arm, we examined potential caspase cleavage sites and found that drICE cleaves Arm at a unique DQVD motif in the N-terminal domain of the protein. Mutation of the drICE cleavage site in Arm results in a protein that is not cleaved in vitro and in vivo.

The main features of the apoptotic cell phenotype are the condensation of the cytoplasm, breakdown of nuclear integrity, cell rounding, membrane blebbing, and in epithelial cells the loss of cell polarity and cell junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These morphological changes are caused by proteolytic cleavage of key proteins by a group of aspartate-specific cystein proteases, called caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Active caspases recognize and cleave their target proteins at defined tetra-peptide motifs; the cleavage site being located after an aspartate residue in the C-terminal most P1 position of a given tetra-peptide motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Cleavage of the substrates can lead to their inactivation or activation. For example, cleavage of ICAD (Inhibitor of caspase activated DNAse) releases the active CAD endonuclease, which triggers DNA fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, cleavage of Rho-associated Kinase-1 (ROCK-1) by caspase-3 leads to an activated form of the kinase that promotes membrane blebbing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although many caspase substrates have been identified by proteomic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the overall mechanisms and cellular consequences of target cleavage remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Early during apoptosis in epithelia, cells lose contact and are extruded by the neighbouring cells in a active process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. While many cell adhesion molecules are cleaved by caspases in vitro, the relevance of such cleavage has not been addressed in vivo mostly due to the lack of a genetically tractable system. We have employed early <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryos as a model to follow the fate of the cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complex during apoptosis. The first epithelium formed in <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryogenesis is the blastoderm epithelium, a simple epithelial monolayer. A large part of the blastoderm epithelium matures gradually into the ectodermal epithelial sheet and the integrity of this epithelium depends on the activity of the cadherin-catenin system of cell adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin, Arm (beta-catenin), and <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin accumulate in adherens junctions and form a typical apical belt-like structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Cadherins and catenins form stable Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cell adhesion between epithelial cells and are instructive to organize the apical actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin and Arm are essential to mediate cell adhesion during the establishment of cell junctions in early development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the fate of the individual components of the cadherin-catenin system during apoptosis and to determine the functional relevance of their modification by caspases. The mutation <italic>thread (th) </italic>provides a good tool to study morphological changes in apoptotic cells, because the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction in the absence of <italic>th </italic>has been well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>th </italic>encodes for the cellular caspase inhibitor DIAP1, which is essential for the survival of all cells in the early embryo. Embryos homozygous for <italic>th </italic>loss of function alleles develop normally until mid-gastrulation, however shortly after this stage all cells undergo apoptosis because of unrestrained caspase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. One early response of apoptotic cells in DIAP1 null mutants is a change in cell shape associated with an apparent loss in epithelial polarity and cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We show that full length <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin and Arm are cleared from the membrane, while <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin is more stable during apoptosis. Arm is proteolytically cleaved by z-VAD-FMK sensitive proteases present in embryo extract from apoptotic cells. We present evidence that Arm is cleaved by the caspase-3 homolog drICE, and determined a DQVD motif as specific caspase cleavage site within the N-terminus of Arm. Our results show that cleavage of Arm results in a truncated C-terminal Arm cleavage product, Arm<sup>&#x00394;N </sup>that maintains its localization with <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin even after the onset of apoptotic responses. Cleavage of Arm can be prevented in apoptotic cells by a single amino acid exchange in the N-terminal DQVD motif. Expression of caspase-resistant Arm in the embryo leads to a delay of the removal of <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin from the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells. These data suggested that drICE-specific cleavage of Arm is responsible for the loss of <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin from cell junctions and thus might contribute to the degeneration of epithelial integrity during apoptosis. However we find that Arm<sup>&#x00394;N </sup>is still able to mediate cell adhesion in an <italic>arm </italic>mutant background. Therefore caspase cleavage of Arm does not render Arm non-functional suggesting that in addition to Arm cleavage other modification of the protein complex is required for the down-regulation of cadherin-dependent cell adhesion in apoptotic epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Arm is degraded in apoptotic cells</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila </italic>cellular blastoderm embryo is composed of a simple epithelial monolayer covering a central yolk cell. The blastoderm epithelium undergoes a variety of morphogenetic movements during gastrulation including ventral furrow formation and germ band extension. To study the effects of caspase activation on these primary epithelial cells, we examined the components of the cadherin/catenin adhesion system in apoptotic cells using embryos homozygous for the DIAP1 loss-of-function mutation <italic>th</italic><sup>109</sup>. We have shown before that DIAP1 mutant embryos undergo a complete and sudden block of all morphogenetic movements at the onset of germ band extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. All cells in DIAP1mutant embryos exhibit typical features of apoptosis, such as DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, cell rounding and membrane blebbing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Unlike in wildtype embryos where apoptosis is not detectable during gastrulation, in gastrulating DIAP1 mutant embryos all cells become TUNEL-positive and accumulate high levels of processed caspase indicating that all cells have undergone apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, E, F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>DIAP1 loss of function mutation results in altered cell polarity and adhesion</bold>.

We discriminate between two distinct developmental time points in DIAP1 mutant embryos: (1) The early stage, that lasts about 30 min after the first signs of the morphogenetic block (cephalic furrow formation + 45 min, represents developmental stage 8) and (2) The late stage, an hour after the morphogenetic block occurred (cephalic furrow formation + 60 min, corresponds to developmental stage 9). In wildtype or <italic>th</italic><sup>109 </sup>heterozygotes, these markers label the cells circumference at different levels along the apical to basal axis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G, H, I, J</xref>). In DIAP1 mutants, the distribution of the marker proteins is strongly impaired. In early stages of apoptosis, Baz and <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin are still detected at the cell surface, albeit at lower levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K, L, N</xref>). Nrt can no longer be detected at the cell surface, suggesting that full-length Nrt is rapidly degraded during apoptosis and thus represents an early marker for apoptotic cells in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M</xref>). In late stages of apoptosis, cells in DIAP1 mutants show low levels for all three markers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1O, P, Q, R</xref>). Only Baz immunoreactivity can still be detected in a punctate staining pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1P</xref>). We conclude that components of the subapical region and the adherens junctions become redistributed and presumably degraded during apoptosis.</p><p>To gain a better picture of the redistribution and disassembly of adherens junctions during apoptosis, we took a closer look at the distribution and the protein levels of <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin and Arm in DIAP1 mutant embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In wildtype and <italic>th</italic><sup>109 </sup>heterozygotes, <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin and Arm co-localise in apical adherens junctions, the zonula adherens (ZA) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>). At the late stage of apoptosis (&#x0003e;60 min after the onset of the morphogenetic arrest), cells have rounded up and exhibit only low levels of Arm protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D, D'</xref>). Similarly, <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin is strongly reduced and is predominantly found in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, E', F, F'</xref>). The change in the subcellular localization of junctional proteins in apoptotic cells parallels the changes in overall levels of the full-length proteins. In the early apoptotic stage the levels of full-length <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin and Arm protein are strongly reduced, while <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin levels remain largely unimpaired (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). In the late stage, both Arm and <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin amounts are further reduced. Indeed, the full-length Arm protein is at the limit of detection in late apoptotic embryos suggesting that Arm is efficiently degraded during apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin appears very stable in early apoptotic cells; this result is consistent with the persistent membrane localization of <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin in the early stage of apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1N</xref>). We conclude that during apoptosis the components of the cadherin/catenin system are progressively degraded and eventually redistributed from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Arm is degraded during apoptosis</bold>.

To determine whether the observed cleavage of <sup>35</sup>S-Lamin Dmo was based upon caspase activity, we employed the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. When zVAD-FMK was added to the extract prior to incubation with <sup>35</sup>S-Lamin Dmo, cleavage of Lamin was completely abolished (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane d).

(A) Cleavage of Arm and Lamin Dmo by embryonic extracts in vitro. <sup>35</sup>S-labeled Arm (lane a-c) or Lamin Dmo (d-f) was incubated with protein extracts of wildtype embryos (wt extract; c, f) or extracts prepared from embryos obtained from <italic>th</italic><sup>109 </sup>heterozygous flies (1/4 of the embryos are homozygous for <italic>th</italic><sup>109 </sup>indicated as <italic>th</italic><sup>109 </sup>extract; b, e). The <italic>th</italic><sup>109 </sup>extract contains proteolytic activity that leads to quantitative degradation of Lamin Dmo (e) and Arm (b). <sup>35</sup>S-labeled Arm appears as a range of bands suggesting premature termination during in vitro translation. Arm cleavage results in proteolytic fragments with the apparent M<sub>r </sub>between 90 kDa and 70 kDa suggesting N-terminal cleavage of all isoforms produced in vitro (bracket in b). Addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK completely prevents degradation of Arm (a) and Lamin Dmo (d).

Both, the initial <sup>35</sup>S-Arm substrate and the cleavage product were found to represent several bands, which were likely to be produced by premature termination during the in vitro translation reaction. Again, cleavage was based on zVAD-sensitive protease activity in the extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane a). We conclude that Arm is cleaved in vitro by a zVAD-sensitive protease, most likely reflecting caspase activity, which is present in extracts from DIAP1 mutant embryos, but not in extracts made from wildtype embryos.

To determine which of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>effector caspase cleaves Arm, we performed experiments with recombinant, bacterially produced caspase-3 homologues drICE and DCP1. <sup>35</sup>S-Arm was incubated with different amounts of caspases and the stability of Arm protein was determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). drICE was able to cleave Arm into a stable 90 kDa fragment while DCP1 did not cleave Arm under these conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Cleavage of <sup>35</sup>S-Arm by drICE was completely blocked by addition of zVAD-FMK to the assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C, a,b</xref>). We conclude that Arm is cleaved by drICE releasing a stable protein fragment, which corresponds in size to the fragment produced in the embryo lysate assay. These results suggest that the activity of the apoptotic embryo extract, which cleaves Arm, might represent endogenous drICE activity (see below).

To determine which of the five potential caspase cleavage motifs in Arm was used by drICE, we performed an in vitro mutagenesis experiment. The Arm cDNA sequence encoding putative caspase cleavage motifs was altered to create missense mutations changing Asp to Ala at P1; such mutations render these cleavage motifs non-functional. We mutated a putative cleavage site just N-terminal to the Arm repeats (ArmD170A and ArmD172A), a region that was shown to be crucial for <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Another potential motif C-terminal to the <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin binding region was also mutated (ArmD755A; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Furthermore, we mutated the cleavage sites DQVD<sup>88 </sup>(ArmD88A) and TQFD<sup>123 </sup>(ArmD123A) in the N-terminus of Arm. The various mutated forms of Arm were radio-labelled and subjected to drICE cleavage in vitro. Mutations of the non-conserved motifs had no inhibitory effect on the cleavage and always lead to stable 90 kDa products as seen with wildtype Arm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Even mutation of the conserved TQFD<sup>123 </sup>motif did not prevent cleavage by drICE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). However cleavage was completely abolished when the DQVD<sup>88 </sup>motif was altered by the mutation D88A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><p>To test whether Arm is indeed cleaved at DQVD<sup>88 </sup>in the embryo, we generated transgenic flies that allow conditional expression of the mutated drICE-resistant variant of Arm, Arm<sup>D88A</sup>.

These results indicate that Arm is cleaved in the N-terminal domain during apoptosis. Furthermore, cleavage of Arm in apoptotic cells can be prevented by mutation of a single caspase consensus site in the N-terminal half of the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Cleaved Arm remains associated with the cell surface in apoptotic cells</title><p>The in vitro data in combination with the over-expression data indicated that drICE-mediated removal of the N-terminal 88 amino acids leads to a stable cleavage product at a size of approximately 90 kDa. This result is in contrast to the findings described in the beginning where we found a strong decrease of Arm levels in DIAP1 mutant cells. However, since the commonly used monoclonal antibody 7A1 is directed against the N-terminus of the protein, cleavage at DQVD<sup>88 </sup>is predicted to remove the epitope for this antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus the observed decrease in the level of full length Arm in DIAP1 mutant cells might reflect the removal of the epitope of the anti-Arm<sup>Nterm </sup>antibody rather than a decrease in the total amount of Arm protein.</p><p>Because the specificity of the anti-Arm<sup>Nterm </sup>antibody might prevent detection of an N-terminally truncated Arm cleavage product, we raised a polyclonal antibody against the central domain of Arm (amino acids 172&#x02013;755) referred to as anti-Arm<sup>Central </sup>antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The specificity of the anti-Arm<sup>Central </sup>antibody was determined by immunofluorescence as well as by immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In early embryos, anti-Arm<sup>Central </sup>immunoreactivity always co-localised with the staining obtained with anti-Arm<sup>Nterm </sup>(data not shown).

We conclude that the anti-Arm<sup>Central </sup>antibody recognizes full length Arm protein in <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryos.</p><p>The anti-Arm<sup>Central </sup>antibody allowed us to determine whether a stable Arm cleavage product was generated in the embryo. We performed a Western analysis of extracts obtained from hand-selected DIAP1 mutant embryos at the late apoptotic stage. While in wildtype embryos only full-length Arm can be detected, additional forms of the protein appear in DIAP1 mutantembryos; the most prominent form with an apparent molecular weight of around 90 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The 90 kDa form of Arm is stable as it persists until the late stage of apoptosis, at time points when full length Arm is no longer detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C, D, H</xref>). This experiment demonstrates the presence of a cleavage product of Arm at around 90 kDa in apoptotic cells. Strikingly, the 90 kDa fragment is not recognized by the anti Arm<sup>Nterm </sup>antibody in extracts of apoptotic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). Together these results strongly suggest that the 90 kDa fragment might indeed represent the N-terminal Arm fragment produced by drICE.</p><p>To determine the subcellular localization of the 90 kDa Arm fragment, DIAP1 mutant cells were co-stained with anti-Arm<sup>Nterm</sup>, anti-Arm<sup>Central </sup>and anti <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C&#x02013;J</xref>). While in early DIAP1 mutant embryos full-length Arm is not associated with the cell surface anymore, the anti-Arm<sup>Central </sup>antibody shows a clear localization along the periphery of the cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C, D</xref>). Interestingly, the staining of the anti-Arm<sup>Central </sup>antibody co-localised with <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin suggesting that the cleaved Arm fragment is still associated with <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D&#x02013;F</xref>).

These data suggest that N-terminal truncation of Arm at D88 does not completely abolish the adhesive function of the protein.

While the molecular pathways that control the execution of cell death as well as the activation and the activity of caspases have been studied in great detail, the events downstream of the execution, namely the function of individual target cleavage by caspases, are just beginning to emerge. The central question in this field is how caspase cleavage alters the activity of the proteins to orchestrate the changes in the morphology and the physiology of the dying cell. The cellular differentiation triggered by caspases might also be of interest defining the emerging role of caspases in processes unrelated to apoptosis like cell communication and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The present study demonstrates that cell death in DIAP1 mutant <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryos represents a well-defined model system to study the specificity and function of caspase targets in apoptotic cells. DCP1 and drICE are activated in DIAP1 mutant embryos and DIAP1-dependent cell death in the early embryo requires the activity of drICE and DCP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The activation of caspases in DIAP1 deficient embryos depends on the Apaf-1 homolog Dark and the CARD-domain caspase DRONC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Dronc and Dark are required for most cell death throughout the <italic>Drosophila </italic>life cycle as only little cell death occurs in loss-of-function mutants for the respective genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The requirement of Dark and Dronc for DIAP1-dependent cell death indicates that cell death in DIAP1 deficient embryos is under similar control as naturally occurring cell death.</p><p>drICE and DCP-1 are the closest relatives to caspase 3, the major effector caspase in vertebrates. Although DCP1 is highly related to drICE and exhibits very similar substrate specificity, Arm is cleaved by drICE, but not DCP1 in vitro. These results suggest that DCP1 and drICE, despite all similarities described so far, have distinct substrate specificities. Consistent with this conclusion, DCP1 and drICE exhibit both overlapping and differential functions: While some cells in the embryo require both DCP1 and drICE for apoptosis, some cell types require either of these caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The cleavage product of Arm obtained by drICE in vitro has the same apparent molecular weight as the cleavage product detected in apoptotic cells in embryo extracts of DIAP1 mutants. Mutation of the DQVD<sup>88 </sup>motif to DQVA<sup>88 </sup>renders the protein resistant to cleavage both in vitro and in vivo, providing strong evidence that in apoptotic cells Arm is cleaved at DQVD<sup>88</sup>. In conjunction with the observations that drICE is highly expressed in the early embryo, is activated in DIAP1 mutant embryos and is required for cell death in DIAP1 mutant embryos, the results demonstrate that Arm is specifically cleaved by drICE in <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryonic apoptotic cells.</p><p>The DQVD motif is conserved in insects but it is not in vertebrate homologs of beta-catenin. Strikingly however an important caspase cleavage site has been determined in mammalian cells at a similar position (ADID93) suggesting that although the sequence has not been conserved, the position of the caspase cleavage site within the N-terminal domain of the protein has been conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Moreover sequence analysis of beta-catenin throughout the animal kingdom revealed predicted caspase cleavage sites at very similar positions within the N-terminal domain of beta-catenin homologs in fish, cephalochordata, annelida and nemertea (M&#x000fc;ller, unpublished data). These observations support the idea that N-terminal truncation of beta-catenin by caspases might represent an important mechanism in morphological changes that occur during apoptosis of epithelial cells.</p><p>In cultured epithelial cells, E-cadherin is subject to extra- and intracellular degradation after induction of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Our results suggest that removal of the N-terminal peptide does not abolish the adhesive function of Arm. This result is not unexpected as the <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin as well as <italic>D</italic>&#x003b1;-catenin binding domains of Arm are not affected by drICE cleavage. Previous studies in mammalian cells are consistent with our data in that the central Arm repeats region remains unaffected by caspase cleavage. Moreover, when anoikis is induced in human breast epithelial cell lines or MDCK cells, only beta-catenin is degraded, while &#x003b1;-catenin and E-cadherin remained uncleaved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In this case, the truncated forms of beta-catenin were still able to bind E-cadherin and &#x003b1;-catenin, but still might not be able to compensate for the normal function of full-length beta-catenin in cell junctions. It is interesting to note in this context that N-terminally truncated Arm when localized in the cytoplasm is constitutively active for Wg/Wnt signalling, since it lacks phosphorylation sites for Zeste White-3 Kinase and Casein Kinase 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Since Wg signalling is required for cell survival, activated Arm in the cytoplasm might suppress apoptosis; this mechanism provides an alternative explanation for the rescue potential of Arm<sup>&#x00394;<italic>N</italic>-88 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Does cleavage of the N-terminus of Arm by drICE contribute to the destabilisation of adherens junctions during apoptosis? To directly address this question we asked whether cleavage by drICE results in inactivation of the adhesive function of Arm by over expressing drICE resistant Arm in DIAP1 mutant embryos. Although Arm<sup>D88A </sup>expression delayed apoptosis, expression of wild-type Arm delayed the onset of apoptosis to a similar degree and thus this experiment did not reveal a specific function of Arm cleavage by caspases (Kessler and M&#x000fc;ller, unpublished results). Therefore it is not possible to determine directly whether cleavage by drICE leads to inactivation of Arm, because over expression of a caspase substrate per se might quench caspase activity resulting in a delay of the onset of apoptosis.</p><p>One potential effect of Arm cleavage could be the release of an N-terminal fragment that might actively interfere with the stability of the cadherin-catenin complex in adherens junctions. For example it has been shown in a human tissue culture system that the N-terminal domain of beta-catenin can bind to the central region of beta-catenin and might thereby interfere with its binding to cadherins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. However our biochemical analyses failed to provide evidence for the presence of such a stable N-terminal fragment in apoptotic cells. An alternative possibility is that drICE-mediated cleavage of Arm results in a reduction of its binding properties to <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin. This model would also explain the delay in the removal of <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin from the plasma membrane upon expression of the drICE-resistant form of Arm and is also consistent with a recent report showing that <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin is delocalised in DIAP1 mutant embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Most notably, this study also suggested that cleavage of Arm might act upstream of the down-regulation of the cadherin-catenin complex during apoptosis. The data presented here suggest that cleavage of the Arm N-terminal domain by drICE leads to a disruption of its interaction with <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin and/or with other yet to be defined components of the adherens junctions that are affecting the association of the cadherin-catenin complex in apoptotic cells. For example, deletion of the N-terminus might impair the capability of <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin to bind to the central Arm repeats as shown for human beta-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. It will therefore be interesting to define the nature of this potential intra-molecular interaction and to determine whether the N-terminus binds additional regulatory proteins that are involved in the adhesive properties of beta-catenin in epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our work addresses the question which caspase targets trigger changes in cell adhesion and adherens junctions when polarized epithelial cells undergo apoptosis. We demonstrate that beta-catenin (Armadillo) is a direct target of the caspase drICE in <italic>Drosophila </italic>epithelial apoptotic cells. Cleavage of Arm by drICE is specific for a single caspase consensus site located in the amino-terminal domain of the protein. Mutation of this site results in a caspase-resistant form of Arm, which remains intact when expressed in apoptotic cells. Expression of caspase-resistant Arm in apoptotic cells delays disassembly of <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin from cell junctions. We therefore conclude that cleavage of Arm is an important event for dismantling of epithelial cells during apoptosis. This study also highlights that functional analyses of specific caspase target cleavage events in apoptosis can be complicated because of the complexity of proteolytic cleavages by caspases required to disassemble large protein complexes such as adherens junctions. The apoptosis model of DIAP1 deficient embryos that was used in this study provides the opportunity of a systems approach to caspase cleavage that might be able to explain the biochemical mechanisms responsible for this terminal differentiation process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Molecular cloning and site directed mutagenesis</title><p>Molecular cloning was performed after standard protocols.

To verify that Arm<sup>Central </sup>antibodies do recognize Arm from embryo protein extracts, <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin/catenin complexes were immunoprecipitated using the mouse monoclonal Arm<sup>Nterm </sup>7A1, rabbit anti Arm<sup>Central </sup>and rat anti <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin antibodies and subsequent western blotting using 7A1 and Arm<sup>Central </sup>antibodies. Embryo lysates were prepared through grinding embryos in ice-cold CHAPS buffer (0,2% CHAPS, 10 mM Di-thiotreitol (DTT), 100 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, 20% Sucrose). Actin was used as a standard, because it represents an abundant protein in early embryos. We found that actin appears to be stable in <italic>th</italic><sup>109 </sup>apoptotic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistology</title><p>For immunofluorescence, embryos were fixed either by the heat/methanol method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or with 4% Paraformaldehyd in PBS (in case of TUNEL staining). Primary antibodies used for immunohistology were: mouse-anti-Arm<sup>Nterm </sup>7A1 (DSHB 1:10), rat-anti-<italic>D</italic>E-cadherin (DSHB 1:20), mouse anti Neurotactin (DSHB 1:10), rat anti <italic>D&#x003b1;</italic>-catenin (1:20), rabbit anti Arm<sup>Central </sup>(1:250), mouse anti Flag M5 (Sigma, 1:1000), mouse anti En (DSHB 1:10) and rabbit anti beta-galactosidase (1:5000) or mouse anti beta-galactosidase (DSHB 1:100). TUNEL staining was performed as described before using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche, Mannheim;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>cleavage of Arm</title><p><sup>35</sup>S-labeled Arm protein was in vitro translated using the T7/T3 rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) using cDNAs of full-length or Arm variants, respectively. Extracts of wildtype or <italic>th</italic><sup>109</sup>/TM3[<italic>ftz</italic>::<italic>lacZ] </italic>embryos were made under conditions previously shown to keep caspases active in these extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. <sup>35</sup>S-labelled Arm proteins were incubated with 30 &#x003bc;g of extracted protein for 4 h on 30&#x000b0;C. The reaction was stopped though boiling in SDS sample buffer and the sample was subjected to SDS PAGE following autoradiography. Cleavage of the Arm protein was blocked by addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK at 20 nmol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. For experiments with the recombinant proteins, His-tagged versions of drICE, DCP1 and Decay were induced in BL21pLysS bacteria and purified under native conditions as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Plasmids were a generous gift of Soon Yi Yoo and Bruce Hay (Caltech, USA). Various amounts of caspases were used for cleavage of Arm as indicated. For all experiments in vitro translated Lamin Dmo protein was used as a positive control for active caspases in the extracts and in the purified recombinant caspase fractions. Cleavage of Lamin Dmo protein by caspases has been described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The plasmid encoding <italic>Drosophila </italic>Lamin Dmo was a kind gift of Paul Fischer (Stony Brook, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Drosophila genetics</title><p>Fly work and embryo collections were performed after standard protocols. Apoptotic cells were recorded in embryos homozygous for the DIAP1 null allele <italic>th</italic><sup>109</sup>, which carries a nonsense mutation in the N-terminus resulting in a protein lacking all known functional domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. As controls, Oregon R or <italic>w</italic><sup>1118 </sup>embryos were examined. Transgenic lines carrying a <italic>UAS::Arm</italic><sup><italic>D88A </italic></sup>transgene were obtained by standard methods. A 2nd chromosomal insertion was further used to obtain <italic>UAS::Arm</italic><sup><italic>D88A</italic></sup>/<italic>UAS::Arm</italic><sup><italic>D88A</italic></sup>; <italic>th</italic><sup>109</sup>/<italic>TM3 [ftz::lacZ]</italic>. Males of this stock were crossed to females of the recombinant <italic>th</italic><sup>109</sup><italic>mat15::Gal4</italic>/<italic>TM3 [ftz::lacZ] </italic>stock; this cross allows expression of the UAS transgene with onset of zygotic gene expression in the early embryo.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HAJM and TK conceived the project.
