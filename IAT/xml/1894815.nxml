Recent data indicate that Tax activates the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ahead of schedule, causing premature degradation of cyclin A, cyclin B1, securin, and Skp2. Premature loss of these mitotic regulators is accompanied by mitotic aberrations and leads to rapid senescence and cell cycle arrest in HeLa and <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cells. Tax-induced rapid senescence (<italic>tax</italic>-IRS) of HeLa cells is mediated primarily by a dramatic stabilization of p27<sup><italic>KIP </italic></sup>and is also accompanied by a great surge in the level of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic></sup>mRNA and protein. Deficiencies in p27<sup><italic>KIP </italic></sup>prevent Tax-IRS. A collection of <italic>tax </italic>point mutants that permit normal growth of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>have been isolated. Like wild-type <italic>tax</italic>, many of them (C23W, A108T, L159F, and L235F) transactivate both the HTLV-LTR and the NF-&#x003ba;B reporters. One of them, V19M, preferentially activates NF-&#x003ba;B, but is attenuated for LTR activation. None of the mutants significantly elevated the levels of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP1</italic></sup>, indicating that the dramatic surge in p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>induced by Tax is brought about by a mechanism distinct from NF-&#x003ba;B or LTR activation. Importantly, the ability of these mutants to activate APC/C is attenuated or abrogated. These data indicate that Tax-induced rapid senescence is causally associated with APC/C activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma, which occurs in approximately 5% of infected individuals after a long latency period lasting up to 20&#x02013;40 years. The HTLV-1 viral transactivator/onco-protein Tax is thought to play an important role in T-cell malignancy and HAM/TSP. Tax transactivates the HTLV-1 LTR promoter through its interaction with CREB/ATF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], CBP/p300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and the Tax-responsive 21-bp repeat element, and activates the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] through the interaction with PP2A/IKK&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition to its transactivation functions, Tax also impacts on many aspects of the cell cycle: activating G<sub>1</sub>/S transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], inactivating p53 functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], inducing p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>mRNA transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and inhibiting apoptosis and DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recent data have indicated that Tax can dramatically perturb mitotic regulation, causing micronuclei formation, cytokinesis failure, and chromosome instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. ATL cells are often aneuploid with complex chromosomal abnormalities including trisomy 3, trisomy 7, a partial deletion of 6q, and abnormalities of 14q11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Large lymphocytes with cleaved/cerebriform nuclei are also frequently seen in HTLV-I-positive individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These pathological findings are likely to be associated with Tax-induced mitotic aberrations.</p><p>Indeed, in <italic>tax</italic>-expressing HeLa, MT4, and <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cells, the levels of cyclin A, cyclin B and the anaphase inhibitor: securin/Pds1p (precocious dissociation of sister chromatids) were found to be significantly reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We have found that the loss of cell cycle regulators and the mitotic defects induced by Tax may be causally linked and are associated with premature activation of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (referred to as APC/C henceforth), a multiprotein E3-ubiquitin ligase that controls the onset of anaphase and mitotic exit by targeting mitotic cyclins and other cell cycle regulators for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. More recently, we have shown that the cell cycle dysregulation induced by <italic>tax </italic>does not end with mitotic abnormalities. <italic>Tax</italic>-transduced HeLa cells, after passage through a faulty cell division cycle, immediately entered into a senescence-like G<sub>1 </sub>arrest termed <italic>tax</italic>-induced rapid senescence, <italic>tax</italic>-IRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. These cells expressed high levels of Cdk2 inhibitors: p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>as a consequence of Tax-mediated activation of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>mRNA transcription, and increased stabilization of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>proteins. Consistent with these findings, Tripp et al have also reported that expression of <italic>tax </italic>can cause CD34+ hematopoietic cells to cease proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>During normal cell cycle progression, p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>transiently accumulate during G<sub>1</sub>, but become degraded in S. The destruction of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>during S phase is regulated by the multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCF (Skp-Cullin-F box), together with its substrate-targeting subunit, Skp2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and the cell cycle regulatory protein, Cks1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Recent evidence indicates that Skp2 and Cks1 are both substrates of the Cdh1-associated APC/C (APC<sup>Cdh1</sup>). They become polyubiquitinated and degraded in late M and early G<sub>1 </sub>when APC<sup>Cdh1 </sup>is highly active. This renders SCF<sup>SKP2 </sup>inactive and allows p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>levels to build up in G<sub>1</sub>. When <italic>tax </italic>is expressed, APC/C becomes prematurely activated. This causes Skp2 to be polyubiquitinated and degraded starting in S, through G<sub>2</sub>/M and in subsequent G<sub>1</sub>. The drastic reduction in Skp2 and possibly Cks1, apparently inactivated SCF<sup>SKP2</sup>, profoundly stabilized p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP1</italic></sup>, thereby committing cells to senescence. The stabilization and surge of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>in <italic>tax</italic>-expressing cells, therefore, is temporally and causally linked to premature APC/C activation. In essence, Tax activates the cellular program for mitotic exit far ahead of schedule, thereby driving cells into a state of permanent arrest. Interestingly and as might be predicted, we have found that HTLV-1 transformed T-cells invariably express lower levels of p27<sup><italic>KIP1</italic></sup>. Indeed, a loss of p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>function allows cells to evade <italic>tax</italic>-IRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Our earlier results have indicated that expression of Tax in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>also leads to unscheduled, APC-mediated degradation of Clb2p and Pds1p, G<sub>2</sub>/M delay, chromosome aneuploidy, growth arrest, and loss of cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Considering the highly conserved nature of the cellular machineries that control mitosis in eukaryotes, this is probably not surprising. The powerful genetics available for <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>provides an opportunity to dissect the mechanism by which Tax dysregulates APC/C and mitosis, which is otherwise difficult to perform in human cells. Here we report the isolation of a collection of 26 <italic>tax </italic>point mutants whose expression in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>did not lead to growth arrest. Five mutants (V19M, C23W, A108T, L159F, and L235F) &#x02013; with amino acid substitutions that span the majority of Tax protein sequence &#x02013; were chosen for in-depth analyses. C23W, A108T, L159F, and L235F transactivated both the HTLV-LTR and the NF-&#x003ba;B reporters. One mutant, V19M, preferentially activated NF-&#x003ba;B, but was attenuated in LTR activation. All became impaired or abrogated in their ability (i) to activate APC, (ii) to increase the levels of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP1</italic></sup>, and (iii) to cause <italic>tax</italic>-IRS. These data strongly suggest that <italic>tax</italic>-IRS, with the associated mitotic aberrations and the accompanying rise in p21<sup><bold><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1 </italic></bold></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>levels, is coupled to APC/C activation, and is mechanistically unrelated to the CREB/ATF-CBP/p300 or IKK-NF-&#x003ba;B pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of <italic>tax </italic>mutants that do not cause growth arrest in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title><p>In the course of a yeast 2-hybrid screen using Tax as bait, we noticed that the yeast strain expressing the <italic>lexA-tax </italic>fusion grew significantly slower than the <italic>lexA </italic>control. This prompted us to examine more closely the effect Tax exerts on the growth and proliferation of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. To this end, W303a, a standard laboratory yeast strain, was transformed with pRS315-Gal10-Tax, a CEN plasmid carrying the <italic>tax </italic>gene under the control of a galactose inducible promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. As reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], expression of <italic>tax </italic>after galactose induction lead to a cessation of cell growth and proliferation. Upon Tax expression, the W303a/Gal10-Tax cells initially suffered a delay in S/G<sub>2</sub>/M progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. They then became arrested at G<sub>1 </sub>phase of the cell cycle. The growth-arrested cells became greatly enlarged in size, but were without buds and displayed severe DNA aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Their viability was also significantly decreased. These results immediately suggest that <italic>tax </italic>mutants that do not cause growth and proliferation arrest may be readily isolated in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and these mutants may have similar or identical properties in human cells. To isolate <italic>tax </italic>mutants impaired in causing growth arrest, we mutated pRS315-Gal10-Tax by hydroxylamine (36). W303a cells were then transformed with the pool of chemically mutated plasmid preparation, and plated to select for galactose-resistant transformants. The colonies on galactose plates were then screened by colony dot blots for <italic>tax </italic>expression using a mouse hybridoma Tax antibody, 4C5. A total of 26 non-growth-arrest <italic>tax </italic>mutants were identified, for which the respective pRS315 vectors were isolated. We next confirmed loss of the growth arrest phenotype by reintroducing plasmids carrying the mutant <italic>tax </italic>alleles into W303a. As expected, all W303a expressing mutant <italic>tax </italic>alleles readily grew on both glucose and galactose plates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), while W303a expressing the wild-type <italic>tax </italic>failed to grow on galactose plates as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A) A summary of amino acid substitutions in HTLV-1 <italic>tax </italic>point mutants whose expression did not cause growth arrest in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></bold>.

W303-1a cells were transformed with the Gal10-Tax (WT-Tax) or its equivalent carrying each of five mutant <italic>tax </italic>alleles and plated on agar plates containing 2% raffinose or 2% raffinose plus 2% galactose. The amino acid alterations in <italic>tax </italic>mutants are as indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-4-35-1"/></fig><p>DNA sequence analyses of the <italic>tax </italic>coding sequence revealed that each of the 26 <italic>tax </italic>mutants contained a single amino acid substitution that resulted from a G to A or C to T transition, as might be expected for hydroxylamine mutagenesis. The altered amino acid residues in the Tax protein sequence are listed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. Many of the amino acid substitutions are clustered in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal half of Tax (20/26). Consistent with the notion that the amino acid substitutions had occurred in important regions of Tax, we noticed that the T130I substitution overlap with the dual amino acid substitutions &#x02013; T130A L131S &#x02013; in a well characterized <italic>tax </italic>mutant known as M22, which is partially defective in dimerization and is severely impaired in IKK&#x003b3;/NEMO-binding and NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Two distinct mutations (G61E and G61R) and (A108T and A108V) were isolated for each of the amino acid residues 61 and 108, suggesting the importance of these residues in protein-protein interactions that mediate Tax functions. Finally, the expression levels of all mutants in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>were comparable as judged by immunoblotting (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Tax mutants selected in W303a are functional in HTLV-1 LTR and NF-&#x003ba;B trans-activation</title><p>Next, we investigated the biological activities of <italic>tax </italic>mutants in mammalian cells. Mutant <italic>tax </italic>alleles were cloned into a lentiviral vector, HR'CMV-SV40-puro. This vector allowed <italic>tax </italic>to be expressed transiently from the CMV immediate early promoter after DNA transfection or stably after lentivirus vector-mediated gene transduction. We first examined the ability of the Tax mutants to transcriptionally activate luciferase reporters driven respectively by the HTLV-1-LTR (LTR-Luc) and the NF-&#x003ba;B-inducible E-selectin-promoter (E-selec-Luc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Twenty one mutants were analyzed by luciferase reporter assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The other five mutants (V24E, C36Y, G61R, P92L, and L183F) were excluded from the reporter assays because of either the drastic amino acid alterations caused by the mutations or the existence of alternative amino acid substitution in the same position. Approximately half of the mutants analyzed (S32F, A47T, H52Y, G61E, L75F, T145I, W147L, P169L, A285T, and S300F) were greatly impaired in both transactivation functions of Tax. Many of these mutations are in the highly conserved NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of Tax. Because of their severe defects, no attempts have been made to determine if their expression in 293T cells may be altered by the respective amino acid substitutions. The levels of expression of these mutants in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>were normal, however. By contrast, several mutants (C23W, P102L, A108T, A108V, H127T, L159F, 235F, G245D, and D264Y) continued to transactivate both LTR and NF-&#x003ba;B reporters to levels (greater than 50%) comparable to those of the wild-type Tax. Of note, V19M was specifically impaired in LTR activation but remained a potent NF-&#x003ba;B activator, while T130I was defective in NF-&#x003ba;B activation, but exhibited significant LTR activation capability, reminiscent of similar properties of the M22 (T130A L131S) mutation mentioned above. As indicated below, at least five of these mutants (V19M, C23W, A108T, L159F, and L235F) expressed at levels comparable to that of the wild-type Tax in HeLa cells (see below). These results indicate that mutations that impaired the ability of Tax to arrest growth of W303a cells did not necessarily affect LTR or NF-&#x003ba;B transactivation. Finally, although the reporter assays for some of the mutants varied more than others, the variations occurred mostly due to strong transactivation; and importantly, the LTR and NF-&#x003ba;B transactivations by the 5 mutants that were analyzed in depth have been confirmed by independent methods (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and see below). We infer from these data that the growth arrest phenotype of Tax most likely involves interactions with a cellular process distinct from the CREB/CBP/p300 and the IKK/NF-&#x003ba;B pathways.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>HTLV LTR and NF-&#x003ba;B transactivation functions of <italic>tax </italic>mutants</bold>.

Lentivirus vectors (LV) capable of transducing the mutant <italic>tax </italic>alleles were generated by co-transfection of the respective HR'-CMV-<italic>tax</italic>-SV40-puro vectors together with packaging plasmids that encode HIV structural proteins and VSV G protein as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. A stable HeLa cell line, HeLa-18 &#x000d7; 21-DsRed, which expresses DsRed under the control of a Tax-inducible enhancer/promoter cassette containing 18 copies of the 21-bp repeat upstream of a minimal HTLV-1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], was used as the cellular background for introducing the <italic>tax </italic>alleles. As the expression of DsRed in HeLa-18 &#x000d7; 21-DsRed is strictly Tax-dependent, cells that express Tax after gene transduction can be readily detected by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

The LV-transduced cells were then selected in media containing 1 &#x003bc;g/ml puromycin for 2&#x02013;3 days. Drug-resistant colonies were then grown in puromycin-free medium for 1 day and observed under a fluorescence microscope for DsRed expression.

As expected, HeLa-18 &#x000d7; 21-DsRed transduced with the LV-EGFP control did not express DsRed. Previously, we have demonstrated that Tax expression in HeLa cells greatly elevated the levels of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, thereby causing HeLa cells to enter into a senescence-like G<sub>1 </sub>arrest termed Tax-induced rapid senescence (Tax-IRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The HeLa cells in Tax-IRS are flat, enlarged, vacuolated, often binucleated, and stained positive for the senescence associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase. Indeed, in agreement with previous results, microscopic examination of the HeLa-18 &#x000d7; 21-DsRed cell line transduced with LV-Tax (wild-type) revealed a prevalence of enlarged and binucleated cells, consistent with the notion that they were in the state of Tax-IRS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). By contrast, the morphology of cells transduced with mutant <italic>tax </italic>alleles, with the exception of A108T, resembled those of control cells transduced with the EGFP gene. Finally, we noted that despite some similarity of A108T cells to Tax (wild-type) cells, the extent of arrest and morphological changes in A108T cells appeared to be attenuated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Tax mutants whose expression is permissible in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>do not cause, or are attenuated in inducing cell cycle arrest in HeLa cells, but remain functional in activating I-&#x003ba;B degradation and p100 processing</title><p>To characterize the various <italic>tax </italic>mutants further, we analyzed the LV-mutant-<italic>tax</italic>-transduced cells by flow cytometry.

As might be expected, the levels of cyclin B1 in the respective cell lines inversely correlated with the growth characteristics of the respective cells. Likewise, the levels of Skp2 in the transduced cells also correlated with their respective cyclin B1 levels. Finally, consistent with the ability of the <italic>tax </italic>mutants to transactivate the E-seletin-Luc NF-&#x003ba;B reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the levels of I-&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; in the <italic>tax</italic>-transduced cells were reduced, while those of p52, the mature NF-&#x003ba;B2, were increased. Here again, in general agreement with the reporter assays, the A108T mutant is equivalent or possibly better than the wild-type <italic>tax </italic>in inducing I-&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and p52 NF-&#x003ba;B processing, second by V19M and C23W, followed lastly by L235F and L159 mutants. While for some mutants (A108T, L159F, and L235F) there appears to be some correlation between the severity of cell cycle arrest/senescence phenotype and the degree of NF-&#x003ba;B activation, for others such as V19M and C23W, that are strong NF-&#x003ba;B activators, the senescence phenotype was significantly attenuated. These results support the notion that the Tax-induced cell cycle arrest/rapid senescence (Tax-IRS) and increase in p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>levels are causally related and do not involve directly either the CREB/CBP/p300 or the IKK/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway.

To determine the effect of the <italic>tax </italic>mutants on APC/C directly, we introduced them into a yeast strain, KY630, which contains a chromosomally integrated HA-CLB2 at the CLB2 locus. As anticipated, upon induction of <italic>tax </italic>expression for 2 h, a reduction of Clb2p in cells expressing wild-type <italic>tax </italic>was observed compared to the <italic>tax</italic>-null control. By contrast, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>-viable V19M, C23W, A108T, L159F, and L235F <italic>tax </italic>mutants were attenuated in causing Clb2p reduction/degradation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). We have shown previously that Tax activates the anaphase promoting complex in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, HeLa, 293T and HTLV-1 transformed T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. For the ease of transfection, the wild-type and mutant <italic>tax </italic>alleles were individually co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin into 293T cells. Indeed, the five <italic>tax </italic>mutants were also found to be attenuated in inducing cyclin B1 polyubiquitination when compared to the wild-type control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The extents of attenuation of the five <italic>tax </italic>mutants in <italic>S. crevevisiae </italic>versus 293T cells were not exactly identical (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). This may reflect subtle structural differences between <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and human anaphase promoting complex. Finally, the degrees of the mutants to cause cyclin B1 polyubiquitination (A108T &#x02265; C23W &#x0003e; L159F, L235F, and V19M) correlated largely with the levels of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>increase in the transduced cells (A108T &#x0003e; C23W &#x0003e; L159F, L235F, and V19M).

A total of 21 <italic>tax </italic>alleles were analyzed further by luciferase reporter assays for LTR and NF-&#x003ba;B transactivation. Approximately half of the amino acid substitutions likely have impacted on critical regions of Tax so as to render it severely defective. Special attention was directed to five mutants (V19M, C23W, A108T, L159F, and L235F) that remained strong LTR and NF-&#x003ba;B transactivators. Their phenotypes in HeLa cells were largely consistent with those seen in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>&#x02013; all were attenuated or significantly impaired in causing p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>accumulation, but remained able to induce I-&#x003ba;B degradation and p100 NF-&#x003ba;B2 processing. Whereas the majority of HeLa cells transduced with wild-type <italic>tax </italic>entered into <italic>tax</italic>-IRS, cells transduced with each of the 5 mutant <italic>tax </italic>alleles continued to proliferate, albeit at rates that varied dependent on the levels of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>expressed. These results validated the utility of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>as a model for dissecting the mitotic abnormalities and rapid senescence/cell cycle arrest induced by Tax.</p><p>The levels of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>are regulated through transcription, phosphorylation (by cyclinE/Cdk2), subcellular localization, ubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCF, together with its substrate-recognition subunit, Skp2, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The level of Skp2 oscillates in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Recent data have indicated that Skp2 and another SCF subunit, Cks1, are substrates of the Cdh1-associated APC/C (APC<sup>Cdh1</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Both become ubiquitinated and degraded in late M and early G<sub>1 </sub>when APC<sup>Cdh1 </sup>is highly active. This inactivates SCF and allows p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>to accumulate transiently in G<sub>1</sub>. We have shown recently that in HeLa cells transduced with <italic>tax</italic>, early APC/C activation sets in motion premature loss of cyclin A, cyclin B, securin, and Skp2, and causes a dramatic build-up of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>during S phase. After an aberrant mitotic division cycle, the great surge in p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>in <italic>tax</italic>-expressing cells then commits cells into a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest. Results from the present analysis, i.e. mutations in <italic>tax </italic>that abrogated induction/stabilization of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>also disabled APC/C activation, are in agreement with that conclusion.</p><p>Activation of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>mRNA transcription by Tax has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Because a Tax mutant, M47, which is deficient in LTR activation, became disabled in activating p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>promoter, some of these earlier studies have suggested that Tax-induced increase in p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>resulted from transactivation via the CREB/ATF-CBP/p300 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Since four of the five mutants analyzed here activated LTR-luciferase reporter at levels (70&#x02013;80%) comparable to that of the wild-type <italic>tax</italic>, yet were substantially impaired in causing p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>increase, we conclude that the CREB/ATF-CBP/p300 pathway is most likely not the principal determinant in the accumulation of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP1</italic></sup>. Likewise, several of the mutants &#x02013; A108T, V19M and C23W, in particular &#x02013; are potent activators of IKK-NF-&#x003ba;B as indicated by luciferase reporter assays and the extent of I-&#x003ba;B degradation and p100 processing. These mutants are nevertheless impaired in elevating p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP 1</italic></sup>levels. These results support the notion that the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is not directly responsible for the Tax-induced increase in p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>and p27<sup><italic>KIP1</italic></sup>. Our earlier data suggest that a major factor for Tax-induced p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>increase is correlated with premature APC/C activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, promoter transactivation by Tax may only contribute moderately to the overall build-up of p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>protein. This would explain the discrepancy between the data reported here and the earlier studies which relied heavily on p21<sup><italic>CIP1</italic>/<italic>WAF1</italic></sup>promoter-luciferase reporter assays. Finally, we have shown that via a tripartite interaction, Tax, PP2A and IKK&#x003b3; form a stable ternary complex wherein PP2A activity is inhibited or diminished by Tax. In essence, PP2A inhibition by IKK&#x003b3;-bound Tax maintains IKK in an active, phosphorylated state, causing constitutive phosphorylation and degradation of I-&#x003ba;B, which, in turn, leads to potent activation of genes under NF-&#x003ba;B/Rel control. Since PP2A regulates many critical cellular processes, it is conceivable that APC/C activation by Tax is also mediated through an inhibition of PP2A. In this sense, a <italic>tax </italic>mutant deficient in PP2A interaction will be disabled for both NF-&#x003ba;B and APC/C activation, but may continue to transactivate LTR. Several tax mutants, H43Q, K85N, and M22 (T130A, L131S) have been shown previously to be disabled for PP2A binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both H43Q and M22 are deficient in NF-&#x003ba;B but not in LTR transactivation, while K85N is defective for both. Preliminary analyses suggest that these three mutants are also impaired in inducing cell cycle arrest. Mutants like H43Q and M22, with the possible exception of T130I, however, are not highly represented in the current collection. This may be due, in part, to the importance of the PP2A-binding domain of Tax in mediating other critical protein-protein interaction.</p><p>The biological/virological relevance for the profound cell cycle arrest induced by Tax remains unclear. It is possible that HTLV-1-infected T-cells that are arrested in a senescence-like state may persist longer <italic>in vivo </italic>and may, in this condition, be co-opted to devote significant cellular resources to virus replication. Alternatively, the dramatic morphological changes associated with the senescence-like arrest may facilitate virus assembly and/or transmission. Many of the <italic>tax </italic>mutants characterized here that remain functional in transactivating viral LTR and NF-&#x003ba;B can be incorporated into an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-1 to address this question.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tax mutagenesis and selection for <italic>tax </italic>mutants</title><p>The CEN plasmid, pRS315 Gal10-Tax, that contains <italic>tax </italic>under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter derived from Gal10 gene has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].
