As keratinocytes are lost from the outermost epidermal layers, they are replaced through a process of terminal differentiation in which keratinocytes in the basal layer exit the cell cycle, down-regulate adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins of the basal lamina and migrate upwards through the supra-basal, differentiated layers, until they eventually reach the outermost cornified layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Watt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The basal lamina is made up of various ECM proteins, including fibronectin, collagens and laminins. Keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis adhere to these ECM proteins via integrin adhesion receptors and there is considerable evidence that adhesion to ECM plays a key role in regulating epidermal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Watt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Disruption of integrin-ECM interactions results in initiation of keratinocyte terminal differentiation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Watt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Jones1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, normal epidermal function requires that the balance between keratinocyte proliferation, adhesion to ECM proteins and terminal differentiation be tightly regulated. Previous data from our laboratory and others suggest that signalling though Rho family GTPases is required for keratinocyte terminal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-McMullan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Liebig1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. RhoA is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases and acts as a molecular switch to regulate a plethora of cellular processes including organisation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and motility and gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Heasman1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The best-characterised downstream effectors of RhoA are the serine/threonine kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 (also known as ROK&#x003b2; and ROK&#x003b1;, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Leung1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Both ROCK isoforms are comprised of an N-terminal region, a kinase domain, a coiled-coil domain containing a Rho binding site, a PH domain and a C-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Jacobs1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Both isoforms share a high amino acid sequence identity, with 92&#x00025; identity across their kinase domains. However, the two kinases only share 65&#x02013;70&#x00025; sequence identity across their PH domains, which may account for the observed differences in cellular localisation of the two isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Leung1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Yoneda1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Most studies to date have either used over-expression of ROCK or pharmacological inhibition of ROCK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-McMullan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Croft1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Ishizaki1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Neither of these methods allows discrimination of isoform-specific functions. Recently, functional differences between the two ROCK isoforms have become more apparent. In vivo data show that, despite their structural similarities, ROCK1 or ROCK2 expression cannot compensate for loss of the other isoform during murine embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Thumkeo2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In vitro studies utilising ROCK isoform specific RNAi knockdown in fibroblasts also suggest that ROCK1 and ROCK2 may have distinct, and sometimes opposing, roles in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Yoneda1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Yoneda2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we used RNAi to specifically knockdown ROCK1 or ROCK2 expression in cultured keratinocytes and analysed adhesion to various ECM proteins and the differentiation status of the cells. Our data suggest that both ROCK isoforms play distinct and important roles in regulating keratinocyte differentiation status and keratinocyte adhesion to the ECM protein fibronectin.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>HaCaT keratinocytes were stably transfected with GFP-IRES-shRNAmir constructs specifically targeting ROCK1 or ROCK2 or a non-silencing control nonsense mRNA sequence (NSC) to generate HaCaT-ROCK1-KD, HaCaT-ROCK2-KD and HaCaT-NSC cells respectively. A stable decrease in ROCK1 expression was observed in HaCaT-ROCK1-KD cells, compared to HaCaT-NSC and HaCaT-ROCK2-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Similarly, a significant decrease in ROCK2 expression was observed in HaCaT-ROCK2-KD cells, when compared to HaCaT-NSC and HaCaT-ROCK1-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g001">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Depletion of ROCK1 or ROCK2 had no effect on expression of the other, non-targeted, ROCK isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g001">Figure 1A, C</xref>). To further characterise these cell lines following ROCK isoform knockdown, HaCaT-NSC, HaCaT-ROCK1-KD and HaCaT-ROCK2-KD cell lysates were immunoblotted to assess changes in phosphorylation of two known ROCK targets - myosin phosphatase (MYPT) and myosin light chain (MLC). Both ROCK1 and ROCK2 are able to directly phosphorylate MYPT1 on threonine residue 696 whereas serine 19 of MLC is phosphorylated by ROCK1 but not ROCK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Ito1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Kimura1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consistent with MLCpSer19 being a ROCK1 substrate but not a ROCK2 substrate, a decrease in phosphorylated MLC was observed in HaCaT-ROCK1-KD cells, but not in HaCaT-ROCK2-KD or HaCaT-NSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).

Adhesion to the ECM proteins collagen IV and laminin-332 (previously called laminin V) was also assessed. Both are known keratinocyte ligands, but no significant differences in HaCaT adhesion were observed following ROCK1 or ROCK2 knockdown, when compared to HaCaT-NSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g002">Figure 2B, C</xref>).

HaCaT-NSC, HaCaT-ROCK1-KD and HaCaT-ROCK2-KD cells were cultured for 2 days post-confluence to induce differentiation and cells lysed and immunoblotted to assess expression of basal and suprabasal keratins. Loss of the basal keratinocyte marker, keratin 5, is observed during keratinocyte differentiation and expression of keratin 5, was greatly reduced following ROCK1 depletion when compared to HaCaT-NSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Increased expression of keratin 10, a supra-basal marker of keratinocyte terminal differentiation, was also observed in HaCaT-ROCK1-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Conversely, expression of keratin 5 was increased, and expression of keratin 10 was decreased in HaCaT-ROCK2-KD cells, when compared to HaCaT-NSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This would be consistent with an inhibition of keratinocyte terminal differentiation following ROCK2 depletion. To further characterise this differentiation phenotype we used different RNAi methodology and an alternative keratinocyte cell line to analyse spontaneous differentiation in sub-confluent cells. SCC12f cells are derived from a squamous cell carcinoma but grow and differentiate in a manner similar to that seen in normal primary keratinocytes and are a well-established model for keratinocyte function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Rheinwald1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We transiently transfected SCC12f keratinocytes with siRNA oligos targeted against ROCK1 and ROCK2. The target sequences used were different to those targeted using the shRNAi vectors. As a control, SCC12f cells were also transfected with non-silencing control oligos (NSC). Following transient transfection with siRNA oligos, sub-confluent SCC12f cells were cultured, lysed and immunoblotted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, we observed isoform-specific knockdown of ROCK1 and ROCK2 in SCC12f cells although the knockdown of ROCK2 was not complete. To assess the rate of spontaneous differentiation in these cells, expression of the cornified envelope precursor involucrin, a commonly used marker for differentiation, was analysed. Transiently transfected, sub-confluent, SCC12f were fixed and the percentage of cells expressing involucrin was quantified by immunocytochemistry. siRNA-mediated knockdown of ROCK1 expression resulted in a 2-fold increase in the percentage of cells expressing involucrin, when compared to NSC controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of ROCK2 expression resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of involucrin expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008190.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These data are consistent with the changes in keratin 5 and keratin 10 expression observed in HaCaT-ROCK1-KD and HaCaT-ROCK2-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that loss of ROCK1 expression promotes keratinocyte terminal differentiation and that loss of ROCK2 expression has the opposite effect, inhibiting keratinocyte terminal differentiation.</p><fig id="pone-0008190-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008190.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>ROCK isoform-specific knockdown regulates keratinocyte differentiation.</title><p>A, HaCaT-NSC, HaCaT-ROCK1-KD or HaCaT-ROCK2-KD cells were cultured for 2 days post-confluence and lysed.

We observed that depletion of either ROCK1 or ROCK2 results in decreased phosphorylation of MYPT on Thr696 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g001">Fig 1E</xref>). This is consistent with published data where both ROCK1 and ROCK2 have been reported to phosphorylate MYPT on Thr696, leading to its inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Ito1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Kimura1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we observed a specific loss in phosphorylation of MLC on Ser19 in ROCK1 depleted cells but not in ROCK2 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Again, this is consistent with recent studies describing MLC as a ROCK1-specific target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Yoneda1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Sebbagh1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This implies that continued expression of one isoform cannot compensate for the loss of the other, suggesting specific functional differences in human keratinocytes. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that the Rho/ROCK signalling pathway is important in regulating keratinocyte function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-McMullan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we have shown that the two ROCK isoforms have distinct roles in the regulation of keratinocyte adhesion to fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). One possible explanation for the differences in adhesion to fibronectin in ROCK1-depleted keratinocytes might be a consequence of loss of actinomyosin contractility affecting adhesion complexes. However, under the conditions used in the adhesion assays (1 hour adhesion) we observed no differences in adhesion complex size (data not shown). The role of ROCK1 function in adhesion to fibronectin has been analysed in rat embryo fibroblasts which, when seeded on fibronectin, displayed significantly higher ROCK1 activity than ROCK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Yoneda1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This led the authors to conclude that the adhesion process has a particular requirement for ROCK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Yoneda1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This would appear to be consistent with our data in which we see a decrease in adhesion to fibronectin in ROCK1-depleted keratinocytes but it is worth noting that adhesion to fibronectin-coated beads was unaffected in ROCK1-depleted fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Yoneda2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, it might be a consequence of altered fibronectin matrix assembly, as has been observed in fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Yoneda2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this is unlikely to have been a factor in the relatively short period of adhesion used in our assays. It is unclear why adhesion to fibronectin is affected by depletion of ROCK1 or ROCK2 but adhesion to laminin-332 or collagen IV, both of which are known keratinocyte ECM ligands, is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g002">Figure 2B,C</xref>). One possibility is that ROCK1 and ROCK2 regulate expression and/or function of keratinocyte fibronectin receptors (e.g. &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin). We have analysed expression and function of the most abundant fibronectin-binding integrin, &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, but did not observe any consistent or significant changes in expression or activity (data not shown). This does not rule out the possibility that other fibronectin-binding integrins (e.g. &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;5) are involved and this is currently being investigated.</p><p>Previous data from our laboratory also demonstrated that expression of the constitutively active kinase domain of ROCK2 in human keratinocytes promoted terminal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-McMullan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this, inhibition of ROCK using Y-27632 inhibited keratinocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-McMullan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as these experiments involved over-expression of the kinase domain alone, it is possible that the constitutively active mutant would be targeted inappropriately within the cell. Furthermore, Y-27632 inhibits both isoforms of ROCK as well as other kinases such as PRK2 and PKN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Ishizaki1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Davies1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The approach we have adopted here, using ROCK isoform-specific RNAi, allows a more detailed analysis of the role of ROCK in keratinocyte terminal differentiation. Interestingly, we found that the two ROCK isoforms have opposing roles in regulating keratinocyte terminal differentiation. Knockdown of ROCK1 promotes keratinocyte terminal differentiation whereas knockdown of ROCK2 has the opposite effect and inhibits keratinocyte terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008190-g003">Figure 3A,C</xref>). One possible explanation for these observations is that a ROCK1-interacting protein is involved in promoting differentiation and one candidate here might be RhoE/Rnd3, which binds specifically to ROCK1, and has recently been linked to the stratification and differentiation of human keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Liebig1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008190-Riento1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we have used RNAi to specifically knockdown ROCK1 or ROCK2 expression in cultured keratinocytes. The data presented in this paper support our previous report of a pivotal role for ROCK signalling in keratinocyte function and extend those observations by reporting that ROCK1 and ROCK2 play distinct and opposing roles in regulation of keratinocyte adhesion and differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents and Antibodies</title><p>Primary antibodies used were: involucrin (SY-5, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); ROCK1 (H-85, Santa Cruz, USA); ROCK2 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Oxford, UK); tubulin (T6199, Sigma, MO, USA); phospho-MYPT1 (Thr-696-MYPT1, Upstate Cell Signalling Solutions, USA); phospho-MLC (Thr18/Ser19-Myosin Light Chain 2, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., MA, USA); total MLC (Myosin Light Chain, MY-21.
