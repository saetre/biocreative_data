We found that a point mutation that inactivates the Brg ATPase recapitulates multiple defects previously described for Brg deletion (Chi, T.H., M. Wan, P.P. Lee, K. Akashi, D. Metzger, P. Chambon, C.B. Wilson, and G.R. Crabtree. 2003. <italic>Immunity</italic>. 19:169&#x02013;182). However, the point mutant helps reveal unexpected roles of Brg in CD25 repression and CD4 activation. Surprisingly, CD4 activation occurs independently of the Brg ATPase and is perhaps mediated by physical interactions between Brg and the <italic>CD4</italic> locus. Our study thus suggests that the BAF complex harbors novel activities that can be necessary and even sufficient for stimulating transcription from an endogenous chromatin template in the absence of Brg-dependent remodeling of that template. We conclude that conditional point mutants, rarely used in mammalian genetics, can help uncover important gene functions undetectable or overlooked in deletion mutants.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: BAF, Brg-associated factor; DN, double negative; DP, double positive; ES, embryonic stem; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; ISP, immature SP; LCR, locus control region; SA, splice acceptor; SP, single positive.</p></fn><fn><p>M.

The earliest T cells express neither CD4 nor CD8 and are known as double-negative (DN) cells. DN cells pass through four successive stages (DN1&#x02013;4), as defined by differential expression of CD25 and CD44. Cells at the DN3 stage recombine the TCR&#x003b2; gene to express a pre-TCR complex that propels DN3 cells into the DN4 stage. DN4 cells activate CD8 transcription to become immature single-positive (ISP) cells that subsequently derepress <italic>CD4</italic> to become CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double-positive (DP) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). DP cells displaying proper TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2; extinguish either <italic>CD4</italic> or <italic>CD8</italic> expression and mature into CD8 or CD4 SP cells, respectively, before their export to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>The execution of transcriptional programs during development relies on precise temporal- and spatial-specific regulation of gene expression, which in turn requires the modulation of chromatin structure of target genes. An important class of enzymes capable of manipulating chromatin structure is the &#x0201c;chromatin-remodeling complexes,&#x0201d; the multisubunit molecular motors that use energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to physically disrupt histone&#x02013;DNA contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). The best-known chromatin remodeler in mammals is the Brg-associated factor (BAF) complex related to the yeast Swi&#x02013;Snf complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). The BAF complex contains &#x0223c;10 subunits, including the ATPase Brg or its homologue Brm. In addition to Brg/Brm, several other subunits of the BAF complex are encoded by gene families, thus leading to the combinatorial assembly and generation of perhaps hundreds of complexes with divergent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The BAF complex plays diverse roles in the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) and is essential for early T cell development, because Brg deletion in DN2, DN3, and DN4 cells impairs their survival, proliferation, and developmental transitions, and causes premature CD4 expression on these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>Although the BAF complex can remodel chromatin, it might have functions in gene regulation beyond classical ATP-dependent remodeling, as suggested by the following data. Specifically, the ATPase activity of Brg and, therefore, chromatin remodeling by the BAF complex is critically dependent on a lysine residue (K785) located in the nucleotide-binding pocket of the ATPase domain of Brg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Remarkably, although the ATPase-dead Brg mutant Brg (K785R) fails to activate the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter integrated into the genome of a Brg-deficient cell line, it efficiently stimulates the same promoter in transient transfection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). In contrast to the stably integrated promoter that is organized into nucleosomes, the transiently transfected promoter is nucleosome free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), which apparently circumvents the need for ATP-dependent remodeling, thus revealing the potential of the BAF complex to activate transcription independently of Brg ATPase activity, although the data interpretation is confounded by the fact that Brg (K785R) was overexpressed in that study. The existence of the putative novel activities of the BAF complex unrelated to Brg-catalyzed remodeling is consistent with the fact that although the BAF complex consists of 10 subunits, 4 subunits (including Brg) are fully sufficient for nucleosome disruption in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), which suggests that the remaining &#x0201c;dispensable&#x0201d; subunits may harbor the novel activities. In addition, Brg itself may also harbor such activities in regions outside its ATPase domain.</p><p>These data raise the question of whether the phenotype seen in Brg-deleted thymocytes specifically reflects defects in chromatin remodeling. Brg is essential for the integrity of the BAF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), for tethering the BAF complex to nuclear matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), for recruiting the BAF complex to certain target genes via interaction with sequence-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), and presumably for stable association of the BAF complex with chromatin via its bromodomain and a region rich in lysines and arginines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Thus, Brg deletion may have completely eliminated the functions of the entire BAF complex, suggesting that the phenotype in Brg-deleted cells reflects both ATPase-dependent and -independent roles of the BAF complex in gene regulation.</p><p>To test whether Brg has ATPase-independent activity and to dissect the complex phenotype seen in Brg deletion mutants, we generated mice bearing a thymocyte-specific Brg (K785R) point mutation. These mice were produced within the same litters as mice lacking Brg in thymocytes, allowing for direct phenotypic comparison. We found that Brg ATPase is generally required for Brg function, but Brg does have an unexpected, ATPase-independent role in CD4 regulation that is obscured in the Brg deletion mutant. Brg point mutation also reveals a role of Brg in CD25 regulation not detected in the Brg deletion mutant.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Generation of littermates bearing a thymocyte-specific Brg point mutation or Brg deletion</title><p>We first generated a bifunctional Brg allele (Brg<sup>O</sup>) that is normally a null allele but can be conditionally turned into the point mutant allele expressing the Brg (K785R) protein. Specifically, we introduced K/R point mutation into the exon that encodes part of the ATP-binding site in the Brg ATPase domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). At the same time, we placed, downstream of the mutant exon, a removable promoter-trapping cassette consisting of a splice acceptor (SA) and the neomycin resistance gene (Neo). Upon splicing, the promoter-trapping cassette captures the mutant exon, leading to the production of a fusion protein between the N terminus (aa 1&#x02013;813) of Brg and Neo. This fusion protein is unstable and, therefore, does not act as a dominant negative to interfere with the function of the WT Brg protein (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>), but it can be converted into the full-length Brg (K/R) protein upon Cre-mediated excision of the gene-trapping cassette and subsequent restoration of correct splicing between the mutant exon and the downstream exon (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We then bred mice bearing the Brg<sup>O</sup> allele, the &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; floxed Brg (<italic>Brg</italic><sup>F</sup>) allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), and the transgene expressing Cre in thymocytes from the LCK-proximal promoter (LCK-Cre; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). In these mice, nonthymocytes express Brg (1&#x02013;813)&#x02013;Neo fusion and WT Brg from the <italic>Brg</italic><sup>O</sup> and <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F</sup> alleles, respectively, whereas in thymocytes, the fusion is converted into the Brg (K/R) point mutant and WT Brg is eliminated. These mice can be generated within the same litters as <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/F</sup>; LCK-Cre mice by crossing <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/F</sup>; LCK-Cre with <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/O</sup>, thus allowing direct comparison of the phenotypes caused by Brg point mutation versus Brg deletion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of conditional Brg (K785R) point mutation.</bold> (A) A removable promoter-trapping cassette is used to generate a bifunctional <italic>Brg</italic> allele that is normally a null allele but is converted into the point mutant allele expressing Brg(K785R) upon Cre expression. (B) Brg (K785R) is specifically expressed in thymocytes in mice bearing the bifunctional allele (<italic>Brg</italic><sup>O</sup>) in combination with the traditional floxed <italic>Brg</italic> allele (<italic>Brg</italic><sup>F</sup>) and LCK-Cre (left). The phenotypes are then compared with that seen in traditional conditional <italic>Brg</italic> knockout mice (right) to reveal a potential ATPase-independent function of the BAF complex during T cell development. (C) Targeting strategy. Four relevant exons in the <italic>Brg</italic> locus are depicted, arbitrarily designated E1&#x02013;4. A floxed promoter-trapping cassette&#x02014;consisting of an adenoviral SA, the promoterless neomycin resistant gene (Neo), IRES, a destabilized version of GFP, and an SV40 polyadenylation signal (pA)&#x02014;is inserted between E2 and E3. The primers for screening ES cells (a&#x02013;e) and for detecting Cre-mediated recombination (f and g) are indicated. Primers (h and i) are used for detecting the <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F</sup> allele in thymocytes (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>; and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>).

The integration of left and right arms was screened by RT-PCR (D) and PCR (E), respectively. Cre-mediated recombination was confirmed by PCR (F). The targeting was confirmed with Southern blotting (G), where the genomic DNA was digested with Sca I and Not1 cutting outside and within the targeting vector, respectively, thus releasing a 5.5-kb fragment encompassing the Neo sequence. The Brg-Neo fusion protein was analyzed by Western blotting (H). Primer pairs used for RT-PCR were indicated to the right of the gel images in D&#x02013;F. The asterisk in D denotes the PCR product amplified from the mRNA expressed from the bifunctional allele before E2-Neo splicing, and/or from the contaminating genomic DNA sequence. Unmodified ES cells (Ctrl) are used as controls where indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052813f01"></graphic></fig><p>The targeting vector is depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>. The floxed promoter-trapping cassette contains the promoterless Neo&#x02013;internal ribosome entry site (IRES)&#x02013;GFP sequence downstream of an adenoviral SA. This cassette is flanked by <italic>Brg</italic> genomic sequences, the left arm being a 1.8-kb genomic fragment containing the exon (E2) bearing K/R point mutation, whereas the right arm is a 4.6-kb fragment containing another exon (E3). The vector was electroporated into embryonic stem (ES) cells, and a total of 72 colonies emerged after G418 selection, 22 of which were analyzed. Expectedly, most of the clones express RNA in which E2 is spliced to Neo, as detected by RT-PCR using primers b and c recognizing E2 and Neo, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, top). To determine whether the <italic>Brg</italic> locus has been targeted, RT-PCR was performed using primers a and c, the former recognizing an exon (E1) not present in the targeting vector. Clones &#x00023;5 and &#x00023;14 expressed RNA that contains E1 spliced to Neo, indicating that the left arm is correctly recombined into the <italic>Brg</italic> locus in these two clones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, bottom). To check the integration of the right arm, DNA from these two clones was subjected to PCR using primers d and e, the latter recognizing an exon (E4) not present in the vector. An amplicon of the expected size (&#x0223c;5 kb) was obtained, indicating correct recombination of the right arm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). To determine whether Cre can indeed excise out the Neo-IRES-GFP cassette from the targeted locus, a Cre-expressing plasmid was electroporated into the ES cells, and the resultant DNA was analyzed by PCR using primers f and g recognizing the 5&#x02032; LoxP site and a <italic>Brg</italic> genomic sequence downstream of the 3&#x02032; LoxP site. Excision of the floxed promoter-trapping cassette would shorten the distance between the two primers, leading to the amplification of 170 bp DNA. Indeed, rearrangement was specifically detected in the transfected ES cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><p>Southern blotting using a Neo probe was performed, which confirmed that the gene-trapping cassette was correctly targeted and that there is no secondary integration of concatemers, as the latter would have generated an &#x0223c;13-kb band, the size of the linearized targeting vector (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>).</p><p>Western blotting using an antibody against the N terminus of Brg was performed to assess the level of Brg (1&#x02013;813)&#x02013;Neo fusion protein in the ES clones. This fusion is structurally similar to the Brg-Neo fusion expressed by the constitutive <italic>Brg</italic> null allele (<italic>Brg</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>), the latter known to be unstable and undetectable by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Indeed, the antibody detected full-length Brg but not the fusion protein expressed from the <italic>Brg</italic><sup>O</sup> allele that should migrate at 120 kD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>), suggesting that the fusion protein is unstable and thus should not interfere with the function of WT Brg protein, although the protein must be present at some level to confer resistance to neomycin for the selection of ES cells. Alternatively, the protein may be present at a high level but still be undetectable because of masking of the Brg epitope, but this seems less likely because the <italic>Brg</italic><sup>O</sup> allele behaves as a null allele rather than a dominant-negative allele (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In addition, there is no evidence for alternative splicing between E2 and E3 in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>O</sup> RNA, consistent with the fact that the mRNA bearing E2 spliced to E3 is twofold less abundant in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup> cells as compared with WT cells (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080938/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080938/DC1</ext-link>). Collectively, these data indicate that the <italic>Brg</italic><sup>O</sup> allele is a true null allele before the excision of the gene-trapping cassette.</p><p>GFP in the Brg<sup>O</sup> allele was intended for marking the cells that have undergone Cre-mediated excision; those cells should lose GFP expression. As GFP has a long half-life (24 h), we fused GFP to the protein degradation sequence PEST to reduce its half-life. Unfortunately, none of the ES colonies that emerged after G418 selection had visible GFP expression (unpublished data), suggesting that the rapid degradation has eliminated GFP protein (see Discussion). Mice bearing the Brg<sup>O</sup> allele were then generated, and their thymocytes were analyzed as described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Brg<sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup> mice recapitulate the thymocyte defects in Brg<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>We first determined the thymic phenotypes in Brg<sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup> mice bearing the Brg<sup>O</sup> allele together with the WT Brg allele. Developmental stages of thymocytes are usually defined by a CD4/CD8 expression pattern, but such a definition is invalid if the coreceptors are misregulated, as in the case of Brg deletion that derepresses CD4 while impairing CD8 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). We therefore used CD25/CD44, together with CD3, as maturation markers, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). In brief, total thymocytes are first resolved into mature (CD3<sup>hi</sup>) and immature (CD3<sup>&#x02212;/lo</sup>) subsets based on CD3 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, column 1). The immature thymocytes are then resolved into two major subsets, namely DN3 (CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and post-DN3 (CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD44<sup>&#x02212;</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, column 2) before each population is analyzed for CD4/CD8 expression (columns 3&#x02013;5). In WT mice, the DN3 cells are, by definition, CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, row A, column 3). The post-DN3 compartment in WT mice consists of DN4 (CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), ISP (CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and DP cells; the DN4 and ISP subsets are enriched and detectable only within the &#x0201c;post-DN3 blasts&#x0201d; population, the most immature cells in the post-DN3 pool marked by high forward scatter and a complete lack of CD3 expression (FS<sup>hi</sup>CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, row A, column 5).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of Brg point mutation and Brg deletion on thymocyte development.</bold> (A) Thymocytes were resolved into various subsets based on CD3, CD25, and CD44 expression, and the CD4/CD8 expression profile of each subset was then determined.

Red circles mark significantly changed populations; green borders are shown to facilitate comparisons.

These defects are recapitulated in Brg<sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, row B, column 5), as expected from the fact that the Brg<sup>O</sup> allele is a null allele by default. In addition, as in the case of Brg<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, there is no other obvious thymocyte defect in Brg<sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. In particular, these mice contain normal numbers of cells in the DN4 compartment, reinforcing the notion that deleting one allele of Brg is not sufficient to derepress CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of DN4 cells in Brg<sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup>; LCK-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>We next examined the effects of Brg point mutation on T cell development by introducing the LCK-Cre transgene into Brg<sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. There is no gross defect in T cell development in Brg<sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, although the total thymocyte number is mildly reduced (from &#x0223c;136 to &#x0223c;98 million; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, row C, column 1), largely because of a decrease in DP cells. Neither is there a significant change in the cellularity of the peripheral CD4 and CD8 cells (unpublished data). As in Brg<sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup> mice, CD8 expression in early thymocytes is impaired, resulting in the loss of ISP and emergence of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, but the CD8 expression level on DP cells seems less affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, row C, column 5). Surprisingly, DN4 cells are completely missing in Brg<sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (red circles). As DN4 cells are an essential intermediate in T cell development, these cells must be present but have somehow become phenotypically undetectable (see Discussion).</p><p>We then analyzed the status of the Brg<sup>O</sup> allele in various cell types isolated from the Brg<sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The Brg<sup>O</sup> allele appears to be fully converted to the Brg (K/R) allele in DP cells and in peripheral CD4 and CD8 cells, as indicated by the loss of the Brg<sup>O</sup> allele, whereas DN3 cells show little conversion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, top). The loss of the Brg<sup>O</sup> allele was accompanied by the emergence of the Brg (K/R) allele, as expected (unpublished data). This temporal-specific conversion is consistent with the progressive deletion of the Brg<sup>F</sup> allele by the LCK-Cre transgene in Brg<sup>F/&#x0002b;</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, where deletion is marginal in DN2 and DN3 cells but complete by the DN4 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that the Brg<sup>O</sup>&#x02192;Brg (K/R) conversion is induced by the LCK-Cre transgene in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, but there is no gross perturbation of thymocyte development, suggesting that one allele of <italic>Brg</italic> is largely sufficient to mask the effects of Brg point mutation on thymocytes.

Similarly, in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/O</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, thymocyte numbers are severely reduced (&#x0223c;13-fold) because of a loss of post-DN3 cells, and there are few CD4/CD8 SP cells in the thymus or periphery, whereas DN3 cellularity is unaffected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, row E, columns 1, 2, and 6; and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, top). This indicates that Brg ATPase is important for thymocyte development. However, a small number of post-DN3 cells (&#x0223c;5 million) manage to develop in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/O</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, whereas post-DN3 cells are virtually absent in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/&#x02212;</sup>; LCK-Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, suggesting that Brg (K/R) retains the residual ability to support post-DN3 production. In addition, the presence of two loxP sites in the <italic>Brg</italic><sup>O</sup> allele might impair <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F</sup> deletion via competition for the Cre recombinase, thus contributing to the generation of the post-DN3 cells. Interestingly, a similar number of post-DN3 cells is also generated in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/F</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which presumably also represents a &#x0201c;leaky&#x0201d; phenotype resulting from incomplete <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F</sup> deletion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, row F, columns 1 and 2; and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, top). Importantly, the post-DN3 cells in the two <italic>Brg</italic> mutant strains differ in two ways, and the difference apparently cannot be ascribed to the leakiness in the phenotype in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/F</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

The second difference lies in the composition of post-DN3 cells. Specifically, <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/O</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice harbor a conspicuous CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population that constitutes, on average, 38% of the total post-DN3 pool, whereas this population makes up only 14% in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/F</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, rows E and F, column 4; and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, bottom).

We conclude that Brg point mutation produces similar but not identical defects as Brg deletion.</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotypic differences in Bcl-xL-rescued thymocytes</title><p>Although the post-DN3 cells in the two Brg mutant strains show phenotypic differences, these cells are scarce and are undergoing apoptosis, thus confounding interpretations and hampering mechanistic studies. To circumvent these problems, we introduced a transgene expressing Bcl-xL under the control of the LCK-proximal promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). This transgene, when introduced into <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/&#x02212;</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, was able to rescue Brg-deleted DN4 cells from apoptosis, leading to their accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). The DN4 cells do not accumulate because they hyperproliferate: these cells are in fact completely cell-cycle arrested, and most of them are atrophic. The accumulation instead results from a blockade in DN4&#x02192;DP differentiation, based on the fact that DP cells are virtually absent even though DN4 cells are abundant in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/&#x02212;</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>; Bcl-xL<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice.

Thus, Brg point mutation impairs thymocyte survival, proliferation, and developmental transition, as does the Brg deletion. However, there are two differences between the Brg mutant strains. First, in <italic>Brg</italic>&#x0002a; mice, as in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/O</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, CD25 expression is aberrantly elevated in post-DN3 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, column 1; and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), whereas this aberrance is not seen in <italic>Brg</italic> &#x00394; mice. Second, the composition of post-DN3 cells differs: CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells constitute 25% of the total post-DN3 pool in <italic>Brg</italic> &#x00394; but only 9% in <italic>Brg</italic>&#x0002a; mice cells, whereas CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DN4 cells constitute 39% in <italic>Brg</italic> &#x00394; but 52% in <italic>Brg</italic>&#x0002a; mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Thus, CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells are enriched in <italic>Brg</italic> &#x00394; but depleted in <italic>Brg</italic>&#x0002a; mice, whereas the opposite is seen for CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DN4 cells. The two differences between the Brg mutant strains cannot be ascribed to potential leakiness in the phenotype of <italic>Brg</italic> &#x00394; mice, because the same differences are observed when comparing <italic>Brg</italic>&#x0002a; and <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/&#x02212;</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>; Bcl-xL<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice.

We conclude that Brg point mutation recapitulates the defects in cell survival, proliferation, and developmental transitions seen in Brg-deleted thymocytes, but a major difference between the two mutants lies in the unique ability of Brg point mutation to deplete CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DN4 cells, suggesting that Brg point mutation and deletion differentially affect CD4 transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Brg deletion decreases the probability of <italic>CD4</italic> transcription in DN4 cells</title><p><italic>CD4</italic> transcription is driven by the <italic>CD4</italic> promoter and enhancer, together with a locus control region (LCR) necessary for suppressing the position-effect variegation in certain transgenic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Overall, these positive regulatory elements are constitutively active; the stage-specific fluctuation in CD4 expression depends on the <italic>CD4</italic> silencer that overrides the <italic>CD4</italic> enhancer/promoter, because <italic>CD4</italic> silencer deletion leads to ectopic CD4 expression in DN and CD8 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). The CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells have been previously observed in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/&#x02212;</sup>; Cre<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>; Bcl-xL<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice, constituting &#x0223c;37% of the post-DN3 population, and we have postulated that the CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells arise because Brg deletion cannot completely inactivate the <italic>CD4</italic> silencer, thus leading to CD4 derepression only in a subset of DN4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Paradoxically, Brg point mutation, presumably less effective in silencer inactivation, is able to deplete CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells, which prompted us to revisit the mechanism underlying the generation of CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells.</p><p>We noticed that although &#x0223c;8% of cells in <italic>Brg</italic>&#x0002a; mice fall within the CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> compartment, these CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells appear to express low levels of CD4 and blend into the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> pool, whereas the CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells in <italic>Brg</italic> &#x00394; mice appear to truly lack CD4 expression, and in many cases, form a discrete population that can be readily discerned (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, column 3, red circles). This trend is upheld in post-DN3 blasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, column 4). The data suggest that Brg point mutation uniformly derepresses CD4 in DN4 cells and turns them into CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>DN4 cells, whereas Brg deletion leads to variegated CD4 derepression, with only a subset of DN4 cells expressing CD4. To explore this possibility, we used histograms to quantify CD4 expression in the CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, i.e., the blue-shaded population in post-DN3 blasts and the corresponding cells in the total post-DN3 pool. In both post-DN3 blasts and the total post-DN3 pool, there is only a single, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population in <italic>Brg</italic>&#x0002a; mice, but <italic>Brg</italic> &#x00394; mice harbor a second population whose CD4 expression level is, surprisingly, even lower than that on DN4 cells from WT (<italic>Brg</italic><sup>F/F</sup>) mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, left). WT DN4 cells are known to marginally express CD4; although DN4 cells are by definition CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, these cells have actually begun to turn on <italic>CD4</italic> transcription and express some CD4 protein on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Presumably, a developmentally regulated, temporal-specific mechanism has partially inactivated the <italic>CD4</italic> silencer in DN4 cells, thus triggering the onset of <italic>CD4</italic> transcription. The complete lack of CD4 expression on CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells therefore suggests that Brg deletion blocks the onset of <italic>CD4</italic> transcription in a subset of DN4 cells, thus revealing a positive, ATPase-independent role of Brg in <italic>CD4</italic> transcription. Interestingly, in contrast to DN4 cells, the CD4 expression pattern on DN3 cells is indistinguishable between the two Brg mutants, suggesting that Brg is dispensable for <italic>CD4</italic> transcription at this stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, right).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Brg promotes uniform CD4 expression in DN4 cells.</bold> (A) Surface CD4 expression levels on the CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells in post-DN3 pool (left) and on DN3 cells (right).

However, this &#x0201c;transcription defect&#x0201d; might be an artifact resulting from a failure to inactivate the silencer. In this scenario, the <italic>CD4</italic> silencer somehow remains active in Brg-deleted CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells, thus blocking CD4 expression.

Furthermore, this variegated expression pattern, once established, seems epigenetically stable, surviving in vitro culture for at least 3 d (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Brg binds the <italic>CD4</italic> enhancer and LCR</title><p>We have previously shown that Brg binds the <italic>CD4</italic> silencer, suggesting that Brg directly regulates <italic>CD4</italic> silencer function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). To explore how Brg stimulates CD4 expression, we analyzed Brg binding to the positive regulatory elements at the <italic>CD4</italic> locus. Chromatin from various cell types was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Brg antibody and the DNA was analyzed by two sets of PCR. The first is a multiplex PCR that coamplifies sequences from the <italic>CD4</italic> enhancer, promoter, and silencer together with a fragment from the GAPDH gene, which serves as an internal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). The second is a duplex PCR coamplifying sequences from the <italic>CD4</italic> LCR and GAPDH genes. As expected, Brg binds the <italic>CD4</italic> silencer in DN (mostly DN3) cells from Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and in DN (mostly DN4) cells from <italic>Brg</italic>&#x0002a; mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>, top, lanes 1 and 4). Remarkably, in these cells, Brg also binds the <italic>CD4</italic> enhancer and LCR, although binding to the <italic>CD4</italic> promoter is marginal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>, lanes 1 and 4). Interestingly, in DP cells from WT mice, Brg binds all four <italic>CD4</italic> regulatory elements, including the promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>, lane 2). The binding is specific because the signals were undetectable in DN cells from <italic>Brg</italic> &#x00394; mice or in B cells from WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>, lanes 3, 5, and 6). These data suggest that Brg facilitates <italic>CD4</italic> transcription in DN4 cells by directly acting on <italic>CD4</italic> enhancer/LCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of Brg mutations on <italic>CD4</italic> enhancer/LCR accessibility</title><p>We have begun to explore the molecular mechanism whereby Brg stimulates <italic>CD4</italic> transcription. Our genetic data indicate that Brg uses a novel, ATPase-independent activity to stimulate <italic>CD4</italic> transcription, which predicts that Brg-dependent remodeling of the <italic>CD4</italic> enhancer/LCR, if any, is not relevant to the functions of these elements. To confirm this, we used restriction enzymes to probe the accessibility of the <italic>CD4</italic> regulatory elements. Brg mutations strongly reduce the silencer accessibility (unpublished data), as expected from the essential role of the Brg ATPase in <italic>CD4</italic> silencer function. In contrast, Brg mutations do not affect the LCR accessibility, suggesting that Brg-dependent remodeling does not play any role in LCR function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>, right). Although Brg mutations do moderately reduce <italic>CD4</italic> enhancer accessibility, the extent of decrease in CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells is comparable to that in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DN4 cells, suggesting that the accessibility decrease cannot explain the selective loss of CD4 expression in CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>DN4 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>, left). These data are consistent with the idea that ATP-dependent remodeling is dispensable for Brg to stimulate <italic>CD4</italic> transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have developed a method whereby mice with a thymocyte-specific point mutation in the Brg ATPase domain are generated within the same litters as mice deleting Brg in thymocytes. Brg point mutation recapitulates multiple defects produced by Brg deletion but unexpectedly alters CD25 expression and is far more effective in derepressing CD4 than Brg deletion. Further analysis indicates that Brg not only represses CD4 in DN cells but also ensures the onset of <italic>CD4</italic> transcription during DN&#x02192;DP transition; the latter effect, obscured in the Brg deletion mutant, is ATPase independent and perhaps mediated by physical interactions between Brg and the <italic>CD4</italic> locus. This is the first demonstration that the ATPase-dead Brg point mutant, at a physiological concentration, is able to activate an endogenous gene. Our study thus proves that the BAF complex indeed harbors a novel activity in gene regulation distinct from ATP-dependent remodeling, the hallmark function of the BAF complex. Furthermore, it reveals that this activity is sufficient to regulate at least one target gene in the absence of Brg-dependent remodeling, which is counterintuitive given that endogenous genes are chromatinized. Our data highlight the complexity in the mechanisms of gene regulation in vivo, and raise the exciting possibility that the novel activities of the BAF complex might be widely involved in the regulation of BAF target genes, although by themselves such activities in general appear insufficient for gene regulation without concomitant Brg-dependent remodeling. Collectively, our study illustrates the power of conditional point mutations, rarely used in mammalian genetics, for dissecting and discovering gene functions. The strategy for simultaneous generation of deletion and point mutants is generally applicable to other genes.</p><sec><title>Deletion versus point mutation</title><p>Protein functions are typically studied by deleting the gene encoding the protein. This approach has several limitations. A protein often has multiple functions. Deletion abolishes all the functions, which may produce complex phenotypes, thus obscuring certain defects, such as the positive role of Brg in <italic>CD4</italic> regulation. On the other hand, some defects may be masked by the redundant action of a related protein. Such a scenario could potentially explain why Brg point mutation (but not Brg deletion) enhances CD25 expression, assuming that the Brg homologue Brm could compensate for Brg to repress CD25.</p><p>These limitations in deletion analysis may be overcome by introducing point mutations into relevant regions of the gene, because point mutations are more specific, and the mutant protein may act as a dominant negative to prevent the related protein from masking the phenotypes. Point mutations may help uncover protein functions via other mechanisms. For example, a point mutation at serine 276 in the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;b, which prevents p65 phosphorylation but does not affect its DNA binding, produces developmental defects distinct from those seen in p65 knock-out mice, thus providing unique insights into the biological functions of p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). As in the case of deletion mutations, it is often desirable to introduce point mutations in a tissue-specific manner, but the technology for making such point mutations has not been well established. Before this work, three approaches were proposed to generate such mutations. The first two rely on Cre-mediated excision of an inverted, mutated exon that turns a WT allele into the mutant allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). In each case, mutant LoxP sites that enable unidirectional recombination are used. An advantage of these methods is that the mutation can be introduced anywhere in the gene. The disadvantages are that inserting the inverted exon may interfere with the expression of the WT gene, and that Cre-mediated recombination of the mutant LoxP sites may not be as efficient as WT loxP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). So far, no publications describing the successful use of these methods for generating conditional point mutant mice have appeared. The third strategy has been successfully used to introduce mutations into the 3&#x02032; end of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-R gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). In this method, the 3&#x02032; portion of the GABA<sub>A</sub>-R gene that encompasses the site to be mutated is floxed, and a mutated version of this portion is duplicated and placed downstream of the endogenous locus. This mutant segment is transcriptionally silent until unmasked by Cre-mediated excision of the WT segment, where the mutant segment replaces the WT counterpart in the targeted gene. Whether this method can be used to introduce mutations elsewhere in the gene remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>Our method has several useful features. First, mutations can be introduced anywhere in the gene. Second, the status of the bi-functional allele can theoretically be monitored using the GFP engineered in the gene-trapping cassette, which should facilitate phenotypic analysis. Although we failed to detect GFP expression in the targeted <italic>Brg</italic> allele, we believe this is caused by the use of the destabilized version of GFP. Indeed, we have introduced a gene-trapping cassette expressing a regular GFP into the BAF57 gene encoding another subunit of the BAF complex and were able to visualize GFP in the targeted ES clones (unpublished data). The last feature is that our strategy can generate deletion and point mutants within the same litters, allowing for the direct comparison of phenotypes. A drawback of our strategy is that two different alleles (i.e., a floxed and a bifunctional allele) must be generated to reveal the effects of the point mutation, as opposed to the aforementioned methods that only need one conditional allele. Finally, the genes being targeted must be haplosufficient for embryogenesis. However, given that traditional floxed alleles have already been made for numerous genes, many of which are haplosufficient for embryogenesis, our strategy should be widely useful.</p></sec><sec><title>Dual role of the BAF complex in <italic>CD4</italic> regulation</title><p>We and others previously showed that Brg deletion disrupts CD4 repression in DN cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Unexpectedly, Brg point mutation is more effective in derepressing CD4 than the Brg deletion, which led to the discovery of the dual roles of Brg in CD4 regulation, as proposed in the model in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. In DN1&#x02013;3 cells, the <italic>CD4</italic> promoter is completely inhibited by the fully active silencer. In DN4 cells, the silencer is presumably beginning to be inactivated by a physiological mechanism not involving Brg, thus initiating <italic>CD4</italic> transcription that culminates in full-blown CD4 expression in DP cells. Brg is required for CD4 silencer function in DN3 and 4, and presumably also in DN1 and 2 cells. Brg also increases the probability of <italic>CD4</italic> transcriptional initiation in DN4 cells. Thus, Brg deletion produces conflicting effects in DN4 cells: it facilitates CD4 derepression by helping inactivate the <italic>CD4</italic> silencer while stochastically blocking the onset of <italic>CD4</italic> transcription, leading to a variegated CD4 expression pattern that seems epigenetically stable once established. CD4 repression by Brg requires its ATPase, whereas an ATPase-independent activity is used to promote <italic>CD4</italic> transcription.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>A model for the roles of Brg in <italic>CD4</italic> regulation.</bold> T cells develop from DN to DP cells. CD4 expression (red dots), first detected in DN4 cells, is controlled by the silencer (S), <italic>CD4</italic> promoter (P), enhancer (E), and LCR (L). For simplicity, the silencer is depicted to be located upstream of, and to act on, the <italic>CD4</italic> promoter (top), but the exact mechanism of repression is unknown. Brg plays a dual role in <italic>CD4</italic> regulation in DN cells by acting on both the silencer and enhancer/LCR, using distinct biochemical activities (bottom).

Brg binds the <italic>CD4</italic> silencer, where it uses the ATPase to remodel the chromatin and facilitates the entry of Runx1, a transcription repressor essential for CD4 inhibition in DN cells, and this effect might be responsible for CD4 repression (unpublished data). The mechanism for positive CD4 regulation is unclear. Brg binds the <italic>CD4</italic> enhancer and LCR, suggesting that the BAF complex acts directly on these elements, but future experiments are needed to prove this; it is possible that Brg binding at the <italic>CD4</italic> enhancer/LCR is functionally irrelevant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). For example, Brg may act instead by stimulating the expression of a transcription activator required for efficient CD4 expression. Interestingly, Brg is dispensable for CD4 expression in DN3 cells, indicating that a distinct mechanism is used to ensure uniform CD4 expression in these cells. Brg also seems dispensable for CD4 expression in DP cells, because DP cells in Brg &#x00394; mice show uniform, high level CD4 expression. The role of Brg in CD4 regulation in ISP cells is unknown; ISP cells are undetectable in Brg &#x00394; mice apparently because they have lost CD8 expression.</p><p>Finally, we note that the effectiveness of Brg point mutation in CD4 derepression may explain the &#x0201c;loss&#x0201d; of DN4 cells in <italic>Brg</italic><sup>O/&#x0002b;</sup>; Cre <sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Presumably, Brg (K/R) has interfered with WT Brg protein, leading to premature CD4 expression on DN4 cells, which subsequently leave the DN4 compartment and blend into the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> pool.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>DNA construct, ES cell targeting, and mice breeding.</title><p>To make the construct described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, we first constructed a gene-trapping cassette consisting of the following: (a) a 120-bp fragment from pCEM MINX containing the adenovirus major late transcript splicing acceptor sequence from the intron 1/exon 2 boundary (a gift from S.
