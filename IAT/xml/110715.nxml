Transcripts of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> could be shown to exclusively accumulate in actively proliferating cells of the meristems of mesocotyls and root apices, suggesting <italic>ZmMET1</italic> expression to be associated with DNA replication. This was confirmed by simultaneous decrease of transcripts of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> and histone <italic>H3</italic>, a marker for DNA replication, in seedlings exposed to wounding, desiccation and salinity, all of which suppress cell division. Cold stress also depressed both transcripts in root tissues. In contrast, however, accumulation of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcripts in shoot mesocotyls was not affected by cold stress, whereas those for <italic>H3</italic> sharply decreased. Such a differential accumulation of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcripts was consistent with ZmMET1 protein levels as revealed by western blotting. Expression of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> is thus coexistent, but not completely dependent on DNA replication. Southern hybridization analysis with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme revealed that cold treatment induced demethylation of DNA in the <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> transposon region, but not in other genes, and that such demethylation primarily occurred in roots. These results suggested that the methylation level was decreased selectively by cold treatment, and that ZmMET1 may, at least partly, prevent such demethylation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x98b7630.0x95a1968" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

It occurs predominantly in CG and CNG, and levels change in a tissue- and&#x0002f;or development-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c4">4</xref>). The physiological functions in plants are not absolutely clear, but it is proposed to play an important role for modulating DNA compartmentalization, determining chromatin structure, genomic imprinting, regulation of tissue-specific gene expression, aging and gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c5">5</xref>).</p><p>Methylation of cytosines is catalyzed by an enzyme, DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase (MET) (EC 2.1.1.37), which transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to the fifth position of a cytosine residue. Depending on the catalytic properties, isoforms are classified into two major groups; <italic>de novo</italic> MET and maintenance MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c7">7</xref>). Since cytosine methylation is a post replicative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c8">8</xref>), maintenance MET which preferentially methylates cytosine residues in hemi-methylated DNAs has been intensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c11">11</xref>). Corresponding genes have been successfully isolated from several species, including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, pea, carrot and tobacco plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c15">15</xref>), and the genomic sequence for maize has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c6">6</xref>). A survey of polypeptides encoded by these genes revealed that they are classified into three groups, METI, METII and METIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c16">16</xref>). Among these proteins, METI has been most intensively studied, being of considerable size, ranging up to 170 kDa, and containing well conserved domains found not only in plant METs but also in the animal counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c17">17</xref>). Further analyses showed the polypeptides to comprise two domains, a C-terminal catalytic domain, which is similar in structure to prokaryote MET, and a regulatory N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c1">1</xref>). The catalytic domain contains up to 10 conserved motifs, designated I to X, which are essentially organized in the same order. The motifs I, II, III, IV, V and X constitute the AdoMet-binding pocket and the highly conserved motif IV binds DNA. The subregion between motifs VIII and IX constitutes the domain that recognizes the target methylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c19">19</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to this physico-chemical characterization, the physiological significance in plants has received only limited attention. In the carrot and pea, <italic>MET</italic> transcripts are mainly observed in meristematic tissues, suggesting them to be associated with cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c13">13</xref>). However, no experiments have so far been carried out on the impact of exogenous factors on <italic>MET</italic> expression, despite increasing knowledge on the essential roles of DNA methylation, for example in gene silencing and&#x0002f;or self-defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c11">11</xref>). Transposable elements have been shown to be heavily methylated, probably for silencing by the host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c20">20</xref>) and vernalization was proposed to be associated with demethylation of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c22">22</xref>). In an attempt to understand MET roles in plants, we selected maize as an experimental material, because previous studies have relatively well characterized its genome silenced by hypermethylation and the included multi-copies of transposons and highly repetitive regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c23">23</xref>). In the present study, isolation and molecular characterization of a cDNA fragment encoding MET from maize were carried out, and possible associations not only with DNA replication but also with self-defense of genomic DNA explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plant material and stress treatments</title><p>Maize seeds (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L. cv.

Seedlings were dissected into leaf blades, leaf sheaths, mesocotyls, mature roots (without meristem) and root apices (with meristem), frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02013;85&#x000b0;C until use. To investigate wounding responses, excised segments of mesocotyl were incubated under the same light and temperature conditions in covered petri dishes containing 30 ml of MS medium. For drought treatment, MS medium was removed from the cultures allowing roots to dry in an incubator. Salt stress was applied by adding 0.2 M NaCl to the medium and chilling experiments accomplished by transferring seedlings to an incubator at 4&#x000b0;C with the same light and humidity conditions. Ethyl-methane sulfonate (EMS) treatments were performed by submerging entire seedlings in MS medium containing EMS at 0.5&#x00025;. After incubation for 24 h under the same light and temperature conditions, samples were rinsed with 5&#x00025; sodium thiosulfate solution to neutralize EMS, transferred back to the original hydroponic culture condition, and incubated further under the same light, humidity and temperature conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> cDNA, probe preparation and DNA sequencing</title><p>A cDNA library, constructed in a ZAP cloning vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), was screened with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled cDNA fragment of <italic>NtMET1</italic>, a gene encoding a tobacco MET.

A cDNA clone of 2646 bp was further analyzed (EMBL accession no.

Upon comparison of our cDNA fragment with the genomic sequence together with cDNAs from other plant species, the full-length cDNA was predicted to be 4573 bp in size containing an open reading frame for 1525 amino acids (171 kDa), and designated as <italic>ZmMET1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f1">1</xref>). ZmMET1 is composed of two domains, the C-terminal catalytic domain which contains 10 conserved motifs of METs, and the N-terminal domain for regulatory functions. It should be noted that 9 out of 10 introns are localized in the N-terminal region.</p></sec><sec><title>MET activity</title><p>Bacterially expressed ZmMET1 was incubated with (methyl-<sup>3</sup>H)AdoMet and dcm<sup>&#x02013;</sup><italic>E.coli</italic> genomic DNA, and <sup>3</sup>H-incorporation into DNA was measured at various time intervals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f2">2</xref>A). The reaction increased linearly up to 3 h, reaching a plateau thereafter. It is clear that this is due to enzymatic activity, because no increase in <sup>3</sup>H-incorporation was observed with heat-inactivated GST-ZmMET1 protein. The observed reaction pattern was consistent with that of <italic>M.Hap</italic>II. These observations clearly show that bacterially expressed protein indeed possesses MET activity. Velocity measurements at various AdoMet concentrations were then performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f2">2</xref>B). The reaction velocity was concentration-dependent, showing a hyperbolic curve, and the double-reciprocal plots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f2">2</xref>B, insert) gave a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value of 0.3 &#x000b5;M.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular organization and tissue specificity</title><p>The molecular organization of the <italic>ZmMET1</italic> in maize genome was determined by Southern hybridization analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f3">3</xref>). When genomic DNA was digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI, for which no site is present over at least 8 kb of the genomic region, a hybridization signal was only detected in the high molecular weight region.

However, under low stringency washing conditions, extra signals that appeared not to result from <italic>ZmMET1</italic>, were also observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f3">3</xref>A).

Leaf sheath node regions and root apices were analyzed because of their highest accumulation of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcripts as shown by northern assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f3">3</xref>C). In root apex sections, the digoxygenin-UTP labeled anti-sense probe was mainly localized in the initials of the epidermis and cortex, in the radicle cortex and potential metaxylem tissues, but not in the protoderm and root caps (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f4">4</xref>A and C). Transcript levels appeared to decrease in all distal tissues as they progressively elongated and&#x0002f;or differentiated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f4">4</xref>A). In the leaf sheath node region, transcripts were accumulated at the leaf primordium edges as shown in transversal sections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f4">4</xref>D, E and F) and in longitudinal section (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f4">4</xref>G). However, they were found not to be uniformly distributed among the cells, showing a blotchy pattern.</p></sec><sec><title>Stress response</title><p>The experiments detailed above suggested that <italic>ZmMET1</italic> is predominantly expressed in proliferating cells. Subsequently we examined effects of various stresses that may interfere with cell division. As the control, the histone H3 gene (<italic>H3</italic>) was selected, because its transcripts are mainly encountered during the S phase of the cell cycle, so that it can be used as a marker gene for DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c30">30</xref>). Changes of transcript level for <italic>ZmMET1</italic> and <italic>H3</italic> in coleptile node and mesocotyl regions in response to stress were examined by northern hybridization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f5">5</xref>). Mechanical wounding by direct cutting of mesocotyl tissues significantly inhibited transcript accumulation of both <italic>ZmMET1</italic> and <italic>H3</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f5">5</xref>A). When seedlings were subjected to drought (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f5">5</xref>B), or to salinity by being transferred to MS medium containing 0.5 M NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f5">5</xref>C), levels of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> and <italic>H3</italic> transcripts began to sharply decrease after several hours. These observations indicate that expression of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> and <italic>H3</italic> is seriously affected when cell division or DNA replication is disturbed, and therefore that ZmMET1 may be involved in DNA replication complex. This conclusion, however, was countered by the finding that, when seedlings were treated with low temperature, no change was observed in <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcript levels, while <italic>H3</italic> transcripts were significantly decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f5">5</xref>D).</p></sec><sec><title>Cold stress and DNA damage</title><p>The resistance of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> to cold was further investigated by subjecting seedlings to a temperature of 4&#x000b0;C for up to 4 days, during which period RNA was extracted from mesocotyl and root tissues. The level of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcripts in the mesocotyl was weakly affected for up to 4 days (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f6">6</xref>A), while that in root tissues was significantly decreased to &#x0223c;75&#x00025; of the initial level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f6">6</xref>B). Transcripts for <italic>H3</italic> were decreased in both tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f6">6</xref>A and B). This indicates that regulation of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcript level is not always coupled with DNA replication in mesocotyl tissues. A possible explanation is that ZmMET1 is involved in DNA repair, which is required for restoration of damaged DNA under cold stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c31">31</xref>). In order to examine this possibility, maize seedlings were treated for 24 h with EMS which severely damages DNA, and allowed to recover for up to 24 h. Transcript levels of both <italic>ZmMET1</italic> and <italic>H3</italic> were then estimated by northern assay in mesocotyl and root tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f6">6</xref>C and D). Results showed both transcripts to be decreased upon DNA damage, indicating ZmMET1 not necessarily to function in repair system.</p><p>In order to examine whether the differential accumulation of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcripts reflects the protein level, western blotting was performed with extracts of tissues subjected to cold treatments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f7">7</xref>). In mesocotyl tissues, the protein level was not affected during transitory cold treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f7">7</xref>A), being consistent with unchanged transcript levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f5">5</xref>D). Even under prolonged cold treatments, MET proteins in mesocotyl tissues were constitutively present, whereas those in root tissues rapidly declined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f7">7</xref>B). These differential profiles of MET1 protein are consistent with accumulation patterns of its transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f6">6</xref>A and B), indicating the correlation between transcription and translation of ZmMET1 in response to external stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Altered DNA methylation status under cold stress</title><p>The possible reason for continuous expression of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> in the mesocotyl under cold conditions is that ZmMET1 is required to continue methylation of DNA. To assess this question, genomic DNA was examined for methylation status by Southern hybridization analysis. DNA samples from mesocotyl and root seedlings treated or untreated by cold stress were digested with a restriction endonuclease, <italic>Hpa</italic>II, which recognizes methylation of the second cytosine in CCGG sequence. The methylation pattern was examined at loci for <italic>ZmPK4</italic>, which is up-regulated by cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c32">32</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f8">8</xref>A and B), for <italic>ZmMET1</italic> itself (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f8">8</xref>C and D), for <italic>H3</italic> which is down-regulated by cold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f8">8</xref>E and F) and for the <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> transposon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f8">8</xref>G and H). The hybridization for the <italic>ZmPK4</italic> locus demonstrated the methylation pattern to be the same for both untreated and treated cases, although tissue-specific differences were distinct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f8">8</xref>A and B). Results for the <italic>ZmMET1</italic> and <italic>H3</italic> regions were completely the same among all samples regardless of the cold treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f8">8</xref>C, D, E and F). However, methylation of the <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> transposon locus showed distinct patterns. DNA isolated from cold-treated mesocotyl tissues showed essentially the same pattern, although slight decrease and increase of 0.8 and 0.5 kb fragments, respectively, was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f8">8</xref>G). However, in DNA isolated from cold-treated root tissues, a clear change in restriction pattern occurred, showing disappearance of several large-size fragments and increase in a 0.5 kb fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd506f8">8</xref>H). This indicates demethylation at CCGG sites had occurred. Similar experiments with another restriction endonuclease, <italic>Msp</italic>I, which recognizes the first cytosine in CCGG, did not show any difference among these genes (data not shown), indicating the change in methylation to have occurred at the second cytosine. It should be noted that the observed difference in methylation pattern is analytical, since, due to a high copy number of <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c23">23</xref>), data only suggest that the ratio of individual restriction fragment to the total population might be changed. Within these experimental limitations, however, it could be concluded that, while methylation pattern in individual genes did not vary, that in a transposon(s) did change upon cold stress. To determine whether or not the altered methylation pattern affected expression of the <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> transposon, northern hybridization was performed but no expression was detectable (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present paper documents findings for properties of a gene encoding a MET from maize. The partial putative amino acid sequence, encoded by a 2.6 kb cDNA fragment (EMBL accession no. AF229183) obtained by screening of a cDNA library using a tobacco cDNA for MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c15">15</xref>) as the probe showed high similarity with those of other known plant DNA METs. It also matched well with the amino acid sequence predicted from the genomic sequence (EMBL accession no. AF063403), which was submitted to the database during the course of the present study. Comparison of the deduced polypeptide with other METs indicated that it is comprised of 1525 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 171.5 kDa, having 10 conserved motifs characteristic of METs in the C-terminal region and several alternating clusters of lysine&#x02013;arginine residues that separate the N- and C-terminal domains. DNA methyltransferase activity was confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> assay using bacterially expressed protein to efficiently methylate DNA from <italic>E.coli</italic>. These characteristics clearly indicate that it belongs to the MET1 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c6">6</xref>), and therefore it was designated as ZmMET1.</p><p>Northern blot analyses showed <italic>ZmMET1</italic> to be essentially only expressed in tissues where the proportion of proliferating cells is substantial, as shown by active accumulation of <italic>H3</italic> transcripts. This was corroborated by the spatial distribution revealed by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcripts being predominantly accumulated in the apical meristem, where cells actively divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c17">17</xref>). However, the hybridization signal appears to be situated in clusters of cells disseminated in the youngest tissues with blotchy labeling patterns. A similar pattern was observed with carrot <italic>MET</italic> and it was interpreted as possibly reflecting cell-cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c13">13</xref>). Cell-cycle dependent transcription for <italic>MET</italic> has also been reported for mammals and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c33">33</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that MET is closely associated with DNA replication not only in enzymatic activity, but also in its transcriptional regulation.</p><p>In order to examine whether expression of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> is strictly linked with DNA replication, its transcript levels in response to physico-chemical stresses that affect cell proliferation, or DNA replication, were assayed by northern hybridization. Wounding, which suppressed cell division as shown by a decrease of <italic>H3</italic> transcripts, also strongly inhibited <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcript accumulation. It is generally considered that methyl-jasmonate, ethylene and&#x0002f;or abscisic acid mediate wound signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c35">35</xref>). However, we found none of these chemicals to induce <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcript accumulation (unpublished observations), suggesting that signal transduction molecules arising from wounding are not directly involved in regulation of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> expression. Water seizure caused by drought or salinity also simultaneously suppressed <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcript accumulation and cell proliferation, suggesting that expression of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> is indeed dependent on DNA replication.</p><p>However, this conclusion was countered by the finding that cold treatment had only a limited impact on <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcript levels, despite strong repression of <italic>H3</italic> transcript accumulation. This was confirmed by western blotting showing the levels of ZmMET1 protein to be associated with its transcript levels. Since it is established that cell division is inhibited by chilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c36">36</xref>), this discrepancy in transcript accumulation patterns suggests that cell division and <italic>ZmMET1</italic> expression are probably normally coexistent but not completely associated. This is in line with previous observations of mature tissues in which, in spite of low rates of cell division, high expression of MET genes was apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c17">17</xref>). One possible explanation is that cold stress may induce DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c31">31</xref>), which activates DNA repair machinery requiring METs to maintain the initial methylation patterns. In order to assess this hypothesis, we examined the effects of DNA damage by using EMS and UV-C irradiation, but no increase of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcript level was observed (unpublished observations).</p><p>A second explanation is that hypermethylation of genomic DNA occurs to silence genes that are not necessary in a cold environment. It has been proposed that, upon chilling, several hundreds of genes are up- or down-regulated to cope with severe stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c37">37</xref>), and it is conceivable that DNA methylation participates in such a regulation system. Indeed, recent work showed an altered methylation pattern with cold treatment in <italic>A.thaliana</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c21">21</xref>). In the present study, we found that, under cold stress, methylation patterns in individual genes appeared to be faithfully maintained in all tissues examined, whereas those in transposons did change in a tissue-specific manner. Since our experiments were only diagnostically performed by detecting methylation at limited cytosine residues in limited genomic regions, it is too early to conclude that overall methylation status has changed upon cold treatments. Nevertheless, the finding is of particular interest regarding biological significance of METs. First, demethylation appears to occur selectively in particular genome regions. To our knowledge, this is the first clear evidence of cold-induced demethylation of distinct gene(s), although global demethylation was observed in cold stressed chicory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c22">22</xref>). Secondly, cold-induced change in methylation status may potentially change expression of related genes. This idea is consistent with a finding that vernalization is mediated through a gradual activation of relevant genes by altered methylation status during cold treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c21">21</xref>). Thirdly, methylation blocks, or at least reduces expression of <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> transposons. Although we could not detect transcripts of <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> after cold treatment of root tissues, in which the <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> region was demethylated, it is highly probable that some of the <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> loci were activated upon cold stress. Indeed, <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> is known to be largely quiescent during normal growth, but activated upon stress treatments including wounding, pathogen attack and cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c41">41</xref>). Activation of <italic>Ac&#x0002f;Ds</italic> has also been reported to be inversely correlated with methylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c42">42</xref>). These observations are consistent with the idea that methylation functions as a defense mechanism against invading DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd506c11">11</xref>). Fourthly, if the former assumption is correct, ZmMET1 may play a crucial role in preventing demethylation. This is supported by our finding that, in cold-stressed mesocotyl tissues, <italic>ZmMET1</italic> remains largely expressed and demethylation does occur weakly, in contrast to the case in roots, where <italic>ZmMET1</italic> is silenced. The reason for differential accumulation of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> transcripts between the mesocotyl and roots is not clear, but it is conceivable that the self-defense system of the above-ground parts of plants, which suffer more severe temperature changes than roots, is more strongly constituted in comparison with that in other parts of the plant body. Although further evidence from enzyme activity measurement and quantitation of m<sup>5</sup>C is needed, the inverse relationship between <italic>ZmMET1</italic> expression and DNA methylation status strongly supports the idea that the latter changes dynamically depending on the environmental conditions, and that such changes may be modulated by METs.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd506f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Schematic representation of <italic>ZmMET1</italic> gene.
