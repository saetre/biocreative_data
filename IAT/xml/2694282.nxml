Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCH L1) has been linked to several neurological diseases as well as human cancer, but the physiological targets and the regulation of UCH L1 expression <italic>in vivo</italic> have been largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that UCH L1 up-regulates &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF signaling: UCH L1 forms endogenous complexes with &#x003b2;-catenin, stabilizes it and up-regulates &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. We also show that, reciprocally, &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF signaling up-regulates expression of endogenous UCH L1 mRNA and protein. Moreover, using ChIP assay and direct mutagenesis we identify two TCF4-binding sites on the uch l1 promoter that are involved in this regulation. Since the expression and deubiquitinating activity of UCH L1 are required for its own basic promoter activity, we propose that UCH L1 up-regulates its expression by activation of the oncogenic &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF signaling in transformed cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lifetime of many central components of intracellular signaling is regulated by the ubiquitin system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005955-Finley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

We attempted to determine whether the deubiquitinating activity of UCH L1 is important for its ability to form a complex with &#x003b2;-catenin. After overexpression of HA-UCH L1 wild type and mutants C90S and H161D (with cysteine 90 and histidine 161 converted to serine and aspartic acid, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005955-Larsen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>), UCH L1 was immunoprecipitated from the cells and the precipitates probed with &#x003b2;-catenin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005955-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, left). Deubiquitinating activity of overexpressed HA-UCH L1 proteins was tested by hydrolysis of the Ub-AMC substrate, which confirmed that enzymatic activity of both C90S and H161D was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005955-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, right). The results indicate that &#x003b2;-catenin is associated preferentially with wild type UCH L1, but not with enzymatically inactive UCH L1 mutants, indicating that the deubiquitinating activity of UCH L1 is required for the molecular events that precede its association with &#x003b2;-catenin.</p><p>To investigate the possible role of UCH L1 expression in the regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin levels, we created 293 cell lines stably expressing two different UCH L1 siRNAs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Material and Methods</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005955-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, the inhibition of UCH L1 protein expression correlates with reduction of &#x003b2;-catenin levels. To determine whether UCH L1 expression affects &#x003b2;-catenin ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, we immunoprecipitated endogenous &#x003b2;-catenin from control and UCH L1 siRNA-expressing cells in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005955-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Western blot analysis demonstrates that while without the inhibitor the amount of &#x003b2;-catenin is reduced in UCH L1 siRNA-expressing cells (compare lanes 3 and 5 to lane 1), the amount of accumulated &#x003b2;-catenin in the presence of MG101 is greater in the cells where UCH L1 expression is inhibited (compare lanes 4 and 6 to lane 2). These results indicate the involvement of UCH L1 in the regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin ubiquitination, and suggest the possibility of direct deubiquitination of &#x003b2;-catenin by UCH L1. To test this possibility, we used <italic>in vitro</italic>-translated and <italic>in vitro</italic>-ubiquitinated &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005955-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 4 and 1) as substrate for UCH L1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005955-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, lanes 2 and 3, the addition of purified UCH L1 results in the disappearance of high molecular weight forms of &#x003b2;-catenin. These results point to &#x003b2;-catenin as a plausible substrate for UCH L1, although they do not eliminate the possibility that UCH L1 effects &#x003b2;-catenin degradation indirectly. For example, deubiquitination of other targets could result in impaired ubiquitination or proteasomal degradation of &#x003b2;-catenin in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> systems.

Reduction of expression of UCH L1 correlates with decrease in &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels. 293 cells were transfected with control GFP siRNA or two UCH L1 siRNAs in pRS vector and maintained in medium containing puromycin.

Western blot was performed with &#x003b2;-catenin antibody. D. Deubiquitinating activity of UCH L1 is required for TCF4 transcriptional activity. UCH L1 wild type or UCH L1 inactive mutants C90S and H161D were co-transfected with either TOPFlash or FOPFlash into 293 and 3T3 cells.

These results might be explained by different endogenous levels of UCH L1 in 293 and 3T3 cells: so that additional overexpression could not add much to &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF activity in 293 cells, whereas in 3T3 cells which have very low endogenous UCH L1, the effect of exogenous UCH L1 on &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF signaling was more profound.

We transiently transfected wild type and mutant reporters into 3T3 cells and compared their activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005955-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). To activate &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF signaling, we used co-expression of wild type TCF4, treatment with LiCL, or the combination of both. TCF4 itself was able to activate only UCHL1p-WT, but not any of the three mutant reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005955-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, second column in each group). In the presence of LiCl, mutations in each putative TCF/Lef site resulted in a decrease of the promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005955-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, third column in each group). The combination of TCF4 and LiCl had the strongest cumulative effect on the wild type promoter (UCHL1p-WT). Mutations in each (with a slightly more profound effect on the double-mutant) putative TCF/Lef binding site significantly reduced TCF4/LiCl-dependent activation of Uchl1p-Luc reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005955-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, fourth column of each group). Taken together these results identify the uch l1 promoter as a direct target of &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF/Lef transcriptional activity. It is worth noticing, that although mutations in each or both TCF/Lef sites on the uch l1 promoter reduce promoter activity in the presence of LiCl, they do not reduce activity to the basal level.

PCR reaction was performed with 5 &#x000b5;l precipitated DNA using the primer pairs flanking consensus TCF sites in UCH L1 promoter. PCR conditions: one cycle, 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 2 m, and a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The primers used in the reaction are: Site 1 (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032; CATTTACATTCATTCGTATT 3&#x02032;</named-content>, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032; CCTTTCACCATCCCAATTAC 3&#x02032;</named-content>) and Site 2 (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032; ATGGGTTTCCAGAAACTTCG 3&#x02032;</named-content>, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032; TGGTTGTGGAGACGGGATTT 3&#x02032;</named-content>).</p></sec><sec id="s3m"><title>Site Directed Mutagenesis</title><p>The UCH L1 promoter was mutated at different TCF4/Lef1 binding sites using the Quik-Change Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).
