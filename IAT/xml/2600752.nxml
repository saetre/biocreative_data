These studies have proposed that actomyosin interactions bring together the cortical nodes to form a compacted ring structure. In this study, we test this model in cells that are unable to assemble cortical nodes. Although the cortical nodes play a role in the timing of ring assembly, we find that they are dispensable for the assembly of orthogonal actomyosin rings.

In fission yeast, an actomyosin ring is assembled early in mitosis and constricts after mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marks et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fankhauser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McCollum et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Filamentous actin (F-actin) in the ring has been shown to assemble from a leading cable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arai and Mabuchi, 2002</xref>). Recent studies have led to the proposal that actomyosin ring assembly instead is initiated from multiple cortical nodes, each containing two dimers of the formin Cdc12p, anillin-related protein Mid1p, type II myosins, the FCH-BAR (Fer/Cip4 homology&#x02013;Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs) domain protein Cdc15p, and the IQGAP (IQ motif&#x02013;containing GTPase-activating protein)-related protein Rng2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vavylonis et al., 2008</xref>). Nodelike structures have also been detected from several other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Motegi et al., 2004</xref>). Mid1p plays a key role in the cortical anchoring of these nodes because loss of Mid1p function eliminates the assembly of detectable nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Computational modeling experiments consistent with experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daga and Chang (2005)</xref> have revealed that forces generated by type II myosins combined with a search and capture mechanism help compact nodes placed within a 8-&#x003bc;m zone into a proper ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daga and Chang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vavylonis et al., 2008</xref>). Although the node-based ring assembly mechanism is very attractive, a prediction that arises from this model is that cells containing fewer or no nodes should be unable to assemble normal actomyosin rings.</p><p>In this study, we have characterized the process of actomyosin ring assembly in cells lacking Mid1p and detectable nodes. We find that cells lacking Mid1p and detectable nodes can assemble normal-looking actomyosin rings, albeit with a delayed kinetics. Thus, a cortical node&#x02013;independent mechanism is sufficient for the assembly of properly organized actomyosin rings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Cortical nodes are not detected in cells lacking Mid1p</title><p>In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al.

(2006)</xref>, we have found that Cdc15p organizes into a few nodelike structures (15 &#x000b1; 7 nodes/cell; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 17; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and that the number and intensity of these structures is increased (45 &#x000b1; 18 nodes/cell; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 22; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) upon treatment with latrunculin A (LatA), which prevents actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayscough et al., 1997</xref>). We have also been able to observe colocalization of Cdc15p-GFP nodes with Rlc1p-mCherry nodes in LatA-treated cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al. (2006)</xref>, we have found that organization of Cdc15p into nodes in untreated and LatA-treated cells depended on Mid1p function. Although we have been able to detect Rlc1p and Cdc15p in cortical nodes, we were unable to detect the formin Cdc12p in cortical nodes in unperturbed cells, which is consistent with studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yonetani et al. (2008)</xref>. Nevertheless, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al.

Approximately 51% of Cdc12p nodes (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 270) generated by LatA treatment colocalized with Rlc1p nodes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).

Collectively, these studies established that some actomyosin ring components (such as Rlc1p and Cdc15p) are detected in nodes in unperturbed cells, whereas others (such as Cdc12p) are detected in nodes only upon LatA treatment. Furthermore, our experiments as well as other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Motegi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2006</xref>) have established that the organization of cortical nodes depends on Mid1p function.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Membrane-associated nodes of Rlc1p, Cdc15p, and Cdc12p are not detected in cells lacking Mid1p.</bold> (A) <italic>cdc25</italic>-22 and <italic>cdc25</italic>-22 <italic>mid1</italic>&#x00394; cells expressing Rlc1p-GFP, Cdc15p-GFP, or Cdc12p-GFP were arrested at the G2/M boundary by incubation at the restrictive temperature of 36&#x000b0;C.

Cdc4p was readily detected in medial nodes in 30/54 <italic>cps1</italic>-191 cells with short spindles, whereas the rest contained fully formed actomyosin rings. Such organization of Cdc4p was not observed in <italic>cps1</italic>-191 <italic>mid1</italic>&#x00394; cells (36/53 contained no obvious structures, and 17/53 contained disorganized cables), ruling out the possibility that normal ring assembly in <italic>cps1</italic>-191 <italic>mid1</italic>&#x00394; cells is caused by the restoration of medial nodes.

We performed three different experiments. First, we induced the expression of Mad2p, shifted cells to the restrictive temperature for <italic>mid1</italic>-18, and fixed and stained these cells with antibodies against Cdc4p, tubulin, and DAPI. In this experiment, we found that &#x0003e;85% of metaphase-arrested <italic>mid1</italic>-18 cells contained nonorthogonal myosin II cables (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Second, we imaged the process of myosin II ring assembly in metaphase-arrested <italic>mid1</italic>-18 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>). We found that myosin II cables and bundles assembled efficiently in metaphase-arrested <italic>mid1</italic>-18 cells. However, these myosin II cables failed to become organized into rings even upon incubation for nearly 90 min (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Finally, we induced the expression of Mad2p, allowed myosin II ring assembly at the permissive temperature for <italic>mid1</italic>-18, and subsequently shifted cells to the restrictive temperature (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and E</xref>). We found that shift of metaphase-arrested <italic>mid1</italic>-18 cells with a preexisting myosin II ring to the restrictive temperature led to unraveling and disassembly of this ring (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>, red arrows). These observations suggested that Mid1p and possibly the nodes were important for organization of actomyosin rings in early mitosis and that Mid1p function might be continuously required for the medial maintenance of the actomyosin ring until septation.

Because rings in <italic>mid1</italic> mutants assembled later in mitosis, it was possible that some aspect of mitotic progression promoted ring assembly in mutants such as the <italic>cps1</italic>-191 <italic>mid1</italic>&#x00394; cells. Alternatively, because loss of Cps1p function leads to a prolonged maintenance of the SIN, it was possible that the SIN played a role in organization of actomyosin rings in the absence of Mid1p and the cortical nodes. The SIN is a signaling module that is activated upon passage through anaphase and plays a key role in maintenance and organization of actomyosin rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krapp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wolfe and Gould, 2005</xref>). Previous experiments have shown that ectopic activation of the SIN led to the formation of actomyosin rings even in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerutti and Simanis, 1999</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether activation of SIN in interphase-arrested <italic>mid1</italic>-18 and <italic>mid1</italic>&#x00394; cells would lead to the formation of orthogonal actomyosin rings. We shifted <italic>cdc16</italic>-116, <italic>cdc16</italic>-116 <italic>mid1</italic>-18, and <italic>cdc16</italic>-116 <italic>mid1</italic>&#x00394; cells expressing Rlc1p-GFP and Uch2p-GFP (as a nuclear marker) to the restrictive temperature for <italic>cdc16</italic>-116. Cdc16p is a GTPase-activating protein for Spg1p-GTPase, a key component of the SIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furge et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>cdc16</italic>-116 mutants maintain Spg1p in a GTP-bound form, leading to persistent SIN activation. The use of <italic>cdc16</italic>-116 also allowed us to distinguish whether SIN or some aspect of anaphase was important for ring assembly in <italic>mid1</italic> mutants. Interestingly, myosin II rings in interphase-arrested <italic>cdc16</italic>-116, <italic>cdc16</italic>-116 <italic>mid1</italic>-18, and <italic>cdc16</italic>-116 <italic>mid1</italic>&#x00394; were all found to be orthogonal in orientation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). These experiments established that activation of SIN led to the organization of orthogonal actomyosin rings in the absence of Mid1p and cortical nodes. <italic>mid1</italic>-6 mutant cells deleted for <italic>par1</italic>, the gene encoding a regulatory subunit of phosphatase 2A, assemble orthogonal division septa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Le Goff et al., 2001</xref>). Although actomyosin rings were not looked at in this study, the fact that Par1p is a negative regulator of the SIN supports the idea that SIN activation helps establish orthogonal actomyosin rings. Additional genetic experiments (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806151/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806151/DC1</ext-link>) provided evidence that organization of actomyosin bundles in <italic>mid1</italic> mutants and their reorganization in the <italic>cps1-</italic>191 background depended on the function of the SIN.</p><p>Our experiments with two mutants (<italic>mid1</italic> and <italic>plo1</italic>) lacking nodes have established that the accumulation of actomyosin ring components into nodes is not essential for organization of orthogonal rings, although Mid1p and the nodes are important for the kinetics of ring assembly. How do Mid1p and cortical nodes participate in actomyosin ring assembly? Previous experiments using electron microscopy of myosin SI decoration of F-actin filaments have shown that in early mitosis, the actomyosin ring is composed of two parallel bundles of F-actin organized together with other components of the ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kamasaki et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that such an arrangement is achieved by actin filament cross-linking rather than by myosin II&#x02013;based contractility, which depends on antiparallel actin filaments. Consistent with the idea that myosin II may not be fully active in early mitosis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lord and Pollard (2004)</xref> have shown that the localization of the UCS (UNC-45/CRO1/SHE4) domain protein Rng3p, a fission yeast myosin II activator, occurs only after the completion of anaphase. Finally, actomyosin ring constriction (possibly via activation of myosin II&#x02013;based contractility) occurs concomitant with the activation of SIN in anaphase B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sparks et al., 1999</xref>). Collectively, previous work has shown that at the point of actomyosin ring assembly, myosin II might not be fully active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lord and Pollard, 2004</xref>). It is possible that Mid1p and cortical nodes play a role in the organization of moderately or noncontractile actomyosin bundles into ring structures. Activation of myosin II (upon SIN activation and Rng3p localization) might be sufficient for the organization of orthogonal actomyosin rings even in the absence of Mid1p and cortical nodes. Further analysis of actomyosin ring assembly in <italic>cps1</italic>-191 <italic>mid1</italic>&#x00394; cells should provide additional insights into the general mechanism of cytokinesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and methodology</title><p>The fission yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>.
