The contribution of defined nAChR subunits to a specific behavior is thus difficult to assess. Mice deleted for &#x000df;2-containing nAChRs (&#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212;) have been shown to be hyperactive in an open-field paradigm, without determining the origin of this hyperactivity. We here develop a quantitative description of mouse behavior in the open field based upon first order Markov and variable length Markov chain analysis focusing on the time-organized sequence that behaviors are composed of. This description reveals that this hyperactivity is the consequence of the absence of specific inactive states or &#x0201c;stops&#x0201d;. These stops are associated with a scanning of the environment in wild-type mice (WT), and they affect the way that animals organize their sequence of behaviors when compared with stops without scanning. They characterize a specific &#x0201c;decision moment&#x0201d; that is reduced in &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mutant mice, suggesting an important role of &#x000df;2-nAChRs in the strategy used by animals to explore an environment and collect information in order to organize their behavior. This integrated analysis of the displacement of an animal in a simple environment offers new insights, specifically into the contribution of nAChRs to higher brain functions and more generally into the principles that organize sequences of behaviors in animals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Understanding mechanisms underlying complex behaviors and the abnormalities that accompany most neuropathologies is a current challenge in biomedical research. A number of approaches is primarily based on the identification of genes and their associated molecular pathways implicated in complex motor or cognitive pathologies. However, optimal use of the large body of genetic, molecular, electro-physiological, and imaging data is hampered by the practical and theoretical limitations of currently available behavioral analysis methods. Complex behaviors consist of a finite number of actions combined in a variety of spatial and temporal patterns. In this paper we develop a sequential analysis of mouse displacement in an open-field paradigm and demonstrate that a description based on a Markov model can be used to describe quantitatively patterns of behaviors and to detect changes in the way that animals organize their displacement, especially in mice lacking nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits. This paper would be of broad interest not only to those concerned with this particular mice model but also generally to those interested in modeling complex behavior traits in mice.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>nAChRs are well-characterized transmembrane allosteric oligomers composed of five identical (homopentamers) or different (heteropentamers) subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Changeux1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The elementary mechanisms of nAChRs functions are investigated in great details, yet important issues relevant for the role of nAChRs at the higher level, have received less attention. The need to fill this gap is reinforced by nAChR participation in a diverse array of neuropathologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The complex nature of all these disorders underlines the nicotinic influences over neuronal circuits involved in attention, motivation and cognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Changeux2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Dani1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The issue then becomes how to tackle this problem in mouse models that allow pharmacological and genetic manipulations, but for which &#x0201c;psychological&#x0201d; processes must be inferred from observable behaviors. Mice deleted for &#x000df;2-subunit containing nAChR (&#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212;) have been the first nicotinic receptor mutant to be characterized, and found to exhibit more rigid behavior and less behavioral flexibility than wild-type (WT) animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Granon1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Hyperactivity in an open field is often used as a general and non-specific term characterizing experimental conditions where animals show either an increased amount of displacement and related locomotor behaviors, or changes in the frequency of specific motor acts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Norton1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Increased locomotor activity in an open field can reflect different processing and alterations in the organization of behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Norton1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. A complete description of hyperactivity then requires to study duration and temporal patterning (i.e. the sequence) of behavioral acts. In this paper, we address the problem of tracing, by analyzing temporal organization of movement, mouse cognitive and/or decision making behavior that can account for mouse hyperactivity in the open-field.</p><p>Open-field behaviors have been used to study forced exploration of a new environment.

Here, we focus on the analysis of the behavioral sequence, namely the time-organized sequence of patterns that composes the behavior. Considering a sequence of acts, a question would be whether information contained in the structure of this sequence and the presence of specific associations between acts reflects decision-making behavior and can be used to assess alterations of this process.</p><p>We developed further the method already successfully applied to detect modifications of locomotor behavior caused by mutations in &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Granon1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Maskos1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, or in goldfish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Faure1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

This hyperactivity was reflected in the time spent in an inactive or active state with a decreased time in the inactive state in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000229-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The relation between the distance traveled and the duration of the different states were however not different in the two strains. For both strains, the distance traveled during active or inactive states was different, but both exhibited a linear relationship with the duration of a given event (&#x003bc;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.113 and 0.117 in active phase for wt and &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, and &#x003bc;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02 and 0.023 in inactive phase).

The distance traveled was then roughly reflected in the time spent in inactive or active states. These results suggest that higher locomotor activity in &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice is not due to a modification of the velocity distribution (either in the active or inactive phase), but rather to a significant change in the organization of the behavior.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000229-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000229.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Relation between duration of state and traveled distance.</title><p>(A) Boxplot of the total traveled distance and (B) time spent in inactive state during a 30 min session in the open-field respectively for wild-type (WT, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;32) and mutant mice (&#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212;, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;33).

Analysis of transition frequencies and conditional probabilities between different states of the animal were then carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000229-g003">Figure 3A1</xref>). Using only four states {PI, PA, CI, CA} did not allow to build a first-order Markov description of the sequence of states. Indeed, when checking for all possible combinations of states X, Y, Z whether P(X|YZ)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;P(X|Y) was satisfied, revealed that the probability of states X after Y&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;PA did not depend only on the present state PA, but also on the previous one Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000229-g003">Figure 3A2</xref>). In order to obtain a first order Markov dynamics, PA symbols had to be differentiated into peripheral movement that follows central movement (CA), and peripheral movement that follows inactivity in the periphery (PI). They will be designated by the symbols PAc and PAp, respectively.

This implies that, with such a state description, the animal movement depends only on the preceding state, suggesting a very local organization of decision-making.

The main advantage of such hypothesis is that modification of only one element (decreased number of stop) accounts for matrix and residence time difference between WT and &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. A simple simulation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, &#x0201c;stop reduction&#x0201d; model) revealed that removing 30&#x00025; of stops in WT sequences reproduced well the number of occurrences of each of the five states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000229-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000229-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), and residence time distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000229-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). More precisely, PI was not changed, which means that the model does not explain the decrease observed in &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.

The animal can progress forward slowly (with a small but constant speed), freeze, perform a number of action patterns (i.e., grooming, rearing, scratching, etc), or orienting movements (head scanning, sniffing, etc). In order to be able to differentiate some of these patterns, we have simultaneously recorded the position of the animal and digitized video images (25 frames/second). These images have been used as the input for fine off-line movement analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000229-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

To analyze mouse trajectories we developed a specific approach based on a dissection of mouse behavior in the open field as a sequence of motor activities organized in patterns. We have shown evidence for two main modifications of the behavior in &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice: (i) quantitatively, mutant mice show a reduced number of stops and modification of specific transition probabilities, and (ii) structurally, the organization of the sequence of behavior was different between strains.</p><p>Streams of complex acts or movements exhibit some regularity that is the basis of the subdivision of behaviors into units, or species-specific movements.

In our analysis we focused on two classifications, active versus inactive, and central versus peripheral movement. Although simple, this classification captures two essential and ethologically meaningful properties of the displacement. The first is the alternation between progressions and stops, observed in a number of locomotor behaviors, and associated with prey search, vigilance or energy saving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Drai3">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-McAdam1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The second concerns the spatial distribution of movement. Traveling close to the wall is an important feature of the mice, and it has been suggested that the wall confers security while the center is anxiogenic. However, exploratory behaviors also drive the mouse to explore all the open space.

Markov analysis assumes that the underlying process that generates a sequence is homogeneous in time all along the sequence. The time range over which an event influences the future ones is supposed to be constant (i.e independent of the event and the sequence preceding it). For this reason, fixed length Markov chain analysis is a poor detector of sequence rules that operate only after a particular portion of the sequence. By contrast, VLMC allows identification of particular sequences or contexts, such as those identified after scanning an environment. Modification of this homogeneity in sequences is often seen as an indicator of higher organization such as &#x0201c;hierarchical&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;grammatical&#x0201d; properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Dawkins1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Fentress1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> or reflects specific &#x02018;decisions&#x02019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Dawkins1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

It offers the possibility of including ethological knowledge and previously established categories. It would then also be relevant and efficient also in more naturalistic and complex settings.

Our experiments demonstrate that locomotion is not faster in &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, and that the difference lies in the patterns and organization of behaviors. Furthermore, a simulation approach suggests that hyperactivity cannot be explained only by changes in the matrix, or only by changes in the duration of the various states, but by their joint effect. Hyperactivity would then emerge from alterations of many different underlying processes. However, we here propose that in &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice hyperactivity is mainly due to the &#x0201c;lack of stops&#x0201d;. Most characteristics of the sequences of &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice can be explained by the fact that these mice do not observe certain &#x0201c;stops&#x0201d; and that after a stop they organize their behavior differently.

This proposition relies upon the idea that behavioral flexibility is controlled by an adequate hierarchization of motivations, a process known to mobilize prefrontal and cingulate cortex. ADHD symptoms such as inattention lack of inhibitory control, and hyperactivity and prefrontal involvement indeed resemble &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; behavioral deficits, and fit well with nAChR localization and function. Yet, the possible contribution of prefrontal cortex and higher-level top-down processes in open-field behaviors is at this stage not clear. More complex environments and tasks, together with relevant methods of analyses, are needed to explore this problem. Further experiments are also needed to clearly identify the brain loci and the nicotinic receptor subunits that are involved in the modification of the behavioral patterns observed in &#x000df;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.

The core idea is to encode continuous-valued trajectories into behaviorally relevant symbol sequences associated with a finite partition of the state space.

Such an ethological classification has been chosen for its clarity as regarded the aims of the different behaviors. Grooming is defined by a well-characterized sequence beginning with movements of paw cleaning and proceeding through face washing and body cleaning. Rearing and border rearing were easy to distinguish, the animal raises upon its back paw. Difference in between rearing and border rearing is whether front paw touch the border of the open-field or not. Sniffing is defined by an activity in which the mouse sniffs the ground, this behavior is usually used to identify object or food or to make spatial landmark.

From the initial time series written with an alphabet of x symbol, a x&#x0002a;x matrix T&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(tij) can be calculated, where tij is the number of times a given symbol i is followed by another symbol j in the sequence. T is called a transition frequency matrix. A conditional transition matrix can be obtained by dividing each row of the transition frequency matrix by its sum.

Transition frequency matrices and conditional transition matrices are a concise way of expressing the statistical relationship between consecutive states. They give preliminary clues to the organization of the sequence of states. This is generally summarized in a flow diagram, giving a simple graphical representation of these matrices. Nodes in the diagram represent states, while arrows of variable thickness represent the frequencies with which the different transitions occur. This representation provides a suitable overview of the organization of the sequence of behaviors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000229-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Markov Chain</title><p>The matrix of transition describes the statistics of transitions from one state to the other but it does not provide any information about the dynamic nature of the relationship between successive states. Obtaining information about the dynamics in short and long terms from the sole knowledge of the transition matrix is possible only if the dynamics is Markovian: A process is a first-order Markov chain if the transition probability from state A to the next state B depends only on the present state A and not on the previous ones. A first-order Markov model is then a mathematical model fully prescribed by the transition matrix that describes, in probabilistic terms, the dynamic behavior of the system, namely the probability of transitions over any duration between any two states. In such a model, the present state contains all the information that could influence the choice of the next state, that is captured in the transition matrix. A classical way to demonstrate that a process is Markovian is to show that the sequence cannot be described by a zero order process, i.e. that P(B|A)&#x02260; P(B) and that P(C|B)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;P(C|AB), but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Slater1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> for a more detailed review of all these methods.</p><p>The residence times, defined as the time spent in a given state, were studied separately. We described the dynamics of transition between states using an alternate renewal process. That is the sequence is described by the convolution of a Markov chain describing the transitions between the states associating a unit time step to each transition, with the above residence-time distributions, describing the actual duration of each step. Thus, there is no repetition of states in the sequence and the transition matrix has vanishing diagonal elements</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Modeling Strategy</title><p>The most interesting part of the Markov formalism is that the knowledge about the transition probability, i.e. the elementary properties of the system, is sufficient to describe the whole dynamics of the system, either in the short or long term. In practice, this means that as soon as a first-order Markov process has been demonstrated, modifications induced by drugs, genetic mutation or other manipulation of the system can be localized in the transition probabilities and/or in the time distribution of state duration (provided the investigated perturbation does not affect the first-order nature of the dynamics) and the same modeling strategy can be used.</p><p>Modeling procedure is as follows. We used (i) the conditional probabilities from a given state to specify the next one, and (ii) the residence time distributions to determine durations of the successive states. This whole procedure is reiterated until the total duration reaches half an hour of experiment. These synthetic data can then be compared with those obtained experimentally. In a second time, specific modification of transition probabilities or residence time distributions are used to access impact of such a modification.</p><p>A specific model, consisting in &#x0201c;stop reduction&#x0201d; has been particularly used. In this model, sequences of symbols are generated using WT matrices and distribution. In a second step a fixed percentage of stops (35&#x00025; of both PI and CI) are removed in such a way that PA-PI-PA becomes PA-PA, that is a unique PA event but with a longer duration (and similarly for CA-CI-CA). The total length of the sequences is adjusted in a way that it represents a half-an-hour experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Variable Length Markov Chain Analysis</title><p>When the dynamics is not accounted for by a first-order Markov chain, but displays larger dependence on the past states, &#x0201c;variable length Markov chains&#x0201d; (VLMC) provide an efficient modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000229-Bhlmann1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.
