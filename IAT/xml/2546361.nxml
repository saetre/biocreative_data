Over 90% of human cervical carcinoma is associated with high risk mucosal HPVs, mainly the serotypes 18 and 16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying the actions of high risk HPVs leading to cancer have been studied extensively, and it was shown that the E6 and E7 proteins were the oncoproteins interacting with tumor suppressors p53 and pRb, respectively, and leading to infected-cell transformation and dysregulated proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Previous studies also showed that the principle activity of E6 was to target and degrade p53, therefore, p53's growth regulatory functions is abolished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, many authors reported the expression of E6 was not necessarily equated to a p53 null background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized there might be other ways for E6 interaction with p53.</p><p>p53 is a very important tumor suppressor, it can be activated in response to DNA damage stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Phosphorylation of p53 has been studied intensively and has been proposed to play a critical role in the stabilization and activation of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Infected cells recognize viral replication as a DNA damage stress and elicit the host surveillance mechanism to anti-virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The modulation of p53 function by phosphorylation seems to be a major antiviral defense mechanism employed by cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, some viruses have evolved strategies such as reducing the phosphorylation of p53 for counteraction p53 activation. For example, Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma, KSHV viral interferon regulatory factor1 (vIRF1) greatly reduced the level of serine 15 phosphorylation of p53, resulting in an decrease of p53 stability which could circumvent host growth surveillance and facilitate viral replication in infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

The plasmid pGFP-18E6 was transfected in 293T and MCF-7 cells, allowing E6 proteins to be expressed as GFP-18E6 fusion proteins. By fluorescence microscopy, we observed the subcellular location of GFP-18E6 and GFP in both cell lines. Because the E6 fusion proteins may have low or high expression levels at different times, and maybe this could affect the distribution of E6. Therefore, we dynamically observed the location and expression of proteins from 6 h to 72 h post-transfection. The results indicated that GFP-18E6 protein was expressed essentially in the nuclei from 6 h post-transfection. Its expression increased gradually, and reached its maximum expression level at 21 h (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Then, it decreased gradually and disappeared after 1 wk. During this whole period, no change was observed in protein location. As control, we observed the expression of GFP alone. It exhibited a diffused signal, and was present in both the nuclei and cytoplasm from 6 h to 1 wk post-transfection. In addition, its location did not change at any time.

We used antibodies for different sites that recognizing p53 only when it had been modified at these sites. By immunoblotting, we clearly observed phosphorylated p53 at 24 h post-transfected with pGFP-18E6 in both 293T and MCF-7 cells. The result indicated GFP-18E6 could induce p53 phosphorylation at three sites: Ser<sup>15</sup>, Ser<sup>20</sup>, and Ser<sup>392</sup>. As control GFP expressing cells, there was no phosphorylated p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The other sites of p53, such as Ser<sup>6</sup>, Ser<sup>9</sup>, Ser<sup>37</sup>, and Ser<sup>46 </sup>were negative in both GFP-18E6 and GFP expressing cells (data not shown).

For GFP-18E6 expressing cells, the Ser<sup>15</sup>, Ser<sup>20 </sup>of p53 were firstly detected at 12 h post-transfection and increased gradually, significant accumulation was observed at 24 h (P &#x0003c; 0.001). The expression level of Ser<sup>15 </sup>was higher than Ser<sup>20 </sup>at the same time point. It should be noted that phosphorylation of Ser<sup>392 </sup>was not present at 12 h in GFP-18E6 transfected MCF-7 cells, whereas it was highly expressed in GFP-18E6 transfected 293T at the same time. In both cells, the Ser<sup>392 </sup>reached highest level at 24 h post-transfection (P &#x0003c; 0.001). From 48 h to 72 h post-transfection, the three sites of phosphorylated p53s were not detected. As GFP control expressing cells, there was not phosphorylated p53 at Ser<sup>15</sup>, Ser<sup>20</sup>, and Ser<sup>392 </sup>during the whole period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Thus, in 12 h to 24 h expression of GFP-18E6 there was a short term activation of p53 by phosphorylating modification. Because activation of p53 can also be modulated at the transcription level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we next asked whether the mRNA level of p53 was increased by the expression of GFP-18E6. By reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, we clearly observed the mRNA of p53 was not changed in GFP-18E6 expressing cells (data not shown). This agreed with the mRNA level of p53 was stable in the context of HPV-E6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser<sup>15 </sup>and Ser<sup>20 </sup>were the earliest response to E6 expression. It is general believed Ser<sup>15 </sup>phosphorylation of p53 occurs rapidly in response to DNA damage and appears to represent a 'priming event' for the subsequent series of modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Because phosphorylation of Ser15 induced by ATM/ATR (ATM-and-Rad3-related) results in dissociation of p53 from its negative regulator mdm-2, it has been suggested that the primary effect of phosphorylation of p53 at Ser<sup>15 </sup>is to increase p53 level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The Ser<sup>20 </sup>is also critical for stabilizing of p53. Recent studies have demonstrated that Ser<sup>20 </sup>on p53 is phosphorylated by Chk1 (checkpoint kinase 1) or Chk2, enhancing its tetramerization, stability, and activity in response to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In fact, phosphorylated sites at the Ser<sup>15 </sup>and Ser<sup>20 </sup>residues lie right under the binding pocket of mdm-2, which could disrupt the binding with mdm-2, resulting stabilization of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the present study, the level of phosphorylation of p53 at Ser<sup>15 </sup>was clearly higher than Ser<sup>20</sup>. It's probably because Ser<sup>15 </sup>phosphorylation of p53 was a more important target than Ser<sup>20 </sup>in the context of HPV-18E6. This was consistent with some data reported that removing Ser<sup>15 </sup>can abrogate phosphorylation at Ser<sup>20 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. For phosphorylation of p53 at Ser<sup>392</sup>, it was even not same for both cells. In 293T cells, phosphorylation of p53 at Ser<sup>392 </sup>appeared earlier and higher than MCF-7 cells. Thus, the different responses of Ser<sup>392 </sup>maybe due to varied sensitivity of cells. Authors reported phosphorylation of p53 at Ser<sup>392 </sup>was an early response to a wide range of stress-inducing conditions. Ser<sup>392 </sup>is phosphorylated by the protein kinase CK2 after both UV and ionizing radiation treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It has been shown to enable the transcriptional activation of the p53 protein in vitro and also seems to be important for p53-mediated transactivation in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Therefore, the phorsphorylation of p53 at Ser<sup>15</sup>, Ser<sup>20</sup>, and Ser<sup>392 </sup>could stabilize and activate p53, which ultimately induces the irreversible cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response of DNA damage stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>It has been proved the tumor suppressor p53 could induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to stresses, such as UV radiation, DNA damage, hypoxia or virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Previous also studies showed E6 could target and degrade p53, which in turn inhibited apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In present study, we clearly observed the phosphorylating modification of p53 in the early stage of HPV-18E6 expressing. The phosphorylation of p53 could induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Regulation of p53 phosphorylation has also been shown to be induced by many viruses, such as, Africa swine fever virus (ASFV), the p53 in host cell is stabilized by phosphorylation at Ser<sup>392 </sup>and is located in the nuclei. During infection, the phosphorylated p53 is functionally active to induce apoptosis along with the expression of p21 and mdm2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can activate p53 through phosphorylated modification at Ser<sup>15</sup>, Ser<sup>20</sup>, and Ser<sup>392 </sup>modulated by its oncogenic protein LMP1. Additionally, the phosphorylated p53s were associated with MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and the activation of MAPK kinase could target the transcription factors to anti-virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, our result agreed with Shin and others, who reported infected cells recognized viral replication as a DNA damage stress and elicit the host surveillance mechanism to anti-virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. On the other hand, malignant transformation usually takes a long term, where it is important that oncogene E6 integrated in the genome of host and degraded p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It was easy to understand, in the present study, we constructed a short transient expression system, the over-expression of E6 can partly mimic the large infection of HPV in the early stage, where the oncogene E6 is not integrated in the genome of host. With over-expressed exotic DNA of E6, the host cells might clean them up through activating apoptosis pathway. This also agreed with authors, who reported compared to the prevalence of HPV infections in the general population, the number of lesions that progress to cancer is very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The cells infection with high risk HPV might take a self limited process through apoptosis mechanism without progressing to cancer. Thus, the present study gave us an implication that giving the patient correct treatment on the early stage of HPV infection, which will be helpful not to progress to cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present study provided a new pattern of interaction between HPV-18E6 and p53. That was, GFP-18E6 could transiently induce p53 phosphorylation at three sites, Ser<sup>15</sup>, Ser<sup>20</sup>, and Ser<sup>392 </sup>in both 293T and MCF-7 cells by the activation of ATM and/or Chk2 pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CH, LSS and TS participated in its design, discussed the results, and helped to draft the manuscript.
