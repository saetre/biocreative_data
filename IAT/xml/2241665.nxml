Unfolded proteins in the ER are sensed by the IRE1-BiP complex, which causes dimerization, autophosphorylation, and subsequent activation of IRE1. Activated IRE1 splices X-box binding protein-1 (Xbp-1) mRNA in the cytoplasm, leading to synthesis of the active transcription factor Xbp-1 and upregulation of ER stress-response genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001648-Yoshida1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001648-Calfon1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Global profiling of genes modified by ER stress in &#x003b2;-cells has shown that upon induction of ER stress, Insulin 1 and Insulin 2 mRNA are quickly degraded, leading to significantly decreased levels of these mRNAs Pirot et al. (2007). We have shown that hyperactivation of IRE1 is correlated with reduction in insulin mRNA expression in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells (Lipson et al., 2006). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that when ER folding capacity is overwhelmed, IRE1 initiates endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA encoding insulin, the major secretory protein in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells.

This JNK activation suppresses PDX-1 binding to the insulin promoter and reduces insulin gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001648-Kaneto1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. We have shown previously that in mammalian cells ER stress signaling activates JNK through IRE1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001648-Urano1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, hyperactivation of IRE1&#x003b1; by chronic high glucose may suppress insulin gene expression partially through JNK-mediated PDX-1 inactivation.</p><p>Our work demonstrates that two distinct activities are elicited by high-glucose-induced activation of IRE1&#x003b1; in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. IRE1&#x003b1; can be activated in &#x003b2;-cells by overexpressing insulin; and moreover, the level of activation positively correlates with the amount of insulin (Lipson and Urano, unpublished observations). We therefore believe that exposure of &#x003b2;-cells to high glucose levels causes ER stress due to an increased load of insulin translation into the ER. In earlier studies, we found that IRE1&#x003b1; signaling activated by acute exposure to high glucose enhances proinsulin biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001648-Lipson1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, chronic exposure of &#x003b2;-cells to high glucose causes hyperactivation of IRE1&#x003b1;, leading to the degradation of insulin mRNA. Thus, we propose that the duration of exposure to high glucose, and therefore the relative load of translocating insulin, is the critical determinants of the activity of IRE1&#x003b1;.</p><p>High glucose exposure causes ER stress and upregulation of ER folding machinery. Insulin mRNA expression increases, but only to a point. This point may represent the time when the burden that the translocating insulin is placing on the ER exceeds the ER processing capacity. In this scenario, the &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; solution would be to activate Xbp-1 splicing and synthesize more ER folding machinery. However, this upregulation of ER stress-response proteins may add to the burden of the already overloaded ER. The rapid degradation of insulin mRNA could provide immediate relief to the ER and free the translocation machinery. Thus, this mechanism may be an essential element in the adaptation of &#x003b2;-cells to chronic hyperglycemia.</p><p>Chronic ER stress has recently been defined as any persistent (on the order of days to years) stress that requires long term adjustments in cellular function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001648-Rutkowski1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. For cells to survive under a chronic ER stress condition like prolonged hyperglycemia, they must have a mechanism by which ER stress can be continuously tolerated. A small number of cells may die, but the majority of cells must survive and adapt to the stressful stimulus, which, in this case, is chronic exposure to high glucose levels. This adaptation may be crucial for the maintenance of &#x003b2;-cell homeostasis and may, in part, explain why the &#x003b2;-cells of Type 2 diabetic patients with chronic hyperglycemia stop producing insulin without simply undergoing apoptosis.</p><p>The IRE-mediated mRNA decay pathway may not, however, be limited to a stress- response function. In other types of secretory cells, this mechanism of selective degradation of mRNAs by IRE1 may be effective way to quickly control levels of secretory proteins. In addition to transducing the ER stress response, secretory cells may also activate IRE1 in response to various cellular stimuli, allowing adaptation to rapidly changing physiological conditions. In &#x003b2;-cells, it remains to be seen whether these reductive effects of IRE1&#x003b1; on insulin mRNA are actually important for insulin protein biogenesis, which is regulated at many levels. Modulation of levels of its message is certainly one place for regulation. If the load of insulin folding and processing is exceeding the capacity of the ER, then rapid reduction of insulin mRNA would preserve ER homeostasis and help ensure that the insulin already inside the ER can be properly folded and secreted. This mechanism may also be involved in suppression of the autoimmune response by reducing the amounts of misfolded insulin, which could be a source of &#x0201c;neo-autoantigens.&#x0201d;</p><p>Based on recent studies and the results reported here, we suggest that in &#x003b2;-cells IRE1&#x003b1; selectively degrades insulin, the most prevalent ER-targeted mRNA, under adverse conditions. This may be part of a protective adaptation that &#x003b2;-cells have uniquely acquired to protect themselves from death caused by the chronic and high workload placed on the ER under prolonged hyperglycemic conditions. This, combined with subsequent upregulation of ER stress response genes, may function in support of &#x003b2;-cell survival under extreme stress conditions such as chronic hyperglycemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Rat insulinoma cells, INS-1 832/13, and mouse islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS.
