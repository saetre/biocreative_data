The abundance of protein C message is approximately 0.02% of total mRNA. Three overlapping clones contain 1,798 nucleotides of contiguous sequence, which approximates the size of the protein's mRNA, based upon Northern hybridization. The cDNA sequence consists of 73 5'-noncoding bases, coding sequence for a 461 amino acid nascent polypeptide precursor, a TAA termination codon, 296 3'-noncoding bases, and a 38 base polyadenylation segment. The nascent protein consists of a 33 amino acid "signal", a 9 amino acid propeptide, a 155 amino acid "light" chain, a Lys-Arg connecting dipeptide, and a 262 amino acid "heavy" chain. Human protein C and Factor IX and X precursors possess about one third identical amino acids (59% in the gamma-carboxyglutamate domain), including two forty-six amino acid segments homologous to epidermal growth factor. Human protein C also has similar homology with prothrombin in the "leader", gamma-carboxyglutamate and serine protease domains, but lacks the two "kringle" domains found in prothrombin.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0232-a" xlink:role="5237"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0228.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5233"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0229.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5234"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0230.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5235"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0231.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5236"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0232.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5237"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0233.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5238"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0234.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5239"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0235.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5240"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0236.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5241"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0237.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5242"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0238.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5243"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0239.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5244"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0240.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5245"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0241.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5246"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00308-0242.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5247"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
