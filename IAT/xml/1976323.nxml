To investigate the role of both NC zinc fingers in intracellular Gag trafficking, and in virion assembly, we generated series of NC zinc fingers mutations. Results show that all Zinc finger mutations have a negative impact on virion biogenesis and maturation and rendered defective the mutant viruses. The NC zinc finger mutations caused an intracellular accumulation of Gag, which was found either diffuse in the cytoplasm or at the plasma membrane but not associated with endosomal membranes as for wild type Gag. Evidences are also provided showing that the intracellular interactions between NC-mutated Gag and the gRNA were impaired.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results show that Gag oligomerization mediated by gRNA-NC interactions is required for correct Gag trafficking, and assembly in HIV-1 producing cells and the release of infectious viruses.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The retroviral Gag polyprotein precursor is formed of three essential domains, namely the matrix (MA), the capsid (CA) and the nucleocapsid (NC), which upon protease mediated processing of Gag constitute the architecture of the infectious mature viral particle. The three Gag domains contain the critical determinants that orchestrate virus assembly in the infected cell, via membrane-MA, CA-CA and NC-gRNA interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the mature virus, the MA protein is located under the virion envelope, which derives from the infected cell membrane. In the case of HIV-1, MA is myristoylated and contains basic amino acids within its N-terminus required for Gag-membrane binding and determinants that specifically interact with the cellular adaptator proteins AP-3 and AP-2. These AP proteins contribute to the intracellular transport of Gag to endosomal compartments and retroviral budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The CA molecules form the outer shell of the viral core while NC molecules extensively coat and condense the gRNA in the interior of the virion core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. HIV-1 NC contains two zinc fingers flanked by basic regions and is located at the C-terminus of Gag, followed by the p6 domain. This later p6 domain is required for particle budding during which the viral particles pinch-off from the cellular membrane (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The p6 domain contains a Proline-rich and a di-Leucine domains, which are the target of the cellular proteins Tsg101 and Alix, respectively, involved in the cellular class E protein sorting pathway and the HIV-1 budding machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>HIV-1 NC has been extensively studied during the past 15 years and was shown to be implicated in virus structure, gRNA dimerization and proviral DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The highly basic nature of NC makes it a partner of choice of RNA while the zinc fingers appear to provide specific recognition of the HIV-1 Psi packaging signal necessary for gRNA packaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, specific RNA-NC interactions promote Gag-Gag oligomerization which turns out to be a prerequisite for assembly and virus biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both NC zinc fingers and basic domains are essential for virus formation and infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

More recently, new insights into the role of NC in Gag assembly show that mutations and deletions in the basic residues of NC prevent Gag-Gag multimerization but not Gag association with cellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we explored the influence of the NC zinc fingers in HIV-1 assembly by analyzing intracellular Gag and gRNA localization, Gag/membrane association and virion morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid DNA</title><p>HIV-1 pNL4-3 DNA was provided by the National Institute of Health, USA.

In comparison with the wild-type HIV-1, processing of Gag in viral particles was partially changed by mutating the NC zinc fingers, as evidenced by an accumulation of the MA-CA precursor (p41) and probably MA-CA-p2-NC (p49) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes V). The same defect in Gag processing was observed following mutating or deleting the first ZF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Processing of Gag was modified by the H23H44C mutations and &#x00394;ZF1ZF2 deletions, as indicated by the accumulation of partially cleaved Gag products, in particular p41 in virions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, see arrows; compare lane "V" of these ZF mutants with lane "V" for the WT). In particular, these two NC mutants lack p49; thus the absence of p49 could be due to an undetectable level of protein or that mutations in both ZFs still permit maturation of p49. All the other NC mutants show p41 and p49 accumulation in the virions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes V), indicating a defect in maturation cleavage between NC-p1 or p1-p6 (that can be due to a conformational change of NC induced by ZF mutation, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. All NC mutants show intracellular Gag and p41/49 accumulation, except for limited amounts of CAp24/25, suggesting some defect in the budding process (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes Cell). These results suggest that ZF mutants have a negative impact on virus budding and Gag processing.</p><p>Although the viral production was low, enough virus could be recovered to monitor the relative level of genomic RNA (gRNA) in virions. The level of gRNA in virions was analyzed by dot blot hybridization (not shown) and, as reported in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, none of the NC mutants harbored a wt gRNA level. In fact, mutations in the ZF reduced gRNA levels by 10 to 20 fold in comparison with wild-type HIV-1. Finally, the infectivity of HIV-1 ZF mutants was assessed and none of the mutants were infectious (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2- Intracellular accumulation and localization of Gag proteins with NC ZF mutations</title><p>Since Gag with ZF mutations accumulated in cells, we examined the intracellular Gag localization in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy using an anti-CAp24 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Wild-type HIV-1 Gag displayed a punctuate pattern in the cytoplasm and was found in patches at or near the plasma membrane (PM) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), in agreement with the data of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, NC mutated Gag accumulated at the PM and in the cytoplasm. More precisely, Gag with a mutation or a deletion of the first ZF (&#x00394;ZF1 and H23C) preferentially accumulated in patches at the PM while Gag carrying mutations in the second ZF (&#x00394;ZF2 and H44C) accumulated at the PM and in intracellular vesicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Similar results were observed with 293T cells (data not shown). The most dramatic effect was observed with Gag carrying mutations in both ZFs, namely Gag-&#x00394;ZF1ZF2 and Gag-H23H44C, which strongly accumulated at the PM and sometimes in intracellular membranes with "<italic>rings"-like structures </italic>(~1% of the cells) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, &#x00394;ZF1ZF2 zoomed picture). In addition, these NC-Gag mutants also showed a very diffuse pattern in the cytoplasm, as if mutated Gag had lost membrane association (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, see H23H44C). The complete deletion of NC domain of Gag caused an overall accumulation, where Gag-&#x00394;NC was found essentially at the PM, in the cytoplasm and even sometimes in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, &#x00394;NC).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of HIV-1 Gag carrying NC zinc finger mutations by immunofluorescence microscopy</bold>.

Wild-type HIV-1 Gag colocalized with Lamp3-containing vesicles (~30%), i.e. late endosomes, but very few with Lamp1 (less than 10%), i.e. lysosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). For the &#x00394;ZF1ZF2 NC mutant, Gag was found either in the cytoplasm, poorly associated with the Lamp1 marker (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), or at the PM. Similar observations were made with the H23H44C NC mutant (data not shown). This latter Gag mutant weakly localized with Lamp3(+) vesicles (7 &#x000b1; 4%) and with Lamp1(+) vesicles (5 &#x000b1; 2%). Thus, it appears that the double ZF-mutated Gag accumulated in the cytosol and strongly at the PM, and is delocalized from endosomal membranes in comparison with the wild-type Gag. Taken together these results suggest that upon synthesis NC-mutated Gag molecules are targeted mainly to the PM (or to intracellular ring-shape membranes, that can derived from PM invaginations) where they concentrate, resulting in a strong intracellular Gag retention and a decrease in virus production.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Plasma membrane accumulation of the HIV-1 NC(&#x00394;ZF1ZF2) Gag</bold>.

Post-nuclear supernatants from 293T cells expressing either wild-type HIV-1, the &#x00394;ZF1ZF2-NC or &#x00394;NC mutant were fractionated and each fraction was analyzed for its content in viral proteins and gRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, respectively).

In the late endosomal/lysosomal fractions, Gag and processed proteins were found together with the gRNA (fractions 8&#x02013;12), indicating that Gag and the viral RNA are most probably associated in the form of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. Only small amounts of Gag were present at the PM together with the gRNA (fraction 1).

The current view of the assembly process implies that the newly made Gag binds to the cellular membrane by the N-terminal myristoylated domain and stretches of basic residues of the matrix domain (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], also involving inositol phosphates/Gag interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. At the same time, the NC domain selectively binds the gRNA via specific interactions with the packaging Psi signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which in turn promote Gag oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although, a leucine zipper motif could functionally, at least in part, replace NC to drive the assembly of a "minimal" Gag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We propose that the interactions between Gag-NC and the genomic Psi signal will ensure both the formation of Gag oligomers and the selective recruitment of the gRNA. Consistent with this view, mutations in the first NC zinc finger or the flanking basic residues result in a strong decrease of viral particle production and infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, it has been proposed that the NC domain of Gag is required for the proper assembly and release of infectious virions.</p><p>To confirm the multiple roles played by NC in HIV-1 assembly, we have examined the role of the NC zinc fingers (ZF) in Gag trafficking. Taken together, our results show that both NC zinc fingers play critical roles in the ability of Gag to properly assemble and ultimately to bud. In fact, all HIV-1 ZF mutants examined so far produced particles at levels five to ten fold, or more, lower than that of wild-type HIV-1 and were not infectious (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>In model cell lines, the wild-type HIV-1 Gag was found to accumulate either at the PM or on intracellular tetraspanin-rich endosomal membranes as recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Mutating the NC Zinc fingers caused Gag to accumulate within the cell, in a diffuse manner and at the PM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Thus, mutating the NC ZF appears to prevent Gag targeting to and accumulation in endosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This favors the view that endosomes are an important site for virus formation and release (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and also maturation since intracellular mature CAp24 was drastically reduced in the case of the ZF mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). It also indicates that NC is not the major determinant for Gag targeting to the PM, such as the basic MA domain of Gag and phosphatidyl inositol phosphate lipids are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].

As previously shown for mutations in the first ZF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], we found that mutating the second ZF and both of them strongly impaired gRNA content in mutant virions as well as particle release (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), and resulted in the production of replication defective viruses. Staufen, a cellular RNA-binding protein involved in RNA transport and metabolism, was reported to interact with both the gRNA and the NC domain of HIV-1 Gag, and to have a role in HIV-1 gRNA encapsidation and Gag assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Mapping the interaction domain between Staufen and Gag reveals the importance of the NC domain, in particular the second ZF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. This could explain, at least in part, the role played by the second ZF on gRNA encapsidation if Staufen is responsible for gRNA trafficking to the assembly site and consequently RNA-dependent Gag oligomerization and assembly.</p><p>However, Ott and colleagues reported that the decrease in viral production due to NC deletion can be compensated by an RNA binding site in HIV-1 MA domain of Gag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It is very difficult to dissociate the role of NC in virus assembly from NC-RNA interactions, which are critical for the structure of the viral particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], rather than assembly or budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our data favor a model in wich all events are linked and dependent upon Gag-RNA interactions via the NC domain, required to achieve a proper viral assembly, i.e. multimerization of Gag, Gag oligomer targeting and trafficking, and ultimately particle assembly, budding and release.</p><p>To better examine the role of Gag-RNA interactions in assembly, we examined gRNA localization by FISH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and by subcellular fractionation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The gRNA was found in the nucleus, most probably due to provirus transcription, in the cytoplasm and at the PM of cells expressing wild-type HIV-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), in agreement with Berthold and Mandarelli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Wild-type Gag and the gRNA were also found at the level of late endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Mutating the NC ZF motifs drastically altered the cellular distribution of the gRNA, because it was found evenly distributed within the cell and no longer associated with the PM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, by FISH) or the late endosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, by gradient), while the NC-mutated Gag accumulated mainly at the PM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Thus, specific Gag-gRNA interactions via the NC-ZF are most probably required for proper Gag trafficking through Gag-Gag multimer complexes. In agreement with this view, it was reported that Gag expressed from Psi(-) RNA diffuses throughout the cell and shows delayed cytoplasmic colocalisation with the gRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The authors propose that the packaging signal may coordinate capture of the genomic Psi(+) RNA by Gag, followed by assembly and transport to the budding site. This data indeed mirrors the results obtained with the NC mutants, in particular the Gag-&#x00394;NC mutant, for which both the gRNA and mutated Gag were found diffuse throughout the cell and had probably lost Gag-gRNA association (as seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the specific Gag-gRNA interactions via the NC domain are necessary for proper Gag trafficking and assembly, for Gag oligomers to be targeted to either specific domains at the PM or to the late endosomes.</p><p>Finally, the structure of the HIV-1 virions carrying one or several mutations in the NC ZF was determined by electron microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Results show that the NC mutated virions have lost their conical core shape and are immature, which confirm the role of NC in HIV-1 virion structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], as well as for other retroviruses, such as SIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and MLV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our results correlate with previous studies on the assembly of several retroviruses, namely HIV, MLV, RSV that have revealed a critical role of NC in virus assembly and release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the HIV-1 NC protein appears to be a major actor in the late steps of the virus replication in addition to its roles in proviral DNA synthesis and variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks are due to Fabienne Simian-Lerm&#x000e9; and Claire Lionnet (PLATIM, ENS Lyon, France) for their helpful assistance in CSLM.
