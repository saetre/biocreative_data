However, the precise subcellular locations and trafficking of these membrane proteins are poorly understood. This is further complicated by a general deficiency of information about targeting pathways of membrane proteins in plants. To investigate CNGC trafficking and localization, we have measured <italic>Atcngc5 </italic>and <italic>Atcngc10 </italic>expression in roots and leaves, analyzed AtCNGC10-GFP fusions transiently expressed in protoplasts, and conducted immunofluorescence labeling of protoplasts and immunoelectron microscopic analysis of high pressure frozen leaves and roots.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>AtCNGC10 mRNA and protein levels were 2.5-fold higher in roots than leaves, while AtCNGC5 mRNA and protein levels were nearly equal in these tissues. The AtCNGC10-EGFP fusion was targeted to the plasma membrane in leaf protoplasts, and lightly labeled several intracellular structures. Immunofluorescence microscopy with affinity purified CNGC-specific antisera indicated that AtCNGC5 and AtCNGC10 are present in the plasma membrane of protoplasts. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that AtCNGC10 was associated with the plasma membrane of mesophyll, palisade parenchyma and epidermal cells of leaves, and the meristem, columella and cap cells of roots. AtCNCG10 was also observed in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi cisternae and vesicles of 50&#x02013;150 nm in size. Patch clamp assays of an AtCNGC10-GFP fusion expressed in HEK293 cells measured significant cation currents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>AtCNGC5 and AtCNGC10 are plasma membrane proteins. We postulate that AtCNGC10 traffics from the endoplasmic reticulum via the Golgi apparatus and associated vesicles to the plasma membrane. The presence of the cation channel, AtCNGC10, in root cap meristem cells, cell plate, and gravity-sensing columella cells, combined with the previously reported antisense phenotypes of decreased gravitropic and cell enlargement responses, suggest roles of AtCNGC10 in modulating cation balance required for root gravitropism, cell division and growth.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cations are essential macro- and micronutrients in plants, playing critical roles in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, disease resistance, osmotic equilibrium, growth, and development [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]]. Although required for normal cellular functions, an imbalance of cations can cause deleterious effects in plants. To regulate intracellular cation homeostasis, plants have evolved several distinct classes of transporters to facilitate the movement of monovalent and divalent cations across cellular membranes. One such class of cation transporters is the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Originally discovered in barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and subsequently found in many plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], CNGCs share a Shaker-like structure composed of six membrane-spanning domains (S1-6) with a pore situated between S5 and S6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The hydrophilic C-terminus contains partially overlapping cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNBD) and calmodulin-bind (CaMBD) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Cyclic nucleotides (cAMP or cGMP) are believed to activate, whereas calmodulin inhibits cation transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The CNGC family in Arabidopsis is comprised of 20 members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Electrophysiological, molecular and genetic complementation studies of six of these members indicate that they are generally non-selective, monovalent and divalent cation channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], although some discrimination between cations has also been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The phenotypic characterization of loss-of-function mutants has implicated CNGCs to be involved in a wide range of plant processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] including tolerance to heavy metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], sensitivity to various cation stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], plant development and germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], programmed cell death, and disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Structure and expression of CNGCs in Arabidopsis</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Two dimensional model of a generic CNGC as positioned in the membrane relative to the inward and outward orientations.

Cell disruption and fractionation experiments indicate that the tobacco homolog, NtCBP4, is associated with the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. When transiently expressed, AtCNGC3-GFP fusion proteins were detected in the outer region of the leaf protoplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], also suggesting that AtCNCG3 is targeted to the plasma membrane. However, no CNGCs have been immunolocalized at the electron microscope level of analysis and no data exists on their intracellular trafficking in plants. The latter point is also important because the pathway(s) by which membrane proteins are transported to the plasma membrane in plants are not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>To determine where different CNGCs function in plant cells and to elucidate their intracellular trafficking mechanism, we have analyzed the expression of AtCNGC5 and AtCNGC10 and determined at high spatial-resolution the subcellular localization and trafficking of AtCNGC10. AtCNGC10 plays an important role in numerous growth responses in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It also modulates potassium levels in tissues, and it can rescue potassium uptake mutants of <italic>E. coli</italic>, yeast and Arabidopsis on low potassium media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this report, combined approaches of AtCNGC10-GFP targeting and immunofluorescence and electron microscopy of the native protein were used to show that AtCNGC10 is present in the plasma membrane of a variety of cell types in roots and leaves. We have also localized AtCNGC10 to the endoplasmic reticulum cisternae, Golgi stacks and vesicles, and vesicles near the plasma membrane, consistent with the notion that this transporter is synthesized in the ER and transported via the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Finally, patch clamp assays of HEK293 cells heterologously expressing the AtCNGC10-GFP fusion indicated that the AtCNGC10 channel transported K<sup>+</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To study the location of CNGCs within the cellular membranes of Arabidopsis, we chose a combination of CNGC-GFP targeting and immunological approaches. Affinity purified, AtCNGC5- and AtCNGC10-specific polyclonal antisera were generated against synthetic peptides derived from the unique sequences of less conserved sub-regions within the CNGC family. The corresponding positions of these peptides within the predicted two-dimensional structure of a representative generic CNGC are shown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The AtCNGC10-specific antiserum binds to the hydrophilic N-terminus just upstream from the first transmembrane domain, while the AtCNGC5 antiserum binds to an exposed outer loop between the fifth transmembrane domain and the pore (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The specificity of the AtCNGC10-specific antiserum has been characterized in detail against recombinant AtCNGC10 and native plant proteins on immunoblots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The specificity of the AtCNGC5 antiserum was determined here (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>The expression levels of <italic>Atcngc5 </italic>and <italic>Atcngc10 </italic>were assessed in mature leaves and roots using both real-time RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and immunoprecipitation of total cellular proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The abundance of <italic>Atcngc5 </italic>mRNA was similar in roots and leaves, whereas <italic>Atcngc10 </italic>mRNA levels were over 2.5-fold greater in roots. In addition, <italic>Atcngc5 </italic>mRNA levels were 3-fold higher than that of <italic>Atcngc10 </italic>in leaves and 20% higher in roots. In our immunoprecipitation experiments, the AtCNGC10 and AtCNGC5 antisera detected specific bands at 75 and 82 kDa, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), which corresponded to the predicted sizes of the deduced polypeptides. Consistent with our real time RT-PCR results, AtCNGC5 was more abundant than AtCNGC10 in both tissues. Generally, CNGC protein levels correlated with mRNA levels on an equal protein loading basis and using equal antibody dosages (50 kDa heavy chain, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) in the immunoprecipitation assay.</p><p>As an initial approach for localizing CNGCs within the cell, we employed transient expression of an AtCNGC10-GFP fusion controlled by the 35S CaMV promoter in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The AtCNGC10 sequence directed GFP to the plasma membrane, whereas the GFP-alone control was detected uniformly in the cytosol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The AtCNGC10-GFP construct also lightly labeled some diffuse as well as several distinct punctate intracellular structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). These results suggested that the AtCNGC10 sequence directed the fused GFP through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. In another study, some similar structures were also reported to be labeled with AtCNGC3-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Transient expression reveals AtCNGC10-GFP trafficking to the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts using confocal laser scanning microscopy</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Leaf protoplasts were transfected with the two constructs pBL-35S:AtCNGC10-EGFP (C10-GFP) and pBL-35S:EGFP alone (GFP), and compared with untransfected controls (WT).

Immunolabeling at the light microscopy level was performed on chemically fixed wild type leaf protoplasts using the anti-AtCNGC5 and anti-AtCNGC10 antisera (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and an Alexafluor488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antiserum. Fluorescence was specifically detected around the outer fringe of the protoplast coincident with the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, to obtain a strong signal with the AtCNGC10 required 30 min longer incubations with the anti-AtCNGC10 antiserum than with the anti-AtCNGC5 antiserum, possibly to allow for the antisera to penetrate the protoplast to access the epitope on the cytosolic side of the membrane. The negative controls consisted of incubation of fixed protoplasts with the Alexaflour488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody alone, which produced no signal, indicating that the immunolocalizations of anti-AtCNGC5 and AtCNGC10 to the plasma membrane resulted from primary antibody localization and not background binding of the secondary antibody.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Immunolocalization of AtCNGC5 and AtCNGC10 to the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts using confocal laser scanning microscopy</bold>.

Unfortunately, the AtCNGC5 antiserum proved problematic on high pressure frozen and acetone-substituted thin tissue sections.

Slight plasmolysis of the epidermal cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) resulted in an increased separation of the plasma membrane from the cell wall, which further highlighted the specificity of immunolabeling in the plasma membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Immunolocalization of AtCNGC10 to the plasma membrane of diverse Arabidopsis leaf cells using transmission electron microscopy</bold>.

In patch clamp assays, we observed that heterologously expressed AtCNGC10 conducted significant inward K<sup>+ </sup>currents with the application of dibutyryl cGMP (100 uM) in the extracellular recording solution, demonstrating the activation of these channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We also observed significant outward currents, which may be carried by N-methyl-D-glucamine, a large organic cation, through the AtCNGC10. Further work is therefore needed to characterize the selectivity of AtCNGC10 for small and large cations and the role of calmodulin and cyclic nucleotides in channel regulation.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of AtCNGC10-GFP in HEK293 cells and patch clamp assays</bold>.

Antisense knockdown lines of <italic>Atcngc10 </italic>had smaller parenchyma cells and leaves and were disrupted in rates of root growth and gravitropic bending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that AtCNCG10 is involved in cation uptake in the plasma membrane of root and leaf cells. In addition, AtCNGC10 may also be involved in cation transport across the membrane of the vesicles in which it was detected. The inability to isolate a true knockout of AtCNGC10 and the observed haploinsufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], combined with the cell biological data observed here, further support our contention that AtCNGC10 is an essential gene in plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>AtCNGC5 is equally expressed in roots and leaves, while AtCNGC10 is expressed preferentially in roots. Both channels were localized to the plasma membrane of leaf protoplasts using immunofluorescence microscopy, and the translational fusion between AtCNGC10 and GFP also localized to the plasma membrane, indicating that it targets through the secretory pathway. High-resolution immunogold labeling at the EM level demonstrated that AtCNGC10 resides in the plasma membrane of root tip, columella, and meristematic cells, as well as in leaf epidermal, mesophyll and palisade parenchyma cells. AtCNGC10 was found in the ER, Golgi and vesicles, and we propose that these vesicles are trafficking intermediates in the secretory pathway for plasma membrane proteins. AtCNGC10 most likely transports cations into actively growing cells of leaves and roots and the gravity-sensing columella cells of roots.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Experiments were performed using wild type <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, Columbia ecotype.
