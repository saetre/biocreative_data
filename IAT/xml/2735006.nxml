Thus mitochondrial mass and activity must be coordinated with nutrient availability, yet this remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae grown in low yeast food have strong defects in mitochondrial abundance and respiration activity in the larval fat body. This correlates with reduced expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, particularly genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Second, genes involved in glutamine metabolism are also expressed in a nutrient-dependent manner, suggesting a coordination of amino acid synthesis with mitochondrial abundance and activity. Moreover, we show that Delg (CG6338), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue to the alpha subunit of mammalian transcription factor NRF-2/GABP, is required for proper expression of most genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Our data demonstrate that Delg is critical to adjust mitochondrial abundance in respect to Cyclin D/Cdk4, a growth-promoting complex and glutamine metabolism according to nutrient availability. However, in contrast to nutrients, Delg is not involved in the regulation of mitochondrial activity in the fat body. These findings are the first genetic evidence that the regulation of mitochondrial mass can be uncoupled from mitochondrial activity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, cellular organelles are separated from the cytoplasm through lipid membranes, creating compartments with unique biological properties. Rather than static, organelle size and function are often dynamic, and tightly regulated in response to various stimuli. One of the best-studied organelles are mitochondria, which show large cell-type specific variations in morphology and abundance, demonstrating that mitochondria are highly regulated. Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to various diseases, including metabolic disorders and cellular aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Chan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, therefore these organelles are critical for cellular homeostasis. Mitochondria perform multiple metabolic functions, most notably the generation of energy from carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids. Equally important, mitochondria also provide metabolites for anabolic processes such as <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of fatty acids and amino acids. Although the metabolic biochemical reactions are well established, we are just beginning to understand how these processes are coordinated <italic>in vivo</italic>. One interesting question is how nutrients control mitochondrial mass and activity, and how this regulation affects cellular metabolism.</p><p>During cellular growth, amino acids are used for protein synthesis. In higher eukaryotes, essential amino acids are taken up through the diet, whereas nonessential amino acids are synthesized <italic>de novo</italic>. For the latter, mitochondria are critical, since they provide oxaloacetate for aspartate and asparagine, as well as 2-oxoglutarate (&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate) for glutamate, glutamine, arginine and proline biosynthesis. Of these amino acids, glutamine is particularly interesting: First, many cell types take up large amounts of glutamine, which can be used to produce cytoplasmic NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, NAPDH and lactate in a process called glutaminolysis. Second, since the TCA cycle intermediate citrate can be used as a substrate for fatty acid synthesis, glutamine can be converted into 2-oxoglutarate, thus replenishing the TCA cycle. Third, efflux of cytoplasmic glutamine, either taken up or synthesized <italic>de novo</italic>, is directly linked to the uptake of essential amino acids, both in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Nicklin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, all three processes are highly active in cancer cells, under conditions of high metabolic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-DeBerardinis1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. One would therefore expect tight coordination between nutrients, mitochondrial activity and amino acid synthesis, in particular glutamine, yet factors mediating such links have not been described.</p><p>Mitochondria contain their own genome (mtDNA), encoding a small number of proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), as well as tRNAs and rRNAs for mitochondrial translation. The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, including factors for mitochondrial transcription and translation. These proteins are translated in the cytoplasm and imported into mitochondria. Accordingly, the transcription of these nuclear genes is believed to be rate limiting for mitochondrial mass and activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Scarpulla1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. To understand the nutrient-specific regulation of mitochondria, one has to characterize how these nuclear transcription factors are regulated in response to nutrients. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are highly expressed during the larval growth and feeding period. Subsequently, as the larvae stop feeding at the end of the last larval instar and prepare for metamorphosis, expression of these genes is strongly downregulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-White1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Arbeitman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval growth is an ideal system to study how mitochondria are regulated in response nutrients <italic>in vivo</italic>. This has been exploited in recent microarray studies, where expression profiles of normal fed and starved larvae were compared: Indeed, starvation led to a strong downregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial translation, respiration, TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Zinke1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Teleman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar findings have been published using microarrays from fed or starved adult flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Gershman1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Comparing larval fat body and muscle tissues, Teleman et al. discovered that many of these genes respond in a cell-type specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Teleman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, factors must exist that mediate a tissue-specific transcriptional control in response to nutrients. One candidate for such a factor is dFoxo, the fly homologue to mammalian forkhead O-type transcription factors (FoxO family) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Puig1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, dFoxo did only mediate the nutrient responsiveness for a subset of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Teleman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This implies that other transcription factors must exist, yet they have not been described in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we used <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to characterize mitochondria in a developing organism <italic>in vivo</italic>. We focused on the larval fat body, the fly adipose/liver tissue. Fat body cells are specified during embryogenesis, and show an enormous increase in cell size during larval stages, which is accompanied by endoreduplication of its DNA to a C-value of &#x0223c;256. Growth of these cells is directly regulated by nutrient uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Baker1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, making the larval fat body an ideal system to study mitochondria in response to nutrition and nutrient-sensitive growth-promoting pathways. We show that low-yeast food conditions, and thus amino acid starvation, leads to strongly reduced mitochondrial abundance and respiration activity. This correlates with reduced expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, including enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism. Moreover, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Delg (CG6338), the fly homologue to the alpha subunit of mammalian transcription factor NRF-2/GABP, functions as a key regulator for mitochondrial mass. Surprisingly, reduced mitochondrial mass in <italic>delg</italic> mutants does not translate into reduced OXPHOS activity. Rather, residual mitochondria compensate by being more active. More importantly, our data show that Delg is critical to adjust mitochondrial abundance and expression levels of enzymes required for glutamine metabolism in response to nutrient availability. Finally, we observed that the nutrient-sensitive growth-promoting complex Cyclin D/Cdk4 required Delg for its effect on mitochondria. Thus our data demonstrate how Cyclin D/Cdk4 and Delg coordinate mitochondrial abundance and glutamine metabolism with nutrient availability <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mitochondria in the larval fat body respond to low-yeast nutrition</title><p>Standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> food contains high amounts of carbohydrates (sugar and corn) and yeast, the latter providing mostly amino acids and fatty acids, but also compounds for which flies are auxotrophic. To test whether mitochondrial abundance is regulated in response to nutrients, we grew larvae in normal or low-yeast food, and ubiquitously expressed a mitochondrial-targeted GFP (mitoGFP) to label mitochondria. Since low-yeast food leads to a delay in development, mid-third instar larvae were taken for all experiments except when indicated (4 days after egg deposition (AED) for normal fed, and 8 days AED for low-yeast fed control larvae). When analyzed in the larval fat body, mitochondria were abundant throughout the cytoplasm in normal food. In contrast, when larvae were grown under low-yeast conditions (10&#x00025; of normal levels), the mitoGFP signal was dispersed and less abundant in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Since average cell size was not changed (data not shown), we labeled the plasmamembrane with phalloidin, and quantified the GFP-positive area and normalized it to the cell area. Under normal food conditions, mitochondria occupied 45&#x00025; of the cell area. This was significantly reduced to 21&#x00025; under low yeast food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). To confirm that mitoGFP labels mitochondria, we compared its fluorescence with MitoTracker, a mitochondrial-specific dye. Indeed, the two fluorescences perfectly overlapped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006935.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>), demonstrating that mitochondrial abundance is regulated in response to nutrients. To test whether this effect is specific for the fat body, we analyzed other larval tissues. In the gut, using both mitoGFP and MitoTracker, mitochondria were equally abundant under both feeding conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Other larval tissues did also not show apparent changes in abundance upon low-yeast food (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate a tissue-specific control of mitochondrial abundance in response to nutrients. Given that the fat body is critical for the whole animal to respond to amino acid availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Colombani1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, we focused on this tissue to further characterize the effect of nutrients on mitochondria.</p><fig id="pone-0006935-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006935.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Nutrient-specific control of mitochondrial abundance and activity in the larval fat body.</title><p>Larvae were grown in formal food, or in food that contained 10&#x00025; of the normal yeast concentration.

During this process, electrons from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are transferred to the electron transport chain, which uses the electron-transfer potential to create a proton gradient across the inner-mitochondrial membrane. ATP synthase then generates ATP from ADP and phosphate.</p><p>Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor for the electron transport chain, thus oxygen consumption reflects OXPHOS activity. To test whether the reduced mitochondrial abundance under low-yeast conditions would result in oxidative phosphorylation defects, we adapted an assay for mammalian tissue samples to measure fat body-specific oxygen consumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Kuznetsov1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. We dissected larval fat bodies, permeabilized the plasmamembrane with digitonin, and measured oxygen consumption using a Clark electrode. When normalized to protein content, the addition of pyruvate and proline (state 2), which stimulates complex I of the electron transport chain, led to identical respiration rates when larvae were grown in normal or low-yeast food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Under these conditions, ADP is limiting. Therefore, after the addition of ADP (state 3), fat bodies from normal fed larvae showed a 3.2-fold increase in respiration rates. In contrast, this was significantly reduced to 2.3-fold when fat bodies were dissected from low-yeast fed larvae, demonstrating respiration defects under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). In addition to the generation of ATP, the inner-mitochondrial proton gradient is dissipated through uncoupling complexes, producing heat. In mammals, two adipose tissues are found: The white adipose tissue, which mediates energy storage, and the brown adipose tissue, which shows a high degree of uncoupling, being involved in thermongenesis. It is not known whether the fly fat body functions as a white or brown adipose tissue. To measure uncoupled respiration, we used atractyloside, an inhibitor of the ADP/ATP transporter, leading to ADP depletion (state 4). We did not detect different respiration rates between normal and low-yeast fed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Furthermore, when respiration was measured in two other larval tissues, the gut and the epidermis, the ratios between state 3 and state 4 respiration were not changed compared to the fat body under normal feeding conditions (data not shown). We conclude that first, uncoupled respiration is not nutrient-responsive. Second, the fly fat body resembles the mammalian white adipose tissue. Finally, we added KCN to block all mitochondrial respiration by inhibiting complex IV of the electron transport chain. We did not detect a difference between fat bodies from normal and low-yeast fed larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Taken together, mitochondrial abundance in the larval fat body is reduced under low-yeast food conditions, leading to respiration defects.</p><p>As mentioned above, many genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are transcriptional regulated in response to nutrients in the larval fat body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Teleman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. To test whether reduced expression of OXPHOS genes could explain the respiration defects, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measured mRNA levels from dissected fat bodies. Indeed, <italic>RFeSP</italic>, encoding the Rieske iron-sulfur protein of complex III, <italic>Bellwether</italic> (<italic>Blw</italic>), encoding the ATP synthase subunit alpha protein of complex V and <italic>Cyct-c-p</italic>, encoding Cytochrome c, were all expressed at significantly reduced levels under low yeast food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Next, we measured mRNA levels of genes encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis of glutamate, glutamine and proline, which are all synthesized from the TCA cycle intermediate 2-oxoglutarate (see below for a schematic representation of these enzymatic reactions). Of 8 genes encoding these enzymes, 6 were significantly downregulated upon low-yeast food, including <italic>Glutamate dehydrogenase</italic> (<italic>GDH</italic>; conversion of 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate), <italic>Glutamine synthetase 2</italic> (conversion of glutamate and glutamine), and <italic>Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase</italic> (conversion of glutamate and proline; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g007">7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006935.s001">S1B</xref>). These data demonstrate that nutrients must control transcription factors that drive the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins.

To further assay mitochondrial mass, we used NAO, which specifically labels the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin, and is commonly used as a good readout to estimate mitochondrial mass. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, <italic>delg</italic> mutant cells showed a strong reduction in NAO. Again, residual mitochondria were concentrated around the nucleus. Finally, using electron microscopy, we noticed that <italic>delg</italic> mutants had similar numbers of mitochondria, but mitochondria were strongly reduced in size, being on average 50&#x00025; smaller in area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g002">Fig. 2E and 2F</xref>). To test whether this effect is cell-autonomous, we induced <italic>delg</italic> homozygous mutant clones using the Flp/FRT system. Mutant cells, recognized by the absence of GFP, showed a strong reduction in MitoTracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that mitochondrial mass is reduced in <italic>delg</italic> mutant fat body cells in a cell-autonomous manner.

Surprisingly, for none of the respiration states, we detected any difference compared to control backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Importantly, oxygen consumption in these assays was normalized to total fat body protein, and not to mitochondrial protein. Thus, since <italic>delg</italic> mutant tissue contains less mitochondrial mass, this indicates that the residual mitochondria must be more active to compensate for the reduced mass. To support this conclusion, we stained for Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity, reflecting complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Indeed, <italic>delg</italic> mutant cells showed an identical COX activity compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Moreover, individual mitochondria, although reduced in size, showed no morphological defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), and western blots demonstrated no change in Cytochrome c protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). These data are consistent with the model that individual mitochondria are more active, leading to a tissue with normal OXPHOS activity. These finding imply an increased inner-mitochondrial membrane potential in the <italic>delg</italic> mutant. We therefore used JC-1, a dye that fluoresces green under low inner-mitochondrial membrane potential, and red when the potential is high. When assayed in control fat bodies, green fluorescent was predominant, demonstrating low potential. In contrast, <italic>delg</italic> mutants showed an increased red fluorescence, indicating increased mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g005">Fig. 5E and F</xref>). Taken together, although mitochondrial mass is reduced, remaining mitochondria show increased activity, leading to cells and tissues with normal OXPHOS activity. To our knowledge, this phenotype has not been described for any of the transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Our findings are very surprising given the reduced expression of OXPHOS genes in the <italic>delg</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). At least two models can explain this paradox: First, a transcription-independent mechanism exists to maintain normal protein or activity levels to cope with reduced expression in the <italic>delg</italic> mutant. Such a mechanism could affect either the translation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, protein import into mitochondria, processing into functional complexes and/or the activation and turnover of these proteins. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these post-transcriptional regulations are very poorly understood, and biochemistry is required to address these questions. However, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body yields only limiting amounts of material, and specific antibodies for fly proteins are currently not available. Thus this idea cannot be tested directly at present time. Second, factors that are rate limiting for OXPHOS activity are not affected by the Delg mutation. Indeed, we found normal mRNA and protein levels of Cytochrome c (data not shown and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Using allelic series of <italic>Cyt-c-p</italic> hypomorphic mutants, as well as overexpression studies, we will test whether Cytochrome c is limiting for OXPHOS activity under physiological conditions.</p><fig id="pone-0006935-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006935.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Normal mitochondrial activity in <italic>delg</italic> mutant fat bodies.</title><p>(A) Oxygen consumption assays on digitonin-permeabilized dissected fat bodies as done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>.

Equally important, the fat body is known to release amino acids, such a glutamine and proline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Candy1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, which are synthesized from the mitochondrial metabolite 2-oxoglutarate. Therefore, one would expect that mitochondrial mass and activity are regulated in response to nutrients in the larval fat body. Indeed, we show strong decreases in mitochondrial abundance, respiration activity as well as expression levels of enzymes involved in glutamine and proline metabolism under low-yeast food. Under these feeding conditions, amino acids and fatty acids, which are both provided by yeast, become limited. <italic>Delg</italic> mutants show very similar phenotypes compared to normal fed controls, and do not show additive phenotypes in respect to mitochondrial abundance and amino acid metabolism upon low-yeast food. We therefore propose that Delg functions as a transcription factor to coordinate mitochondrial functions according to nutrient availability. One of these aspects is to adjust the synthesis of non-essential amino acids to the uptake of essential amino acids. In this respect, de novo synthesis of L-glutamine is particularly interesting, as the efflux of its cytoplasmic pool is used, both in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, for import of essential amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Nicklin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Our model proposes that Delg either directly senses nutrients, most likely amino acids, or is controlled by upstream sensors. Since the nutrient-sensitive Cyclin D/Cdk4 pathway functions through Delg, the latter seems more likely. Given the key role of the fat body in metabolic homeostasis of the whole animal, one might expect that fat body mitochondria be regulated differently from mitochondria in other tissues. Indeed, our phenotypes were specific to the fat body, demonstrating that Delg functions primarily in this tissue to coordinate the different anabolic and catabolic functions of mitochondria.</p><p>Mammalian NRF-2 was identified through its binding to the promoters of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Virbasius1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Gugneja1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, and previously had been purified as GABP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-LaMarco1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

This is particular well understood for genes encoding electron transport proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Virbasius2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Carter1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Virbasius1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Villena1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Ongwijitwat1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Ongwijitwat2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as for mitochondrial protein import <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Blesa1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Blesa2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Blesa3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, direct NRF-2 binding to several promoters was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Gleyzer1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Ongwijitwat2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus biochemical evidence links NRF-2/GABP to the transcriptional control of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Accordingly, RNAi studies found reduced expression of several COX subunits in cells having reduced NRF-2&#x003b1; levels, leading to reduced COX activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Ongwijitwat3">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, genetic data have not supported the biochemical data: MEFs lacking NRF-2&#x003b1;/GABP&#x003b1; do not have reduced mRNA or protein levels of several putative NRF-2 targets, and mitochondrial phenotypes were not reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Yang1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Delg is the closest fly homologue to mammalian NRF-2&#x003b1;. Two-hybrid data show that Delg can bind to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NRF-2&#x003b2; homologue CG32343 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Giot1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, and preliminary data show that <italic>CG32343</italic> mutants have mitochondrial defects very similar to <italic>delg</italic> mutants (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that Delg functions analogues to mammalian NRF-2&#x003b1;, and our data are the first genetic evidence that links any member of the NRF-2&#x003b1; family to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><p>Of particular interest is the strong reduction in mitochondrial size in the <italic>delg</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g002">Fig. 2E and 2F</xref>). This implies that mitochondrial fusion might be defective, and/or that fission occurs at an increased rate. Indeed, based on our microarray data, expression of <italic>Opa1-like</italic> (CG8479), the fly homologue to mammalian fusion protein OPA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Chan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, showed a significant, 2-fold reduction in expression in <italic>delg</italic> mutant fat body samples (data not shown). In contrast, fly homologues to mammalian Mitofusins, which are well-established fusion factors (fly homologues <italic>Marf</italic>/<italic>CG3869</italic> and <italic>Fuzzy onions</italic>/<italic>CG4568</italic>), were not differently expressed (data not shown). More work is required to test whether <italic>delg</italic> mutant have defects in mitochondrial fusion. In addition, when <italic>delg</italic> homozygous mutant clones were induced, we noted a strong reduction in cell size, yet the nuclear size, shown by the DAPI staining, was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>), demonstrating growth defects, This is surprising, since endoreplication, and thus nuclear size, normally correlates with cell size in this tissue. Since mitochondrial biogenesis has been shown to correlate with nuclear DNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-MartinezDiez1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Schieke1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, our data suggest that Delg might be involved to link S-phase and potentially cell size to mitochondrial mass. Future work will be required to address this hypothesis.</p><p>Genes involved in mitochondrial OXPHOS activity, including <italic>RFeSP</italic> and <italic>Blw</italic>, showed similar reduced expression in the <italic>delg</italic> mutant or under low yeast nutrition. Importantly, we detected additive defects when <italic>delg</italic> mutant were grown under low yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Moreover, when oxygen consumption was measured in permeabilized fat body tissues, state 3 respirations were strongly affected by low yeast nutrition, yet this was independent of Delg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). This demonstrates that factors other than Delg must regulate mitochondrial OXPHOS activity in response to nutrients. One candidate is Spargel/CG9809, the fly homologue to mammalian PGC-1 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Gershman1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, which are transcriptional coactivators that control mitochondrial mass and activity in response to external stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Scarpulla1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, we found that Spargel functions in parallel to Delg, and mediates a link between insulin-signalling and the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (Tiefenb&#x000f6;ck et al., <italic>under revision</italic>). Therefore, Delg and Spargel mediate two parallel pathways that control mitochondrial mass and OXPHOS activity in response to nutrients.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> Cyclin D/Cdk4 is a cyclin-dependent protein kinase complex, and controls cellular growth levels in addition to regulating cell cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Meyer1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Datar1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Emmerich1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly for this study, overgrowth induced by ectopic expression of Cyclin D/Cdk4 is insensitive to nutrient conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Datar2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, demonstrating that the Cyclin D/Cdk4 pathway is nutrient-responsive. We now show that ectopic expression of Cyclin D/Cdk4 in the larval fat body is sufficient to drive mitochondrial abundance in a Delg-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006935-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>), suggesting a mechanism where Cyclin D/Cdk4 coordinate growth levels and mitochondrial mass. Furthermore, one would expect that the transcriptional activity associated with Delg is regulated in response to Cyclin D/Cdk4. Indeed, using lacZ insertions into the loci of several genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, including <italic>Blw</italic>, clonal expression of Cyclin D/Cdk4 was sufficient to stimulate expression of these genes. However, this effect was restricted to wandering third instar larvae, but was not seen in feeding L1, L2 or L3 larvae (data not shown). Moreover, when larvae were grown under low-yeast conditions, ectopic expression of Cyclin D/Cdk4 led to reduced expression of these genes, again based on lacZ insertions (data not shown). We conclude that Cyclin D/Cdk4 is not a general activator of Delg function, but might mediate a nutrient and/or developmental-dependent control.</p><p>In mammals, D-type cyclins bound to Cdk4 or Cdk6 are best characterized for their functions during cell cycle progression, but several reports have shown additional roles, in particular the regulation of multiple transcription factors by direct binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Coqueret1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly for this study, mitochondrial size and activity are regulated in response to mammalian Cyclin D1: Knockdown or knockout of Cyclin D1 leads to larger mitochondria that are more active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Sakamaki1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Wang1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, ectopic expression of Cyclin D1 inhibits mitochondrial activity, a function that requires binding to Cdk4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Wang1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, Cyclin D1 and NRF-1 are functional linked: Cyclin D1 stimulates NRF-1-dependent transcription, the two proteins interact, and a protein kinase associated to immunoprecipitated Cyclin D1 can phosphorylate NRF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Wang1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests a mechanism where Cyclin D1/Cdk4 inhibit mitochondrial mass and activity through inhibition of NRF-1 function. Thus D-type cyclins bound to Cdk4 have opposite effects on mitochondrial mass in mammals compared to flies, suggesting that different mechanisms have been adopted during evolution to control mitochondria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Following fly lines were used: <italic>delg<sup>613</sup></italic> and <italic>delg<sup>tne</sup></italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Schulz1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, UAS-mitoGFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Guo1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, UAS-Cyclin D, UAS-Cdk4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Datar1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>cycd<sup>1</sup></italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Emmerich1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>cdk4<sup>3</sup></italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Meyer1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, hsFlp<sup>122</sup> Act&#x0003e;CD2&#x0003e;Gal4 UAS-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Neufeld1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, hsFlp<sup>122</sup> Tubulin&#x0003e;CD2&#x0003e;Gal4 UAS-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Scott1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, UAS-INR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-Brogiolo1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, UAS-dMyc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006935-SchreiberAgus1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>.
