The second had pre-tRNA at the 5' side of the M1 RNA (pre-tRNA-M1 RNA). Both molecules were self-cleaving RNAs. The self-cleavage of M1 RNA-pre-tRNA occurred at the normal site (5'-end of mature tRNA sequence) and proceeded under the condition of 10 mM Mg2+ concentration. This reaction at 10 mM Mg2+ was an intramolecular reaction (cis-cleavage), while, at 40 mM and 80 mM Mg2+, trans-cleavage partially occurred. The self-cleavage rate was strictly affected by the distance between the M1 RNA and the pre-tRNA in the molecule. The self-cleavage of pre-tRNA-M1 RNA occurred mainly at three sites within the mature tRNA sequence. This cleavage did not occur at 10 mM Mg2+. Use of M1 RNA-pre-tRNA molecule for the in vitro evolution of M1 RNA is discussed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0039-a" xlink:role="4687"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0039-b" xlink:role="4687"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4685"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4686"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4687"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4688"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00069-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4689"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
