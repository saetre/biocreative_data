Patients with secondary MDS have increased BM cell apoptosis, which results in BM dysfunction (cytopenias), and an increased risk of developing fatal acute leukemias. In the present study we asked whether TNF-&#x003b1;, known to regulate cell apoptosis, could modulate the onset of secondary MDS.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>We show that TNF-&#x003b1; is induced by irradiation and regulates BM cells apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast to irradiated wild type (WT) mice, TNF-&#x003b1; deficient (TNF-&#x003b1; KO) mice or WT mice treated with a TNF-&#x003b1;-neutralizing antibody were partially protected from the apoptotic effects of irradiation. Next we established a 3-cycle irradiation protocol, in which mice were sub-lethally irradiated once monthly over a 3 month period. In this model, irradiated WT mice presented loss of microsatellite markers on BM cells, low white blood cell (WBC) counts, reduced megakaryocyte (MK) and platelet levels (thrombocytopenia) and macrocytic anemia, phenoypes that suggest the irradiation protocol resulted in BM dysfunction with clinical features of MDS. In contrast, TNF-&#x003b1; KO mice were protected from the irradiation effects: BM cell apoptosis following irradiation was significantly reduced, concomitant with sustained BM MK numbers and absence of other cytopenias. Moreover, irradiated WT mice with long term (&#x02265;5 months) BM dysfunction had increased BM angiogenesis, MMPs and VEGF and NFkB p65, suggestive of disease progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our data shows that TNF-&#x003b1; induction following irradiation modulates BM cell apoptosis and is a crucial event in BM dysfunction, secondary MDS onset and progression.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumour Necrosis Factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by activated macrophages and T lymphocytes, but also by keratinocytes and fibroblasts &#x0005b;reviewed in 1&#x0005d;.

Our aim was to establish a reproducible and clinically relevant model of BM dysfunction that resembled secondary (that is, resulting from therapy) MDS. It has been known for several years, that dogs chronically exposed to low daily doses of whole-body &#x003b3;-radiation are prone to develop hematologic changes consistent with a myeloproliferative disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Tolle1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Seed1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In our 3-cycle irradiation model (3x irradiation), 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; of WT mice presented low WBC, anemia and thrombocytopenia, and elevated MCH-Hemoglobin per RBC (indicative of macrocytic anemia). These clinical features, together with the incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities (which in our <italic>in vivo</italic> model involved the loss of microsatelite markers in chromosome 2) are strong indications of an MDS-like phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Malcovati1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. TNF-&#x003b1; KO mice subjected to the same irradiation protocol did not develop BM dysfunction; cell apoptosis in TNF-&#x003b1; KO mice BM was significantly reduced, resulting in sustained hematopoietic precursor and mature cell levels, including MK. Besides the maintenance in MK/platelet levels, the circulating WBC and RBC in 3x irradiated TNF-&#x003b1; KO mice were also similar to control (non-irradiated) mice (data not shown). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that TNF-&#x003b1; KO mice are resistant to irradiation-induced BM dysfunction.</p><p>WT mice with sustained MDS-like symptoms beyond 5 months after the last irradiation had increased BM angiogenesis, as determined by quantification of laminin staining in BM sections and also by quantification of collagen IV and laminin in whole BM extracts (since laminin and collagen IV are components of the vessels basement membranes), suggestive of disease progression. The BM of 3x irradiated WT mice also showed increased MMP activity, increased VEGF and NFkB p65, in contrast to the BM of 3x irradiated TNF-&#x003b1; KO mice, where these parameters were unchanged. TNF-&#x003b1; is an important modulator of MMP activity, namely gelatinaseB/MMP9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Sato1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Wielockx1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> which is crucial for extracellular matrix remodelling and has also been shown to play a pivotal role in BM recovery following myelosuppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Heissig1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Under these conditions, MMP-9 activity in culture supernatants was diminished in the presence of the TNF-&#x003b1; antibody (data not shown) suggesting TNF-&#x003b1; release from the irradiated stroma induces a rapid MMP release.</p><p>Therefore, besides inducing cell apoptosis, overproduction of TNF-&#x003b1; in the BM microenvironment following irradiation, may induce MMP-9 and possibly other undisclosed factors, contributing towards degradation of the endothelial basement membrane and release of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF, which in turn may promote angiogenesis. Moreover, our data also shows that TNF-&#x003b1; stimulates VEGF production and release from different BM cells, in particular MK. Concerning the involvement of NFkB, TNF-&#x003b1; has been shown to exert some of its effects via NF-kB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Natoli1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Barkett1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> The increase in NFkB p65 in 3x irradiated mice suggests this may be a molecular event involved in BM dysfunction and possibly progression to an MDS-like phenotype with increased likelihood of developing acute leukemia.</p><p>Our recent unpublished data suggested that MK are major producers of ECM molecules in the BM microenvironment (manuscript in preparation) namely fibronectin, suggesting their survival, observed in TNF-&#x003b1; KO mice, and the resistance of TNF-&#x003b1; KO mice to the effects of irradiation, may involve the production (maintenance) of such ECM molecules in the BM microenvironment. Lack of integrin &#x003b1;4 (which, among other functions is a receptor for fibronectin) has been shown to restrict stem-cell BM repopulating capacity and to limit BM stem cells self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Priestley1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Two recent elegant studies demonstrated unequivocally that the interaction between hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and the BM microenvironment is strictly regulated by Rb and retinoic acid receptor signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Walkley1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Walkley2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In both situations, the absence of such proteins resulted in the development of myeloproliferative diseases; interestingly, in the case of retinoid acid deficiency, transplanting total BM from TNF-&#x003b1; KO into retinoic acid receptor deficient mice protected these from myeloproliferative disease. The authors concluded that TNF-&#x003b1; is one of the mechanisms involved in BM malignant transformation, particularly in the case of myeloproliferative disease. The data shown in our present report demonstrates that TNF-&#x003b1; regulates BM cell turnover (apoptosis) induced by irradiation, conditioning the onset of BM dysfunction and secondary MDS-like phenotypes; moreover, our data also highlight a role for TNF-&#x003b1; in modelling the BM microenvironment, contributing towards the progression of secondary MDS.</p><p>Strategies to block TNF-&#x003b1; activity, seeking to neutralize its inflammatory role, have met some success in the treatment of epithelial cancers, and to a lesser extent also in subsets of patients with primary MDS, although with varying degrees of therapeutic benefit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Boula1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Maciejewski1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Leone1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that TNF-&#x003b1; is a key regulator of BM cell apoptosis provided the rationale for the use of TNF-&#x003b1; blockers in primary MDS. Anti-cytokine therapy (amifostine or pentoxifylline and ciprofloxacin with or without dexamethasone) have been administered to primary MDS patients and the ones with high BM TNF-&#x003b1; levels have a better chance of responding to such therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Reza1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008980-Raza1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.
