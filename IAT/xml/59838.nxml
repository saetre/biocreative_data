To determine if multiple protein isoforms are expressed in breast cancer, we utilized Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses, which revealed the expression of an nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein isoform in a subset of ER+ tumors.

It has been proposed that multiple, different cellular events dictate the biochemical changes that allow normal cells to become highly malignant. These key events require alterations in the expression of many genes, translation of RNA transcripts, and cellular activation by growth factors, hormones and proteins in the evolving tumor cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Steroid hormones play a vital role in the growth of normal mammary gland tissue, as well as, the development and progression of breast tumors. Human estrogen receptor alpha (hER&#x003b1;) is detected in 50&#x02013;85% of all breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and is utilized as a prognostic marker to identify patients who may have a favorable response to hormonal or endocrine manipulations. Thus, hER&#x003b1; provides a useful prognostic index in patients with metastatic disease and is associated with disease-free survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, 35% of all patients with hER&#x003b1; positive (ER+) tumors do not respond to hormonal interventions suggesting cellular and molecular alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>This lack of response may be attributed, at least in part, to the presence of nonfunctional hER&#x003b1; as determined by the inability of hER&#x003b1; to bind hormone, to recognize and bind to specific DNA-responsive elements and/or its inability to recruit other transcriptional activation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It may also be attributed to tumor heterogeneity in which some tumor cells may continue to express functional hER&#x003b1; while other cells may express either dysfunctional hER&#x003b1; or do not express hER&#x003b1; at all. This may permit the tumor to become autonomous with respect to hormone sensitivity, allowing tumor progression. Currently, human breast tumor hER&#x003b1; content is determined by ligand-binding assays or immunohistochemistry. While these techniques measure either hER&#x003b1; content or its cellular distribution, they do not provide the means for assessing hER&#x003b1; functionality.</p><p>In our search for new tumor markers, we identified and characterized a novel 55 kDa nuclear protein, termed nmt55 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The amino acid sequence of nmt55 was highly homologous, but not identical, to that reported for the nuclear protein p54<sup>nrb</sup> identified in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A more recent report by Peters et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] noted differences in the sequence of the reported HeLa cell p54<sup>nrb</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and placental p54<sup>nrb</sup>. When we compared the sequences of nmt55 and placental p54<sup>nrb</sup> (U. Muller, Personal Communication), we determined that the sequences were identical. The differences in the sequence for nmt55, placental p54<sup>nrb</sup> and HeLa p54<sup>nrb</sup> are most likely due to HeLa p54<sup>nrb</sup> sequencing error. Chromosomal location and sequence identity data confirm that p54<sup>nrb</sup> has the same sequence as nmt55 and are the same gene. We refer to this protein as nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup>.</p><p>Our studies on nmt55 and those of p54<sup>nrb</sup> have characterized this protein as an RNA binding protein with the ability to associate with Topoisomerase I and the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein associated splicing factor (PSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Further, we observed the association of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> with several splicing factors known to be essential for spliceosome formation suggesting a role for nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> in pre-mRNA splicing (unpublished results).</p><p>Our previous studies investigated the protein expression of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> in human breast tumors using a monoclonal antibody with an epitope localized to the carboxyl terminal domain of this protein. These studies demonstrated a statistically significant association between nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein expression, tumor hormonal phenotype and mean tumor size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Specifically, in tumors large in size or those tumors which were determined to be ER-, the expression of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein was absent, or greatly reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These results suggested that loss of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein expression may be related to hormone insensitivity, tumor differentiation state, unregulated tumor growth and metastases.</p><p>The absence or reduced expression of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> may be attributed to the regulation of mRNA expression, protein processing of a specific functional domain or the presence of a heterogeneous population of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> isoforms which may not be immunodetected by monoclonal antibody NMT-1. In this study, we compared mRNA levels in ER+ and ER- human breast tumors using Northern blot analysis and ribonuclease protection assay to assess if nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> is regulated at the transcription level. We further developed, nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> specific, site-directed polyclonal antibodies to the amino terminal region and to a mid-region to assess the potential presence of multiple nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> isoforms or processed nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> in human breast tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Isotopes, reagents and chemicals</title><p>[2,4,6,7-<sup>3</sup>H] Oestradiol ([<sup>3</sup>H] E<sub>2</sub>) (102 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham (Arlington Heights, IL). &#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P CTP (800 Ci/mmol) and &#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from New England Nuclear (Boston, Ma).

Since loss of hER&#x003b1; expression is associated with poor prognosis and continued expression of hER&#x003b1; is associated with disease-free survival and correlates well with tumor differentiation state, we wanted to investigate the regulation of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> expression. To test the possibility that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> may be transcriptionally downregulated in ER- tumors, we analyzed mRNA levels from a series of human breast tumors utilizing Northern blot analyses and ribonuclease protection assays.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows Northern blot analysis of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA expression in 12 human breast tumors. MCF-7 cells (Lane M), used as a control, express an abundant 2.6 kb mRNA transcript for nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup>. nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> transcripts were detected at varying levels in both ER+ and ER- tumors. mRNA transcript was expressed at high levels (lanes 2, 3, 5, 9, 11 and 12) moderate levels (lanes 2, 7 and 10) or low levels (lanes 1, 4 and 8). The tumor sample in lane 6 was degraded and was not analyzed further. These different nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA levels were not due to differential RNA loading, as GAPDH levels were similar in all tumor samples. These results suggest that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA transcripts are expressed at various levels. It also suggested that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein expression in some breast tumors does not correlate with nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA expression. Specifically, the decreased nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein expression observed in ER- human breast tumors may not be attributed to transcriptional regulation of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA since mRNA expression in ER- tumors is not universally decreased.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Northern blot analysis of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells and ER+/ER- Human Breast tumors.

This was expected since the nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> probe utilized for detection is of human origin and calf uterus tissue expresses a different transcript for nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup>. This prevents high fidelity hybridization between the probe and the mRNA allowing complete mRNA probe digestion. Based on the data presented in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, it appears that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA is expressed independent of tumor hormonal status suggesting that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA is not regulated by hER&#x003b1;. These results, together with those reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], further suggest that decreased expression of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein in ER- human breast tumors is likely a post-transcriptional event.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Ribonuclease protection assay of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells and ER+/ER- Human Breast tumors.

This necessitated the development of domain specific antibodies. To this end, two peptides were synthesized and purified based on selected sequences in the subdomains of human nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). These selected peptides were referred to as NMT-4 and NMT-5 and represent sequences 56&#x02013;72 and 371&#x02013;386 of human nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup>, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Polyclonal antibodies were developed against these peptides; polyclonal antibody NMT-4 recognized a sequence in the amino terminal region of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> and polyclonal antibody NMT-5 recognized a sequence in a mid-region of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows the binding of polyclonal antibodies NMT-4 and NMT-5 to a protein with an estimated molecular weight of 55 kDa (lanes 3 and 5 respectively). Pre-immune sera detected no specific protein in the 55 kDa range (lanes 1 and 2). Specificity of the polyclonal antibodies was assessed by pre-incubation with the appropriate immunogenic free peptides. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> (lanes 4 and 6), the antigenic peptides competed effectively for the binding of the antibodies to the protein indicating that these antibodies are specific. Complete displacement was not seen in Lane 6 which was due to high titer of the antibody. Incubation of NMT-5 antibody with a higher concentration of free immunogenic NMT-5 peptide resulted in complete displacement (results not shown). These results indicate that the anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies, NMT-4 and NMT-5, detect this 55 kDa protein with high specificity and high affinity.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Assessment of NMT-4 and NMT-5 polyclonal antibody specificity for nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup>.

Since monoclonal antibody NMT-1 is specific for nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the results suggest that polyclonal antibodies NMT-4 and NMT-5 are specific to nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> and do not detect related RNA binding proteins. nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein was not detected in the anti-hER&#x003b1; monoclonal antibody EVG F9 immunoprecipitation sample (negative control).

These results have been reproduced in the nuclear extracts of approximately forty human breast tumors suggesting that there is an alteration or modification in the amino terminal domain of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> that prevents polyclonal antibody NMT-4 from binding to nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup>protein.

Similar results have been observed in sixteen different human breast tumor tissue sections.

The nature of the alteration or modification in the amino-terminal region of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup>, which prevents the detection of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> by polyclonal antibody NMT-4 by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses, remains to be determined.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Immunohistochemical Analyses of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor and nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> in a Human Breast Tumor.

It is possible that decreased nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> expression represents poor tumor differentiation, increased tumor growth and metastases since reduced or absent hER&#x003b1; expression and function correlates with poor tumor differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and tumor size is a strong indicator of tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Here we investigated nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> mRNA expression using Northern blot analyses and ribonuclease protection assays to determine if the reduction of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein expression was the result of transcriptional regulation. mRNA transcripts for nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> showed similar expression in human breast tumors and were not related to hER&#x003b1; expression. These results suggest that the regulation of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein expression observed in human breast tumors is likely a post-transcriptional event.</p><p>Results from Western blot analyses with polyclonal antibodies NMT-4 and NMT-5 showed that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> expression was absent, or greatly reduced, in most of ER- tumors. This confirmed the previous observations obtained with monoclonal antibody NMT-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Data also showed that a subset of ER+ tumors expressed nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein detectable with polyclonal antibody NMT-5 and monoclonal antibody NMT-1 but not polyclonal antibody NMT-4. These results suggested the presence of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> variants in a subset of ER+ human breast tumors. The inability of polyclonal antibody NMT-4 to detect nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> in some ER+ tumors may be attributed to proteolysis during nuclear extraction and analyses or biochemical modification of functionally distinct isoform. While the altered molecular weight of the protein sample shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, lane 9 may be attributed to proteolysis, most of the protein samples in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> displayed a similar estimated molecular weight of 55 kDa. Thus, the lack of nmt55/p54nrb protein detection in this study is most likely not due to proteolysis. We also wanted to determine if nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> variants detected with polyclonal antibody NMT-5 and monoclonal antibody NMT-1 but not polyclonal antibody NMT-4 using nuclear extracts and Western blot analyses were also detectable in intact cells. To test this premise, we utilized immunohistochemistry to detect nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein in human breast tumor tissue sections. The data from immunohistochemistry confirmed the results obtained by Western blot analyses, which suggested that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein was expressed in various isoforms in a subset of ER+ human breast tumors. These potential isoforms may have altered biological function due to the loss of domain specific interactions. We have attempted to ascertain the presence and nature of these isoforms by utilizing mixing experiments; however, these experiments have proved inconclusive. The expression and role of this isoform in human breast cancer remains to be determined.</p><p>A plausible explanation for the lack of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein detection with polyclonal antibody NMT-4 is a point mutation in the epitope for polyclonal antibody NMT-4, a post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation, in or near this epitope or an alternative splice variant affecting this epitope. Another possibility is the methylation of arginine residues; although this would not alter the overall charge of the protein, it could sterically hinder the protein/antibody interaction. The methylation of arginine residues has been shown to take place in other pre-mRNA splicing proteins though the role of this modification is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. One approach to determine the presence of a point mutation or a splice variant is to perform PCR coupled with sequencing techniques. Another approach to resolve this issue is to analyze this protein isoform by Mass Spectroscopy. These studies are currently under investigation.</p><p>In this report, we show that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein is expressed in a variant isoform in a subset of ER+ tumors. These data, along with our previous observations, suggest that the association of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> and hER&#x003b1; expression represents three separate human breast tumor phenotypes. The first phenotype represents tumors that express wild type nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> and are ER+. These tumors may be classified as low grade or early stage tumors and respond well to endocrine manipulations. The second phenotype is identified as ER+ using Western blot or immunohistochemical analyses and would express the amino terminal altered/modified nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> isoform. This may represent mid-grade and mid-stage tumors which are very heterogeneous. It would be of interest to determine if these tumors express nonfunctional hER&#x003b1; and, as a result, do not respond to hormonal therapy. Finally, the third phenotype represents tumors that do not express hER&#x003b1; and nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup>. These tumors would most likely be highly proliferative, classified as high grade and late stage, hormone insensitive and potentially metastatic. While the focus of this study has been the biochemical relationship between nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> and tumor hormonal status, a more expansive study correlating nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein expression with various breast tumor clinicopathological characteristics may provide additional key information. These studies are under investigation.</p><p>Our data suggests that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> may be critical to cell growth and function, such that, decreased nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> expression in ER- human breast tumors or the expression of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> variants in ER+ tumors may indicate loss of normal growth, nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> has been shown in several studies to bind RNA and interact with PSF and Topoisomerase I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Those results along with our observations that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> associates with several splicing factors essential for spliceosome formation (unpublished) and relates to tumor hormonal status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] suggest that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> may be involved in pre-mRNA processing. Thus, loss of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein or the expression of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> protein variants in tumor cells may result in the loss of hER&#x003b1; expression, the expression of nonfunctional hER&#x003b1; or the altered expression other critical cell growth factors due to lack of proper pre-mRNA splicing.</p><p>Specifically, the role of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> as a splicing factor may affect hER&#x003b1; structure and function. The progression of breast cancer may be associated with changes in RNA processing and the production of aberrantly spliced mRNAs, which may result in non-functional gene products or the loss of specific gene expression. It has been proposed that loss of hER&#x003b1; expression in breast tumors is the result of aberrant RNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. These aberrantly spliced mRNAs, if translated, could lead to truncated receptors with hormone binding but not DNA binding function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Further, there is evidence for the role of RNA processing in oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Many studies, including those on human hnRNP A2/B1 and the CD44 gene, suggest that high fidelity pre-mRNA splicing is critical to normal cellular function and may play a key role in oncogenesis and breast cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The strong association between nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> and hER&#x003b1; expression indicates that nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> may be an important marker for breast cancer progression. The decreased or altered expression of nmt55/p54<sup>nrb</sup> may be related to tumor differentiation, unregulated tumor cell growth and metastases and may explain tumor heterogeneity, especially with respect to hormonal interventions in the course of treatment. Although an RNA splicing protein, hnRNP A2/B1, has been used as a tumor marker in lung cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], this is the first time that a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing has been implicated in breast cancer progression and may represent an important breast tumor marker. Further studies are necessary to determine a functional link between this RNA binding protein and hER&#x003b1; in human breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-publication history</title><p>The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/1/15/prepub"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command under DAMD 17&#x02013;98&#x02013;1&#x02013;8035.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>MN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cellular and molecular aspects of the multistage progression of mammary carcinogenesis in humans and rats.</article-title><source>Semin Cancer Biol</source><year>1993</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>161</fpage><lpage>169</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8318692</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dickson</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Lippman</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Growth factors in breast cancer.</article-title><source>Endocr Rev</source><year>1995</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>559</fpage><lpage>589</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8529572</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tumor suppressor genes.</article-title><source>Science</source><year>1991</year><volume>254</volume><fpage>1138</fpage><lpage>1146</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1659741</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The molecular basis of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.</article-title><source>Ann N Y Acad Sci</source><year>1995</year><volume>758</volume><fpage>331</fpage><lpage>338</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7625701</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hanahan</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The hallmarks of cancer.</article-title><source>Cell</source><year>2000</year><volume>100</volume><fpage>57</fpage><lpage>70</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10647931</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B6"><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McGuire</surname><given-names>WL</given-names></name><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>OH</given-names></name><name><surname>Segaloff</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Predicting hormone responsiveness in human breast cancer.</article-title><source>Estrogen Receptors in Breast Cancer pp. 17&#x02013;30.
