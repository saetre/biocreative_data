Two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and A/J, have marked differences in susceptibility to obesity, atherosclerosis, and vessel remodeling. However, it is unclear how these diverse genetic backgrounds influence pathways known to regulate thrombosis and hemostasis. The objective of this study was to evaluate thrombosis and hemostasis in these two inbred strains and determine the phenotypic response of A/J chromosomes in the C57BL/6J background.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A/J and C57Bl/6J mice were evaluated for differences in thrombosis and hemostasis. A thrombus was induced in the carotid artery by application of the exposed carotid to ferric chloride and blood flow measured until the vessel occluded. Bleeding and rebleeding times, as surrogate markers for thrombosis and hemostasis, were determined after clipping the tail and placing in warm saline. Twenty-one chromosome substitution strains, A/J chromosomes in a C57BL/6J background, were screened for response to the tail bleeding assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thrombus occlusion time was markedly decreased in the A/J mice compared to C57BL/6J mice. Tail bleeding time was similar in the two strains, but rebleeding time was markedly increased in the A/J mice compared to C57BL/6J mice. Coagulation times and tail morphology were similar, but tail collagen content was higher in A/J than C57BL/6J mice. Three chromosome substitution strains, B6-Chr5<sup>A/J</sup>, B6-Chr11<sup>A/J</sup>, and B6-Chr17<sup>A/J</sup>, were identified with increased rebleeding time, a phenotype similar to A/J mice. Mice heterosomic for chromosomes 5 or 17 had rebleeding times similar to C57BL/6J mice, but when these two chromosome substitution strains, B6-Chr5<sup>A/J </sup>and B6-Chr17<sup>A/J</sup>, were crossed, the A/J phenotype was restored in these doubly heterosomic progeny.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results indicate that susceptibility to arterial thrombosis and haemostasis is remarkably different in C57BL/and A/J mice. Three A/J chromosome substitution strains were identified that expressed a phenotype similar to A/J for rebleeding, the C57Bl/6J background could modify the A/J phenotype, and the combination of two A/J QTL could restore the phenotype. The diverse genetic backgrounds and differences in response to vascular injury induced thrombosis and the tail bleeding assay, suggest the potential for identifying novel genetic determinants of thrombotic risk.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Family history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] is the strongest risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While a number of genetic mutations have been identified, these account for only a small percentage of the CVD in human populations. Thrombus formation on fissured atherosclerotic plaques is the precipitating event in the transition from a stable or subclinical atherosclerotic disease and leads to acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or peripheral arterial occlusion. Arterial and venous thrombosis are complex responses and are influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Polymorphisms and mutations in coagulation factors, fibrinolytic factors, platelet surface receptors, methylenetetrahydrofalate reductase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and antioxidant enzymes have been implicated as genetic determinants of susceptibility to thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Great strides have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of thrombosis in the last decade. However, strategies to prevent thrombosis have lagged far behind due, in part, to the contribution of multiple, and as yet undefined, genetic factors that lead to thrombotic risk. Moreover, it remains unclear how genetic background influences the function of molecules and pathways known to regulate thrombus formation and lysis and, thereby, contributes to the risk of thrombotic disease.</p><p>Many of the available inbred mouse strains, such as C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J, have been classified as resistant or susceptible to particular complex diseases (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These two strains have diverse responses to diet-induced obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] (B6 susceptible; A/J resistant), diet-induced atherosclerosis (B6 susceptible; A/J resistant) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], arterial ligation-induced neointimal hyperplasia (B6 resistant; A/J resistant), and ligation induced vessel remodeling (B6 resistant; A/J susceptible) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These conditions are predisposing to thrombosis per se, but these mice have not been systematically evaluated for thrombosis. Clot formation and lysis, which ultimately determine thrombosis, requires platelet aggregation, coagulation, and fibrinolytic functions. Interactions among these pathways may occur and additional factors may modulate these processes. Identification of novel modulators and factors of these pathways can be identified by associating the phenotype with a location(s) on a specific chromosome, a quantitative trait locus (QTL).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Identification of mice susceptible or resistant to obesity, atherosclerosis, and vascular injury</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Mouse Strain/Genotype</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Diet-induced Obesity</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Diet-induced Atherosclerosis</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Neointimal Hyperplasia</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Vessel Remodeling</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">C57BL/6J (B6)</td><td align="center">S [8]</td><td align="center">S [9]</td><td align="center">R [10]</td><td align="center">R [10]</td></tr><tr><td align="center">A/J</td><td align="center">R [8]</td><td align="center">R [9]</td><td align="center">R [10]</td><td align="center">S [10]</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Lep<sup>ob</sup></td><td align="center">S [41]</td><td align="center">S [42]</td><td align="center">R [43]</td><td align="center">R [43]</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Plg-/-</td><td align="center">R [44]</td><td align="center">S (apoE-/-) [45]<break/>R (transplant) [46]</td><td align="center">R [47,48]</td><td align="center">R [48]</td></tr><tr><td align="center">PAI-1-/-</td><td align="center">S [18]</td><td align="center">R [49,50]</td><td align="center">R [50]</td><td align="center">R [50]</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>R: resistant; S: susceptible.

Genetic markers were used to identify homozygosity in the background (B6) and the individual A/J chromosome. These strains have one chromosome from A/J mice in a B6 background. This allows the identification of a trait in one or more CSS and implies that at least one QTL resides on this chromosome. Use of this panel requires fewer mice to determine the QTL than does a genome-wide scan. Another advantage is the ability for detection of QTL in the presence of other QTL. In addition, initial screens with the CSS simplify the fine-mapping of QTL. Several studies of this CSS panel, B6 Chr1-19, X, Y<sup>A/J</sup>, have been reported for behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], sterols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and plasma amino acids levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and have identified many more QTL than studies of the same traits using a genome-wide scan.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the two inbred strains of mice for prothrombotic risk, utilizing a ferric chloride vascular injury model, tail bleeding assay, and measures of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The results of this study indicate that the two inbred strains, B6 and A/J mice, have diverse prothrombotic phenotypes, unrelated to coagulation or platelet aggregation. In addition, in the CSS, expression of the A/J phenotypes, rebleeding time and arterial occlusion, was modified in the B6 background, and suggested that interactions occurred among the A/J QTL. Thus, it should be possible to identify independent genetic determinants of susceptibility to pathological haemostasis and thrombosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>The inbred strains, B6 (#000664), Lep<sup>ob </sup>(#000632), A/J (#000646) and gene-targeted plasminogen (Plg) activator inhibitor deficient mice (PAI-1-/-) (#002507) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] mice in a B6 background were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) at 6 wks-of-age. The Plg-/- mice were generated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and maintained in the B6 background, generated by crossing mice from the original mixed (B6:129) background for eight generations with B6 mice. The Plg-/- mice do not reproduce well and Plg heterozygous pairs were used for breeding. Genotypes (Plg+/+, Plg+/-, Plg-/-) of the offspring were determined by a PCR assay at 3&#x02013;4 weeks-of-age from an ear punch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Breeding pairs of the CSS mice were transferred from Dr. Nadeau's laboratory. All mice were housed and bred in the Biological Resource Unit at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF). Mice were housed in sterilized isolator cages, maintained on a 14 hr light/10 hr dark cycle, and were provided sterilized food and water ad libitum. Mice were fed a standard autoclavable laboratory diet consisting of: 23% protein, 4.5% fat, 6% fiber, (Purina, St. Louis, MO), and tested between 7 and 9 wks-of-age. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at CCF.</p></sec><sec><title>Vascular injury</title><p>To induce thrombosis formation in the carotid artery, a ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>) model of vessel injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] was employed. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (80 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg), a midline cervical incision was made and the left common carotid artery isolated by blunt dissection. The flow probe (Transonic Systems, model 0.5PSB) was placed under the artery and when a stable baseline was reached, a 0.5 &#x000d7; 2 mm strip of filter paper saturated with 10% FeCl<sub>3 </sub>solution was applied to the surface of the carotid artery for 3 min. Occlusion time was determined from the addition of the FeCl<sub>3 </sub>solution to the occlusion of the artery (minimum blood flow). The flow probe was in place from the establishment of the baseline until several min after the stable occlusion had been reached or stopped at 30 min if it had not occluded. Blood flow was recorded every 10 sec (Transonic Systems, model TS420). There was no difference in body weight among the mice that were tested in the vascular injury model.</p></sec><sec><title>Bleeding and rebleeding assay</title><p>For the tail bleeding assay, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (80 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg), the tail prewarmed for 5 min in 10 mL of saline at 37&#x000b0;C in a water bath. The tail was lifted from the saline and a 5 mm tail segment amputated and immediately returned to the saline. Bleeding time was measured as the time between the start of bleeding to cessation of bleeding. With the tail remaining in the same saline solution, the rebleeding time was measured from the time between bleeding cessation and the start of the second bleeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Coagulation, Plg, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin, fibrinogen, fibrinolytic and PAI-1 assays</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane (Abbott), bled from the orbital sinus into uncoated capillary tubes, and a drop of blood immediately placed on a reagent strip (Synbiotics) for prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) determinations and inserted into the precalibrated Coagulation Analyzer (SCA2000, Synbiotics). PAI-1 activity was determined according to the method of Chandler <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

Plg was determined with a chromogenic assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the fibrinolytic activity determined by fibrin degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. For the negative controls in these assays, plasma from PAI-1 or Plg deficient mice was used. Functionally active mouse &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin was determined with a plasmin capture assay and detection with a mouse antibody (Molecular Innovations, Southfield, MI), and fibrinogen with an ELISA assay with antibodies that recognize mouse fibrinogen (Hyphen BioMed, France).</p></sec><sec><title>Histochemical and immunohistochemistry analysis</title><p>The frozen tails or injured carotids in OCT were sectioned at 5 &#x003bc;m thickness and stained with Masson's Trichrome (HT 15, Sigma Diagnostics).

No difference in migration for immunostained Plg under these conditions was observed (data not shown). The density of the Western blot from SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions of plasma of varying volumes from B6 and A/J mice was compared and the density of the bands was 56% higher in the A/J than the B6 mice (six individual mice were tested on at least two occasions) from the same amount of plasma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

Arterial occlusion time, tail bleeding and rebleeding time were evaluated as potential predictors of thrombotic response. Assessments of the two inbred strains were compared to values from gene targeted mice of the Plg network with altered fibrinolytic responses, as well as in leptin deficient mice with a reduced platelet function. Marked differences were found in the thrombotic response among the two inbred strains, B6 and A/J, and the observed differences were not correlated with change in coagulation or platelet function. Screening the CSS identified three chromosomes that harbored genes which contributed to the A/J phenotype of increased rebleeding time. Mice homosomic for these chromosomes or doubly heterosomic for two of the chromosomes, 5 and 17, were required to express the A/J phenotype, elevated rebleeding time. PAI-1 antigen and activity were decreased in both CSS-5 and CSS-17 and the heterosomic mice, CSS-5F1 and CSS-17F1, but not in the CSS-11 strain. Values were restored in the doubly heterosomic for two of chromosomes, 5 and 17. Arterial occlusion time was similar to B6 in the CSS-5 and CSS-17 homozygous strains, but increased in doubly heterosomic for two of chromosomes, 5 and 17.</p><p>The FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced model of vascular injury and thrombosis in mice is now widely used to evaluate genetic and pharmacological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The two inbred strains had marked differences in the time for occlusion of the carotid artery after FeCl<sub>3 </sub>injury. After FeCl<sub>3 </sub>treatment, thrombus formation and occlusion was remarkably shortened in the A/J mice compared to the B6 mice. These results have not previously been reported. A recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] of sheer stress in rats, found that the magnitude of changes in sheer stress with increased blood flow varied with the different strains. Further investigation, beyond the scope of this study would be necessary to determine the contribution in the differences in size and sheer stress of the carotids to arterial occlusion rates in the B6 and A/J mice. In preliminary studies, we have noted differences in the composition of the thrombus in B6 and A/J mice. The pattern of blood flow cessation for the two inbred strains was different than for the Lep<sup>ob </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] with impaired platelet function, and coagulation time was similar in the two strains. In the mice with deficiencies of the Plg network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], thrombus formation time was reduced in the Plg-/- mice, but increased in the PAI-/- mice, suggesting that alterations in plasmin activity that affect the rate of clot lysis, can modulate the events leading to occlusive thrombus formation.</p><p>The tail-bleeding assay has been used extensively in mice to assess the impact of deficiencies and over expression of platelet and coagulation proteins in mice. Sweeny <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] screened 25 strains of mice and found only the RIIS/J mice to have increased bleeding time due to reduced von Willebrand antigen. Broze <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] evaluated mice with gene deletions of the coagulation pathway and found that while bleeding time was not increased, rebleeding persisted despite electrocautery of the tail in FVIII and FIX deficient mice. This observation raised the possibility that rebleeding time may be a sensitive reporter of genetic influences on thrombus formation and stability. Mice that are deficient in factors required for normal platelet function, platelet glycoprotein Ib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and protease-activated receptor-4, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] have increased tail bleeding time. The leptin deficiency with reduced platelet aggregation clearly shows a marked increase in bleeding time and the increased bleeding time in Plg-/- and uPA-/- mice suggests that Plg and uPA may exert an influence on platelet response to promote normal thrombus formation. Overall, the marked increase in rebleeding times observed in certain mouse strains suggests genetic factors other than coagulation may play a role in the stability of a thrombus.</p><p>In the tail bleeding assay, A/J mice did not have changes in bleeding time, but rebleeding time was higher compared to B6 mice. In our study, Plg-/- mice had increased bleeding time, PAI-1-/- had decreased rebleeding time, and uPA-/- mice had an increased bleeding time similar to the Plg-/- mice (J. Hoover-Plow, A. Shchurin, and E. Hart, unpublished results). Increased bleeding or rebleeding times have not been reported in any of the Plg network targeted mice. Matsuno <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] reported no difference in bleeding time for tPA-/-, uPA-/-, PAI-1-/- mice compared to WT mice, and the assay was similar, but the tail clip segment was considerably shorter and bleeding times reduced compared to the times reported in our study. Bleeding time has not been previously reported for Plg-/- mice. We have found similar values for Plg-/- mice in a 50%B6:50%129 background (J. Hoover-Plow, A. Shchurin, and E. Hart, unpublished results). The results of this study suggest that not only is bleeding time genetically determined by background, but also that tail rebleeding time is genetically determined.</p><p>While blood pressure could conceivably be higher in mice with elevated tail bleeding time, several studies suggest that this is not the case. Studies of A/J [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] mice have reported either decreased blood pressure or no difference compared to the B6 mice. Blood pressure was measured in the Plg-/- mice (D. Hellard, J. Hoover-Plow, and E. Plow, unpublished results), and these mice have reduced blood pressure when compared to WT littermates, and uPA-/- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and Lep<sup>ob </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] mice also have reduced blood pressure, but there is no correspondence between blood pressure and tail bleeding or rebleeding times. Morphometric analysis of the tail indicated a difference in the collagen content of the tail in the A/J mice. Differences in the structure and/or metabolism of collagen or extracellular matrix proteins may contribute to the increased rebleeding and reduced occlusion time in the A/J mice and warrant further investigation.</p><p>The genes for Plg, PAI-1, and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin reside on the three chromosomes identified for QTL for rebleeding time and may or may not be coincidental to the observed phenotypes found in the A/J mice and CSS. It is not likely that merely the concentration of these components explains the increased rebleeding time and reduced arterial occlusion time in the A/J mice. When compared to the B6 mice, the A/J mice and the three strains with elevated rebleeding time had variable Plg, PAI-1, and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin. Two allelic forms of the mouse Plg gene have been reported for B6 and A/J mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Plg concentration was increased in A/J mice compared to B6 mice. Although we did not detect differences in Plg structure, this would not exclude possible functional differences. A congenic strain (specific for a homosomic region from A/J and the remaining Chr and background is from B6 mice) of A/J chromosome 17 that includes the Plg gene was tested in the bleeding assay. Values for bleeding and rebleeding in this congenic strain were similar to values from B6 mice, indicating that the QTL is not Plg. There are genes for other proteases and matrix proteins that reside on chromosome 17 in addition to unknown genes. DNA base pair sequence data for the PAI-1 gene or the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-antiplasmin gene in B6 and A/J mice have reported no differences [51], but regulatory genes upstream of the coding region may be important. Our results suggest that novel or unknown genes may interact with the Plg system components to modify their function.</p><p>In summary, this study reports marked differences in two inbred strains of mice, B6 and A/J, in arterial thrombosis formation in a FeCl<sub>3 </sub>vascular injury model, rebleeding time in a tail bleeding assay, plasminogen function, and tissue and vessel collagen deposition. Three chromosomes from A/J mice were identified that had QTL for rebleeding time. The genes may interact with components in the Plg network and modulate arterial occlusion time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The marked independent differences demonstrated in the B6 and A/J mice can be exploited to identify genetic determinants of thrombosis and haemostasis. Our results of the CSS screening suggest that novel or unknown genes can be used to identify the genes responsible for the traits related to arterial thrombosis, tail bleeding/rebleeding and vessel extracellular matrix. Identification of differences in the parent strains, such as those described in this study, and screening of the CSS is a first-step in the discovery of new genetic determinants of thrombotic risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>B6 = C57BL/6J</p><p>CSS = chromosome substitution strains</p><p>CSS-# = B6-Chr #<sup>A/J</sup></p><p>CSS-#F1 = (B6 &#x000d7; CSS-#)F1</p><p>WT = wild-type</p><p>-/- = deficient</p><p>Plg = plasminogen</p><p>PAI-1 = plasminogen activator inhibitor-1</p><p>tPA = tissue plasminogen activator</p><p>uPA = urokinase plasminogen activator</p><p>SEM = standard error of the mean</p><p>QTL = quantitative trait locus</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JHP conceived and designed the study, coordinated the experiments and drafted the manuscript.
