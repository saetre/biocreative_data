The mature TolC protein comprises 467 amino acid residues, and, as previously reported (1), a signal sequence of 22 amino acid residues is attached to the N-terminus. The C-terminus of the gene is followed by a stem-loop structure (8 base pair stem, 4 base loop) which may be a rho-independent termination signal. The codon usage of the gene is nonrandom; the major isoaccepting species of tRNA are preferentially utilised, or, among synonomous codons recognized by the same tRNA, those codons are used which can interact better with the anticodon (2,3). In contrast to the codon usage for other outer membrane proteins of E. coli (4) the rare arginine codons AGA and AGG are used once and twice respectively.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0335.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6487"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0336.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6488"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0337.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6489"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0338.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6490"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0339.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6491"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0340.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6492"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0341.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6493"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0342.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6494"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0343.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6495"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
