It employs a number of efficient defense mechanisms to eliminate airborne pathogens encountered in breathing, including the specific innate and adaptive immune responses, which represent a dynamic interaction of host and pathogen. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important antigenic component of Gram-negative bacteria, and is a potent stimulus to local and systemic immune responses. The human receptor for LPS is Toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>TLRs are a family of pattern recognition receptors whose pivotal importance in orchestrating the innate immune response is widely accepted. Binding of ligand activates a signaling cascade involving TRAF6, IKKs and I-&#x003ba;Bs, culminating in NF-&#x003ba;B translocation to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B regulates the inducible expression of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and acute phase proteins which activate cellular immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. TLR signaling pathways arise from intracytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains, which are conserved among TLRs and TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins such as MyD88, Mal/TIRAP and TRIF/TICAM-1. These adaptor proteins confer specificity on TLR signaling, with Mal specifically involved in MyD88-dependent signaling via TLR2 and TLR4, and TRIF in the MyD88-independent TLR3- and TLR4- signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]</p><p>The mammalian innate immune system produces a variety of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) as part of its host defense repertoire. The defensins are a broadly dispersed group of AMPs, and are classified according to their molecular structure into three distinct families: the &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- and the &#x003b8;-defensins. Unlike &#x003b1;-defensins, which are produced mainly by neutrophils, &#x003b2;-defensins are produced directly by epithelial cells, and combat infection both through direct microbicidal action and by modulation of cell-mediated immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To date, four human &#x003b2;-defensins (HBD) have been identified (HBD1-4), although genomic studies suggest more have yet to be discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In contrast to HBD1, which is constitutively and stably expressed, HBD2 expression is induced in response to infective stimuli, including Gram-negative and, less potently, Gram-positive bacteria or their components or to proinflammatory stimuli including tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) and interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Like other defensins, HBD2 has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, displaying potent microbicidal activity against many Gram-negative bacteria and less potent bacteriostatic activity against Gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has recently been demonstrated that activation of TLR2 by bacterial lipoprotein results in up regulation of HBD2 in tracheobronchial epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. LPS and Gram-negative bacteria such as mucoid <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>are a more potent stimulus for HBD2 production, which in turn has anti-bacterial activity predominantly against Gram-negative bacteria. Colonisation and infection due to Gram-negative bacteria are important in many pulmonary diseases including severe COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and Cystic Fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Production of HBD2 by respiratory epithelium is an important component of host defense against Gram-negative organisms, and understanding of the signaling pathways involved may further our understanding of and guide future therapeutic strategies in these diseases.</p><p>Cultured intestinal epithelial cells have been shown to produce HBD2 in response to LPS following transfection with TLR4 and MD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although CD-14 is known to be critical to LPS-induced HBD2 production in airway epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the role of TLR4 in transcriptional regulation of HBD2 in respiratory epithelium has not been established. Indeed, the importance of the respiratory epithelium in the innate immune response to LPS has been called into question by some recent publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this study we demonstrate TLR4 expression in A549 pulmonary epithelial cells and production of HBD2 in response to LPS. We examine the effect of modulation of TLR4 by receptor blockade and expression of a dominant negative TLR4 construct on induced expression of HBD2. We show that LPS-unresponsive HEK293 cells can produce HBD2 in response to LPS following transfection with TLR4 and MD2 transgenes and demonstrate that the adaptor proteins MyD88 and Mal are involved in transcriptional regulation of HBD2 in response to LPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>The human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, (ECACC-85120602) was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures.

Here we provide evidence for a critical role for TLR4 in LPS-induced HBD2 expression in airway epithelial cells. The data show that A549 cells respond to LPS with increased HBD2 gene and protein expression and that these effects can be blocked by a TLR4 neutralizing antibody or transfection with functionally inactive TLR4, MyD88 or Mal transgenes. We further implicate TLR4 in LPS-induced HBD2 expression by demonstrating that expression of functional TLR4 and MD2 (a co-factor which is unique to and necessary for TLR4 activity) in HEK293 cells confers LPS responsiveness to these cells, which can lead to HBD2 induction.</p><p>There is some discrepancy in the literature regarding surface expression of TLR4 in A549 cells. Guillot and colleagues reported that TLR4 is not expressed on the surface of A549 cells, but is compartmentalized to the intracellular compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], while Monick et al. demonstrated low level surface expression on the same cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our data showed low-level surface expression of TLR4 by LSC, and TLR4 was also detectable in membrane fractions by Western blotting. Further evidence of surface expression comes from the ability to block the receptor with anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody. Surface expression of TLR4 has been demonstrated on other respiratory epithelial cells including human bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and human airway cells in primary culture, where it was found in a more basolateral distribution. The findings of higher levels of TLR4 in the cytoplasmic fraction is also relevant, as internalisation of LPS in A549 cells has been reported as early as 4 hours after LPS challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and this internalisation modulated expression of ICAM-1 and TNF. It remains unclear whether LPS-TLR4 co-localisation intracellularly activates the same signalling cascade as at the cell membrane.</p><p>Similar controversy exists regarding the LPS responsiveness of A549 cells. Previous studies have suggested that A549 cells were hyporesponsive to LPS, at doses of up to 100 &#x003bc;g/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This was not the case in our study. A549 cells responded to 10 &#x003bc;g/ml LPS with significant up regulation of both HBD2 and IL-8. One potential reason for this difference is the type of LPS used. Previous studies used <italic>E. coli </italic>LPS. <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>is an important respiratory pathogen, particularly in patients with lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. <italic>E. coli</italic>, in contrast, is more important in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract, and as an important cause of septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Mucoid strains of <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>have been demonstrated to induce HBD2 in respiratory epithelia including A549 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For these reasons, we used <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>LPS in our study. CD-14 is a glycoprotein which, together with TLR4 and LPS Binding Protein (LBP), forms the LPS signaling complex, and exists in membrane bound and soluble (in serum) forms. Soluble CD14 is required for LPS signaling in A549 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and it is therefore important that LPS stimulation is performed in the presence of serum, as in our study.</p><p>Different types of LPS differ in their ability to stimulate cells. Structural differences in LPS, most commonly in the <italic>O</italic>-polysaccharide chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], may result in different biological properties. <italic>E. coli </italic>LPS is highly toxic in its ability to propagate the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, principally through activation of monocytes. <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>LPS differs from <italic>E. coli </italic>LPS both in the <italic>O</italic>-polysaccharide side chain and in the Lipid A component, and stimulates significantly less endotoxic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], but induces sustained airway inflammation in a number of chronic lung diseases including CF and diffuse panbronchiolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>LPS has been shown to be significantly more potent than LPS from a number of different strains of <italic>E. coli </italic>in its ability to stimulate IL-8 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) from respiratory epithelial cells, including A549 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The reason for this is not clear, but structural differences may determine its processing by the TLR4/MD2 complex, either directly or through its interaction with the host plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Basolateral expression of TLR4 has been reported in pulmonary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and this is particularly interesting given that <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>elastase has been shown to increase epithelial permeability by its effect on tight junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], thereby potentially increasing access of <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>LPS to the basally expressed TLR4.</p><p>Previous work by Becker et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] in primary human tracheobroncial cells shows a clear increase in HBD2 protein in response to LPS by western blotting, although another recent study in primary airway epithelial cells reports low expression of MD2 limiting LPS responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. MD2 was induced in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], while MD2 expression in A549 cells is enhanced along with TLR4 following infection with RSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. While differences speak to the limitations of using a cultured cell model, as well as to the variable responses of cultured primary cells, they also reinforce the critical importance of both TLR4 and MD2 in the signalling pathway. A549 cells clearly expressed MD2 and TLR4 and responded to Pseudomonas LPS in our hands. LPS stimulation resulted in a 5-fold increase in HBD2 promoter linked activity. The increase in HBD2 protein, though statistically significant, was small in absolute terms raising questions regarding the physiological significance of LPS-induced epithelial derived HBD2 production.</p><p>Indirect activation of epithelial cells by proinflammatory cytokines released by stimulated alveolar macrophages may be more important at lower concentrations of LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], while direct stimulation of the epithelial cells may become important when bacterial load is high, where TLR4 and MD2 expression is enhanced, or following internalisation of LPS. The kinetics of the epithelial response in this and other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] may also be relevant, with direct stimulation of the epithelial cells providing a slower but potentially more sustained release of HBD2 than that induced by inflammatory mediators. Indeed, recent studies of cellular cross-talk between epithelial cells and mononuclear cells suggests co-localisation of these cells may result in a more pronounced immune response <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Further work using primary cell culture and co-culture with immune cells mimicking physiologic conditions is required to clarify the relative contributions of these cells to HBD2 production <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The mechanism by which LPS induces HBD2 expression in respiratory epithelium has not been previously reported. Indirect evidence for involvement of a TLR came first from Diamond and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] in 1996, who described CD-14 dependent LPS induced production of an anti-microbial peptide in bovine tracheal epithelium, and later from Becker and colleagues, who showed that HBD2 up regulation in response to LPS in human tracheobronchial cells was CD14 dependent (33). The GPI-linked CD14 receptor lacks a cytosolic domain and must interact with another receptor to transduce its signal to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Transcriptional regulation of HBD2 in response to LPS has also been shown to involve NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], but the signaling pathway upstream of NF-&#x003ba;B has not been elucidated. Until recently, TLRs appeared to share a common signaling pathway downstream of their TIR domain. It is now known that individual TLRs utilize different adaptor proteins for signaling, thus conferring biological specificity in their response to activation by individual ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. MyD88 is involved in signaling from all TLRs with the exception of TLR3, whilst Mal is known to have a role in TLR2 and TLR4 intracellular signaling. Our data implicate both MyD88 and Mal in LPS-induced HBD2 expression and clearly demonstrates the critical role of TLR4 in LPS induction of HBD2, thus defining another role for TLR4 in pulmonary host defense. Along with the previously well-defined functions of TLR4 in induction of a large number of cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules that activate phagocytosis and the adaptive immune responses, activation of TLR4 in the epithelium results in a direct microbicidal response via production of a potent anti-microbial peptide.</p><p>Modulation of TLR4 expression in respiratory epithelium may critically affect the production of HBD2. Risk factors for respiratory tract infections include increased age and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], both of which may affect TLR4 expression. TLR4 expression in macrophages is reduced in aged mice, who have a blunted cytokine response to LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Cigarette smoke has also been demonstrated to reduce LPS responsiveness in alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. As LPS is an active component of cigarette smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and down regulation of TLR4 expression by LPS in cigarette smoke, otherwise known as LPS tolerance, may result in impaired HBD2 production in response to Gram-negative pathogens, facilitating colonization and infection. This is the subject of ongoing work in our laboratory. Similarly, therapies for septic shock aimed at inhibiting LPS signaling by blockade of the TLR4 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] may result in increased susceptibility to nosocomial Gram-negative pneumonia through impaired HBD2 induction.</p><p>HBD2 is an important component of host defense in the lung. This study defines a critical role for TLR4 in induced expression of HBD2 in response to LPS and highlights the potential effect of modulation of TLR4 and the accessory proteins MyD88 and Mal expression on pulmonary production of this potent anti-microbial peptide. We also provide important information regarding the cellular responses of A549 cells, a cultured cell model which is widely used in studies of host defense.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr Andrew Bowie and Dr Aisling Dunne, Dept of Biochemistry, Trinity College Dublin, for providing the Mal P/H plasmid, TLR4 plasmid and MD2 plasmid, Dr M.
