However, some but not all studies in mice and humans (though none in rats) have found that CLA promotes insulin resistance. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects are unclear, and there are conflicting reports on the effects of CLA on peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) activation and expression. We have conducted three experiments with CLA in obese mice over three weeks, and one over eleven weeks.

After two weeks, in contrast to beneficial effects obtained with the PPAR&#x003b3; agonist rosiglitazone, CLA or CLA enriched with its <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 isomer raised fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations, and exacerbated glucose tolerance. After 10 weeks, however, CLA had beneficial effects on glucose and insulin concentrations. At this time, CLA had no effect on the plasma TNF&#x003b1; concentration, but it markedly reduced the plasma adiponectin concentration. CLA and CLA enriched with either isomer raised the plasma triglyceride concentration during the first three weeks, but not subsequently. CLA enriched with its <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 isomer, but not with its <italic>cis</italic>-9, <italic>trans</italic>-11 isomer, stimulated PPAR&#x003b3;-mediated reporter gene activity; both isomers stimulated PPAR&#x003b1;-mediated reporter gene activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>CLA initially decreased but subsequently increased insulin sensitivity in <italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob </sup></italic>mice.

In the short term, however, another mechanism, activated primarily by <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12-CLA, which probably leads to reduced adipocyte number and consequently reduced plasma adiponectin concentration, may decrease insulin sensitivity.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The term conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) refers to a mixture of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid (<italic>cis</italic>-9, <italic>cis</italic>-12-octadienoic acid). The major components of CLA, are the <italic>cis</italic>-9, <italic>trans</italic>-11 (c9, t11) and the <italic>trans</italic>-10, <italic>cis</italic>-12 (t10, c12) isomers, both of which have biological activities. The t10, c12-isomer is the one primarily responsible for the effects of CLA on weight gain and insulin sensitivity. The CLA used in the present study contains these isomers in roughly equal proportions.</p><p>CLA may be of benefit in cancer, atherosclerosis and possibly some disorders of the immune system. In addition, it reduces weight gain and fat accretion in rats and mice. Some studies have found that CLA causes fat loss in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and two studies have shown weight loss[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but another did not find any significant effect of CLA on body composition or body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. More marked effects of CLA on body weight and body composition have been obtained in rats and especially mice, possibly because the rate of energy expenditure relative to energy stores is much higher in rodents than in humans.</p><p>In previous studies, CLA or t10, c12-CLA has exacerbated glucose tolerance and raised plasma insulin levels in normal and genetically obese (<italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>) mice, despite causing weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Both t10, c12-CLA and c9, t11-CLA have also been reported to cause insulin resistance in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], although in other studies neither CLA nor its major isomers affected insulin resistance significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. By contrast, CLA or t10, c12-CLA improved glucose tolerance in Zucker fatty <italic>lep<sup>fa</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>fa </sup></italic>and Zucker diabetic fatty <italic>lep<sup>fa</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>fa </sup></italic>rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. One difference between the rodent species is that peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)&#x003b1;-regulated genes are more responsive to CLA in mice than in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but this would be expected to correlate with improved insulin sensitivity in mice rather than rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>By contrast with this result for PPAR&#x003b1; knockout mice, at least one response to CLA depends on expression of PPAR&#x003b3;: the beneficial effect of CLA in a mouse model of colitis was absent in mice that lacked PPAR&#x003b3; in the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In view of the variety of reports of CLA's effects on PPAR&#x003b3; activity and expression, it is possible that PPAR&#x003b3; responses may vary between species; the different proportions of isomers in the CLA used in different studies may also be important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Some reports describe activation of PPAR&#x003b3; by CLA or t10, c12-CLA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; others describe little or no agonist activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but antagonism of rosiglitazone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. One report describes increased expression of PPAR&#x003b3; mRNA in white adipose tissue of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and another describes increased expression in liver of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but studies in isolated adipocytes or of adipose tissue from treated mice show decreased expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Since PPAR&#x003b3; agonists increase insulin sensitivity but promote adipogenesis, decreased activity of PPAR&#x003b3; in adipose tissue could explain why CLA reduces obesity but increases insulin resistance. Various other mechanisms have also been suggested to explain why CLA exacerbates insulin sensitivity despite causing loss of fat. One of these is increased expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)&#x003b1;, since TNF&#x003b1; is associated with apoptosis of adipocytes but causes insulin resistance. TNF&#x003b1; mRNA levels were markedly increased in isolated adipocytes from normal mice that had been fed on CLA for as little as four days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Surprisingly however, serum TNF&#x003b1; levels were reduced by CLA in both normal rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Moreover CLA reduced the expression of TNF&#x003b1; in mouse macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Although most studies in mice have found that CLA exacerbates glucose tolerance and raises the plasma insulin concentration, in one study treatment of <italic>lep<sup>db</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>db </sup></italic>mice with CLA for eleven weeks improved glucose tolerance and reduced plasma insulin concentration during the glucose tolerance test, indicating improved insulin sensitivity. Treatment for five weeks also improved glucose tolerance but plasma insulin was raised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is sometimes difficult to interpret studies in <italic>lep<sup>db</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>db </sup></italic>mice because &#x003b2;-cell failure as well as insulin resistance affects glucose homeostasis, and glycosuria can cause weight loss. Therefore, to investigate the effect of CLA on glucose homeostasis further, we have conducted four experiments in <italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob </sup></italic>mice. We have included rosiglitazone as a comparator in one experiment and compared the effects of t10, c12- and c9, t11-enriched CLA with CLA in another experiment. The first three experiments were over 22 days, whereas the fourth was extended to eleven weeks and included measurements of plasma TNF&#x003b1; and adiponectin. An intriguing finding is that whereas CLA initially exacerbated glucose tolerance and raised the plasma insulin level, after ten weeks it began to improve glucose tolerance and lower the plasma insulin levels.</p><p>We also describe activation of PPAR&#x003b3; by t10, c12 but not by c9, t11-CLA, whereas PPAR&#x003b1; was activated by both isomers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Weight gain</title><p>Inclusion of CLA in the diet of genetically obese (<italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>) mice reduced their body weight, or weight gain compared to mice fed on a diet containing a similar amount of sunflower oil (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Mice fed on chow supplemented with sunflower oil gained weight at the same rate as mice fed on chow alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). The effect of CLA on weight gain appears to be primarily due to t10, c12-CLA, since CLA enriched to 90% with this isomer had more effect on weight gain than CLA containing 50% t10, c12-CLA and 50% c9, t11-CLA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). CLA that was enriched to 90% with the c9, t11 isomer had only a small effect on weight gain, and this may have been due to the 10% t10, c12-CLA. Food intake was measured over two days in experiment 4 and was not reduced by CLA (food intake per group: control, 33.1 and 37.5 g; CLA 10 g/kg diet, 35.1, 43.4 g; CLA 25 g/kg diet, 39.9, 39.6). Rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg diet) reduced body weight (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) but to a lesser extent than CLA (15 g/kg diet).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Weight gain in mice fed on diets that contained (doses per kg diet) (a) experiment 1: sunflower oil (&#x025cf;, 15 g), rosiglitazone (&#x025c7;,10 mg), CLA (&#x025b2;, 15 g); (b) experiment 2: chow only (&#x025cb;), sunflower oil (&#x025cf;, 25 g), CLA (&#x025b2;, 25 g); (c) experiment 3: sunflower oil (&#x025cf;, 25 g), CLA (&#x025b2;, 25 g), t10, c12-CLA (&#x025b3;, 25 g), c9, t11-CLA (&#x025bd;, 25 g); (d) experiment 4: sunflower oil (&#x025cf;, 25 g), CLA (10 g) plus sunflower oil (15 g) (&#x025a0;), CLA (&#x025b2;, 25 g). *<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05; **<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01: ***<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 compared to sunflower oil group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-511X-4-3-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Tissue weights and body length</title><p>The weight of the parametrial white fat pads was reduced by CLA and by CLA enriched with t10, c12- but not c9, t11-CLA (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

Those that have failed to show such effects are generally those that have used low levels of CLA or CLA that contained low concentrations of t10, c12-CLA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Studies disagree, however, as to whether CLA improves or exacerbates glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in these species: studies in rats show improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], whereas studies in mice, with the exception of one study in <italic>lep<sup>db</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>db </sup></italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], show exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In humans, several studies have shown a loss of fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but doubts have been raised about the use of CLA for the treatment of obesity by reports that both t10, c12-CLA and c9, t11-CLA exacerbated insulin resistance in abdominally obese men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and that t10, c12- (but not c9, t11-CLA) reduced the HDL cholesterol concentration or the HDL:LDL cholesterol ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These are by no means consistent findings, however [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Our study raises the possibility that an initial exacerbation of glucose tolerance, apparently due to insulin resistance, might, after prolonged treatment with a high dose of CLA, be followed by improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. We used genetically obese (<italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>) mice as our model of insulin resistance. There is only one previous report of the effect of CLA in <italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob </sup></italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In agreement with other studies in rodents, we found that CLA reduced weight gain and perigenital fat pad weight, and that this effect appeared to be produced by the t10, c12- rather than the c9, t11-isomer. We also found, like other studies in mice, that glucose tolerance was initially exacerbated and the plasma insulin concentration was raised. Again, these effects were primarily due to the t10, c12-isomer. However, in our last experiment we found that after ten weeks glucose tolerance improved and the fasting plasma insulin concentration was reduced by treatment of <italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob </sup></italic>mice with CLA. These benefits were achieved faster with the higher (25 g/kg diet, including 40% t10, c12-CLA) than the lower dose (10 g/kg diet) of CLA.</p><p>Our results are similar to those of Hamura <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], insofar as they found that treatment of <italic>lep<sup>db</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>db </sup></italic>mice with CLA for eleven weeks improved glucose tolerance and lowered insulin levels during the glucose tolerance test. Hamura <italic>et al</italic>. found that glucose tolerance was also improved in <italic>lep<sup>db</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>db </sup></italic>mice after five weeks of treatment, but this was apparently due to increased insulin secretion rather than improved insulin sensitivity. It is not clear why others have not also found improved glucose tolerance and reduced insulin levels following prolonged treatment of mice with CLA. In the one previous study in <italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob </sup></italic>mice, the dose of t10, c12-CLA was only about 5.9 g/kg diet and treatment was for only four weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A study in lean C57Bl/6J mice similarly used a dose of 4 g/kg diet of t10, c12-CLA for four weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Other studies lasted for twelve weeks and eight months, however. The dose of CLA was only 10 g/kg diet in both studies and neither was conducted in exceptionally obese or insulin resistant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We therefore suggest that improved insulin sensitivity is most likely to be found when mice are initially markedly obese and insulin resistant, and when treatment is prolonged and results in a major loss of adipose tissue. The relevance of our findings to humans is unclear, but it is interesting that in one 12 month study plasma glucose was raised after two weeks treatment with CLA, but not at any subsequent time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>After ten weeks the higher dose of CLA lowered the plasma fasting non-esterified fatty acid concentration, which is consistent with improved insulin sensitivity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The lower dose raised the NEFA concentration at this time, despite apparently improving insulin sensitivity, even though it did not raise the NEFA concentration at earlier times when glucose tolerance was reduced and plasma insulin levels were raised. This paradox seems to be largely a consequence of the low control NEFA concentration after ten weeks: the highest NEFA level in the low dose CLA group was after five weeks of treatment and it seems possible that the NEFA concentration in the low dose group would have fallen with further treatment, just as it was falling in the high dose group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Hamura <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] found that after twelve weeks CLA reduced the plasma NEFA concentration in <italic>lep<sup>db</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>db </sup></italic>mice, suggesting that insulin sensitivity was improved. After six weeks, however, CLA raised the NEFA concentration, suggesting that CLA exacerbated insulin sensitivity at this time. The elevated plasma NEFA concentration may have been partly responsible for the elevated plasma insulin and improved glucose tolerance after six weeks in their study. CLA and its major isomers have little or no effect on plasma NEFA levels in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism</title><p>No single mechanism has been identified that can account for the various effects of CLA on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, let alone its anticarcinogenic and immunomodulatory activities. In part this is because CLA is a mixture of isomers, each with its own balance of activities. The activities of even the most active isomer, t10, c12-CLA, cannot, however, be pinned down to a single mechanism.</p><p>We can first rule out any possibility that responses to CLA in our experiments were mediated by a fall in leptin levels as has been suggested by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], because our study was conducted in <italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob </sup></italic>mice. In any event, when fat loss is achieved by reducing energy intake, insulin action and glucose tolerance improve despite a reduction in the plasma leptin concentration.</p><p>Antagonism of PPAR&#x003b3; by t10, c12-CLA has been suggested to contribute to both decreased adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. A recent report that c9, t11-CLA exacerbates insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] is consistent with a report that it too antagonises PPAR&#x003b3;, albeit a little less effectively than t10, c12-CLA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We found little evidence that c9, t11-CLA exacerbates insulin sensitivity in <italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob </sup></italic>mice, however (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>), and others have reported no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Some workers favour the hypothesis that t10, c12-CLA decreases adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity by a mechanism that involves decreased expression of PPAR&#x003b3; in adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Since PPAR&#x003b3; agonists increase PPAR&#x003b3; expression in some situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], antagonism of PPAR&#x003b3; might decrease PPAR&#x003b3; expression. By contrast with mice, however, in rats CLA increases both PPAR&#x003b3; mRNA expression and insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus it is possible that CLA activates one mechanism that decreases and another that increases insulin sensitivity, and that PPAR&#x003b3; expression reflects the balance of these forces, rather than having a causal role.</p><p>In any event, our results do not support antagonism of PPAR&#x003b3; as a mechanism of action of CLA. In agreement with some other workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], we find that t10, c12-CLA, but not c9, t11-CLA activates PPAR&#x003b3;. Activation of PPAR&#x003b3; might contribute to the improvement in insulin sensitivity in <italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob </sup></italic>mice following prolonged treatment with CLA.</p><p>Activation of PPAR&#x003b1; might also contribute to improved insulin sensitivity. t10, c12-CLA was more potent as an activator of PPAR&#x003b1; than of PPAR&#x003b3; in the particular assays that we used, although it is inappropriate to make precise comparisons of potency in view of the different plasmids, their levels and other differences between the two assays. In contrast to some previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], t10, c12-CLA was, if anything, more potent than c9, t11-CLA as an activator of PPAR&#x003b1;. Nevertheless, c9, t11-CLA was sufficiently effective to raise the possibility that it contributed to the improvement in insulin sensitivity due to the prolonged treatment with CLA.</p><p>Activation of PPAR&#x003b1; and peroxisomal proliferation might contribute to the increased liver weight in c9, t11-CLA-treated mice, steatosis also playing a role, at least in the case of t10, c12-CLA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Activation of PPAR&#x003b1; does not, however, appear to have a major role in the anti-obesity effect of CLA, because CLA reduced body fat content in PPAR&#x003b1; knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Moreover, some investigators have found that c9, t11-CLA is more effective than t10, c12-CLA as an activator of PPAR&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Other workers have shown that CLA also activates PPAR&#x003b2;/&#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], but the effect was small in one these studies and c9, t11-CLA was more potent than t10, c12-CLA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>We measured plasma TNF&#x003b1; and adiponectin concentrations following prolonged treatment with CLA. Neither hormone contributed to the improved insulin sensitivity at this time: the plasma TNF&#x003b1; concentration was unchanged by CLA, and the plasma adiponectin concentration was reduced rather than increased. Other investigators have reported that t10, c12-CLA but not c9, t11-CLA reduces the level of adiponectin mRNA in white adipose tissue of lean mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Since adiponectin is released primarily from adipocytes but plasma levels are low in obesity and increased by weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], the marked reduction in plasma adiponectin in the CLA-treated mice is consistent with their having less, rather than smaller, adipocytes. This is in turn consistent with the view that the anti-obesity effect of CLA and the initial decrease in insulin sensitivity is due to apoptosis of adipocytes. Decreased fat cell number may also account for the tendency of CLA to increase plasma triglyceride levels in lep<sup>ob</sup>/lep<sup>ob </sup>mice, the remaining fat cells being too full to accommodate the triglyceride released by cells that have undergone apoptosis. Other workers have reported that CLA reduces plasma triglyceride levels; but in some cases this reduction was in lean mice with less replete adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and in the one other study in <italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob </sup></italic>mice, it was an effect of c9, t11-CLA, which presumably causes little apoptosis of adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interestingly, CLA has been reported to <italic>increase </italic>plasma adiponectin levels in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, at the same time decreasing plasma triglycerides and improving insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We therefore suggest that the main effect of CLA in Zucker diabetic fatty rats is to reduce fat cell size, rather than to promote apoptosis and reduce fat cell number.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with CLA initially decreased but subsequently increased insulin sensitivity in <italic>lep<sup>ob</sup></italic>/<italic>lep<sup>ob </sup></italic>mice. Activation of both PPAR&#x003b3; and PPAR&#x003b1; may contribute to the improvement in insulin sensitivity.

Blood samples (20 &#x003bc;l) were taken from the tip of the tail after applying a local anaesthetic (lignocaine) and immediately before and 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after dosing the glucose. They were mixed with haemolysis reagent and blood glucose was measured in duplicate using the Sigma Enzymatic (Trinder) colorimetric method and a SpectraMax 250 (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Areas under the glucose tolerance curve (0&#x02013;180 min) and other manipulations and analysis of the data were carried out using Prism software, version 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Other plasma analytes</title><p>Blood was collected into EDTA-coated microcuvettes (Sarstedt microcuvette, Aktiengsellschaft &#x00026; Co., N&#x000e4;mbrecht, Germany) for the measurement of plasma insulin, non-esterified fatty acids and triglycerides. Plasma was stored at -80&#x000b0;C. 5 &#x003bc;l plasma samples were assayed using kits for triglyceride (Sigma enzymatic colorimetric method), non-esterified fatty acids (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany) and insulin (mouse standard; Crystal Chemistry Incorporated, Downers Grove, IL, USA).</p><p>For the measurement of plasma TNF&#x003b1; (Linco; St Charles, MI, USA) and adiponectin (Biosource UK, Nivelles, Belgium), blood was taken into tubes containing 200 units of heparin and plasma was stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids for reporter gene assays</title><p>pRSV/hRXR&#x003b1; and pcDNA3/hPPAR&#x003b3;1 were both obtained from Professor VKK Chatterjee (Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK). PPPRE3TK-luc was prepared by replacing the NF-kB enhancer element of pNF-&#x003ba;B-luc (Clontech) with a cassette of 3 PPAR Response Elements (PPREs). A double-stranded PPRE cassette was prepared using the 'Klenow fill-in' technique. An 113 bp oligonucleotide (PPRE3) 5'- GCATTCACGCGTCAAATATAGGCCATAGGTCATTCTCGAGCAAATATAGGCCATAGGTCATTCTCGAGCAAATATAGGCCATAGGTCAGATTCGATCAATATAGGCCATAGGTCACTCGAGGCAACAGATCTTACGCATG -3' containing a triplet of PPREs and appropriate restriction endonuclease sites was used as a template for synthesis of a second DNA strand. This was primed by PPRE3R, 5'-CATGCGTAAGATCTGTTGCC-3', which is complementary to the 3' region of PPRE3. 20 &#x003bc;l annealed PPRE3 and PPRE3R, 1.5 &#x003bc;l 2 mM dNTPs, 1 &#x000d7; Klenow Buffer and 5 units DNA Polymerase I (Klenow fragment), were incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C and then 10 minutes at 75&#x000b0;C, purified by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in sterile water. The double-stranded PPRE cassette was digested with <italic>Mlu</italic>I and <italic>Bgl</italic>II and ligated into pNF-&#x003ba; B-luc that had been cleaved with the same restriction endonucleases. Ligated DNA was transformed into competent JM109, <italic>E. coli </italic>cells (Promega). pcDNA3/PPAR&#x003b1; was prepared by removing the human PPAR&#x003b1; cDNA insert from pUC18/hPPAR&#x003b1; as a <italic>Nru</italic>I/<italic>Bam</italic>HI fragment and ligating it into <italic>Eco</italic>RV/<italic>Bam</italic>HI cleaved pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen).

Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE as directed by the manufacturers (GibcoBRL). For the PPAR&#x003b3; assay Cos-7 cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 0.375 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well. Cells were transfected in serum-free medium (DMEM containing 2 mM L-glutamine) with pPPRE3TK-luc, pRLTK, pRSV/hRXR&#x003b1; and pcDNA3/hPPAR&#x003b3; 1 at concentrations of 0.4, 0.03, 0.02 and 0.02 &#x003bc;g/well, respectively. Five hours after transfection cells were fed with 250 &#x003bc;l/well of serum-free medium containing various concentrations (0&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M) of CLA (either the c9, t11 isomer or t10, c12 isomer prepared in 0.1% DMSO). Cell lysates were prepared after 46 hours using 100 &#x003bc;l 1 &#x000d7; passive lysis buffer (Promega) per well. Firefly and renilla luciferase activities were measured using a Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega), as described by the manufacturers. Measurements were performed on an MLX microtitre plate luminometer (Dynex). For the PPAR&#x003b1; assay Cos-7 cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well. Cells were transfected in serum-free medium with pPPRE3TK-luc, pRLTK, pRSV/hRXR&#x003b1; and pcDNA3/hPPAR&#x003b1; at concentrations of 0.4, 0.04, 0.03 and 0.03 &#x003bc;g/well, respectively. Five hours after transfection DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 20% SBCS (charcoal-stripped bovine calf serum, Sigma) was added to the cells. Following 18 hours incubation at 37&#x000b0;C/5% CO<sub>2 </sub>the medium was removed and replaced with medium (DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% SBCS) containing various concentrations (0-100 &#x003bc;M) of CLA enriched to 85% with the c9, t11 isomer or 81% with the t10, c12 isomer prepared in 0.1% DMSO. After 24 hours of treatment cell lysates were prepared and luciferase activity measured as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were analysed by one-way analysis of variance followed by LSD test with the sunflower oil treatment as the control.
