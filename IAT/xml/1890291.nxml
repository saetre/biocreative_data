More recently, Plexins have been implicated in diverse biological functions, including vascular growth, epithelial tissue morphogenesis and tumour development. In particular, PlexinB1, the receptor for Sema4D, has been suggested to play a role in neural development and in tumour angiogenesis, based on in vitro studies. However, the tissue distribution of PlexinB1 has not been extensively studied and the functional relevance of this receptor in vivo still awaits experimental testing. In order to shed light on PlexinB1 function in vivo, we therefore undertook the genomic targeting of the mouse gene to obtain loss of function mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>This study shows that PlexinB1 receptor and its putative ligand, Sema4D, have a selective distribution in nervous and epithelial tissues during development and in the adult. PlexinB1 and Sema4D show largely complementary cell distribution in tissues, consistent with the idea that PlexinB1 acts as the receptor for Sema4D in vivo. Interestingly, PlexinB1 is also expressed in certain tissues in the absence of Sema4D, suggesting Sema4D independent activities. High expression of PlexinB1 was found in lung, kidney, liver and cerebellum.</p><p>Mutant mice lacking expression of semaphorin receptor PlexinB1 are viable and fertile. Although the axon collapsing activity of Sema4D is impaired in PlexinB1 deficient neurons, we could not detect major defects in development, or in adult histology and basic functional parameters of tissues expressing PlexinB1. Moreover, in the absence of PlexinB1 the angiogenic response induced by orthotopically implanted tumours was not affected, suggesting that the expression of this semaphorin receptor in endothelial cells is redundant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our expression analysis suggests a multifaceted role of PlexinB1 during mouse development and tissue homeostasis in the adult. Nonetheless, the genetic deletion of PlexinB1 does not result in major developmental defects or clear functional abnormalities. We infer that PlexinB1 plays a redundant role in mouse development and it is not strictly required for tumour induced angiogenesis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Plexins are a highly conserved family of single pass transmembrane receptors which, in mammals, comprises nine genes grouped into four subfamilies (A thru D) based on sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. They are characterized by a conserved sequence, the "sema domain", a structural domain that mediates protein-protein interaction, and phylogenetically links the Plexins to the Semaphorins and the Scatter Factor Receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The intracellular domain is highly conserved among the Plexins but does not share striking homology with other known proteins. Although the mechanisms of Plexin-mediated signalling have not been well understood, they are known to impinge on cytoskeletal dynamics and on cell adhesion, e.g. by regulating monomeric GTPases of Rho and Ras families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Plexins were initially characterized for their role in axon guidance, where they function, either alone or in complex with the Neuropilins, as semaphorin receptors. Subsequently, Plexins were shown to control immune response and angiogenesis, and more recently were proposed to orchestrate tissue morphogenesis and cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We have previously identified PlexinB1 as the receptor for Sema4D. Upon ligand binding, PlexinB1 regulates cytoskeletal remodeling (via Rac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], PDZ-RhoGEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], p190 RhoGAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]), integrin activation (via R-Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]), MAPK signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], cytosolic tyrosine kinases (Src, PYK2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and can trigger the activation of the tyrosine kinase receptors Met and ErbB-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>It was also demonstrated that PlexinB1 can mediate axon outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and endothelial cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, its ligand Sema4D is a potent angiogenetic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], possibly involved in tumour induced angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>PlexinB1 mRNA expression has previously been shown in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and in diverse tissues at E14 of murine development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; on the other hand, detailed information on the expression of Sema4D mRNA outside the nervous system is missing. Notably, PlexinB1 and Sema4D expression at protein level by immunohistochemistry has not been reported yet. Furthermore, little is known about the expression of Sema4D and PlexinB1 in the adult tissues.</p><p>In spite of extensive studies performed on Plexins of A subfamily, molecular genetic studies to address the functional relevance in vivo of Plexins-B are currently lacking. Here we report our analysis of PlexinB1 deficient mice, including functional studies to test the relevance of this semaphorin receptor in tumour induced angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PlexinB1 and Sema4D expression during embryo development and in the adult</title><p>In order to get insights to their physiological function, we investigated the tissue distributions of PlexinB1 and Sema4D in embryonic and adult tissues. Initially, we explored PlexinB1 mRNA expression by Dot Blot analysis of human tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and by whole mount In Situ Hybridization of mouse embryos (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Taken together, these data revealed a wide expression of PlexinB1 in various tissues, including nervous system, lung, kidney and liver.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of PlexinB1 and Sema4D in in different organs and during branching morphogenesis</bold>. A) PlexinB1 expression in different human organs was assessed by mRNA Dot Blot analysis. In the mouse embryo at E14 PlexinB1 is present in the mesenchimal cells of kidney (B) and lung (D) while Sema4D displays a complementery expression pattern in the epithelial cells of the same organs (C and E respectively). F) At E17 PlexinB1 expression in the lung is found in the mesenchymal cells positive for Smooth Muscle Actin (arrow). The inset shows the anti-Smooth Muscle Actin staining, for comparison.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-7-55-1"/></fig><p>In order to gain further evidence of PlexinB1 expression at the protein level, we generated specific anti-PlexinB1 antibodies (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> for specificity controls), which we used to analyze further embryonic and adult tissues.</p><p>The immunohistochemical analysis of PlexinB1 and Sema4D expression revealed an intriguing distribution in developing organs characterized by epithelial branching morphogenesis, including the kidney, the lung and the pancreas. During epithelial branching morphogenesis, tissues are shaped by the outgrowth and branching of tubular epithelial structures, which invade the surrounding mesenchyme under the control of growth factors and guidance cues. We found that, at an early stage, PlexinB1 is expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding epithelial tubules in kidney and lung (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, D</xref>) and in the pancreas (not shown), while Sema4D is expressed by epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, E</xref>).</p><p>The developmental expression of this ligand-receptor pair appears to be dynamically regulated. For instance, in the lung at E17, PlexinB1 was expressed in cells of putative smooth muscle lineage recruited to wrap the differentiating airways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>); conversely, in the adult, PlexinB1 expression was mostly localized to bronchial epithelium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Notably, while Sema4D expression was clear in developing epithelia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), it was undetectable in the adult lung (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>PlexinB1 and Sema4D are expressed in different epithelial tissues in the adult mouse</bold>.

B) In the kidney PlexinB1 staining is present in the distal tubules (arrow) and the collecting ducts (arrowhead); the proximal tubules are stained in red by PAS histochemical reaction. C) In the kidney, Sema4D is mainly expressed in the pars convoluta of the proximal tubules. D) In the adult liver PlexinB1 is diffusely expressed in the liver parenchima.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-7-55-2"/></fig><p>In the adult kidney, we found an elevated expression of PlexinB1 in distal tubules and collecting ducts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), while Sema4D displays a complementary expression in the pars convoluta of proximal tubules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>In the mouse liver, we could not clearly detect PlexinB1 expression during early embryonic stages (not shown), though we found a high expression of PlexinB1 in adult hepatocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Surprisingly, we could not detect Sema4D expression in the liver at any stage (not shown), suggesting Sema4D-independent activities of PlexinB1 in this tissue.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], in the nervous system we detected PlexinB1 expression in sensory and motor neurons, but were particularly attracted by the distinctive expression of PlexinB1 and Sema4D during cerebellar development. During postnatal development, Purkinje cell (Pk) dendrites expand into the nascent molecular layer, to form extensive connections with granule cell axons (parallel fibres). In the P10 cerebellum, PlexinB1 is exclusively expressed in Purkinje cells, being distributed in the perikaryon, dendritic tree and axon, up to the terminal branches in the deep cerebellar nuclei (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). At the same developmental stage it was shown that Sema4D is expressed by myelinating oligodendrocytes in the folial white matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the mature cerebellum PlexinB1 expression remains selectively confined to PK cells. Moreover, labelling intensity of Pk axons now reveals a clear cut rostro-caudal gradient, with higher levels of expression in the posterior cortical lobules (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>). In addition, analysis of frontal sections shows differential expression along parasagittally oriented Pk cell subpopulations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). At this age, anti-Sema4D antibodies show a diffuse distribution pattern in the molecular layer, suggesting expression in parallel fibres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>PlexinB1 and Sema4D expression in developing and adult cerebellum</bold>.

A) In the P10 cerebellum PlexinB1 is homogeneously expressed in Pk cell perikarya, axons (A) and in the dendrites invading the molecular layer (inset). B) This expression is maintained in adult Pk cells. At this age, however, labelling intensity of Pk axons shows a clear rostrocaudal gradient (compare the black arrows with the red arrowheads in C). In addition, frontal sections reveal different expression levels in parasagittally-oriented Pk subsets (D). E) Diffuse Sema4D immunoreactivity is present in the adult molecular layer.

To this end, we generated a targeting construct in which we placed exon 22 and 23 of the PlexinB1 gene (encoding the transmembrane domain of the receptor) between two loxP sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Furthermore, we inserted a Neo cassette, flanked by two FRP sites and followed by a LacZ reporter fused to the first exon of the intracellular portion of the PlexinB1 gene; this allowed us, upon FLP recombination, to also obtain knock-in PlexinB1 mutants. The correct targeting of the construct in the genome of ES cells was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Chimeric mice, obtained from a positive ES cell clone, were mated with a CRE deleter strain to achieve gene inactivation, and eventually backcrossed into C57BL/6 genetic background. The actual deletion of exons 22 and 23 in mouse genome, encoding for the transmembrane region of PlexinB1, was confirmed by PCR analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of PlexinB1 mutant mice</bold>.

We confirmed the absence of PlexnB1 mRNA in homozygous mutant by RT PCR analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Moreover, we analyzed tissue extracts of mutant and control mice by Western blotting by means of an antibody directed to the intracellular domain of the receptor, and confirmed that the expression of PlexinB1 was abrogated in homozygous mutant mice at the protein level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Mendelian distribution of PlexinB1 deficient mice in offsprings</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">No.</td><td align="left">%</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Wild type</bold></td><td align="left">31</td><td align="left">25.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Heterozygous</bold></td><td align="left">63</td><td align="left">50.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Homozygous</bold></td><td align="left">30</td><td align="left">24.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The genotyping of littermates born from heterozygous &#x000d7; heterozygous breeding pairs showed the expected mendelian ratio.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>PlexinB1 deficient mice do not display major developmental defects</title><p>PlexinB1 mutant mice did not show any detectable difference in size and were undistinguishable from their wild type (WT) littermates; in addition, their feeding behaviour and weaning appeared to be regular, they developed normally and did not show defects in reproduction or fertility. Moreover, we measured some of the main blood parameters (i.e. white blood cells counts, red blood cells counts and values, haemoglobin concentration, platelet count) and found them to be normal (data not shown). Thus we undertook a histological analysis of embryonic and adult tissues in PlexinB1 null mice.</p><p>Lung development provides a prototypic example of branching morphogenesis and semaphorins and plexins were shown to play a role during this morphogenetic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, upon histological examination we failed to reveal any obvious abnormality in the morphology of lung epithelium or in the septation of the airways in PlexinB1 null mice (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Besides, the alveoli were properly inflated and the respiration occurred normally in all the animals analyzed.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Histology of lung, kidney and liver is normal in PlexinB1 mutant mice</bold>.

The analysis of lung (A, D), kidney (B, E) and liver (C, F) sections from WT and mutant animals did not reveal any major abnormality in the histology of these organs. Moreover, the number of glomeruli per section was equal in WT and in the PlexinB1 deficient mice (G).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-7-55-5"/></fig><p>In the kidney PlexinB1 is highly expressed; however, the histological analysis of mutant mice did not reveal any gross defect or abnormality in tubules or nephrons (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). These specialized structures develop as the result of an intricate dialogue between the epithelial cells and the surrounding mesenchyme, and these results implicate that PlexinB1 is not essential during nephrogenic induction. Furthermore, the number of renal glumeruli were counted and found to be similar in WT and mutant mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>). Because significant defects in kidney function may not implicate gross histological abnormalities and because PlexinB1 is also expressed in the adult, we performed blood tests on two major indicators of renal function, creatinine and urea levels, which turned out to be comparable in normal and mutant mice (see Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>We furthermore examined the liver parenchyma, where PlexinB1 is strongly expressed in WT mice. The haematoxylin/eosin staining revealed no sign of fibrosis, steatosis or other particular abnormality in mutant mice (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>).

However, in PlexinB1 null mice, the overall cerebellar morphology of the cerebellum appeared normal and we could not reveal any abnormality in the foliation of lobuli or in the number of Pk cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, E</xref>). In the cerebellum, myelin formation starts from the first postnatal week, in a period in which Sema4D is expressed by the olygodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This prompted us to scrutinize the myelination process of Pk axons by means of confocal analysis. In fact, anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) staining showed a correct wrapping of Pk axons by the glial cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B, C, D, F, G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>). In addition, Pk axons were immunolabeled with anti-Calbindin (a major Pk cells marker) in the mutant mice, revealing a normal axon patterning. Furthermore, the collateral branching of Pk axons in the infraganglionic plexus, which is normally confined in the most superficial portion of the granular layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], did not show any abnormality (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B, F</xref>). Also, the dendritic arborization of Pk cell in the molecular layer appeared normal in the mutant mice (not shown).

For instance, it was demonstrated that the axonal growth cones of cultured hippocampal neurons undergo collapse in response to Sema4D in vitro, and it was proposed that this response is mediated by PlexinB1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We observed that PlexinB1 is expressed by hippocampal neurons, although at a lower level compared to Pk cells (not shown); however, the evidence that PlexinB1 is responsible for the transduction of Sema4D repulsive signals in these neurons is still lacking. Thus, to verify whether this functional response is abrogated in PlexinB1 deficient mice, hippocampal neurons derived from WT or mutant mice were cultured for 48 hours ex vivo and then incubated with Sema4D for 1 hour. While the number of collapsed growth cones in wild type neurons was strongly increased upon Sema4D stimulation, PlexinB1 -/- hippocampal neurons did not collapse and underwent normal axonal outgrowth and differentiation, irrespective of Sema4D treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This establishes a functional requirement for PlexinB1 in the repelling activity of Sema4D in hippocampal neurons. We then examined the overall histology and the cellular composition of the hippocampus in PlexinB1 knock-out mice. Moreover, we analysed the cytoarchitectonic and the connection pattern of hippocampal neurons (stained for Calbindin marker) and interneurons (immunolabeled with anti-Parvalbumin antibody). However, we did not observe obvious abnormalities of this neural structure in mutant mice (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), consistent with a compensation of Sema4D function in the development of the hippocampus.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>PlexinB1 -/- hippocampal neurons do not respond to Sema4D</bold>.

Furthermore, it was shown that inhibiting the expression of Sema4D in human head and neck carcinoma cells leads to reduction of tumour burden and vascularity in a mouse xenograft model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In fact, the so called "angiogenic switch", i.e. the ability of tumour cells to recruit new vessels in order to provide blood supply, is a basic step in solid tumour growth and metastatic dissemination. Without overcoming this rate-limiting step, most tumours cannot grow over 2 mm in diameter, nor metastasize. PlexinB1 is known to transduce Sema4D signals in vitro and it is expressed in HUVEC endothelial cells and in the tumour vessels in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], however its requirement in tumour angiogenesis has not been clearly established.</p><p>We reasoned that, if PlexinB1 would play a major role in this process, its ablation would impact on tumour angiogenesis, leading to reduced growth rate and metastatization of cancer cells. To test this, we exploited the well established B16 melanoma model, which is syngenic with the C57BL6 background of our mutants, and that we found to produce Sema4D (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Melanoma cells were injected orthotopically in the subcute of WT, heterozygous and homozygous PlexinB1 mutant; tumour growth was followed over time, and tumour explants were eventually weighted at the end of the experiment after 25 days.

In both cases, we did not measure a significant change in PlexinB1 -/- compared to WT mice.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Plexins were originally characterized for their role in the wiring of neural network as receptors for Semaphorin guidance cues. However, accumulating lines of evidence later prompted the investigators to reappraise and revise the biological role of these molecules. First, it was found that many Plexins are widely expressed outside the nervous system. Moreover, as the signal transduction mechanisms start to be uncovered, it is now clear that Plexins can impinge on a range of signaling pathways potentially regulating cell adhesion, cell proliferation and differentiation.</p><p>Here we demonstrate, by immunohistochemical analysis, the expression of PlexinB1 receptor and of its ligand Sema4D in diverse epithelial tissues and in the nervous system, suggesting that PlexinB1 might play multiple functional roles in vivo, during development and in the adult stage. In fact, this is the first extensive analysis, in the mouse embryo and in the adult, of PlexinB1 and Sema4D tissue distribution undertaken so far.</p><p>Previous expression studies and experiments in vitro had highlighted a potential role for secreted semaphorins and their receptors during tubular morphogenesis in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and in the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and it was hypothesized that these guidance cues may define permissive and restricted regions for cell migration. Interestingly, based on our expression analysis, Sema4D-PlexinB1 signaling might have a role in this function, for instance at the boundaries between different cell populations. Moreover, PlexinB1 can regulate the activation of Met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], a tyrosine kinase receptor known to mediate tubular morphogenesis in fetal lung and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In spite of these facts, the genetic deletion of PlexinB1 did not lead to morphological or functional abnormalities, indicating that the function of this semaphorin receptor is redundant in development. Notably, developing kidney and lung also express PlexinB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], another putative Sema4D receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although we observed that PlexinB2 binds to Sema4D with lower affinity than PlexinB1 (J.P. and L.T., unpublished observation), it is conceivable that PlexinB2 can compensate for the lack of PlexinB1 in these organs. In fact, by measuring PlexinB2 mRNA levels in tissues with real time PCR, we found significant expression in liver and kidney, which did not increase in PlexinB1-deficient mice (not shown).</p><p>These findings are in line with that found in previously reported mouse mutants of semaphorins or plexins expressed in developing lung (such as Sema3A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], Sema3F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], PlexinA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]), which also lack to show obvious abnormalities of these organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, this scenario suggests a high level of redundancy in semaphorin signaling during branching morphogenesis and in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in lung and kidney. Moreover, since additional guidance cues are known to regulate these developmental processes, it is conceivable that the absence of semaphorin signals may be compensated by functionally related morphogenetic factors such as the Netrins and the Slits (for an extensive review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]).</p><p>In contrast to the lung and the kidney, PlexinB1 expression in the liver is not consistent with a function as receptor for Sema4D, since we could not detect significant expression of this semaphorin in the mouse liver at any stage. This may suggest that hepatocytes or other liver cells express as yet unidentified alternative ligands for PlexinB1. Furthermore, since it was shown that Plexins can associate in receptor complexes on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or regulate homophilic cell-cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], it is also possible that PlexinB1 acts in the maintenance of liver tissue architecture by functionally regulating other receptors or homologous plexins.</p><p>It was previously shown that Sema4D-PlexinB1 signalling can collapse the growth cone of hippocampal neurons in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Interestingly, we have observed loss of responsiveness to Sema4D in PlexinB1-deficient neurons derived from our mutants. On the other hand, our histological analysis revealed that the overall morphology, cell composition and neural connections in the hippocampus do not display obvious abnormalities in the absence of PlexinB1, suggesting a compensation of Sema4D function in development.</p><p>In the cerebellum, PlexinB1 is highly expressed in Purkinje (Pk) cells during the postnatal development. Notably, these neurons do not express PlexinB2 or CD72, which are lower affinity receptors for Sema4D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Incidentally, it was shown that Pk cells express PlexinB3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], but we previously demonstrated that this receptor cannot bind Sema4D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. PlexinB1 distribution in the cerebellum appears consistent with the traditional role of Plexins as receptors for neurite outgrowth inhibitory cues. In fact, during the first postnatal days, Purkinje axons show exuberant sprouting of collateral branches that are eventually pruned during cerebellar development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The final shaping of Pk axons is associated with the axonal myelination mediated by the olygodendrocytes that express Sema4D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, our analysis shows that Pk axons are correctly myelinated and the pruning of excessive branches occurs normally in the PlexinB1 mutant mice. It is noteworthy that PlexinB1 in Pk cells is also present in the perikaryon and dendrites. In addition, the protein shows different levels of expression in Pk cell subsets, corresponding to morphofunctional modules of the cerebellar cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Together with the precise distribution of Sema4D in the molecular layer, these observations suggest that Sema4D-PlexinB1 signalling may play a role in regulating the patterning and plasticity of intracortical connectivity, although this may be compensated during cerebellar development by alternative pathways.</p><p>The absence of clear developmental defects in PlexinB1 mutants is consistent with that reported for Sema4D-deficient mice. In fact, the latter were only found to have minor defects in the immune response, likely attributed to defective CD72 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], which is an alternative low-affinity receptor for Sema4D expressed in lymphocytes.</p><p>Our expression analysis had revealed that PlexinB1 is importantly expressed in a number of adult tissues, potentially suggesting a physiological role beyond embryo development. To address this point, in addition to study tissue histology, we have performed blood tests to investigate major functions in PlexinB1-deficient mice. Our data show that liver and kidney functions were normal. In addition, we found that hematopoiesis and coagulation parameters were not affected (data not shown).</p><p>Furthermore, it was proposed that PlexinB1 expressed by endothelial cells may mediate the pro-angiogenic activity of Sema4D released by tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Tumour-induced angiogenesis is of fundamental importance in cancer progression; in fact, hampering the formation of new vessels is now a popular strategy to restrain tumour growth. In order to test the functional requirement for PlexinB1 in this process, we exploited B16 melanoma transplants, which are commonly used to study tumour growth and angiogenesis in the context of syngenic C57BL/6 mouse models. We found that B16 cells produce Sema4D and tested their ability to grow and induce angiogenesis in PlexinB1-deficient mice. Our results suggest that the angiogenic activity of Sema4D may be mediated not only by PlexinB1, but also via other receptors expressed in endothelial cells (e.g. PlexinB2, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, panel C). Future studies will tell whether other tumour models are equally capable to grow in a PlexinB1-deficient tissue microenvironment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Collectively, our data concerning PlexinB1 and Sema4D expression suggest that PlexinB1 may carry out multiple functions during development and in the adult. Nonetheless, our analysis of PlexinB1 mutant mice did not show any major impairment in embryo development or differentiated functions in the adult, including the neo-angiogenetic response induced by tumour growth. We conclude that PlexinB1 plays a redundant role during development, in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and in tumour angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>mRNA expression analysis</title><p>A human multiple tissue array (MTE&#x02122;) was purchased from Clonetech laboratories (Cat. #775-1).

Soluble Sema4D was purified from the conditioned media of cells transfected with a cDNA expression construct, generated by recombinant PCR as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Tumourigenesis assays in vivo</title><p>Sema4D expression in melanoma cells was detected using clone 30 antibody (BD-Transduction lab), by immunopurification and Western blotting experiments according to standard protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Tumourigenesis assays were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Shortly, 75000 B16 melanoma cells were diluted in PBS up to a final volume of 200 &#x003bc;l and injected subcutaneously into the right posterior flanks of 8-week old WT, heterozygous and homozygous PlexinB1 mutant mice. Tumour volume was calculated as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. At the end of the observation period, tumours were weighed. Superficial pulmonary metastases were counted under a stereoscopic microscope taking advantage of the black pigmentation of B16 melanoma cell line.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood tests</title><p>Blood tests were performed according to ordinary analytical techniques.

A) Sema4D expression is detected in mouse B16 melanoma cells by immunopurification followed by immunoblotting with a specific antibody (MoAb, clone 30). A murine tumour cell line that does not express the semaphorin, mammary carcinoma 66cl4, provided a specificity control. Lysates of human leukemia cells Jurkat, known to over-express and release Sema4D in secreted form, were included as positive control. Vinculin was detected in total protein lysates to provide a loading standard (at the bottom). B) The expression of Sema4D in B16 tumours growing in mice was furthermore detected in situ in tissue sections by immuno-histochemistry, using MoAb clone BMA-12. C) HUVEC (HU) endothelial cells express both PlexinB1 and PlexinB2, as demonstrated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Human carcinoma cells SKBR3 (SK) provided a positive control for plexin expression.
