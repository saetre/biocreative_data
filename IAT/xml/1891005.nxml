CLCs from Arabidopsis have been shown to participate in nitrate accumulation and storage. In this study, the physiological role of the functional chloride transporter AtCLC-d from Arabidopsis was investigated. AtCLC-d is weakly expressed in various tissues, including the root. When transiently expressed as a GFP fusion in protoplasts, it co-localized with the VHA-a1 subunit of the proton-transporting V-type ATPase in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN). Stable expression in plants showed that it co-localized with the endocytic tracer dye FM4-64 in a brefeldin A-sensitive compartment. Immunogold electron microscopy confirmed the localization of AtCLC-d to the TGN. Disruption of the <italic>AtCLC-d</italic> gene by a T-DNA insertion did not affect the nitrate and chloride contents. The overall morphology of these <italic>clcd-1</italic> plants was similar to that of the wild-type, but root growth on synthetic medium was impaired. Moreover, the sensitivity of hypocotyl elongation to treatment with concanamycin A, a blocker of the V-ATPase, was stronger in the <italic>clcd-1</italic> mutant. These phenotypes could be complemented by overexpression of AtCLC-d in the mutant background. The results suggest that the luminal pH in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network is adjusted by AtCLC-d-mediated transport of a counter anion such as Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chloride</kwd><kwd>nitrogen</kwd><kwd>vesicular traffic</kwd><kwd>channel</kwd><kwd>immunoelectron microscopy</kwd><kwd>V-ATPase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The protein family of voltage-regulated chloride channels and anion transporters (CLCs) is widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Many eukaryotic CLC proteins localize to the cell surface and function as chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Jentsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). A key feature of CLCs is their double pore structure, which results from the fact that CLCs are dimeric proteins and each monomer forms an anion pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Jentsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). A common characteristic of the CLC chloride channels is that they are also permeable to nitrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Pusch <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), but this is of little physiological importance in animals.</p><p>In contrast to the eukaryotic plasma membrane CLC channels, a prokaryotic CLC has been shown to function as an electrogenic chloride/proton exchanger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>). Similarly, several mammalian CLCs have recently been recognized to function as chloride/proton exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Picollo and Pusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Scheel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The mammalian CLCs that function as anion/proton exchangers appear to be mainly localized to intracellular vesicles, but not to the plasma membrane. The vesicular anion transporters ClC-3, ClC-5 and ClC-7 from mammals co-localize with vacuolar V-ATPase and appear to be functionally linked to this proton pump. Several mammalian ClCs may thus provide an electric shunt for the efficient acidification of intracellular compartments by V-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Jentsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Seven CLC genes have been identified in the Arabidopsis genome. Mutant plants have given some insight into their physiological function. Recently, the plant homolog AtCLC-a was shown to function as a nitrate/proton exchanger on the tonoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">De Angeli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). A loss-of-function mutant plant for this transporter accumulates less nitrate than the wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Geelen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). A quantitative trait loci analysis of nitrate storage in Arabidopsis suggested that AtCLC-c might be involved in nitrate accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Harada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Indeed, in a loss-of-function <italic>clc-c</italic> mutant, total anion homeostasis appeared to be affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Harada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). These results suggest that a physiological function of AtCLCs is in nitrate accumulation and anion homeostasis in Arabidopsis.</p><p>A clear drawback in assigning a role to AtCLCs was that the functional analysis of several AtCLCs, e.g. by heterologous expression in frog oocytes, was unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hechenberger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). However, in contrast to some other CLCs, AtCLC-d restored the growth defect of the yeast <italic>gef1</italic> mutant on iron-limiting medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hechenberger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). GEF1 (ScCLC) is the only CLC identified in the genome of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. ScCLC is Golgi-localized and plays a role in vesicular cation homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gaxiola <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Whether AtCLC-d acts in a channel-like manner or as a proton-coupled chloride transporter is still unclear at this point.</p><p>In this study, the expression pattern of AtCLC-d and its cellular localization were determined and a loss-of-function mutant was isolated. AtCLC-d was weakly expressed, but was developmentally regulated in several tissues. GFP-tagged AtCLC-d co-localized with V-type ATPase in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN). Loss of AtCLC-d in <italic>clcd-1</italic> plants did not affect overall anion content, but impaired root growth. Furthermore, hypocotyl elongation was impaired by concanamycin A, a specific H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase inhibitor, and this effect was stronger in the <italic>clcd-1</italic> mutant. These results suggest some cooperativity of the H<sup>+</sup>-V-ATPase and AtCLC-d. The data are in agreement with the hypothesis that the anion transporter AtCLC-d provides an electrical shunt for optimal acidification of the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Developmental regulation of AtCLC-d expression</title><p>To analyze the expression pattern of AtCLC-d, a 2 kb fragment 5&#x02032; of the ATG was cloned in front of the &#x003b2;-glucoronidase gene. The construct was transformed into Arabidopsis and the promoter activity was assayed in two independent homozygous lines from the T<sub>2</sub> generation. Promoter activity was most prominent in the root of germinating seedlings and in cotyledons of 5-day-old seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). Although differential expression was observed, a weak staining, indicating weak promoter activity, was observed in most plant organs. In older plants, stronger staining was observed in the hydathodes and in flowers, especially in anthers and pollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Expression pattern of AtCLC-d in Arabidopsis.

The T-DNA insertion was within the fourth intron of the <italic>AtCLC-d</italic> gene (At5g26240; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>), and initial hybridization with an antisense probe covering the 3&#x02032; terminal fragment of AtCLC-d showed that this 3&#x02032; fragment was overexpressed in <italic>clcd-1</italic> (data not shown). Such overexpression of transcripts in lines from the Salk collection is not unprecedented, as the T-DNA harbors a 35S promoter, which drives expression of genes located close to the left border. However, the partial transcript lacks the coding information for the first three transmembrane helices of AtCLC-d. Proteins that might be formed from this transcript are unlikely to be functional. Subsequent Northern blot hybridization with a 5&#x02032; probe confirmed that the full transcript was only detected in wild-type plants, but not in the homozygous <italic>clcd-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). The 5&#x02032; part of the transcript and the fragment covering the T-DNA insertion were not detectable using RT-PCR, which confirmed that the <italic>AtCLC-d</italic> transcript was at least strongly reduced, if not abolished, in <italic>clcd-1</italic>. RT-PCR with primers covering the 5&#x02032; fragment of the gene confirmed the strong expression of the 3&#x02032; fragment of the partial <italic>AtCLC-d</italic> transcript in the <italic>clcd-1</italic> line.

The Qa SNARE SYP41 has been identified in the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bassham <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In many protoplasts, a strict co-localization was observed with SYP41&#x02013;mRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4i&#x02013;l</xref>). However, the pattern of the SYP41&#x02013;mRFP marker in transiently expressing protoplasts was not entirely consistent and varied somewhat between different protoplasts. An intense overall red fluorescence and less pronounced co-localization were also observed with this marker. Furthermore, co-localization was observed with co-expression of the mRFP-tagged VHA-a1 subunit of V-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dettmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4m&#x02013;p</xref>).

Due to the weak activity of the endogenous promoter of AtCLC-d&#x02013;GFP, the CaMV 35S promoter was used to drive expression.

This matches the tissue distribution obtained for <italic>AtCLC-d</italic> by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hechenberger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) and the data from global expression profiling experiments using microarrays (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genevestigator.org">http://www.genevestigator.org</ext-link>).</p><p>AtCLC-d had been shown previously to function as an anion transporter by complementation of a yeast strain with a deletion in the single, Golgi-localized endogenous ScCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gaxiola <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hechenberger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). The fluorescent AtCLC-d&#x02013;GFP fusion protein was also functional in such assays, an observation that could be reproduced in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). When heterologously expressed in yeast, AtCLC-d&#x02013;GFP localizes to punctate structures that represent the Golgi and possibly to vesicular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hechenberger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schwappach <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In Arabidopsis, AtCLC-d&#x02013;GFP localized preferentially to TGN membranes. Partial co-localization was observed with the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi marker ST&#x02013;mRFP (that can often be detected in the TGN), but not the endosomal marker ARA7&#x02013;mRFP. Strict co-localization was observed with the TGN marker SYP41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bassham <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), and especially the VHA-a1 subunit of V-type ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dettmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). That AtCLC-d resides in the same membrane structures at the <italic>trans</italic> side of the Golgi that also contain a proton pump suggests a close functional cooperativity of the pump and the anion transporter. A close functional relationship between V-type ATPase and vesicular CLC chloride transporters has not previously been reported in plants, but has been observed in yeast and animals. Interestingly, loss of yeast ScCLC did lead to several secondary defects, including altered quality control mechanisms for membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and an iron-suppressible defect in respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Greene <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Such a phenotype was also caused by defects in another gene, <italic>GEF2</italic>, that encodes a subunit of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Greene <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). The link between vesicular CLC anion transporters and the H<sup>+</sup>-pump has been amply confirmed for the mammalian ClC-3, ClC-5 and ClC-7 transporters. For example, osteopetrosis, a severe bone disease, is associated with mutations in V-ATPase and CLC-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Jentsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). It has been proposed that endosomal CLCs provide an electric shunt for the efficient acidification of intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Jentsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). To build up the necessary proton gradients, the excess positive charge in these organelles has to be neutralized, which may be achieved by the import of anions. From studies on isolated animal endosomes, it is known that acidification is more efficient in the presence of extravesicular chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Fuchs <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> studies with secretory and recycling endosomes of the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network indicated a dependence of the acidification rate on the level of chloride in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Demaurex <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). This demonstrates the need for chloride conductance in the acidification of these intracellular eukaryotic organelles. Efficient endosomal acidification can be easily envisaged by the V-ATPase cooperating with an anion channel; however, endosomal and intracellular CLCs appear to be anion/proton exchangers. Only excess transport of anions, e.g. as 2 Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/1 H<sup>+</sup> exchange, appears to efficiently electrically neutralize the vesicular lumen. Whether AtCLC-d acts as anion channel or as anion/proton exchanger cannot be answered at the moment. A molecular determinant that distinguishes CLC channels from CLC transporters appears to be position E259 (which corresponds to E203 in EcCLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Accardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). This residue is &#x02018;transporter-like&#x02019; in AtCLC-d, and this may suggest that AtCLC-d acts as an anion/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger, rather than as a channel. This also opens up the possibility that it is not acidification of the TGN <italic>per se</italic>, but the anion accumulation in these structures that is critical for their vesicular transport function, a hypothesis that may be clarified in future studies.</p><p>A defective AtCLC-d might thus disrupt normal cellular function by causing defective TGN acidification. This may subsequently impair vesicular traffic and affect optimal root growth. It remains unclear which cellular defect impairs root elongation at neutral or more alkaline external pH, but a defective pH homeostasis and impaired vesicular acidification may be involved.</p><p>The importance of TGN acidification for optimal root growth and cell elongation is compatible with the results of another study, in which the vacuolar subunit VHA-c<sub>1</sub> was knocked-down by RNAi. In that study, the reduced activity of the V-ATPase resulted in shorter root length and impaired cell elongation in the hypocotyl of Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Padmanaban <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The acidification of endosomal compartments appears to be essential for normal plant development, as mutants with defective V-ATPase are lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dettmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><sec><title>Function of AtCLC-d in acidification of endosomal compartments</title><p>The luminal pH of endomembrane compartments in eukaryotic cells is generally acidic, although data on the exact luminal pH of plant endomembrane vesicles are scarce. An increasingly acidic luminal pH towards the vesicle destination appears to be required for correct membrane trafficking of endosomal vesicles in eukaryotes, as well as for import of cargo, such as ions, into these vesicles. A decrease in the luminal pH has been reported in a number of eukaryotic cells along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Paroutis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The luminal pH in secretory granules and endosomes may be primarily regulated by the activity and number of V-ATPases, but the proton leak and counter-ion conductance provided by AtCLC-d may also be of fundamental importance.</p><p>Intracellular mammalian CLCs and the yeast ScCLC show close sequence similarity to the Arabidopsis CLC proteins, which is consistent with an intracellular localization. AtCLC-d is the first plant anion transporter localized to compartments involved in trafficking. As expected from this localization, the total anion accumulation in plants was not affected in a loss-of-function mutant.</p><p>The TGN has been recognized as a major sorting site in the secretory pathway, where plant proteins destined for the lysosome or vacuole are segregated from exocytic cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Jurgens, 2004</xref>). It has, however, been shown that the early endosome and the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network are at least partially identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dettmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Such data are fully compatible with the data presented here and are supported by the finding that the AtCLC-d&#x02013;GFP compartments rapidly stained with endocytosed FM4-64. The fluorescence pattern of AtCLC-d&#x02013;GFP after BFA treatment is compatible with a function in the secretory pathway, as BFA at least partially blocks post-Golgi secretion and leads to rapid internalization of plasma membrane proteins into large aggregates containing Golgi compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hawes, 2005</xref>). The data presented here indicate that AtCLC-d and V-ATPase support growth in expanding cells by tight cooperation within the TGN.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants (ecotype Col-0) were grown in soil and transformed by spraying using the GV3101 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strain.
