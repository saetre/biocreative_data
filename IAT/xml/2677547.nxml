Pathogens also exploit this pathway to enter and exit the central nervous system. In this study, we characterised the binding, endocytosis and axonal transport of an adenovirus (CAV-2) that preferentially infects neurons. Using biochemical, cell biology, genetic, ultrastructural and live-cell imaging approaches, we show that interaction with the neuronal membrane correlates with coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) surface expression, followed by endocytosis involving clathrin. In axons, long-range CAV-2 motility was bidirectional with a bias for retrograde transport in nonacidic Rab7-positive organelles. Unexpectedly, we found that CAR was associated with CAV-2 vesicles that also transported cargo as functionally distinct as tetanus toxin, neurotrophins, and their receptors. These results suggest that a single axonal transport carrier is capable of transporting functionally distinct cargoes that target different membrane compartments in the soma. We propose that CAV-2 transport is dictated by an innate trafficking of CAR, suggesting an unsuspected function for this adhesion protein during neuronal homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Adenoviruses commonly cause subclinical morbidity in the ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts, and less frequently, adenovirus-induced disease can be fatal for newborns and immunocompromised hosts. In addition, adenoviruses can reach the central nervous system (CNS) and cause associated encephalitis and tumours. On the flip side, during the last two decades, adenovirus vectors have become powerful tools to treat and address diseases of the CNS. Despite the fact that axonal transport of adenoviruses was reported more than 15 years ago, nothing was known concerning how adenoviruses access the CNS. The characterization of their interactions with brain cells was therefore long overdue. In this study, we describe the axonal trafficking of an adenovirus that preferentially infects neurons and reaches the CNS through long-range axonal transport. We show that this adenovirus exploits an endogenous vesicular pathway used by the adhesion molecule CAR (coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor). Our study characterizes this endogenous route of access, which is likely to be crucial to neuronal survival, neurodegenerative diseases, gene transfer vectors, and adenovirus-induced morbidity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Adenoviridae</italic> is a family of greater than 150 nonenveloped double-stranded DNA viruses that infect all vertebrate classes.

Here, we characterised the binding, internalisation and axonal transport of an Ad that preferentially infects neurons. Our data suggest that the neuronal binding of CAV-2 is CAR-dependent and its internalisation involves clathrin-coated pits and the small GTPase Rab5. In contrast to the established paradigm of Ad trafficking in epithelial cells, long-range CAV-2 transport in axons is mainly vesicular, and depends on the sequential maturation of transported endosomes, which switch from Rab5 to Rab7. We found that CAV-2 axonal motility is bidirectional, with a bias for the retrograde direction. Carriers of CAV-2 also transported tetanus toxin and neurotrophin receptors and surprisingly still contained CAR. We also demonstrated that similarly to whole virions the fibre knob (FK) protein could be found in CAR<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> organelles. We therefore propose that the intrinsic neuronal properties of CAR are responsible for the efficient trafficking of CAV-2 in neurons. More globally, our data demonstrates that distinct receptor-mediated endocytic events determine the sorting of diverse cargoes to nonacidic vesicles, which are then recruited in a Rab7-dependent manner to the long-range retrograde transport pathway, in a process that allows selected pathogens to reach the CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CAV-2 binding correlates with CAR surface expression and uptake involves clathrin-coated pits</title><p>CAV-2 vectors preferential infect neuronal cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and in mixed brain cell cultures, however the binding determinants responsible for this tropism have not been addressed.

To study the neuronal link between CAR and CAV-2, we incubated Cy3-labelled CAV-2 virions (CAV-Cy3) with primary spinal cord motor neurons (MNs) on ice to allow binding, but prevent internalisation. Cells were then fixed and stained for endogenous CAR. Interestingly, CAR was found in two distinct compartments in MNs.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to address the determinants of Ad neurotropism and axonal transport. Axonal transport has been described for a handful of viruses, including rabies, herpes simplex type I (HSV-1), measles, West Nile and poliovirus. Although less common than the above pathogens, both human and canine Ad serotypes are associated with brain pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Kosulin1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Caudell1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably different mechanisms of axonal transport have been described: direct interaction with molecular motors for HSV-1 and rabies viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Smith1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> versus endosomal trafficking for poliovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Mueller1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our proposed model goes partially against the paradigm derived from prototype Ad trafficking studies performed in epithelial cells. We propose that the recognition of CAV-2 on the neuronal surface is primarily CAR-dependent. Internalisation involves CAR and clathrin-coated vesicles that acquire the early endosomal marker Rab5, yet apparently does not induce capsid disassembly and endosomal escape. These latter axonal vesicles mature into Rab7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> compartments that still contain CAR, and have the advantageous characteristic of being nonacidic. After a lag phase, long-range transport of CAV-2 entrapped in vesicular organelles becomes sustained and bidirectional, probably involving the concerted action of dynein and kinesin. Crucially, our data also suggest an innate function of CAR in axons dictating CAV-2 transport.</p><p>Endocytic progression is required for Ad infection and has been shown to differ mechanistically for different Ad serotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Leopold1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The lag phase observed before the onset of CAV-2 axonal transport, which is not seen in epithelial cells infected by CAV-2 or Ad2/5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Meier1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Chillon1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, was also similar to that observed for TeNT H<sub>C</sub> and p75<sup>NTR</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Deinhardt2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Although further studies will be needed to pinpoint the underlying causes of this delayed onset, a likely explanation is that it is due to cargo sorting and/or endosome maturation. The association of CAV-2 initially with Rab5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> early endosomes and then with a transport compartment containing Rab7 is also similar to TeNT H<sub>C</sub> trafficking. Interestingly, Rab7 effectors RILP and ORP1L can mediate the recruitment of cytoplasmic dynein to endosomes in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Johansson1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether Rab7 also directly recruits the dynein complex in axons is unknown, but might explain why, by reaching organelles containing Rab7, CAV-2 undergoes efficient axonal transport. Although other serotypes can reach Rab7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Miyazawa1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, there appears to be a functional difference between some of those found in axons and epithelial cells, one difference being that a population of Rab7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> endosomes in axons have lumens that are neutral. Using a marker described to traffic inside pH-neutral carriers (TeNT H<sub>C</sub>), CAV-2 linked to a pH-sensitive dye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Bohnert1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and Lysotracker, we showed that in contrast to virions in the cell body that can reach acidic organelles (pH 5&#x02013;5.5), the majority of axonal CAV-2 carriers had a pH ranging from 6 to 7. These data, combined with previous report of the pH of axonal organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Overly1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrate that the presence of Rab5 and Rab7 offer no indication of the pH of the endosomes or other organelles under investigation. Neurons appear to differ in the regulation of endosomal acidification that occur in their axons versus cell body. By entering nonacidic organelles in axons, CAV-2 could remain stably and efficiently associated with long-range carriers until delivered to the soma, where endosomal acidification could occur, triggering the exit from these compartments.</p><p>In light of these results, it is tempting to speculate that human Ad serotype 5 (HAd5), which can be retrogradely transported <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Akli1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-LeGalLaSalle1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and escapes endosomes when the pH drops below 6 in epithelial-like cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Miyazawa1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, could take advantage of a similar protective endocytic pathway to reach the neuronal cell body. Interestingly, when HAd5 and CAV-2 vectors were mixed and co-injected in the rodent brain, both are capable of axonal transport to afferent regions. However CAV-2 vectors are 50&#x02013;100 fold more efficient when transgene expression is used as a readout at distal sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Soudais1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Does HAd5 use a pathway similar to CAV-2? There are notable similarities and differences between HAd5 and CAV-2 that may affect their axonal transport. In the case of CAR as a binding site, our data have consistently suggested that CAV-2 is &#x0201c;CAR-tropic&#x0201d; while other studies have reported that HAd5 uses CAR, as well as other cell surface molecules for binding and internalisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Zhang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. CAV-2 is also more thermostable than HAd5 (unpublished data). <italic>A priori</italic>, we would predict that if an HAd5 virion binds CAR it could be taken up and transported in a manner similar to that seen by CAV-2. Using real time confocal microscopy we detected fast axonal transport of HAd5 in primary neurons (our unpublished data) suggesting, but not demonstrating, similarities in transport. We do not know if the increased thermal stability of CAV-2 versus HAd5 plays a role during vesicular maturation at, for example, the axon soma interface. The interaction with integrins via the HAd5 penton base may also make the HAd5 capsid more sensitive to disassembly triggers in the lumen of a Rab7 vesicle in axons.</p><p>The motility of CAV-2 showed an average retrograde speed above 1 &#x000b5;m/s, consistent with fast axonal transport. Notably, we found a minor population of CAV-2 and FK carriers undergoing bidirectional transport. Similar bidirectional transport was detected using FK to monitor CAR trafficking in axons. This feature is not unique to Ad: HSV-1 shows bidirectional transport with a bias for the retrograde direction during infection and displays a preferential anterograde transport during the phase of egress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Smith1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Smith2">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. However, bidirectional HSV-1 transport is via direct recruitment of motors to the viral capsid. The association of CAV-2 and CAR with organelles undergoing bidirectional movement is particularly interesting because the regulation of bidirectional transport is still poorly understood. In this regard, CAR- or CAV-2-containing endosomes could represent an ideal tool to address how vesicular cargo coordinates the recruitment of both classes of microtubule-dependent molecular motors, or how a main retrograde motor, such as cytoplasmic dynein, may switch to an anterograde direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Ross1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Dynactin may be a potential regulator of kinesin- and dynein-driven transport since it is able to simultaneously bind these two classes of motors. Interestingly, p50/dynamitin, a subunit of the dynactin complex, colocalised with CAV-2, and p50/dynamitin overexpression inhibited the axonal transport of virions. The observed impairment of CAV-2 transport by inhibition of either cytoplasmic dynein or kinesin-1 suggests that coordination between these two classes of motors is necessary to ensure efficient axonal retrograde transport, as previously observed for TeNT H<sub>C</sub> carriers and mitochondria (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Salinas1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p><italic>A priori</italic>, one could envisage that the internalised cargo, via its interaction with specific integral membrane proteins, dictates the directionality of the transport. In this light, although TeNT H<sub>C</sub> and CAV-2 share a high number of axonal carriers, together they move exclusively in the retrograde direction. In contrast, anterograde moving organelles contain CAR and CAV-2, but lack TeNT H<sub>C</sub>. This observation suggests the existence of discrete sorting steps during internalisation or <italic>en route</italic> endosomal maturation, which alter the ability of transported endosomes to recruit or activate anterograde and/or retrograde motor complexes. This may be achieved by engaging specific adaptor proteins able to co-ordinate motor complex activity, as in the case of huntingtin, which controls the directionality of vesicular carriers in cortical neurons via an Akt-dependent phosphorylation switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Colin1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although CAR is the main receptor for many Ad serotypes, little is known regarding its intracellular dynamics in neurons. In addition to a plasma membrane targeting, we found that CAR is also present on an internal vesicular pool. By means of competition experiments, we showed that the binding to CAR is an essential step for the entry of CAV-2. CAV-2 and its recombinant FK are taken up in CAR-containing vesicles, suggesting that the virus and its receptor could be endocytosed together and then co-transported. Notably though, our assays do not address whether fibres detach from the capsid, which is an early step in virion disassembly in epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Leopold1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the average size of CAV-2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> vesicles (100&#x02013;110 nm) versus the CAV-2 icosahedra core (&#x0223c;90 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Schoehn1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref> plus the projecting fibres (30 nm)), the most obvious prediction is that the fibres would be detached. However, the CAV-2 fibre shaft, in contrast to other Ads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Wu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, is particularly flexible due to the presence of two hinges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Schoehn1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. This added suppleness may allow the fibre to fold over whilst still attached to CAR in the lumen of the endosomes.</p><p>By using fluorescently-labelled CAV-2 FK, we also demonstrated that CAR undergoes endocytosis and bidirectional transport in cultured MNs and in sciatic nerve axons. These findings introduce a paradigm shift for the CAR-mediated endocytosis of Ads. As mentioned above, the available <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence is that CAR functions as a primary attachment site and that integrins are responsible for virus internalisation via the interaction with motifs in the Ad penton base.

In this light, it will be critical to determine if the FK induces clustering of CAR, which in turn triggers internalisation of ligand-receptor clusters, or if other mechanisms are involved. Interestingly, the affinity of the CAV-2 FK to CAR is 5 to 7-fold times greater than that of HAd5 knob-CAR and the highest reported for an Ad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Seiradake1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The roles of CAR as an adhesion molecule and key component of tight junctions are well established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000442-Freimuth1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Notably, our <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data demonstrate that CAR is found inside axons even in absence of an exogenous &#x0201c;ligand&#x0201d;, and also link CAR directly or indirectly to the axonal transport machinery.

The ligated sciatic nerve was removed, post-fixed for 4 hours in the same fixative and then cryoprotected in 30&#x00025; sucrose in PBS. The animals were housed in a controlled temperature and humidity environment and maintained on a 12 hour light/dark cycle with access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000442.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>CAR neuronal localisation and CAV-2 entry.
