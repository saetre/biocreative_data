Mutagenesis on P2X<sub>1</sub> receptors of conserved residues in mammalian P2X receptors has established the paradigm that three lysine residues, as well as FT and NFR motifs, play an important role in mediating ATP action. In this study we have determined whether cysteine substitution mutations of equivalent residues in P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors have similar effects and if these mutant receptors can be regulated by charged methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compounds. All the mutants (except the P2X<sub>2</sub> K69C and K71C that were expressed, but non-functional) showed a significant decrease in ATP potency, with &#x0003e;300-fold decreases for mutants of the conserved asparagine, arginine, and lysine residues close to the end of the extracellular loop. MTS reagents had no effect at the phenylalanine of the FT motif, in contrast, cysteine mutation of the threonine was sensitive to MTS reagents and suggested a role of this residue in ATP action. The lysine-substituted receptors were sensitive to the charge of the MTS reagent consistent with the importance of positive charge at this position for coordination of the negatively charged phosphate of ATP. At the NFR motif the asparagine and arginine residues were sensitive to MTS reagents, whereas the phenylalanine was either unaffected or showed only a small decrease. These results support a common site of ATP action at P2X receptors and suggest that non-conserved residues also play a regulatory role in agonist action.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the <grant-sponsor>Wellcome Trust</grant-sponsor>.

Seven P2X receptor genes have been identified (P2X<sub>1&#x02013;7</sub>) and the subunits form functional homo- and heterotrimeric ion channels with a variety of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). ATP is released from neurons, in response to shear stress, as well as from damaged cells. P2X receptors have been shown to be involved in a wide range of physiological roles including blood clotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>), sensory perception (including pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), bladder voiding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), and taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>)), as well as bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). As the receptors provide novel drug targets for a range of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) an understanding of the agonist binding site would be useful for rational drug design. However, it is clear that common ATP binding sequences, <italic>e.g.</italic> the Walker motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), are not present in P2X receptors. In the absence of a crystal structure a site-directed mutagenesis approach has been used to gain insight into amino acids important in mediating the actions of ATP at P2X receptors.</p><p>We have used the human P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor and alanine mutagenesis of conserved residues in the extracellular loop (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) to propose a model of the ATP binding site (reviewed in Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Cysteine substitution mutagenesis and charged methanethiosulfonate (MTS)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref> compounds have been useful in investigating a variety of ion channels including the pore region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) as well as residues involved in ATP action/sensitivity at P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). We have used this approach to study the contribution of the 44 amino acids before the second transmembrane domain to ATP action at the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). For example, we have shown that for the mutant K309C, ATP potency and binding of radiolabeled 2-azido-ATP is reduced. The K309C mutant was also accessible to MTS reagents. When positively charged MTSEA ((2-aminoethyl)-methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide) modifies a free cysteine residue it produces a positively charged side chain of similar size to lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). MTSEA application rescued ATP potency at K309C supporting that the charged lysine at this position plays a role in coordinating the binding of the negatively charged phosphate tail of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). In addition our work with alanine and cysteine mutants has also identified residues that are unlikely to play a major role in ATP action (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Taken together our work has given rise to a model of the ATP binding site with the phosphate tail of ATP bound to residues Lys<sup>68</sup> and Lys<sup>309</sup>, and the aromatic ring sandwiched between residues Phe<sup>185</sup>-Thr<sup>186</sup> and Asn<sup>290</sup>-Phe<sup>291</sup>-Arg<sup>292</sup>. This is supported by a recent study on the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor showing that substituted cysteine mutants of residues Lys<sup>68</sup> and Phe<sup>291</sup> can form an intersubunit disulfide bond and this is inhibited in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). The model is also corroborated by some mutagenesis studies from P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). However, an alternative model of ATP action at the P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor based on a similarity in predicted structure to the tRNA synthetases has also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). In this study to determine whether P2X receptor subunits share a core common mode of ATP action we tested at P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors whether cysteine mutagenesis of the residues corresponding to those proposed in the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor model have any effects on ATP potency or the action of MTS reagents.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence line-up of the extracellular domain of human P2X<sub>1&#x02013;7</sub> receptors and the <italic>Dictostelium discoideum</italic> (<italic>Dict</italic>) P2X receptor (</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37"><bold>37</bold></xref><bold>).</bold> Residues conserved in at least 5 of the human P2X receptors are shown in <italic>red</italic>.

Human P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor plasmid (gift of Dr. Andrew Powell, GlaxoSmithKline, United Kingdom) contained the sequence of the P2X<sub>2a</sub> isoform (Q9UBL9) with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal variant MAAAQPKYPAGATA &#x02192; MV as described.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref> For the rat P2X<sub>4</sub>-myc (gift of Dr. Francois Rassendren, CNRS, Montpellier, France), the mutant Y378A was created and used as the template for more stable currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Production of the correct mutations and absence of coding errors in the P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> mutant constructs was verified by DNA sequencing (Automated ABI Sequencing Service, University of Leicester).</p><p><italic>Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes</italic>&#x02014;Wild type and mutant constructs were transcribed to produce sense strand cRNA (mMessage mMachine&#x02122;, Ambion, TX) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Manually defoliculated stage V <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes were injected with 50 nl (50 ng) of cRNA using an Inject+Matic microinjector (J. Alejandro Gaby, Gen&#x000e9;va, Switzerland) and stored at 18 &#x000b0;C in ND96 buffer (96 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 2 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 1.8 m<sc>m</sc> CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 m<sc>m</sc> sodium pyruvate, 5 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, pH 7.6). Media was changed daily prior to recording 3&#x02013;7 days later.</p><p><italic>Electrophysiological Recordings</italic>&#x02014;Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings (at a holding potential of &#x02013;60 mV) were carried out on cRNA-injected oocytes using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier with a Digidata 1322 analog to digital converter and pClamp 8.2 acquisition software (Axon Instruments) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Native oocyte calcium-activated chloride currents in response to P2X receptor stimulation were reduced by replacing 1.8 m<sc>m</sc> CaCl<sub>2</sub> with 1.8 m<sc>m</sc> BaCl<sub>2</sub> in the ND96 bath solution. ATP (magnesium salt, Sigma) was applied via a U-tube perfusion system. ATP (0.1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> to 10 m<sc>m</sc>) was applied at 5-min intervals, using this regime reproducible ATP-evoked responses were recorded. Individual concentration-response curves were fitted with the Hill equation: <italic>Y</italic> = [(<italic>X</italic>)<sup>H</sup> &#x000d7; <italic>M</italic>]/[(<italic>X</italic>)<sup>H</sup> + (EC<sub>50</sub>)<sup>H</sup>], where <italic>Y</italic> is response, <italic>X</italic> is agonist concentration, <italic>H</italic> is the Hill coefficient, <italic>M</italic> is maximum response, and EC<sub>50</sub> is the concentration of agonist evoking 50% of the maximum response. pEC<sub>50</sub> is the &#x02013;log<sub>10</sub> of the EC<sub>50</sub> value. Mutants that had considerably shifted ATP potency were tested with ATP concentrations up to 10 m<sc>m</sc>. For the calculation of EC<sub>50</sub> values individual concentration-response curves were generated for each experiment and statistical analysis carried out on the pEC<sub>50</sub> data generated. In the figures, concentration-response curves are fitted to the mean normalized data.</p><p><italic>Characterization of the Effects of Methanethiosulfonate Compounds</italic>&#x02014;To study the effect of MTS compounds on ATP activation at wild type and cysteine mutants, ATP (&#x0223c;EC<sub>50</sub> concentration) was applied and either MTSEA or sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) were bath-perfused (for at least 5 min; the recovery time required between application to see reproducible responses) prior to coapplication with ATP via the U-tube as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). MTS reagents (1 m<sc>m</sc>) were made in ND96 solution immediately prior to use. MTS reagents were applied for 10 min with the maximal, or near maximal response seen after 5 min. The effects of the MTS reagents on the P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor mutants were the same following washout of the compounds showing that they irreversibly modified the receptors.</p><p>The effects of the MTS compounds on the mutant P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors were reversible following a 5&#x02013;10 min washout. The P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor has been shown to be subject to extensive constitutive and agonist induced trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) even for the Y378A mutant used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). To determine whether longer incubations could be used to irreversibly modify P2X<sub>4</sub> mutant receptors we treated the oocytes for 3 h in the presence of MTSES (1 m<sc>m</sc>) and 3.2 units/ml of apyrase to break down any endogenous ATP, or just apyrase. This longer incubation was aimed to modify more of the pool of P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors. This was followed by washing and subsequent testing of responses to an EC<sub>50</sub> concentration of ATP (in the absence of MTSES). This treatment had no effect on the amplitude of WT P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor currents, however, reductions of the mutants were equivalent to those where MTSES was present during the recordings demonstrating that any changes in properties for the mutant receptors result from irreversible modification of introduced cysteine residues and that cysteine residues were available in the resting un-liganded state of the receptor. MTS reagents have a reasonably short half-life and this suggests that the 1 m<sc>m</sc> concentration used is supramaximal and there was still sufficient reagent present during the 3-h incubation to irreversibly modify the receptors. These results suggest that the reversal of MTS effects following washout of short applications is likely to result from trafficking of un-modified receptors to the cell surface and longer incubations are required to irreversibly modify the whole pool of P2X<sub>4</sub> mutant receptors. We have therefore presented data for effects on an EC<sub>50</sub> concentration of ATP during the presence of the MTS reagents as this allows us to analyze data from the same oocyte before and during application of the reagents.</p><p>The effects of MTS reagents on the concentration responses to ATP for P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors were investigated following washout of MTSEA (applied at 1 m<sc>m</sc> for 10 min in the absence of agonist), there was no effect on WT responses. For P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors the effects of MTSEA on concentration responses were investigated by application of ATP following incubating the oocytes for 1 h in MTSEA (1 m<sc>m</sc>) and washout of MTSEA. ATP concentrations were applied via the U-tube with ND96 bathing solution (no MTS reagents present).</p><p><italic>Western Blotting</italic>&#x02014;Expression levels of wild type and mutant receptors were estimated by Western blot analysis of total cellular protein and cell surface proteins. Total cellular protein samples were prepared from oocytes injected with wild type or mutant receptor cRNA homogenized in buffer H (100 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 20 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 &#x003bc;l/ml protease inhibitor mixture) at 20 &#x003bc;l/oocyte. Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) labels cell surface proteins by reacting with primary amines and was used to estimate the level of wild type or mutant receptor trafficked to the cell surface membrane. Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin is impermeable to the cell membrane and can only biotinylate proteins available at the cell surface. Oocytes injected with wild type or mutant receptor cRNA were treated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (0.5 mg/ml) in ND96 for 30 min and washed with ND96. Oocytes were homogenized in buffer H, and the spin-cleared supernatant was mixed with streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) treated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). All samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer and heated to 95 &#x000b0;C for 5 min prior to loading. Samples were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and screened for immunoreactivity for the anti-P2X<sub>2</sub> or P2X<sub>4</sub> antibody (1:500) (Alomone, Israel).</p><p><italic>Analysis</italic>&#x02014;All data are shown as mean &#x000b1; S.E. Significant differences between WT and mutant maximum current amplitudes, agonist potency, and MTS reagent modification were calculated by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test for comparisons of individual mutants against control using the GraphPad Prism package. Differences in mutant concentration response curves for individual mutants, on treatment with MTSEA, were tested with Student's <italic>t</italic> test. <italic>n</italic> corresponds to the number of oocytes tested for electrophysiological data.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p><italic>Effects of Cysteine Mutants on ATP Responses at P2X<sub>2</sub> Receptors</italic>&#x02014;At WT human P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors ATP evoked concentration-dependent inward currents with an EC<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;13 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) similar to that reported previously for this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Robust currents were also recorded for F183C, T184C, and F289C mutants, however, they showed a modest 4&#x02013;10-fold decrease in ATP potency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The peak amplitude of currents to a maximal concentration of ATP (10 m<sc>m</sc>) were reduced by &#x0223c;90% for the mutant R290C and for this receptor the amplitude of responses continued to increase between 3 and 10 m<sc>m</sc> indicating the EC<sub>50</sub> is &#x0003e;3 m<sc>m</sc> ATP. At mutants N288C and K307C 10 m<sc>m</sc> ATP evoked very small currents suggesting that the EC<sub>50</sub> for these receptors is &#x0003e;3 m<sc>m</sc>. No currents were recorded in response to 10 m<sc>m</sc> ATP for mutants K69C and K71C. Analysis of the expression of both total and surface levels of P2X<sub>2</sub> WT and mutant receptors with reduced peak current amplitudes showed that there was at most an &#x0223c;50% reduction in surface expression (K307C), predicting a halving in peak current amplitude, however, there was a &#x0003e;97% reduction in amplitudes for K69C, K71C, and N288C. This indicates that any reductions in current amplitude compared with WT were predominantly due to an effect on channel properties and not trafficking to the cell surface. Overall these results are consistent with those from similar mutants for the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>).</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of the effects of cysteine substitution on P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub></bold></p><p>Peak current values taken on 1st application of a maximal concentration of ATP (a saturating concentration 300 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> to 10 m<sc>m</sc>). pEC<sub>50</sub> values shown as calculated from experimental data. pEC<sub>50</sub> is &#x02013;log10 of the EC<sub>50</sub>.

The substituted cysteine accessibility method has been used to look at the contribution of introduced cysteine mutants to receptor function, where modification of properties following application of MTS reagents indicates that the introduced cysteine residue is accessible in the aqueous environment and may play an important role in receptor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>).

MTSEA had no effect on the potency of ATP and current amplitudes returned to control levels on washout.

At T184C there was an increase in potentiation to 195 &#x000b1; 11% of control, however, on washout this was reduced to 141 &#x000b1; 11% of control indicating that it results from a combination of the reversible effect seen for WT and an additional irreversible modification. R290C and K307C MTSEA produced a significantly larger increase in the response to an EC<sub>50</sub> concentration of ATP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) that was sustained on washout indicating that it results from irreversible modification of the introduced cysteine.</p><p>At R290C the amplitude of responses was still rising in response to increases from 3 to 10 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, indicating a large decrease in ATP sensitivity at this mutant. MTSEA application for 10 min in the absence of agonist resulted in a large increase in amplitude of responses and a leftward shift in the concentration response to ATP and now a fully saturating concentration response was generated following MTSEA treatment (pEC<sub>50</sub> values 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.1, estimated from a free fit as responses did not saturate for control, to 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.2, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, for MTSEA, <italic>n</italic> = 3&#x02013;4) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

As MTSEA was able to rescue the responses to mutants with small amplitude currents we tested whether MTSEA had any effect on mutants where receptor protein could be detected at the cell surface but little or no current was detected in response to high concentrations of ATP. At N288C the responses to ATP (3 m<sc>m</sc>) were reduced to 22 &#x000b1; 5% of control following MTSEA treatment, this effect was sustained on MTSEA washout.

MTSES, however, reduced the amplitude of response to an EC<sub>50</sub> concentration of ATP by &#x0223c;80% for mutants T184C, N288C, R290C, and K307C, a more modest &#x0223c;20% decrease was recorded at F289C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These effects were maintained following washout of MTSES indicating that the reagent was acting irreversibly to modify the introduced cysteine residues.

It is known that P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors undergo cyclical trafficking to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>) so we decided to see whether longer incubation with the MTS reagents had an irreversible effect. In addition, as the MTS reagents were applied before and during ATP application the question arises as to whether the introduced cysteines are accessible in the un-liganded or ligand bound state. To address these questions we incubated mutant P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors in membrane impermeant MTSES (1 m<sc>m</sc>) in the presence of apyrase (3.2 units/ml to break down any endogenous ATP in the solutions) for 3 h followed by washing. This treatment had no effect on the amplitude of WT P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors compared with oocytes treated with just apyrase. For the mutants, however, there was a significant reduction in the amplitude of responses for the mutants K67C, K69C, T186C, N293C, R295C, and K313C (8 &#x000b1; 1, 10 &#x000b1; 3, 10 &#x000b1; 3, 35 &#x000b1; 8, 25 &#x000b1; 6, and 17 &#x000b1; 4.7% of ATP responses following apyrase treatment only and washing, with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, 0.001, 0.005, 0.005, 0.005, 0.01, respectively, <italic>n</italic> = 4&#x02013;7). These results show that longer incubations with MTS reagents are required to irreversibly modify the receptors, give equivalent results to bath-applied MTSES, and suggest that washout following short applications of MTS reagents (5&#x02013;10 min) results from trafficking of un-modified mutant P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors to the cell surface. These results also demonstrate that these introduced cysteine residues are accessible in the absence of agonist. This is consistent with previous studies on the P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor indicating that MTS effects at the region around Lys<sup>69</sup> and Lys<sup>71</sup> are blocked by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) and MTSEA biotinylation studies on the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor showing that mutants N290C, F291C, R292C, and K309C are MTSEA biotinylated in the absence of ATP and this is reduced following application of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). Taken together these results show that the MTS reagents are acting at introduced cysteine residues that are accessible in the absence of ligand.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of point cysteine P2X<sub>4</sub> mutations on ATP potency.</bold> ATP potency was tested on WT and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor mutants expressed in oocytes by two-electrode voltage clamp (holding potential = &#x02013;60 mV). <italic>A</italic>, trace data representative of currents observed for wild type and mutant receptors in response to ATP applications (indicated by <italic>bar</italic>, concentration in micromolar) at 5-min intervals. <italic>B</italic>, concentration-response curves to ATP for WT and mutants K67C, K69C, F185C, T186C, N293C, F294C, R295C, and K313C.

Mutagenesis of these residues has shown a marked decrease in agonist potency at a variety of receptors with the majority of the mutations resulting in a shift in EC<sub>50</sub> to &#x0003e;3 m<sc>m</sc> and in some cases, <italic>e.g.</italic> P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors, currents are below the limit of detection even at high agonist concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). At P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors ATP sensitivity at K67C, K69C, and K313C was increased on treatment with MTSEA, consistent with the fact that the incorporation of MTSEA at cysteine produces a side chain of similar size and charge to lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). In contrast, responses were reduced by 80&#x02013;95% following treatment with negatively charged MTSES. This clearly indicates that the localized charge at these three positions plays an important role in regulating ATP action at the receptor. For P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors a response to ATP was not evoked even following MTS treatment at mutants K69C and K71C. One feature that is common to the P2X<sub>1,2,4</sub> receptors is that the decrease in ATP potency at the cysteine mutant of the residue equivalent to Lys<sup>309</sup> in the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor can be rescued by treatment with MTSEA, consistent with an important role of positive charge at this position. A recent study on the P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor using single channel analysis has suggested the lysine residue 308 can play a role in regulation of gating of the channel. This was based on the fact that mutation of this residue could abolish spontaneous gating of the T339S mutant P2X<sub>2</sub> channel and that mutation K308R reduced ATP potency by &#x0223c;200-fold and decreased the amplitude of the maximal response compared with control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). In the current study the concentration responses to P2X<sub>2</sub> K307C and P2X<sub>4</sub> K313C did not saturate so it is not possible to determine whether there was a reduction in the amplitude of the maximal response. At the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor the &#x0223c;200-fold reduction in ATP potency at K309R and K309C mutants did not result in a decrease in the amplitude of the maximal response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) as would have been expected if an effect on gating of the receptor has been primarily responsible for the reduction in potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). These results suggest that the effects of mutation of this conserved residue can be manifest as a principal effect on ATP binding at the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) and an additional effect on gating at the P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). This may indicate that in the P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor the lysine residue interacts with another amino acid that is not conserved at the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor to regulate gating. Taken together these results support that the three positively charged lysine residues play an important role in ATP action most likely contributing to the ATP binding site. Indeed it would be unusual to have an ATP-binding protein without positive charge being important in coordinating agonist binding.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of MTS compounds on ATP potency at P2X<sub>4</sub> cysteine mutants.</bold><italic>A</italic>, MTSEA significantly increased the potency of ATP and amplitude of responses at K67C mutants. <italic>B</italic>, MTSEA significantly increased the potency of ATP and amplitude of responses at K69C mutants. <italic>C</italic>, MTSEA significantly increased ATP potency and peak response at K313C mutants (<italic>n</italic> = 3&#x02013;4).

For MTSEA treatment (1 m<sc>m</sc>, 1 h incubation, followed by washout and construction of the concentration response in the absence of MTSEA) these have been corrected with a scaling factor corresponding to the mean -fold increase, at 3 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, in currents compared with untreated oocytes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0320843800007"></graphic></fig></p><p>The mutations of conserved aromatics F183C in P2X<sub>2</sub> and F185C in the P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor gave rise to a modest 3- and 20-fold decrease in ATP potency at the receptors. This is consistent with previous studies on P2X<sub>1</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>) and indicates that this conserved residue contributes to ATP action. The MTS reagents used are of similar size (or smaller) than ATP and can gain access to the ATP binding pocket. The effects of the MTS compounds at cysteine mutants of the adjacent threonine residue (T184C and T186C for P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub>, respectively) suggest that this region of the receptor is accessible to these reagents and the lack of effect at the cysteine-substituted phenylalanine residues is likely to reflect that this residue is either not very close to the ATP binding pocket or is involved in interaction with other residues that could regulate gating. The former interpretation suggests that the phenylalanine may not play a direct role in binding of the adenine ring of ATP as we have suggested previously for the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). However, cysteine substitution does give rise to changes in agonist action at the receptor. The introduction of a polar side chain (cysteine) to replace the non-polar phenylalanine could have an effect on bonding/electrostatic interactions or a structural change to the receptor.</p><p>Mutation of threonine in the conserved FT motif to cysteine resulted in a 10- and 40-fold decrease in ATP potency at P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors. Previous studies on the P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor have shown that alanine substitution at this residue deceases ATP potency by &#x0223c;100-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). This is the first time a mutation has been made at this position for the P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors and it supports a similar mode of agonist action as P2X<sub>1</sub> and P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors. At P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors the response was inhibited by MTSES. These results clearly indicate that modification of the side chain at this conserved threonine residue can regulate channel function. Close to the FT motif is a nearby conserved lysine residue that has been shown to be involved in regulating ATP potency (Lys<sup>190</sup> in P2X<sub>1</sub> and Lys<sup>188</sup> in P2X<sub>2</sub> that when mutated to alanine resulted in &#x0223c;10- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) and &#x0223c;100-fold decreases in ATP potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>)). Thus this region in the middle of the extracellular loop of the channel plays a role in regulation of ATP potency, however, whether this results from an effect on agonist binding and/or gating remains to be determined. What is clear is that residues involved in agonist action at P2X receptors are not just focused around regions close to the transmembrane segments and the pore of the channel.</p><p>At the conserved NFR motif cysteine substitution at Asn and Arg reduced ATP potency by &#x0003e;300-fold and gave marked reductions in peak current amplitudes (&#x0003e;80%) at P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors. The asparagine to cysteine mutation had the same effect at P2X<sub>2</sub> (N288C) and P2X<sub>4</sub> (N293C) receptors with inhibition of currents by either MTS reagent as reported previously for P2X<sub>1</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The reduction of ATP responses at the mutants of the conserved arginine by MTSES is the same for P2X<sub>1,2,4</sub> receptors, however, MTSEA inhibited P2X<sub>1</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors, but potentiated the P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> and this study, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This shows that the P2X<sub>1</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors are similar in that the MTS reagents interfere with the action of ATP in a way that is charge independent. However, for P2X<sub>2</sub> the results are consistent with the polarity of charge at this position being important. When the phenylalanine of the NFR motif was replaced with cysteine there was only a modest &#x0223c;4-fold reduction in ATP potency, no effect on peak current amplitude, and MTS reagents were ineffective. This suggests that at P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors the conservation of the asparagine and arginine residues is more important in regulating the actions of ATP than the phenylalanine of which they are adjacent. At P2X<sub>1</sub> receptors and a non-desensitizing chimeric P2X<sub>1/2</sub> receptor, marked effects of &#x0003e;100-fold decrease in ATP potency with no effect on the peak response were recorded with the equivalent mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Taken together these results show that whereas there are marked similarities between the receptors, there are also differences in regulation of ATP potency between the P2X receptor subunits (<italic>e.g.</italic> the effects of MTSEA on cysteine substitution of the arginine of the NFR motif). This is consistent with variations in the pharmacological properties of P2X receptors and suggests that non-conserved amino acids are associated with agonist action.</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>TABLE 2</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of data for the effects of MTS reagents at P2X receptor cysteine mutants</bold></p><p>Arrows correspond to significant effects of MTS reagents on ATP responses.

We have previously shown, for P2X<sub>1</sub> receptors, that reductions in ATP potency at cysteine mutants of the NFR motif are likely to result from effects on agonist binding at Arg<sup>292</sup> and effects on both binding and gating for Asn<sup>290</sup> and Phe<sup>291</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The contribution of this region to the agonist binding site is supported by a recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) showing that the phenylalanine is close to the conserved Lys<sup>68</sup> residue in the P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor and cysteine mutants K68C and F291C can form an inter-subunit disulfide bond and this is inhibited by ATP, suggesting that both residues are close to the ATP binding site. Similarly a recent single channel study on P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors reported that the reduction of ATP potency for the K69A mutant of the P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor results predominantly from an effect on agonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). So how may the NFR region be involved in coordination of ATP binding? Previously we had suggested that the phenylalanine residues in the NFR motif were involved in binding of the adenine ring of ATP. However, the present results from P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors with modest changes in ATP for cysteine mutants of these phenylalanines and the lack of effect of MTS reagents on ATP responses suggests that the conserved aromatic residue may not contribute directly to agonist recognition. The inhibition of cysteine-substituted mutants of the arginine of the NFR motif for P2X<sub>1</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors by both positive and negatively charged MTS reagents suggests that arginine is not directly involved in binding of the phosphate tail of ATP. This suggests that asparagine and arginine are most likely involved in binding of the ribose and/or adenine ring of ATP.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of the ATP binding site at P2X receptors.</bold> Portions of the extracellular loop adjacent to either the first (in <italic>gray</italic>) or second (in <italic>black</italic>) transmembrane domain are shown for two adjacent P2X receptor subunits (numbering for the P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor).

The conserved FT motif also contributes to agonist action, however, whether this results from an effect on agonist binding and/or gating remains to be determined.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">North, R.
