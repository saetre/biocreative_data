It is categorized into three clinical subtypes based on age of onset and severity of sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular areflexia, and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Usher syndrome type I (USH1) is the most severe clinical subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>] and is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder. There are seven USH1 loci (<italic>USH1B</italic>, <italic>USH1C</italic>, <italic>USH1D</italic>, <italic>USH1E</italic>, <italic>USH1F</italic>, <italic>USH1G</italic>, and <italic>USH1H</italic>), and the causative genes for five of the loci have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. The USH1 proteins myosin VIIa (<italic>USH1B</italic>), harmonin (<italic>USH1C</italic>), cadherin 23 (<italic>USH1D</italic>), protocadherin 15 (<italic>USH1F</italic>), and sans (<italic>USH1G</italic>) interact with each other in the inner ear and retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p><p>In humans, some cadherin 23 (<italic>CDH23</italic>) missense mutations cause nonsyndromic deafness (DFNB12), whereas truncating nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations have been reported to cause USH1D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Most of the reported mutations of mouse <italic>Cdh23</italic> cause the <italic>waltzer</italic> phenotype, which is deafness and vestibular dysfunction but no retinal degeneration. <italic>Waltzer</italic> mice are therefore models of DFNB12 nonsyndromic deafness and not USH1D even though at least 11 of the 12 mutant alleles of <italic>Cdh23</italic> are hypothesized to be functional null alleles and are caused by nonsense (<italic>Cdh23<sup>v-3J</sup></italic>, <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-5J</sup></italic>, <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-6J</sup></italic>), frameshift (<italic>Cdh23<sup>v</sup></italic>, <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-J</sup></italic>, <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-4J</sup></italic>, <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-7J</sup>, Cdh23<sup>v-Alb</sup></italic>), or splice site (<italic>Cdh23<sup>v-2J</sup>, Cdh23<sup>v-ngt</sup>, Cdh23<sup>v-bus</sup></italic>) mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. One missense mutation, <italic>Cdh23<sup>sals</sup></italic>, appears to be a hypomorph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Although there are mouse models for retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], thus far all waltzer mice do not develop RP and are therefore not models for USH1D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. The same is true for mouse mutants of the other USH1 genes including <italic>Myo7a</italic>, <italic>Pcdh15</italic>, <italic>Sans,</italic> and <italic>harmonin.</italic> Even those mutant alleles, reported to be nulls, have lacked significant retinal phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. An exception is the <italic>Ush2a</italic> null mouse, which develops progressive photoreceptor degeneration and moderate nonprogressive hearing loss akin to human <italic>USH2A</italic> patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>].</p><p>The longest <italic>Cdh23</italic> transcript (<italic>Cdh23_v1a</italic>) comprises 69 exons encoding 3,354 amino acid residues of a single pass transmembrane protein with 27 extracellular cadherin repeats (ECs). Originally, two <italic>Cdh23</italic> splice isoforms were reported that differed with respect to the presence or absence of exon 68, which encodes a portion of the cytoplasmic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. The CDH23 isoform, lacking the 35 residues encoded by exon 68 (<italic>Cdh23_v1b</italic>), is predominantly expressed in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. The CDH23 cytoplasmic domain has two putative PDZ binding motifs (PBM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). These PBMs of CDH23 appear to interact with the PDZ domain-containing USH1C protein, harmonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], and with the scaffold protein MAGI-1, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family, that was shown to bind to the C-terminal PBM of CDH23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Isoforms, antisera, and expression of cadherin 23 isoforms. <bold>A</bold>: This panel illustrates schematically (not drawn to scale) four classes of <italic>Cdh23</italic> transcripts (GeneID 22295), CDH23 protein isoforms, and the locations of TaqMan probes.

CDH23 is also a component of the tip link complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>] together with the tip link antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>] identified by us as protocadherin 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. The tip link connects the tips of the shorter stereocilia to the side of its taller neighbor and gates the mechanotransduction channels located on the tops of stereocilia in all but the tallest row [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Recently, Rzadzinska and Steel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>] have shown that in the <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-2J</sup> waltzer</italic> mice, tip links are present in stereocilia bundles of young hair cells, calling into question the role of cadherin 23 as a component of the tip link and suggesting that the molecular composition of the tip link is not yet fully resolved. However, the small amounts of normally processed <italic>Cdh23</italic> transcript (approximately 4%) reported in the <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-2J</sup></italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>] may be sufficient wild-type expression to explain the formation of tip links in homozygous <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-2J</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>There is a range of <italic>Cdh23</italic> transcripts that results from alternate promoter usage (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/50254107">AY563163</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/56118747">AY563164</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/50254099">AY563159</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/50254101">AY563160</ext-link>) or alternate splicing of cassette exons (GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/26086963">AK039126</ext-link>).

We undertook this study to better characterize cadherin 23 mRNA and protein isoform expression to gain insight into their roles in the retina and inner ear. We demonstrate that <italic>Cdh23</italic> transcripts are developmentally regulated and have tissue-specific expression profiles. The temporal expression patterns suggest specific roles for some <italic>Cdh23</italic> transcripts. For example, in the inner ear, <italic>Cdh23_v2</italic> expression between P0 to P14 is consistent with the critical period of inner ear development. By P14, when <italic>Cdh23_v2</italic> is expressed at very low levels, all turns of the cochlea have reached their adult size, most vestibular sensory cells have matured, and vestibular sensory epithelia have reached their adult shape and size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>]. Furthermore, electrical events that lead to the onset of hearing, occurring at approximately P21, are already detectable during this period including the endocochlear potential (roughly around P12) and Preyer reflex (around P12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. In the retina, <italic>Cdh23_v4</italic> expression between P0 to P21 is consistent with the time period in which major visual developmental events occur such as the peak of rod neurogenesis (around P0), the onset of retinal waves (approximately P1), and eye opening at approximately P13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we show that CDH23_V3 is expressed in the synaptic region of photoreceptor cells, and in the synaptic region of auditory and vestibular hair cells. We do not speculate on CDH23_V3 function at this location, but note that this isoform does not have extracellular or transmembrane domains. However the PDZ binding motifs remain intact, indicating it may play a part in the scaffolding network of USH proteins at the synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>].</p><p>The overall expression profile we show here for CDH23 in the outer nuclear layer, the synapse in the outer plexiform layer, and in the ciliary apparatus at the inner segment of photoreceptor cells is in agreement with previous CDH23 localization data in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. It also overlaps with the localization of the USH proteins sans (USH1G), whirlin (USH2D), and VLGR1b, supporting CDH23 as a component of the USH retinal protein network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>]. In this study we show more specifically that in the ciliary apparatus, CDH23 localizes to the basal body and not to the connecting cilium. The presence of CDH23 in the basal bodies and centrioles of photoreceptors cells is in agreement with its localization in the centrosomes of auditory and vestibular hair cells. Basal bodies are analogous to centrioles that are considered to be microtubule organizers as well as the structures from which cilia extend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible that CDH23 plays a role in cilia development or maintenance, and in the organization of microtubules.</p><p>Our western blot analyses indicated that CDH23 protein isoform expression varies between the mouse inner ear and retina. CDH23_V1 (the longest CDH23 protein isoform) was only detected at P0-P10 in the wild-type inner ear. It was not detected in the adult wild-type inner ear or in the young and adult homozygous <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-6J</sup></italic> mutant inner ear. The lack of CDH23_V1 expression in homozygous <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-6J</sup></italic> mutant mice inner ear is likely to be the cause for deafness and circling behavior of mutant mice, presumably due to the disruption of hair cell bundle architecture and perhaps the tip link.</p><p>CDH23_V1 was also not detected in wild-type or <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-6J</sup></italic> mouse retina at any time point. This observation is inconsistent with a previous report of western analysis demonstrating CDH23_V1 in mouse, rat, and human retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. We were successful in detecting CDH23_V1 in mature human and primate retinas perhaps due to a higher expression level of CDH23_V1 in these tissues. It is possible that the low abundance of CDH23_V1 in mature hair cells and in the mouse retina together with reduced sensitivity of our antibodies made it difficult for us to detect CDH23_V1. Nevertheless, human and mouse retinas appeared to express different CDH23 protein isoforms. Consistent with our data, it is plausible that CDH23_V1 is not expressed or is expressed at low levels in the mouse retina. Williams et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>] reported that the largest harmonin isoforms were not expressed in the mouse retina. The absence of CDH23_V1 raises the question of whether a mouse model for USH1D is possible.</p><p>Localization studies of CDH23 in the monkey retina indicate expression of CDH23 in the ciliary region, the outer plexiform layer, and in the outer and inner nuclear layer of photoreceptor cells as observed in the mouse retina. Unlike in the mouse photoreceptor cells, CDH23 is localized in the base of the inner segments of monkey cone photoreceptor cells. Considering that cytoskeletal-dependent mechanisms occur in the inner segment of the photoreceptor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>], it is possible that CDH23_V1 expression in the inner segment of the primate photoreceptor cells is a representation of the fundamental differences that exist between the human and mouse vision processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we show here that CDH23 protein isoforms are localized in discrete compartments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina and the inner ear. We also show that CDH23 has several wild-type isoforms shorter than CDH23_V1, and demonstrate that there are differences in CDH23 isoform expression between mice and primates. If one of the short isoforms of CDH23 in the mouse retina performs the function of the long isoform of CDH23 in primates, then studying the expression and function of these shorter wild-type isoforms in the mouse retina may lead to a creation of a mouse model for USH1D. A knockout model of CDH23 cytoplasmic domain shared by the majority of CDH23 isoforms would test this hypothesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Ronna Hertzano and Doris Wu for their critical reading of the manuscript.
