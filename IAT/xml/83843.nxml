Our aim was to assess whether, in addition to targeting the known autoantigens PM/Scl-100 and PM/Scl-75, autoantibodies also target recently identified components of the PM/Scl complex. The prevalence of autoantibodies directed to six novel human exosome components (hRrp4p, hRrp40p, hRrp41p, hRrp42p, hRrp46p, hCsl4p) was determined in sera from patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (<italic>n</italic> = 48), scleroderma (<italic>n</italic> = 11), or the PM/Scl overlap syndrome (<italic>n</italic> = 10). The sera were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and western blotting using the affinity-purified recombinant proteins. Our results show that each human exosome component is recognized by autoantibodies. The hRrp4p and hRrp42p components were most frequently targeted. The presence of autoantibodies directed to the novel components of the human exosome was correlated with the presence of the anti-PM/Scl-100 autoantibody in the sera of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), as was previously found for the anti-PM/Scl-75 autoantibody. Other clear associations between autoantibody activities were not found. These results further support the conception that the autoimmune response may initially be directed to PM/Scl-100, whereas intermolecular epitope spreading may have caused the autoantibody response directed to the associated components.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anti-PM/Scl</kwd><kwd>autoantibody</kwd><kwd>autoantigen</kwd><kwd>exosome complex</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Anti polymyositis/scleroderma (PM/Scl) autoantibodies are often detected in sera of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), scleroderma, and the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, although some anti-PM/Scl-positive patients may not have either of these syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

The nucleolar localization of the PM/Scl complex suggested a role in ribosome synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and, indeed, it was found that the yeast homologue of PM/Scl-100, Rrp6p, is involved in the maturation of 5.8S ribosomal RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, a yeast complex, named the exosome, consisting of 11 3' &#x02192; 5' exoribonucleases, including Rrp45p (the yeast homologue of PM/Scl-75) and Rrp6p, has been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

This finding indicates that the human PM/Scl complex is related to the yeast exosome, and it is therefore referred to as the human exosome (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). Recently, cDNAs encoding three novel components of the human exosome (hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p) were isolated and were shown to be associated with the PM/Scl-100 autoantigen and hRrp4p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, cDNAs encoding four additional human proteins with homology to yeast exosome components have been isolated, although conclusive evidence for their physical association with the PM/Scl complex is still lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Our aim in this study was to assess whether autoantibodies target other components of the human exosome than the PM/Scl-100 and PM/Scl-75 autoantigens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The prevalence of autoantibodies directed to six novel components of the human exosome (hRrp4p, hRrp40p, hRrp41p, hRrp42p, hRrp46p, hCsl4p) was determined in sera from anti-PM/Scl-positive patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM, <italic>n</italic> = 48), scleroderma (<italic>n</italic> = 11), or the myositis/scleroderma overlap syndrome (<italic>n</italic> = 10).

Plates were washed and to each well was added 50 &#x003bc;l of the serum samples, which were diluted 1:200 in buffer C (0.3% (w/v) BSA, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH7.6, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate).

All sera were tested at least in duplicate in parallel with positive and negative controls on each ELISA plate.

In total, 63% (<italic>n</italic> = 30) of the IIM sera, 73% (<italic>n</italic> = 8) of the scleroderma sera, and 60% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) of the myositis/scleroderma overlap sera contained autoantibodies directed to one or more of the novel components of the human exosome. Our results further show that each exosome component is recognized by autoantibodies, although some are preferentially targeted. The hRrp4p component is most frequently recognized by the anti-PM/Scl-positive IIM sera (25/48; 52%), the scleroderma sera (7/11; 64%), and myositis/scleroderma overlap sera (6/10; 60%). Also the hRrp42p component is frequently recognized, albeit less often than hRrp4p (20&#x02013;36%). Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the ELISA readings of the anti exosome-positive sera after correction for background signals.</p><p>Sera that were positive in ELISA were also tested for reactivity with the recombinant exosome components by western blotting. The results indicated that some novel components are poor autoantigens on western blot. Using this approach, we could confirm the reactivity of 75% (3/4) of anti-hRrp40p-positive sera, 71% (12/17) of anti-hRrp42p-positive sera, and 29% (11/38) of anti-hRrp4p-positive sera. However, some sera that were strongly positive on ELISA did not react with the same antigen on immunoblots, while other sera that were only weakly positive on ELISA reacted well on immunoblots. These results suggest that both linear and nonlinear epitopes are important for recognition.</p></sec><sec><title>Anti exosome autoantibodies are mostly restricted to anti-PM/Scl-100-positive sera</title><p>The previously reported dominance of the anti-PM/Scl-100 autoantibody activity in anti-PM/Scl-positive sera was also apparent in the sera analyzed in this study. None of the scleroderma or myositis/scleroderma overlap sera and only three IIM sera contained anti-PM/Scl-75 autoantibodies without detectable anti-PM/Scl-100 reactivity. To determine whether the autoantibody response directed to any of the six novel exosome components is correlated with an anti-PM/Scl-100 response, we also analyzed a large group of anti-PM/Scl-100-negative IIM sera (<italic>n</italic> = 168) by ELISA (data not shown). These results indicated that some, predominantly weak, reactivities may be present in anti-PM/Scl-negative sera: 5% (8/168) of the sera contained detectable reactivity with one or more novel exosome components. In contrast, as mentioned above, 63% of anti-PM/Scl-positive IIM sera contained such reactivity.</p><p>We also tried to discover other correlations between anti exosome autoantibodies. Although the number of anti-hRrp4p-positive sera is comparable to the number of anti-PM/Scl-75-positive sera, the presence of the two types of autoantibody does not appear to be correlated. Furthermore, most of the sera analyzed in this study recognized only one (25/44 positive sera) or two (12/44 positive sera) of the novel exosome components (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). As might be expected, the single reactivity was predominantly directed to hRrp4p (20/25 sera) and the most frequently encountered combination was anti-hRrp4p with anti-hRrp42p reactivity (8/12 sera). Few sera (<italic>n</italic> = 7) contained reactivity with more than two novel components of the exosome.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we examined the prevalence of autoantibodies directed to six novel components of the human exosome in sera of patients diagnosed with IIM, scleroderma, or PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Compared with other published series of patients with anti-PM/Scl autoantibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], in our cohort, fewer patients with scleroderma or PM/Scl overlap than with IIM were available. This does not impair the conclusions drawn from our data, because the autoantibody subspecificities detected were very similar for the three groups of patients.</p><p>Our results show that the anti-human-exosome autoantibody response is not restricted to the previously identified autoantigenic components PM/Scl-100 and PM/Scl-75. Indeed, all the novel exosome components analyzed were targeted by some autoantibodies, albeit with relatively low frequencies in some cases. These autoantibodies are associated predominantly with the anti-PM/Scl-100 response, as has been found for anti-PM/Scl-75 autoantibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This correlation may be particularly interesting in the cases of hRrp42p and hCsl4p, whose association with the human exosome complex has not yet been unequivocally established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our results support the idea that the initial autoimmune response may be directed to the PM/Scl-100 protein and that subsequent intermolecular epitope spreading may play a role in the generation of autoantibodies directed to other components of the exosome components. A similar mechanism has been suggested to generate anti-tRNA<sup>His</sup> autoantibodies in anti-Jo-1-positive IIM patients or anti-U1A, anti-U1C, anti-U1-70K, or anti-Sm autoantibodies in anti-U1 small nuclear RNP-positive SLE patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The event that initiates the autoantibody response is unknown, but we can speculate that modification of the PM/Scl-100 autoantigen occurring in dying cells, for example by granzyme-B-induced cleavage, could generate neo-epitopes that trigger the aberrant immune response in genetically susceptible individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, there is also a possibility that the intact exosome complex is exposed to the immune system, triggering a selective immune response to some of the components. The immunogenicity of the exosome components may be different for each patient and may be defined by phenomena yet unknown. In that case, the autoantibodies directed to different components might be evoked simultaneously. Since none of the patients studied has been followed up over a long period, it is not possible to predict which of the described scenarios (epitope spreading versus simultaneous immunization) may actually be occurring.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The PM/Scl complex, or human exosome, is targeted by autoantibodies that are directed not only to the known autoantigens PM/Scl-100 and PM/Scl-75 but also to recently identified exosome components, most frequently hRrp4p and hRrp42p. However, the anti-PM/Scl-100 reactivity remains the most important one in these sera, supporting the idea that the autoimmune response may initially be directed to this protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GST = glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase; IIM = idiopathic inflammatory myopathies; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PM/Scl = polymyositis/scleroderma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr D Tollervey, Dr C Allmang, and Dr P Mitchell (University of Edinburgh, UK) for providing the hCsl4p, hRrp4p, and hRrp42p expression constructs.
