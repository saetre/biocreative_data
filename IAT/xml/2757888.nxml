We investigated the function of this molecule in the host response to pathogens in vivo, by generating mouse lines lacking the DC-SIGN homologues SIGNR1, SIGNR3, and SIGNR5. Resistance to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> was impaired only in SIGNR3-deficient animals. SIGNR3 was expressed in lung phagocytes during infection, and interacted with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacilli and mycobacterial surface glycoconjugates to induce secretion of critical host defense inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF). SIGNR3 signaling was dependent on an intracellular tyrosine-based motif and the tyrosine kinase Syk. Thus, the mouse DC-SIGN homologue SIGNR3 makes a unique contribution to protection of the host against a pulmonary bacterial pathogen.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Innate immune defense against pathogens involves interactions between conserved microbial molecular motifs and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002</xref>), such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>) and C-type lectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gordon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geijtenbeek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2006</xref>), expressed on host phagocytic cells. The binding of microbial ligands to PRR results in various immune effector functions, including phagocytosis, oxidative burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saijo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taylor et al., 2007</xref>), secretion of antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2006</xref>), autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delgado et al., 2008</xref>), and the production of inflammatory cytokines, which help the body to resist pathogens either directly or by shaping the adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medzhitov, 2007</xref>). Conversely, inappropriate innate responses, caused by mutations in PRR-encoding genes, for example, may lead to pathogen persistence and profound effects on host susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quintana-Murci et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>C-type lectins constitute an extensive family of receptors involved in the recognition of endogenous and microbial carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weis et al., 1998</xref>). DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is a prototypic member of the C-type lectin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geijtenbeek et al., 2000</xref>). This molecule facilitates broad immune surveillance by DCs and some subsets of macrophages, through interactions with fucose- and mannose-containing glycans on many viruses, bacteria, and parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, DC-SIGN is an important receptor for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the pulmonary bacterial pathogen responsible for tuberculosis (TB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geijtenbeek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tailleux et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Torrelles et al., 2008</xref>). DC-SIGN recognizes mannose residues in glycoproteins and lipoglycans, such as mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), in the mycobacterial cell envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geijtenbeek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tailleux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitarque et al., 2005</xref>). A transgenic knockin model of &#x0201c;humanized&#x0201d; mice expressing DC-SIGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaefer et al., 2008</xref>) has suggested that this lectin may be involved in protection against TB pathogenesis. Other in vitro studies have suggested that DC-SIGN may be exploited by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as a means of evading immune surveillance and persisting in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geijtenbeek et al., 2003</xref>). Genetic association studies in TB patients and healthy contacts have led to conflicting results on whether DC-SIGN promotes protection or increases susceptibility to TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barreiro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vannberg et al., 2008</xref>); nevertheless, both studies clearly suggested a role for DC-SIGN in the course of the disease. This role remains unclear, particularly because of the lack of an appropriate animal model.</p><p>The mouse <italic>DC-SIGN</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Powlesland et al., 2006</xref>) encompasses seven genes, <italic>Signr1-5</italic> (also called <italic>Cd209b</italic>, <italic>Cd209c</italic>, <italic>Cd209d</italic>, <italic>Cd209e</italic>, and <italic>Cd209a</italic>) and <italic>Signr7-8</italic> (also called <italic>Cd209g</italic> and <italic>Cd209f</italic>), and one pseudogene, <italic>Signr6</italic>, which is also called <italic>Cd209h</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090188/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). SIGNR5 (also termed mDC-SIGN or CIRE) was initially described as the mouse orthologue of human DC-SIGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2001</xref>). However, further analyses clearly showed that SIGNR5 differs functionally from human DC-SIGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caminschi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gramberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Powlesland et al., 2006</xref>). Amino acid sequence comparison and reconstruction of the phylogeny of these lectins revealed that mouse SIGNR1, SIGNR3, and SIGNR4 were the homologues most closely related to human DC-SIGN (Fig. S1). In human DC-SIGN, Val<sup>351</sup> is instrumental in sugar recognition, particularly in binding fucose residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2004</xref>). The only mouse homologues containing this residue are SIGNR3 and SIGNR4. However, SIGNR4 is unable to bind sugars in vitro, probably because the critical calcium-binding amino acids, Glu<sup>347</sup> and Glu<sup>354</sup>, which are present in all other related molecules, have been replaced by Gln residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Powlesland et al., 2006</xref>). SIGNR1 does not contain Val<sup>351</sup>, and is thus different from human DC-SIGN, as confirmed by the sugar recognition profiles of the two lectins. Mouse SIGNR1, like human DC-SIGN, recognizes mannose residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geijtenbeek et al., 2002</xref>), but it recognizes these residues as terminal monosaccharides rather than branched glycans, a property common to other C-type lectins outside the DC-SIGN family, such as the mannose-binding lectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Powlesland et al., 2006</xref>). SIGNR1 binds terminal mannose motifs in mycobacterial ManLAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koppel et al., 2004</xref>), but SIGNR1-deficient mice have no phenotype upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wieland et al., 2007</xref>). SIGNR3 is the only one of the seven mouse homologues that, like human DC-SIGN, shows dual specificity for both glycans with high mannose content and fucose-containing oligosaccharides, including the Lewis<sup>X</sup> antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Powlesland et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, like human DC-SIGN, SIGNR3 forms tetramers, mediates endocytosis, and releases bound ligands in acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Powlesland et al., 2006</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that SIGNR3 is the best candidate for a functional orthologue of human DC-SIGN.</p><p>We investigated the role of members of the DC-SIGN family in TB in vivo in more detail by generating mice lacking three homologues of human DC-SIGN, namely SIGNR1 and SIGNR3, the homologues that are biochemically most similar to human DC-SIGN, and the more divergent SIGNR5. KO animals were generated directly in a C57BL/6 genetic background so that backcrosses were not required for background purification. We assessed the susceptibility of these mice to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and compared the results obtained with those for WT animals. We report that only SIGNR3-deficient mice have impaired pulmonary defenses against the bacillus, whereas SIGNR1- and SIGNR5-deficient animals show no particular phenotype upon infection. Consistent with this finding, we report that, like human DC-SIGN in patients with TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tailleux et al., 2005</xref>), SIGNR3 is expressed in lung (myeloid) cells during the course of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, whereas it is not expressed in naive animals. Mycobacterial recognition by SIGNR3 induces a signaling cascade requiring the tyrosine kinase Syk and involving a YxxI motif in the cytoplasmic tail of SIGNR3. This motif resembles the immunoreceptor tyrosine&#x02013;based activation motif (ITAM)-like YxxI/L found in other C-type lectins, such as dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown, 2006</xref>). SIGNR3 signaling activates macrophages, inducing the production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, in an NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013; and Raf1&#x02013;ERK-dependent pathway, with these cytokines being key components of protection against TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flynn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ladel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saunders et al., 2000</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>SIGNR1 and SIGNR3 recognize <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and mycobacterial surface glycoconjugates</title><p>We evaluated the capacity of the murine DC-SIGN homologues to recognize mycobacterial ligands, by carrying out binding experiments with <sup>125</sup>I-labeled recombinant SIGNR proteins incubated with various mycobacterial lipoglycans, including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;derived ManLAM and lipomannan (LM), <italic>Mycobacterium chelonae</italic>&#x02013;derived LAM (AraLAM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>), and the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;derived 19-, 38-, and 45-kD glycoproteins. These molecules were used to coat plastic plates. Like human DC-SIGN, SIGNR3 recognized ManLAM and LM, but did not bind to AraLAM, which has no mannose-capping residues. However, to a lesser extent, SIGNR3, like human DC-SIGN, also recognized mycobacterial glycoproteins, including the 19-kD antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). In contrast, recombinant SIGNR5 bound only weakly to these ligands, and this lectin was unable to recognize ManLAM in particular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koppel et al., 2004</xref>), SIGNR1 also bound to ManLAM and bound poorly to AraLAM. We also found that SIGNR1 recognized several other mycobacterial glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). Thus, SIGNR3 and SIGNR1, but not SIGNR5, can interact with mannose-containing mycobacterial surface molecules. In addition to binding, the expression of SIGNR3 and SIGNR1, but not of SIGNR5, in Rat6 fibroblasts conferred on these cells an ability to mediate endocytosis and to take up ManLAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>). SIGNR1 has been reported to interact directly with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>). We wished to evaluate whether this was also true for SIGNR3, therefore we infected SIGNR3-expressing and control macrophages of the RAW 264.7 line. Cells expressing SIGNR3 displayed markedly higher levels of mycobacterial recognition than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>). Furthermore, macrophages expressing low levels of SIGNR3 bound fewer bacteria than macrophages expressing higher levels of this lectin in a mixed cell infection assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 b</xref>). Our results provide evidence for the recognition by the DC-SIGN homologue SIGNR3 of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and mycobacterial surface glycoconjugates.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>SIGNR1 and SIGNR3 bind mycobacterial ligands, whereas SIGNR5 does not.</bold> (a) Schematic representation of the mycobacterial lipoglycans studied.

In contrast, SIGNR3-deficient animals had 5&#x02013;31 times more bacteria in their lungs 21 d after infection (14.1 &#x000b1; 1.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> vs. 2.4 &#x000b1; 0.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>; <italic>n</italic> = 7; P = 0.0007), and 3&#x02013;12 times more bacteria in their lungs 42 d after infection (0.5 &#x000b1; 0.10<sup>7</sup> vs. 0.1 &#x000b1; 0.03 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 6, P = 0.0095) than did the WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref>).

These results were reproduced in two independent experiments and indicated a role for SIGNR3 in early pulmonary resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, but not in mycobacterial dissemination or the extrapulmonary control of infection in secondary lymphoid organs. Although the difference in lung CFUs between WT and SIGNR3-deficient animals persisted in the longer term (after 21 d), infection was controlled in KO mice, as attested by the observed decrease in pulmonary bacterial load. These results suggest that SIGNR3 is involved in the early control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection but does not play a major role in mounting an efficient antimycobacterial adaptive immune response. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed no difference in the formation of granulomatous lesions in SIGNR3-deficient and SIGNR3-containing mice, in high- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 a</xref>) and low-dose infection models (not depicted). Furthermore, SIGNR3-KO animals mounted specific antimycobacterial Th1, Th2, Tc1, and Th17 responses similar in strength and kinetics to those of WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 b</xref>).

We investigated whether SIGNR3 stimulation induced cytokine secretion, by stably transfecting RAW 264.7 macrophages with a SIGNR3-encoding vector, and stimulating them with ManLAM for various periods of time. We then quantified cytokine levels in culture supernatants by ELISA. ManLAM stimulation of SIGNR3-expressing cells resulted in the strong induction of IL-6 secretion, as shown by comparison with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 a</xref>). Larger amounts of TNF were also produced by SIGNR3-expressing macrophages than by control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 b</xref>). IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-12p40 were not detected in any conditions in stimulated RAW and RAW-SIGNR3 cells (unpublished data). Nitric oxide, an important mediator of resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in mice and possibly also in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flynn and Chan, 2001</xref>), was not produced in larger amounts in SIGNR3-expressing macrophages than in control cells after stimulation with ManLAM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090188/DC1">Fig. S5 a</ext-link>). IL-10 was barely induced in ManLAM-treated macrophages, regardless of SIGNR3 expression, and ManLAM did not potentiate IL-10 secretion in LPS-treated SIGNR3-expressing cells (Fig. S5 b). Infection with live <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> also resulted in higher levels of production of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 c</xref>) and TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 d</xref>) in SIGNR3-expressing cells than in control cells. We wanted to use BM-derived phagocytic cells from SIGNR3-deficient animals to confirm these results in a primary context. However, flow cytometry analysis of the macrophages and DCs derived from BM progenitors of WT mice using various classical cytokines, such as M-CSF, GM-CSF, and Flt3-ligand, resulted in no detection of SIGNR3 mRNA or protein in these cells (unpublished data). The treatment of these cells with cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, which are known to induce DC-SIGN expression in human phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Soilleux et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Puig-Kr&#x000f6;ger et al., 2004</xref>), also failed to increase SIGNR3 expression (unpublished data). We could not purify SIGNR3-expressing cells from the lungs of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&#x02013;infected animals in a sufficiently pure state and in large enough quantities. We therefore decided to validate the functionality of SIGNR3 signaling in primary cells by nucleofecting BM-derived macrophages (BMMs) with a SIGNR3-encoding vector. SIGNR3 expression in BMMs was validated by RT-PCR (unpublished data). The treatment of these cells with ManLAM again resulted in much higher levels of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 e</xref>) and TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 f</xref>) secretion than observed in BMMs transformed with a control vector.

In particular, it has been intensely remodeled through gene duplication, generating seven paralogous genes and one pseudogene, whereas the human <italic>DC-SIGN</italic> gene is flanked by only one paralogue, <italic>L-SIGN</italic>. Sequence analysis and phylogeny reconstruction alone could not identify the true mouse orthologue of human DC-SIGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Powlesland et al., 2006</xref>). However, biochemical studies clearly demonstrated that only SIGNR3 displayed dual specificity for mannose- and fucose-containing oligosaccharides and glycans, like human DC-SIGN. It is therefore not surprising that, like DC-SIGN, SIGNR3 binds to and internalizes <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> ManLAM through its mannose capping residues. We also showed that SIGNR3 bound other mycobacterial lipoglycans, such as LM, and glycoproteins, such as the 19-kD antigen, and whole <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacilli. SIGNR1 also recognizes <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> ManLAM, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koppel et al., 2004</xref>), in addition to mycobacterial glycoproteins. However, the properties of SIGNR1 are not consistent with strong functional similarities to human DC-SIGN. Indeed, SIGNR1 recognizes terminal monosaccharides rather than mannose-branched oligosaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Powlesland et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, SIGNR1 is expressed in liver endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geijtenbeek et al., 2002</xref>), with an expression pattern similar to that of L-SIGN in humans. The other mouse SIGNR lectins recognize different sugar moieties, such as N-acetyl glucosamine for SIGNR2, or have no sugar-binding activity, as is the case for SIGNR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Powlesland et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that human DC-SIGN and mouse SIGNR3 are functional orthologues that are duplicated differently within and between species during the course of evolution to fulfill different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bashirova et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We found that the early pulmonary resistance of SIGNR3-deficient mice to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was weaker than that of WT animals, although the infection was controlled in the longer term in KO animals. In contrast, SIGNR5- and SIGNR1-KO animals were as resistant to the bacillus as WT control mice. The greater permissiveness to infection of SIGNR3-deficient mice was consistent with the ability of the lectin to signal after binding its mycobacterial ligands, and to induce secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF in vitro in macrophages, and in vivo in the lungs of experimentally infected animals, at least regarding TNF. These cytokines are essential for the control of mycobacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flynn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ladel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saunders et al., 2000</xref>). Although we could not evince a dramatic decrease in IL-6 secretion in the lungs of SIGNR3-KO animals 21 d after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 g</xref>), the level of IL-6 transcript in these mice was reduced significantly as compared with WT controls (unpublished data). Moreover our results obtained in vitro undoubtedly show that SIGNR3 signaling contributes to IL-6 secretion. Although we can only speculate at this stage about the potential involvement of IL-6 in SIGNR3-mediated protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, our results for SIGNR3-KO mice are reminiscent of those reported for IL-6 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saunders et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, in both mouse lines, early control of mycobacterial infection is impaired in the lungs, but not in other organs, such as the spleen, and the adaptive antimycobacterial immune response, longer term control of the infection, and survival of the infected animals were normal. The possible roles of IL-6 in the early control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection have been discussed in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saunders et al. (2000)</xref>, and further work will be needed to firmly establish whether IL-6 plays a part in SIGNR3-mediated protection against the TB bacillus in vivo.</p><p>We showed that SIGNR3-mediated cytokine secretion required an intact tyrosine residue within the YxxL/I ITAM-like motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the lectin, and that this process was associated with Syk and dependent on both the NF-&#x003ba;B and Raf1&#x02013;ERK pathways. These findings resemble those for another myeloid C-type lectin, dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown, 2006</xref>), which mediates protection against fungal infections through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and an oxidative burst in a Syk- and CARD9/Bcl10-dependent manner, via its cytoplasmic YxxL motif. Like SIGNR3, dectin can signal on its own, or in collaboration with TLR2 to modulate inflammatory responses. Several C-type lectins carry intracellular ITAM-like motifs, and Syk-mediated signaling may be a common feature of this PRR family.</p><p>Our results raise intriguing questions about the potential similarity of DC-SIGN and SIGNR3 functions in humans and mice, and about the overall beneficial or detrimental nature of the DC-SIGN&#x02013;mediated immune response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in vivo for the host. Interestingly, SIGNR3 in infected mice and DC-SIGN in patients with TB have similar patterns of expression, with both lectins induced during the infection process in cells of myeloid origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tailleux et al., 2005</xref>). In vitro, DC-SIGN may signal in a TLR-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geijtenbeek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caparr&#x000f3;s et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gringhuis et al., 2007</xref>) or -independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodges et al., 2007</xref>) manner. In human DCs, DC-SIGN binding to ManLAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geijtenbeek et al., 2003</xref>) or agonist antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caparr&#x000f3;s et al., 2006</xref>) has been reported to increase secretion of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 if it coincides with TLR4 stimulation by bacterial LPS. The intracellular Tyr<sub>31</sub> residue in the cytoplasmic tail of DC-SIGN does not appear to be required for signaling in this case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gringhuis et al., 2007</xref>). We observed no such increase in IL-10 secretion in SIGNR3-expressing cells stimulated with both ManLAM and LPS, but it is likely that macrophages and DCs differ in this respect. However, the TLR-independent stimulation of DC-SIGN requires Tyr<sub>31</sub> and leads to the induction of <italic>TNF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodges et al., 2007</xref>), consistent with our findings in mouse SIGNR3.</p><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>-derived compounds can interact with TLRs in vitro, leading to cell activation and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jo, 2008</xref>). In vivo, TLR2 plays a key role in the production of TNF and IL-12, and TLR2-deficient mice have been reported to die earlier than WT controls after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reiling et al., 2002</xref>), although these results were not confirmed in a more recent study of TLR2-4-9 triple KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">H&#x000f6;lscher et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the role of TLR4 in TB remains unclear. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-derived compounds can stimulate TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Means et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takeuchi et al., 2000</xref>) in vitro, but TLR4 does not appear to be involved in antimycobacterial immunity in vivo, at least in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reiling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">H&#x000f6;lscher et al., 2008</xref>). Further investigations are required to determine whether DC-SIGN acts together with TLR4 to potentiate IL-10 production during the natural course of TB in vivo in humans. Such a mechanism might result in immune evasion by the bacillus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geijtenbeek et al., 2003</xref>). It might also make it possible to control inflammation and to limit host tissue damage, thereby contributing to host protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neyrolles et al., 2006</xref>). These results are compatible with a model in which, depending on the cell context, DC-SIGN may signal either as a single PRR along a pathway requiring the Tyr<sup>31</sup> residue, or in association with TLR4, independently of Tyr<sup>31</sup>. The net effect of these multiple types of PRR stimulation on the immune response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> remains unclear. The results obtained in this study with mice and the 19-kD protein, a mycobacterial TLR2 ligand also recognized by SIGNR3, suggest that SIGNR3 signaling synergizes with TLR2 for the production of protective inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>In summary, our results reveal, for the first time, the role of a C-type lectin, the DC-SIGN homologue SIGNR3, in innate resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in vivo. In addition to mycobacteria, DC-SIGN recognizes a plethora of viruses, bacteria, and parasites. The identification of SIGNR3 as the most likely functional orthologue of DC-SIGN and the availability of a mouse line in which this receptor has been inactivated should facilitate further investigations of the role of this lectin in several infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Binding experiments.</title><p>Mycobacterial ManLAM, LM, and AraLAM were purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitarque et al., 2005</xref>).

Specific primers for quantifying IL-6, TNF, and the house-keeping gene HPRT were used: TNF sense 5&#x02032;-TCTCATCAGTTCTATGGCCC-3&#x02032;; TNF antisense 5&#x02032;-GGGAGTAGACAAGGTACAAC-3&#x02032;; IL-6 sense 5&#x02032;-GTTCTCTGGGAAATCGTGGA-3&#x02032;; IL-6 antisense 5&#x02032;-TGTACTCCAGGTAGCTATGG-3&#x02032;; HPRT sense 5&#x02032;-GATTCAACTTGCGCTCATCTTA-3&#x02032;; and HPRT antisense 5&#x02032;-GTTGGATACAGGCCAGACTTTGTTG-3&#x02032;. All primers were selected to span the predicted splice sites. PCR was performed with a 25-&#x000b5;l reaction mixture, in triplicate, with a sequence detection system (model ABI Prism 7300; Applied Biosystems) and the Power SYBR-Green PCR mastermix (Applied Biosystems). The threshold cycle (Ct; the number of the cycle at which the amount of the amplified gene of interest reached a fixed threshold) was then determined. Relative mRNA levels were calculated by the comparative Ct method. Relative target mRNA levels, normalized with respect to an endogenous control (<italic>HPRT</italic>) and in particular calibrator conditions, were expressed as 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> (fold), where &#x00394;Ct = Ct of the target gene &#x02212; Ct of the control gene (<italic>HPRT</italic>), and &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct = &#x00394;Ct of the studied set of conditions &#x02212; &#x00394;Ct of the calibrator conditions, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Livak and Schmittgen, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses.</title><p>Data were analyzed using the Student's <italic>t</italic> test, with Welch's correction in cases of unequal variance, as assessed with the <italic>F</italic> test.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material.</title><p>Fig. S1 depicts comparative genomic protein sequence and phylogeny analysis of human DC-SIGN, its paralogue L-SIGN, and their homologues in the mouse.
