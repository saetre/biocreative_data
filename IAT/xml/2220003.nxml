The amount of p66Shc mRNA quantified by Real Time PCR was significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.001) lowered upon p66Shc shRNAi microinjection. This reduction was selective for p66Shc mRNA, as both histone H2a and p53 mRNA levels were not altered. The relative signal strength of p66Shc immuno-fluorescence revealed a significant reduction in the number of pixels for p66Shc shRNAi microinjected groups compared to controls (P &#x0003c; 0.05).

Senescence is triggered by a p53-dependent signalling cascade associated with the shortening of telomeres, the tandem G-rich repetitive, non-coding DNA sequences and specific binding proteins at the ends of linear chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We have previously shown that permanent cell growth arrest of cultured bovine somatic cells is associated with telomere shortening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], increased levels of serine 20-p53 phosphorylation, and elevated levels of oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Since permanent growth arrest/cellular senescence occurs prematurely under conditions of elevated oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and can be activated by disruption of the telomere structure itself, even at maximally long telomere lengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we hypothesize that arrested mammalian embryos permanently arrest in their development by a similar stress signalling pathway.</p><p>At the cellular level, an oxidative stress sensor that can provide a key understanding of cell senescence and permanent embryo arrest is p66Shc, the recently identified protein belonging to the Shc family of adaptors for signal transduction in mitogenic and apoptotic responses. p66Shc is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate the cellular response to oxidative stress and life span and has been shown to act as a downstream target of p53-mediated elevation of intracellular oxidants, cytochrome c release and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. p66Shc is important in the signalling response to ROS and propagation of apoptotic signals in mouse fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Remarkably, p66Shc(-/-) mice exhibit increased resistance to oxidative stress and have a ~30% longer lifespan than wild-type control animals with no apparent side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We have measured elevated levels of p66Shc mRNA and protein in senescent somatic cells and in permanently arrested 2&#x02013;4 cell bovine embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently, we have demonstrated that p66Shc is significantly more abundant in an embryo population that exhibits higher frequencies of embryo arrest and quantities of intracellular ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggests that p66Shc regulates an oxidative stress-induced senescence pathway that triggers permanent embryo arrest. The objective of this study was to elucidate a functional role for p66Shc in embryo arrest by selectively decreasing p66Shc levels in bovine oocytes and embryos using the post-transcriptional gene silencing technique of RNA interference (RNAi).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Quantification of p66Shc, H2a and p53 mRNA transcripts</title><p>Determination of the number of p66Shc, H2a and p53 mRNA transcripts was carried out by Real Time PCR in arrested 2&#x02013;4 cell embryos collected at day 8 post-insemination, in early cleaving embryos (28 hours post insemination (hpi)) that show very low percentage of embryo arrest and in late cleaving embryos (29 to 48 hpi) that are more likely to arrest, in accordance to previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

Therefore, approximately 12,000 p66Shc short hairpin RNAi molecules were microinjected in the subsequent experiments. To further verify a dose-dependent silencing/reduction of p66Shc protein levels we also injected twice (~24,000 molecules) the amount of p66Shc shRNAi molecules.</p></sec><sec><title>Successful selective down-regulation of p66Shc</title><p>To assess whether p66Shc expression was selectively down-regulated by the injection of approximately 12,000 and 24,000 p66Shc short hairpin RNAi molecules, we quantified p66Shc mRNA and protein levels in 35 hpi embryos by Real Time PCR and by quantitative immunoflorescence, respectively.

Based on our previous findings that showed significantly elevated levels of p66Shc and reactive oxygen species in permanently arrested 2&#x02013;4 cell bovine embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the goal in this study was to decrease p66Shc levels in developing bovine oocytes and embryos to elucidate a functional role for p66Shc in early embryo arrest. We significantly decreased the number of p66Shc mRNA transcripts and protein by approximately 54% by microinjecting ~12,000 short hairpin (sh)RNAi molecules specific for the bovine p66Shc mRNA sequence into GV stage oocytes. Concomitant with this reduction in p66Shc mRNA and protein levels, we observed a significant reduction in permanently arrested 2&#x02013;4 cell embryos of approximately 93%. Therefore, this study clearly demonstrates a direct functional association between high levels of p66Shc with early embryo arrest. However, down-regulation of p66Shc also induced a significant reduction in the number of cleaved embryos and blastocysts signifying that it may play a vital role in facilitating early embryonic development as well.</p><p>Since permanent embryo arrest occurs before the major activation of the embryonic genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], microinjection of the p66Shc hairpin RNAi molecules was required at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage to maximize the effects of RNAi mediated reduction of endogenous p66Shc transcripts. Microinjection was carried out on cumulus-intact GV oocytes, but this presented several challenges. Accordingly, care was taken to minimize the damage to COCs by the holding pipette, which readily stripped off the cumulus cells, and to reduce oocyte injury by the injection pipette since the ooplasm contents were not easily visible and piercing of the GV was possible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Denuded immature oocytes do exhibit a decreased ability to reach the second metaphase (MII stage), with a greater incidence of abnormal fertilization, reduced pronuclei formation, and reduced cleavage and blastocyst development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. When we microinjected embryos without the p66Shc shRNAi molecules (vehicle control), we found a significant decrease in these parameters with 41.0 &#x000b1; 2.4% of embryos cleaved, 21.8 &#x000b1; 0.5% of embryos that develop to the blastocyst stage and 10.8 &#x000b1; 0.7% of embryos that arrested. It appears that the micromanipulation procedure itself affects the developmental potential of IVP bovine embryos reaching the blastocyst stage in vitro. A similar decrease in cleavage and blastocyst rates has been reported after pronuclear injection of bovine zygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

Svoboda et al. (2000) were able to down-regulate the expression of specific target genes up to 80% in a dose-dependent manner.

Wianny and Zernicka-Goetz (2000) microinjected mouse oocytes with 0.1 to 2.0 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l of hairpin RNAi molecules in a larger volume, up to 10 pl, to down-regulate their genes of interest. Marked success was also achieved by microinjection of the short interfering siRNA expression vector directly into the nuclei of 2-cell mouse embryos in a concentration of 10 ng/&#x003bc;l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In the present study, approximately 12,000 p66Shc hairpin RNAi molecules were microinjected in GV-stage bovine oocytes, representing the number of p66Shc mRNA molecules previously quantified in arrested 2-cell embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The microinjection volume we utilized needed to be significantly smaller than what was used previously for mouse oocytes. Microinjection of a volume greater than 0.25 pl resulted in mechanical lysis of the GV bovine oocytes. This species-difference might be due to a greater fragility of bovine oocytes versus mouse oocytes or to different parameters, such as the optimal pressure utilized for the microinjection and the microinjection needle diameter.</p><p>Early cleaving co-culture embryos known to display high developmental potential and a low incidence of embryo arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], exhibit an average p66Shc mRNA concentration of 1.20 &#x000b1; 0.30 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>pg per embryo, while late cleaving embryos, which are significantly more likely to arrest, contain a p66Shc mRNA amount of over twice as much (2.80 &#x000b1; 0.32 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>pg) per embryo (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The amount of p66Shc mRNA is even higher in arrested 2&#x02013;4 cell embryos collected at day-8 post-insemination, at 4.02 &#x000b1; 0.21 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>pg per embryo (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These results, along with the consensus that the major activation of embryonic transcription occurs at the 8&#x02013;16 cell stage in bovine embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], suggest that the increased levels of p66Shc mRNA and protein in arrested embryos may be due to an increase in p66Shc mRNA stability and/or protein stability through post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications. Recently, the small GTPase rac1 has been shown to induce phosphorylation-dependent increase in the stability of p66Shc in various somatic cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].

Spontaneous oocyte cleavage induced by the microinjection procedure itself, while occurring in some species such as mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], does not readily occur in the bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In the absence of chemical activation, approximately 4% of injected bovine oocytes cleaved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], which is consistent with the results presented in this study where 2.1 &#x000b1; 2.0% of injected oocytes spontaneously cleaved following microinjection. Most spontaneously cleaved bovine oocytes exhibit developmental delay/arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], suggesting that the reduction in spontaneous cleaved oocytes in the microinjected groups compared to non-injected controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) may account for the reduction in embryo arrest. However, there was also significant reduction in spontaneous oocyte cleavage in the vehicle-microinjected group without a concomitant reduction in the proportion of embryos permanently arresting at the 2&#x02013;4 cell stage. This result further supports that the decrease in arrested embryos observed for the p66Shc shRNAi microinjected group was not due to a reduction in spontaneous oocyte cleavage but to the knockdown in p66Shc levels.</p><p>P66Shc knock-out mice are viable, but the fertility of p66Shc null females has not been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this study, RNAi-mediated reduction in p66Shc mRNA and protein significantly reduced the proportion of embryos arrested at the 2&#x02013;4 cell stage (0.9 &#x000b1; 0.9%), but only 8.7 &#x000b1; 1.4% developed to the blastocyst stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), suggesting that escape from arrest leads to embryo demise by other means at later developmental stages and that p66Shc has a variety of functions during early embryo development. The reduction in blastocyst yield might suggest RNAi toxicity to the oocytes/embryos, but this is not likely since histone H2a and p53 mRNA levels were unchanged for both the 2-cell embryo and blastocyst stages after p66Shc RNA interference. Any insult/toxicity would greatly affect the expression of most genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], rather than isolated individual loci. The use of long (&#x0003e;30 nt) dsRNA molecules have been shown to trigger a sequence non-specific interferon response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], however the use of short interfering and short hairpin RNAi molecules in mammalian cells and embryos have not shown any toxicity or interferon response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The lack of alterations in p53 mRNA levels also suggest that p53 is not affected by p66Shc mRNA down-regulation, consistent with our previous observations, which propose that embryo arrest and death are p53-independent events in early bovine embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The levels of p66Shc transcripts after a 54% p66Shc knockdown with ~12,000 shRNAi molecules in 35 hpi, 2&#x02013;4 cell embryos (0.46 &#x000b1; 0.06 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>pg/embryo) is equivalent to the amount of p66Shc mRNA normally observed in a developing bovine blastocyst (0.50 &#x000b1; 0.07 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>pg) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting that we were working in a physiological range typically measured in blastocysts. At the blastocyst stage no differences in p66Shc mRNA levels were observed between the control, vehicle microinjected and p66Shc RNAi microinjected groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This result indicates that the RNAi molecules either induced only a temporary effect on endogenous p66Shc levels, or that an optimal concentration of p66Shc is necessary for continued development.</p><p>Besides p66Shc's role in normal cell management of stress and damage repair, p66Shc functions in regulating mitochondrial metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In the absence of p66Shc, mouse embryonic fibroblasts and PC12 cells both exhibit a reduction in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity, which was partially offset by increased levels of aerobic glycolysis and lactate production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This altered mitochondria metabolism in p66Shc deficient cells is the most likely explanation for the reduced blastocyst frequencies observed for the p66Shc knockdown embryo group. Quantitative assessment at timed stages of development coupled with a titrated silencing of p66Shc under culture conditions with varying oxygen levels and energy sources will help clarify the metabolic role of this protein during early embryo development.</p><p>p66Shc is an adaptor protein that is activated in response to oxidative stress and appears to play a crucial role in mediating cell death and cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Conversely, Trinei <italic>et al</italic>. (2002) showed that p66Shc is an oxidative stress inducer, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is possible that the reduction in permanently arrested 2&#x02013;4 cell embryos in the p66Shc shRNAi injected group is due to a decline in mitochondrial ROS production and an increase in stress resistance. Recent studies have shown that oxidative stress-activated p66Shc can translocate into the mitochondrial intermembrane space where it interacts with reduced cytochrome c to produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>which promotes the opening of permeability transition pores allowing for the release of ROS and other constituents into the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The localization of p66Shc protein throughout and as distinct foci within the cytoplasm of bovine embryos corroborates with this data. ROS are involved in the redox-dependent regulation of various cellular functions, including energy metabolism and the response to stress or growth signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Our previous research demonstrated that elevated oxygen tensions increase the levels of p66Shc, intracellular ROS and oxidative damage in bovine fibroblasts and embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], supporting other work that shows that oxidative stress mediates p66Shc's function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Interestingly, embryos injected with the high dose (~24,000) of p66Shc shRNAi molecules appeared to cleave faster than those injected with the low does (~12,000) of p66Shc RNAi hairpin molecules (data not shown), supporting p66Shc's other known role in antagonizing mitogenic signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].</p><p>Embryo arrest and continued embryo development may therefore be regulated, in part, by the translocation of p66Shc into the inter-mitochondrial space where it controls trans-membrane potential altering mitochondrial metabolism and/or generating and releasing ROS into the cytosol causing cellular damage that triggers permanent cell cycle arrest at a developmental stage (2&#x02013;4 cell embryo) that is in an anti-apoptosis state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] or apoptosis at other developmental stages. p66Shc has been shown to regulate redox-dependent inactivation of members from the forkhead transcription factor family triggering their translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Forkhead transcription factors have been reported to regulate the expression of anti-apoptosis genes and several antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. The nuclear and peri-nuclear localization of p66Shc observed in this study and elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] may account for this extra-mitochondrial role for p66Shc. RNAi-mediated knockdown of p66Shc in embryos already deemed arrested and in embryos at later developmental stages will reveal the developmental capacity of arrested embryos and may uncover the aetiology of the permanently arrest state and other p66Shc function(s) during later stages of early embryo development.</p><p>Finally, there is now supporting evidence that telomere-driven senescence is triggered by mitochondrial production of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. ROS-mediated disruption of the telomere structure may explain the high rates of developmental arrest of <italic>in vitro </italic>produced embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Preliminary evidence in our lab detecting phosphorylated histone &#x003b3;-H2A.X foci in arrested 2&#x02013;4 cell embryos but not in proliferating 2&#x02013;4 cell embryos support this possibility since phosphorylation of histone H2A.X appears to facilitate the formation of DNA damage foci around uncapped telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Based on the immunolocalization studies it is tempting to speculate that p66Shc may be involved in a cycling cascade of events that triggers and maintains permanent embryo arrest through a ROS-mediated and response pathway that permanently maintains a telomeric DNA damage state.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, using the post-transcriptional gene silencing approach of RNA interference by microinjecting short hairpin RNAi molecules into bovine oocytes/embryos, we were able to selectively diminish the levels of p66Shc and correlated this knockdown with a significant reduction in the incidence of 2&#x02013;4 cell embryo arrest and with a significant decrease in embryo development to the blastocyst stage. These apparent contradictory roles for p66Shc in both permanent embryo arrest and developmental competence implies that p66Shc functions must be tightly regulated. Escape from permanent cell cycle arrest may alleviate some cases of age-related infertility, or at least provide a less controversial source of embryonic stem cells from arrested embryos original deemed as non-viable, biological waste.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid preparation and cells transformation</title><p>Two DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Guelph Molecular Supercentre (Guelph, ON, Canada).

To sustain development through to the blastocyst stage, 20 &#x003bc;l of fresh IVC medium was added to each drop after 48 hours of culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Total RNA extraction</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from each pool of embryos using QIA Shredder&#x02122; and RNeasy<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was co-precipitated using 2 &#x003bc;l of <italic>See</italic>DNA (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Baie d'Urf&#x000e9;, QC, Canada) as a carrier by the addition of 0.1 &#x000d7; volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) (Amersham Biosciences Corp.) and 2 &#x000d7; volume of ice-cold absolute ethanol. The RNA pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 8 &#x003bc;l of RNase-free water. Samples then underwent DNase treatment, according to the manufacturer's instructions (DNA-free&#x02122;, Ambion Inc.). Following DNase treatment, samples were reverse transcribed immediately or stored at -80&#x000b0;C for future use.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse Transcription (RT)</title><p>RT reactions were performed on the RNA extracted from pools of oocytes/embryos using 500 ng of oligo (dT)<sup>12&#x02013;18 </sup>and Superscript II (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase, according to the following protocol. The oligo (dT)<sub>12&#x02013;18 </sub>was first added to the RNA samples and allowed to anneal by denaturing the secondary structures at 70&#x000b0;C for 2 min, then a mixture of 4 &#x003bc;l RT buffer, 1 &#x003bc;l of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 1 &#x003bc;l of 10 mM dNTP mix, 0.5 &#x003bc;l of RNAsin (40 U/&#x003bc;l) (Promega, Madison, WI) and 1 &#x003bc;l of Superscript II (200 U/&#x003bc;l) was added and the reaction was incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 1 hour, followed by a denaturing step at 70&#x000b0;C for 30 min. To amplify p66Shc, p53 and H2a cDNAs the primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) that have been previously optimized for the bovine species were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Oligonucleotide Primers used for Real Time amplification</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Gene</td><td align="left">GenBank accession number</td><td align="left">Sequence</td><td align="center">Product size (bp)</td><td align="left">Species</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">p66Shc</td><td align="left"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U73377">U73377</ext-link></td><td align="left">5'-GTGAGGTCTGGGGAGAAGC-3'<break/>5'-GGTTCGGACAAAGGATCACC-3'</td><td align="center">336</td><td align="left"><italic>Homo sapiens</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left">H2a</td><td align="left"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U62674">U62674</ext-link></td><td align="left">5'-GTCGTGGCAAGCAAGGAG-3'<break/>5'-GATCTCGGCCGTTAGGTACTC-3'</td><td align="center">374</td><td align="left"><italic>Mus musculus</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left">p53</td><td align="left"><ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U74486">U74486</ext-link></td><td align="left">5'-CTCAGTCCTCTGCCATACTA-3'<break/>5'-GGATCCAGGATAAGGTGAGC-3'</td><td align="center">364</td><td align="left"><italic>Bos Indicus</italic></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Real Time RT-PCR</title><p>The PCRs were conducted in a Light Cycler apparatus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, QC, Canada) and products were detected with SYBR Green (FastStart Master SYBR Green I mix, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prior to the quantification, optimization procedures were performed by running PCRs with or without the purified template to identify the melting temperatures of the primer dimers and the specific product. To measure the level of mRNA in the samples, the fluorescence values were taken at the temperature associated with the beginning of the peak for the specific product, 84&#x000b0;C for p53, 86&#x000b0;C for p66Shc and 88&#x000b0;C for H2a. For each quantification a 1 &#x003bc;l aliquot of the RT reaction was used. The standard curve was established using the DNA template in six serial dilutions ranging from 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2 </sup>pg to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>pg. The amplification program was as follows: Preincubation for FastStart polymerase activation at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 amplification cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C (20&#x000b0;C/sec), annealing for 5 sec (20&#x000b0;C/sec), elongation at 72&#x000b0;C and acquisition of fluorescence for 5 sec (20&#x000b0;C/sec). After the end of the last cycle, starting the fluorescence acquisition at 72&#x000b0;C and taking measurements every 0.1&#x000b0;C until 95&#x000b0;C was reached generated the melting curve. Amplification was performed on the histone H2a gene as an endogenous standard to assure equal RT efficiency and for p66Shc knockdown specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>Whole-mount indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of p66Shc</title><p>In order to verify the knockdown efficiency at the protein level, ~12,000 (low group) and ~24,000 (high group) shRNAi molecules were injected at the zygote stage, 18 h post co-culture with sperm or 1 hpi. Early 2&#x02013;4 cell staged bovine embryos were collected and processed at 35 hpi for application of whole-mount immunofluorescence as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Sixty embryos were injected for each group over three repetitions and about 30 embryos were assessed for p66Shc immunoflurescence intensity from each repetition. Embryo pools were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed in PBS and then either processed immediately for whole-mount indirect immunofluorescence or stored at 4&#x000b0;C in Embryo Storage Buffer (1 &#x000d7; PBS + 0.9% sodium azide) for up to 3 weeks. Fixed embryos were permeabilized and blocked concurrently by room temperature incubation in Embryo Blocking Buffer (0.01% Triton X-100 + 5% Normal Donkey Serum in 1 &#x000d7; PBS) for 1 hour followed by one wash in fresh 1 &#x000d7; PBS for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Embryos were incubated with primary antisera (Rabbit anti-human p66Shc; Catalog #AB3824, Millipore) at non-saturating conditions using a 1:100 dilution in Antibody Dilution/Wash Buffer (ADB: 0.005% Triton X-100 + 1% Normal Donkey Serum in 1 &#x000d7; PBS) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Embryos were then washed 3 times for 20&#x02013;30 minutes in ADB at 37&#x000b0;C and incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) at 1:200 dilution in ADB overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. To visualize F-actin localization and to stain nuclear DNA, the first 30 minute wash in ADB following secondary antibody incubation embryos were treated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (5 &#x003bc;g/ml; 1:20, Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, ON, Canada) and DAPI (1 mg/ml; 1:2000, Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, ON, Canada) for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C followed by 2 washes for 2 hours each at 37&#x000b0;C. Fully processed embryos were mounted onto glass slides in a drop of FluoroGuard&#x02122; Anti-Fade Reagent (BioRad Laboratories Canada Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada). Immunofluorescence imaging was carried out by confocal microscopy using an Olympus Fluoview Laser Scanning Confocal system on an IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a computer running the Olympus Fluoview software (v. 4.3).</p></sec><sec><title>Image analysis and quantification of immunofluorescence intensity</title><p>To quantify immunofluorescence results we employed the method developed and reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. All microscope and image capture settings remained constant during the digital capture of confocal micrographs between embryos and between treatment groups. Acquired micrographs were saved in TIFF image format and processed using Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA), for recognition, selection and separation of the desired chromogen signal. Quantitative analysis began by separation of the green image channel representing FITC fluorescence of p66Shc protein from the red (representing Rhodamine-phalloidin-labelled F-actin) and blue (representing DAPI-stained nuclei) channels. The green channel image was converted to "Grayscale", discarding the other two color channels to ensure the signal remaining represented only FITC fluorescence. The overall luminance of each pixel in the converted image corresponded to the intensity of FITC fluorescence. Each converted micrograph was then inverted so that grey and black pixels represented areas of FITC immunofluorescence on a white background and saved as a new TIFF image file for Scion Image analysis.</p><p>The Scion Image program, Version 4.0.3.2 (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA), is a freely distributed commercial software program that mimics the performance of NIH Image program for quantification of the chromogen signal strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. The greyscale inverted micrographs were opened in Scion Image and following the methods of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>], the mean density of the chromogen signal strength (SS) of each image was measured and recorded. The average SS from at least three micrographs representing no primary antibody controls was subtracted from the SS values of the measured images from each treatment group to produce an adjusted relative SS value. Relative signal strength (RSS) values represented in pixels were plotted on the graph.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of cleavage, blastocyst and arrest frequencies</title><p>Developmental potential was assessed by evaluating the frequency of embryos cleaving at day-2 post insemination (p.i.), and percentage of those reaching the blastocyst stage at day 8&#x02013;9 p.i. Embryos were considered "arrested" when still appearing as "morphologically normal" 2&#x02013;4 cell embryos at day 8 post insemination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The frequencies of blastocyst formation and embryo arrest were calculated as a proportion of the total number of cleaved embryos. The proportion of spontaneously cleaved oocytes was evaluated in each IVF experiment using a group of oocytes (10 to 15 oocytes per experiment) matured and cultured, omitting the fertilization step. The spontaneous cleavage rate was calculated at 35 hpi as the number of oocytes cleaving in absence of sperm over the total number of oocytes in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Fisher LSD multiple comparison test. The non-parametrical equivalent test (Kruskal-Wallis) was used when samples did not meet the assumption of normal distribution or homogeneity of variance. The results are presented as the means &#x000b1; SEM from three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by MINITAB&#x02122; software or SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Version 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and means were considered significantly different when P &#x0003c; 0.05 using the least-significant-difference test.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>RNAi &#x02013; RNA interference, shRNAi &#x02013; short hairpin RNAi, IVF &#x02013; in vitro fertilized, IVP &#x02013; in vitro produced, ROS &#x02013; reactive oxygen species, hpi &#x02013; hours post-insemination, GV &#x02013; germinal vesicle, dsRNA &#x02013; double stranded RNA</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LAF participated in the design of the study, performed the experiments including construction of the p66Shc RNAi molecule, Real Time PCR analyses, embryo development analyses and statistical analyses, and drafted the manuscript.
